Airjordan.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352

00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
Jordan

00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,656
What's up

8
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,984
My brakes Jordan is something interesting I learned something

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
Bindi I was unaware of this

10
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
I was valid to lots of gas from that guy

11
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,064
Honestly I had every reason to know before and I don't know why I did

12
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
Quite frankly but as it turns out

13
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,744
I only know when things come to our PO box

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Because I get an alert

15
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
From the store

16
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
Sure where the box is

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
Dido

18
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
Don't send you alert

19
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
When letters

00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216

21
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
Oh

22
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,544
I didn't know that and unless

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
The person who's giving you the packages check

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
The mailbox

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
You'll never know

26
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
That's not fair

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
I found a bunch of letter the last time I went to pick up

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Packages

29
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
And also weird

30
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,232
Way behind on Zeppelin of the mailbag around

31
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
22 opening some of that up

32
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
In the near future by

33
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
On the last trip I went down there got these letters

34
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
And I got a particularly amazing letter from someone who I just want to call dr. Justin that's what I was

35
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,872
Going to say.

36
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
I don't I feel like this letter is delayed because I have no idea when things

37
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
The mailbox

38
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,112
But it was just getting more us

39
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
Then did not know wedding mail

40
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,512
I appreciate it so much it meant a lot

41
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,120
How has been just tears

42
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
Just tears

43
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Non-Stop

44
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,800
Thanks for sharing that letter with us

45
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
Things on your

46
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
Dr. Ness Hellyeah

47
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,992
My bright spot then is I have finally finished

48
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,040
2 months long project

49
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
And I've done with Taylor Swift

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
Okay

51
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,464
Listen to the whole catalog listen to every one of her albums

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Nmd

53
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm done

54
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,560
Is Amazon pretty proud of myself how do you feel

55
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
Find

56
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
That was perfect

57
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:24,800
I am even tentatively not read anything you've written about Taylor Swift cuz I don't want to get mad at you

58
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592
Just got this before I don't want to

59
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,664
I don't want to pick a fight I don't want to

60
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,016
Look I love blank space I don't know what I don't want to talk about it

61
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
I understand

62
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,624
Irene Irene

63
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,488
Tried to pick a fight I was trying to go so far over the top no one could possibly imagine

64
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
Would be fighting

65
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
At a certain point I insisted that

66
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
The guy who wrote Bloodsport was the writer of one of her songs do you understand

67
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,872
The audience wants to know what your next extended exercising misogyny will be

68
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,272
Maybe bunches articles about Mariah Carey not being as good as April

69
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,928
Well that would just be impossible because Mariah Carey is exactly as good as everyone thinks

70
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,232
Maybe extra series could be about pink

71
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
Now you're just now you're just

72
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
Fighting people you're defensive

73
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,679
About Mariah Carey election

74
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
I don't know lifetime

75
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
See I met some big haters in life

76
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,335
Well congratulations on finishing a project

77
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
Yes let's not talk about it again

78
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247
Jordan Tillman we are going to talk about is Alex Jones

79
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
What's today

80
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,671
Episode

81
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
Moving I was like

82
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
I knew.

83
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:53,887
Easypro like me everything happens in slow motion

84
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
No matter how many times I've

85
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,007
Sit there and think in my head I know he's about to say the date

86
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:04,895
Yeah I'm still caught by surprise every time it's also not quite Fair because I can just keep talking

87
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,527
Has one word almost even

88
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,111
You're you're playing at a disadvantage but I'm also very good at it

89
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,487
The double whammy this is Monday or talk about the day after the Superbowl right there

90
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,815
Some thoughts on that imagine so now they are there

91
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,423
Some thoughts on that there's a big Broad

92
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,727
Push that Alex is at engaging in

93
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
That I think will be the direction

94
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Of content

95
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
In the in the near future

96
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:41,247

Have you ever seen the room

102
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
That's why I want to see it

103
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,311

That's right

124
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,671

Did you watch the Super Bowl I did not

133
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
Grateful for it

134
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:12,031
I meant because of this episode I watch the halftime show

135
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:18,431
I did not know I did hear that weekend did stuff off of House of balloons in the f******

136
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,015
Spoons with his first Italy po

137
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
Where is Seattle

138
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
About doing cocaine and f****** stairs that song like I can't feel my face when I'm with you

139
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
I thought I don't know that

140
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
Just think I've heard that somewhere

141
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
Read it that for sure

142
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
And then I Starboy except like

143
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,431
No they were all about that

144
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,063
Put the chorus is I'm a motherfuking Starboy he is a motherfuking Starboy

145
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
It sucks

146
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,815
Halftime show and we'll get to that at the end of this episode

147
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
A little bit

148
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
But the only thing I was thinking was like

149
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
I can't believe

150
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,215
Did the weekend is this big of a star

151
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:19,615
I've nothing against Texans like a talented guy but I'm so disconnected from pop culture

152
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
Wow

153
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
There's no surprise guest

154
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:28,831
There's not like I remember the days of halftime shows what it's like 15 is not allowed

155
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
Five different bands Aerosmith going to be there

156
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
Hitman Nelly's going to parachute in this s***

157
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,679
Comes out of the floor at the Super Bowl

158
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,543
Math yeah it was just a weekend it was a fine performance

159
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,103
I didn't like all the songs

160
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
Maybe it's somewhere a little bit boring

161
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
But I'm not about to talk to Remo

162
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Although

163
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,903
Give me time

164
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,791
That's about all I thought I saw a little like a couple of

165
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Like Choice plays

166
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,679
Look at Mahomes passwords falling

167
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
I don't really have any strong feelings about it

168
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
The game

169
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
I guess I'm from Missouri so I should love to

170
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Cheese

171
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
All right some friends who really like it

172
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
The Chiefs are good for them

173
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,759
Anyway

174
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
We start

175
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
With Alex

178
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
About this out of context drop

179
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
He's telling somebody to burn in hell

180
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
And I'd like to try and guess who he wants

181
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Supernanny

182
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
That is

183
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Out of the lot

184
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
They hit the gas

185
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
I thought you were going to be okay

186
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Etsy

187
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
And this is after

188
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,991
Do the Superbowl I am going to go with

189
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,087
Why not

190
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Bill Gates

191
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:12,767
Springsteen Bruce Springsteen's going to burn in hell

192
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
Bruce Springsteen doesn't like the far-right

193
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:21,471
Ephesians learned that to born in the u.s.a.

194
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Commercial

195
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
No one explained the song

196
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
YouTube

197
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
He resented the commercial

198
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,943
Where I guess it was a General Motors

199
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,551
Commercial where Bruce Springsteen was doing the voiceover talking about how

200
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
There's a purity

201
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
The middle of can

202
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
Right in the middle of America

203
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
We all is hard to get

204
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,999
The middle that boy oh boy

205
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,143
It's about that pissed off Alex ugly where Bruce Springsteen going to burn in hell everybody should burn their Jeeps

206
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
I'm fine with that

207
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
Whatever

208
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
Is that more or less carbon in the

209
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Atmosphere

210
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,871
To burn your Jeep but Alex thinks we need all the carbon that's true

211
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,991
Start off the show and Alex is in the exact mode that I like to I like him to be a

212
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,551
This is what I know like okay this is going to be weird

213
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,879
Okay I tend to get up here on the Arrogant really side

214
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
I'll get to all the points I really want to break down

215
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Try my best

216
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Yesterday

217
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
To just

218
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:26,495
Be calm and then we'll see how long that lasts and just cover all of this but it is becoming

219
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Extremely

220
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Extremely clear

221
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Exactly

222
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
What is going on and what is

223
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Unfolded

224
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,959
This is all just too happy this is all too insane this is all too serious

225
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
Okay okay

226
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,663
Come in and out of the gate

227
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,759
Brought a lot of energy

228
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,367
We're going to calm down I'm just going to get

229
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Through this I quit

230
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
I am not going to be here for any longer I'm done

231
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
I got to get out of here

232
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
He doesn't actually go to rebroadcast buddy does play

233
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
Some special report

234
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,239
But not before teasing a little bit of what's coming up on the show something interesting because of his

235
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
Jay Dyer is going to be in studio whether she's a great author

236
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
And researcher noticed

237
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Easton

238
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
More deep research

239
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
On the globalist endgame but even I have

240
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
Because

241
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,391
Did you make a movie about two years ago 20 years ago 10 years ago

242
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,951
Another operation butt

243
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
Hehehe

244
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Going back as well

245
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Hundreds of years but then

246
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,143
Reader's Digest

247
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
Was there show the things he does to go

248
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,799
Please book she's reading my everyday new 14 there

249
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
Terrace Apartments

250
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
Brain damage

251
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,175
Sterilizer

252
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
Piranhas

253
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
It's hard for me to read there

254
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
But he doesn't

255
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:22,463
Probably just said it's hard for him to read

256
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,863
Apparently Alex doesn't read primary sources anymore but pretends to pretty expensive

257
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,191
Except

258
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Jay Dyer

259
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
Say yesterday I do all my own research

260
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,943
And then say today I can't really do any research so I just read this guy

261
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
Yeah that's not

262
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,551
Fair and then I accept whatever interpretations he

263
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
Carly has a bad

264
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,951
How about primary sources that he probably didn't read either are you kidding me this man

265
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:59,839
Claims to read a book a day or how could I not take everything he says at face value dance certainly

266
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,655
Excited

267
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
I can't wait to assess you

268
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,007
I've heard him been on the show before he's boring

269
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
Stupid

270
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,847
Well alright I'll get excited for that

271
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Alex is in a bad mood

272
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
He clearly wants to storm off the show

273
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
He's got this guy coming up that I think I can

274
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
Sick my teeth into

275
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
Instead Alex just like

276
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,159
Easy plays the special report about Marjorie Taylor Greene

277
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
Okay

278
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,231
It's this weird

279
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,047
Weird thing where John bowne

280
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,119
One of those employees trying to make an argument

281
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,775
That Marjorie Taylor Greene having these committee committee appointments taken away

282
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,591
It's somehow it purged of all conservatives

283
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,663
It seems like a dumb argument to make it seems like a ballia

284
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:52,063
What year what you're doing is essentially equating whatever you believe in and your rhetoric with her and if you believe

285
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
Leave if you want to

286
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,511
If you want to make that Association you're more than welcome to yeah I think it's illusion or it might not work well

287
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
Extends to like what we need to do

288
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Is we need to get

289
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,911
Committees

290
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Try

291
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:16,383
Find that's called being reactive you wanted

292
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,783
You can do that you can post your phone on thing whatever.

293
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
The dumb video

294
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
Anyway I got bored of that

295
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
But was not bored with

296
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
Is there somewhere

297
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Okay

298
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,511
Last episode

299
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Commercials

300
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
And there was a big hit

301
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
And I thought we need a little more of a taste

302
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
Of these

303
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,727
Because I have not heard of any really

304
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Stand-out commercial

305
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
I think we won

306
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,663
I think we had the best commercials of Super Bowl Sunday

307
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Yeah yeah I think

308
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:59,391
Can't think of whatever like an advertising publication but I think it would give the crown to Alec

309
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,487
Oakley commercial

310
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
Small town

311
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
There's a small town that's how you do the light

312
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,935
This commercial might take the

313
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Okay

314
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
I think it's my favorite

315
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,055
I have to warn you

316
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
4 minutes

317
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Nautica

318
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
This is a special report

319
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
It goes

320
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
All over the place

321
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
Hey ladies so mopey

322
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,903
A bummer

323
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
So was 4 years ago

324
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Lawyers

325
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:48,799
Like 10 years ago and I dressed up like The Joker do anti

326
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,127
Prozac at

327
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,687
Prozac

328
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
Prozac

329
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
Classic

330
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Frogs

331
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,135
Antidepressants

332
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
Admit

333
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
Lawyer

334
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
She's playing with Joker

335
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Crews are just like Jack Nicholson

336
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Joker

337
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
That's not really all show

338
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
This was actually a defense of introducing any video of Alex on Infowars

339
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
But you did say that it would be like

340
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,063
Compare

341
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,159
Playing The Joker correct but it wasn't just about a specific video

342
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,231
But Alex is referencing where he does have Joker makeup on

343
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
Trying to complete those two things

344
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
But yeah I was like

345
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Hello this is

346
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
Just like the first minute

347
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,423
Avisca scrambler

348
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,495
The commercial aspect to this will get to it many commercials

349
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:57,151
Begin with of course I was in a custody battle four years ago years ago

350
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Or is it something weird

351
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,879
Surprise me at all my kids taken away for me and my lawyer need to make a

352
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,951
Really really desperate argument

353
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
To keep my public

354
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,047
Persona out of court

355
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:20,447
So not to answer for why ice cream but how my enemies are demons and literal travels an hour

356
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,287
Because I'm a performance artist

357
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,591
What you my audience to think that right

358
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,895
Sales pitch won't work

359
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,503
Have you tried, that's the preamble to a great

360
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
Commercial

361
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Yeah

362
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
Jones admits

363
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Character

364
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
The most unscripted personality

365
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,703
Research

366
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
Instead of

367
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Fireflies

368
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
Why do prabhakaran

369
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,831
And then I

370
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,999
Sometimes

371
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399

381
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,215
What does somebody drunk at like 3 a.m.

00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:04,383
At four years ago alright I was in a custody battle first minute is about the custody battle stuff and how I'm real

383
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,503
Sometimes

384
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,391
I got real excited and I just yell s*** whatever it's tied to deliver information I kind of forget what I'm doing

385
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
Probably cuz I'm a drug

386
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,560

Exhausted by my spirits.

Psychotic anti-human

Paradox

397
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,800
Continue

398
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
I've had to rely

399
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
Basically purely on people.

400
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
Hollister today

I'd rather be on air

403
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,240
What's happening

404
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,640

And on top of it our mission

409
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560

410
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Reach Out

Where we are and what you've done for this operation

414
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
In advertising

415
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,144
They could break down

416
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
How this is

417
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
Active calls action

418
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,336
Here's what I'm here's what I'm seeing in my mind's eye

419
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,152
End of season 1 of Mad Men

420
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,992
Don Draper is looking at that Carousel and he's thinking

421
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:55,648
I'm going to say everything Alex Jones is saying in this wood right here look I'm not telling you what to do

422
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:02,048
You cannot by Kodak don't want to see these pictures

423
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,144
But some people don't I mean that's fine I'm a proud man

424
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Ascertain

425
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,056
Saudi qualification silvery concert like

426
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
Listen you don't have to

427
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
To do this

428
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
I heard that

429
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,688
And I thought

430
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,784
Who is in charge of

431
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,624
Quality control

432
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
Could of God

433
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,024
Here's what you could have done are you so desperate for something to be

434
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
Before minutes long

435
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
Exactly fit like

436
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,912
In a break only the only explanation

437
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:44,800
Because the only explanation I was a lot of fat in there there was not a lot of substance

438
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
And you do what you can do

439
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,896
You can edit the video

440
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
None of it

441
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
At the end

442
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
Relates

443
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,856
20 set at the beginning and he's called to action please go by from Infowars store

444
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,696
Do you need the added contacts of 4 years ago he was in a custard

445
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:07,840
Nor nor do need the second minute

446
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,656
Cool I think he's having

447
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
Problems with employment

448
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,520
I think maybe he does not have the most

449
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,056
Capable hands on deck

450
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,848
I think maybe he has very few in

451
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
.

452
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
So we get in this mess

453
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
Alex getting actually down to business and

454
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:32,160
I think I think that you see hear him complaining about like Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton

455
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,280
We also see what I think is going to be the Direction moving

456
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,584
Forward and how Alex is going to try and

457
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,144
With the end of

458
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,216
The really like the Trump season should I guess

459
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
The only way I can

460
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,056
Express it really is I feel like we're back

461
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
In 2009

462
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
The Union

463
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:57,248
Psychology of the Shadow onto you.

464
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,088
Maxine Waters likes her evil ugly ass no

465
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
Weather

466
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,440
Watch this evil ugly ass no

467
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,768
Hillary likes her evil Twisted but no

468
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
Exit on you

469
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,632
Because these people are not retrospective

470
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,424
And they cannot look within themselves

471
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Wow

472
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
Alex

473
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,544
Knowing thyself

474
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Used

475
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Highest order

476
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,872
Alex

477
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
Loud exhaust

478
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
Alex

479
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,736
But if you don't know yourself you don't know anything

480
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
Know thyself first

481
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,208
People do not know who they are they don't even know where they came from or where they're going

482
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
They just want to pull

483
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
Down everything good

484
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,376
Just as night follows day in day follows night

485
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,448
Massive false Flags in this country

486
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,544
Play knots and they're going to try to move against us they're going to do it

487
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Because they never got

488
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,360
Trouble for all the things they did before

489
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
The corrupt lawyer run just

490
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
Apartments

491
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
You so full of pedophiles and corrupt people

492
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,296
They literally existentially want to make a run

493
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,368
American gun owner on the American Christian and they're going

494
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
To do it

495
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,976
There's an overwhelming Sense on this episode of feeling like

496
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:17,376
Exactly like the narratives of 2009 they're coming for your gun

497
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,680
It's just

498
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
It was exhausting

499
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
Cuz it's just like I feel like I've

500
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
We've been here before

501
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,688
If you are somebody who is listening to his show like I don't understand how you wouldn't

502
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
Be like hey you

503
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,784
You played this song before

504
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,904
I mean you know can you end up going hard on hating immigrants

505
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,488
It's now too so everybody's everybody's trying to step back and be like

506
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,328
Remember when we could just be racist for fun come on guys this is going well

507
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
Yeah

508
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:53,728
I think that there's a difference with Alex though and that is that he's playing this game

509
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
30 play

510
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
Before with

511
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
The same intensity before

512
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
And it didn't come true

513
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
True

514
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
So

515
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Or

516
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
What if he

517
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
He just said it did

518
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
Have I guess I didn't option

519
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
So it's

520
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
It's going to be psychic Warfare they're going to show US flag

521
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Cordless corrupt lawyer run just

522
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,536
Department is so full of pedophiles and corrupt people

523
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
They literally

524
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,608
Existentially want to make a run

525
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,680
American Christian and they're going

526
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
To do it

527
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,520
They're going to do it first or psychological operations

528
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,800
And it's going to be bad

529
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
It's going to be rough

530
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,384
And you better get yourself ready for it

531
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,664
Are you better now

532
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,480
What the different scenarios are they're going to unfold out of this

533
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
Call coverall we come back

534
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
We're not going to be on here unless we have your

535
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,928
Plus we've got great products

536
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,464
Everybody already

537
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,864
Needs minutes of a rambling nonsense commercial but I mean that commercial was great

538
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
Did you hear that that was

539
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
What 10-second

540
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:02,080
It goes on from there

541
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
Wintersun being awesome

542
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:14,368
False flags are absolutely coming or they're all going to take a run at the gun owners and Christians they hate all that is good

543
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,928
Yep

544
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:21,024
It's just a classic at Vivid business it's just not fair

545
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,352
They're just shouldn't be allowed to just be like okay

546
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,424
These past four years we had a grand old time

547
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,752
Ran roughshod all over your b******* killed a lot of people in

548
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,544
Destroyed essentially anybody's faith in

549
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,592
Democracy anyways

550
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
We're going to go back

551
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:42,016
To just being mad about regular stuff now is that find it we're going to

552
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
Seem to like us

553
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,600
Right

554
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:51,488
Crawl in a little hole the angry tea party typos again

555
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,024
Does everybody like

556
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,608
The stakes being lower I guess

557
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,656
Pretend to be escalated

558
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,984
I thought Biden was the devil

559
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,384
Devil I thought the whole idea of him getting into office was an existential threat to literally everybody because he

560
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,016
Cold by China which is controlled by the devil and God also the devil's controlling whole bunch of other things

561
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
But like

562
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Alex

563
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,880
Reveals how he and his staff talked about

564
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
Biting ants like

565
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,744
You wouldn't talk this way if you actually thought he was the devil

566
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
And so I remember

567
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,608
On that same conversation on January 8th with

568
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
The managers

569
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,800
You know what's trumps out everybody didn't think everything's fine

570
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,360
More letters to people are going to hate by

571
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
And I said you mark my words

572
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,224
As soon as I can ovulation Tovar

573
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
Biden sworn in up there

574
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
People are actually going to give up

575
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
They're going to ask

576
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
Ashley Fall Away

577
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,976
That's okay

578
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,792
We've got a bigger number than we had 20 years ago

579
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,840
Or even ten years ago even five years ago but

580
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,960
All the sunshine Patriots aren't Winter Soldiers they're not going to be involved

581
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,008
They wanted to be part

582
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
Of the

583
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
What does it matter

584
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:18,016
So Alex and his managers have a conversation the conversation goes along the lines of they think it's going to be

585
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,832
Business divides in office and Alex's

586
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,368
People are going to lose interest

587
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,928
Yeah that's the way they're talking about this

588
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,488
Behind the scenes that's how they're processing test

589
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,792
Whether or not this is good for business

590
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
It has nothing to do with their

591
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,912
Pretend nonsense about buying beans

592
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,472
The f****** devil Neville that is performance

593
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,264
Anybody who thinks otherwise

594
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
This is

595
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
I mean

596
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
Duluth

597
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,432
Now at the same time there is a real-world implication of a lot of this stuff

598
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,504
And that's where this discussion of how there's false flag

599
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Coming up

600
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
Where is that

601
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,856
Becomes really important

602
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,648
And I have some thoughts about that

603
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
Guaranteed

604
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
Hundred percent confirmed

605
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
They've done it before

606
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,584
They stand to gain from it they have a history of doing it

607
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
They have the motive

608
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:10,496
And they are now pre-programming at 11 I haven't ever seen

609
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,312
Even before 9/11 IMA for Oklahoma City

610
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
Even before other events that right-wingers

611
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,224
Going to engage in Terror attacks mass shootings bombings

612
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
Everywhere

613
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
America

614
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Pro-gun

615
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,880
Or anyone that pro-life is a terror

616
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
And they're going to try to get the

617
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,632
The general public then in Mash

618
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,936
The same ones that wear the mask

619
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,728
They want to do what they're told

620
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,312
2 then literally anomalous Revolution

621
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,920
Not work with us not talk to us and actually physically attacked us

622
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,968
I've already beta-tested the whole thing

623
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
When Alex talks like this

624
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,600
Generally what you should take away from that

625
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:02,464
Is he recognizes that he and his entire information economy

626
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,024
Formation space have made things too hot

627
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,632
Yep they've got things too hot and stuff going to Bubble over Amanita preemptive

628
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,680
Justification and narrative for it

629
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,264
That is all you need to hear when Alex says

630
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
I guarantee

631
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Tefal swags are coming

632
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,592
That means

633
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
Hey

634
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,712
Trump has an impeachment trial starting on Tuesday

635
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
It's probably going to be some

636
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,040
Fuckedupshit

637
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
People have

638
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,392
Has been radicalized to the point of no return

639
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
Thinking

640
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,976
He had the election stolen from him

641
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,048
The narratives that I've Been instrumental in pushing

642
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
We need to make sure

643
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
That all this is fake

644
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
It does happen

645
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
Very sad

646
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,008
It's it's not just added

647
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
I mean

648
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:53,408
Perhaps not legally criminal but at the very least morally debate

649
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,552
I would say so and it's awfully transparent to you when you watch enough

650
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:04,416
Of of him and you see these behavioral patterns such as becomes really obvious that

651
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:10,816
I'm not saying that like Stewart Roads called him and said I know someone's going to do that

652
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
And and and

653
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,632
And very irresponsible

654
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,448
But I think that Alex knows well enough to read

655
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
Do you know the sign

656
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,032
They're out there

657
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:24,384
Chatter Alex's Alex's plugged into enough chatter where you're like

658
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,432
A lot of this is too hot

659
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,552
I can see you somebody out there doing read the comment

660
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,392
To be some indication of some people are

661
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,976
If he even does that right but even if you don't like you don't even need

662
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:44,352
To go that far to say chat or you could just say like look at the scenario look at the world

663
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,936
Happening happened a few weeks ago

664
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,496
Are there was a bombing on Christmas morning

665
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,288
Yeah yeah

666
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Oh yeah

667
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
Anyway

668
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
I think

669
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,456
That is what's going on in that is the big push

670
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,016
Then I was talking about being like what Alex

671
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,552
This content in his

672
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,136
Stuff is going to be moving forward it's going to be a lot of that

673
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,184
Like return to 2009

674
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,232
And then really really

675
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Stress that

676
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,304
If there's if there's false Flags coming

677
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
And

678
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
That's just to do preemptive damage

679
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Image control

680
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,448
Four people in those pro-trump communities

681
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
Anyone

682
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
Take violent action

683
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Absolutely

684
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,848
So all the other moves

685
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
In the past the bubbles have made

686
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,224
All just leading up to this move

687
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
This move right now

688
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,624
The false flag that will lead to the Civil War that will lead to

689
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,184
I have quick before we go any further

690
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,464
What happened to plan B

691
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
He didn't say that

692
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:50,144
The Harrison Smith doesn't work

693
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
They're making their big move

694
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,728
All the other moves were probes

695
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,520
All the other moves were test

696
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,312
All the other moves were just

697
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,896
Beta this is the main assault

698
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,224
They're going to blow up federal buildings are going to shoot up colleges Church

699
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,088
Why didn't you tell us all the other one in lakes in in Reservoir

700
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,416
Attack on terratech

701
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:17,280
As the globalist try combat combine text America down and causes of Civil War

702
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:23,936
So all the other everything was Prelude the other ones all the

703
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,960
Screamed at you

704
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,104
For 25 years being very most important ones that have ever happened it turns out

705
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
All of them we're just

706
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
Probes

707
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,248
Alright. Mine's my tasks

708
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,088
Is it possible that you're wrong this time too

709
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,928
No no he's only been wrong every time for 25 year

710
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:51,328
Is it possible that you have a currency bias that you think whatever is happening now is literally the most of

711
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,352
Ford thing

712
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
The Domino's Jordan

713
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,704
Essentially

714
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,752
False flag tips over

715
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Right

716
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
Sure

717
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
That goes off

718
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:05,664
Hi Penelope used to make Patriots and right-wingers look bad

719
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
We need help with that

720
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:12,320
Teams were done that after the storm go to Capital play

721
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
That goes down

722
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
Babe there's a civil war

723
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:20,000
But the Civil War is only two like collapse

724
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,560
The United States Shore and then

725
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
Death camps

726
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
This is all men

727
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,936
To trigger the Civil War that's the goal

728
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,264
So the false flag triggers

729
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,104
Pictures of Civil War and the breakup of the country in the end of the dollar

730
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
What's a plan to have done in a year

731
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,456
Has the symbol of America

732
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,992
Who will carry it out evil

733
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,784
What's America collapses

734
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,624
What about 1 year out from the end of the country completely unfair

735
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Where are you

736
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:53,792
Year away from death camp you just get to step down after you've destroyed the country there's no like

737
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,888
Fanfare he's just like that I'm out of here guys mean I'm sure it wouldn't

738
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
You know the smoothest exit

739
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:06,080
I got a cab but I'm going to get out of here to go I got to go

740
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,616
This is a s******* by the way

741
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,688
Yeah I think this is nonsensical and it's also

742
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
Deeply irresponsible

743
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
To tell you're already terrified of paranoid

744
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,368
Gullible as audience that you're a year away from death camps

745
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Because of f******

746
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
Jill Biden

747
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,464
Why in God's name

748
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,280
Would somebody bother with a false flag

749
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,584
Whenever you just said

750
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
That you're a year away from

751
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
Death camps

752
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:36,544
So you should be out now being like we got to terrorize these people otherwise we're going to be in a desk

753
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
I mean

754
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
It's it's

755
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:44,480
You know terrorists edging mixed with terrorists free

756
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,808
Rationalization and denial

757
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,112
But there is other folks

758
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,720
What is a scholar on the matter

759
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
I disagree

760
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
Killer got into power

761
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
19:33

762
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
He wasn't

763
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
Finding people

764
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,424
The death camps

765
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
1942

766
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,544
Oh wow

767
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,360
Businesses

768
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
How did

769
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,624
So Alex doesn't know anything about Hitler's rise to power is he fully demonstrated a couple episodes

770
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
Call tisserie is

771
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,696
Is really upsetting

772
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:31,328
According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum cooked the first concentration camps in Germany were established

773
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,912
Soon after Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in January 1933

774
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:38,496
After the night of Long Knives The Purge of the essay that took place

775
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:44,128
Between June 30th and July 2nd 1934 Hitler assigned a Heinrich Himmler to formalize

776
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
The system of Campus

777
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
That was going on

778
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,760
The camps that they were primarily for the purpose fully

779
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,064
Of extermination, later

780
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,856
But even if you want to give Alex the most

781
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,904
Generous interpretation possible

782
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,232
Operation T4 started in January 1940

783
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,560
Who does anybody systematic killing of people with disabilities in Germany

784
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,912
I was just playing with the Nazis weren't sending people to death camps until 1942

785
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
Probably just him knowing

786
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,496
But that's the year the Operation Reinhard began

787
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
The Nazis attempt

788
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,056
Did you kill all the Jews in Polish

789
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:17,664
There's a larger picture that he's unaware of or weirdly ignoring

790
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,528
And this should be another signifier that Alex has absolutely no idea about the reality of world history

791
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,624
Nor does he have any respect for majorly traumatizing and a traumatic world events

792
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,696
You should never be taken seriously as claiming to know

793
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,720
Anything

794
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Yeah

795
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,280
No and it's not

796
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Just that he's

797
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:39,424
And it's not even like he wants to remain ignorant or he doesn't want to learn things they they

798
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,240
It said he actively wants to go out of his way

799
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,032
To learn and propagate things that

800
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,360
It did not happen in order to justify his b*******

801
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,432
Now anything he says about history

802
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,736
It said entirely to be like

803
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
Totally okay for me to do whatever I want

804
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
Today

805
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,600
Has nothing to do with any

806
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
It's and it's false

807
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,672
Depictions of

808
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,720
Of like a very very serious thing

809
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:05,280
Expand its I mean that's just

810
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,328
That's just wild. f*** him

811
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,656
F*** him so you know how Hillary Clinton project

812
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:14,752
Sahara Shadow her Union Shadow on people she doesn't like her but

813
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:20,640
Important thing that I've heard madler and Maxine Waters all don't like their butts

814
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,456
So they project this Union Shadow on you

815
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:28,320
So they think that you're bad cuz that's their Union Shadow that they see on you but that's really them

816
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,136
For Alex to say somebody else's

817
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,160
Projecting its

818
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
It's very rude Alex

819
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:38,304
He protects his shadow on people too and that's why he thing

820
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
Pigs that everybody else is good at f******

821
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
I think people are powerful in

822
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,288
Amazing and have incredible ideas and

823
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
Have any credible

824
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
Sexual prowess

825
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
Amazing

826
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
Dynamic

827
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,503
Build civilizations

828
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
I love freedom and Josh

829
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
I've learned not to project

830
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
What I believe

831
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
William

832
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
On dollars

833
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,207
I can only hope

834
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
I love myself

835
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
We know

836
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,119
I have written a poem of myself to myself

837
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:17,983
I've learned

838
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:24,383
I have learned not to project myself onto others I can only hope that everyone is as good at sex as me

839
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,479
There is nothing wrong with masturbating you are very good at

840
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,551
It sucks you masturbated what a doofus

841
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,343
What is boron

842
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,207
Unreal navigate to one of my favorite types of moments

843
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,487
But I think it's this

844
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
What's a good stripper

845
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:45,887
His projection is understanding of Union Shadows

846
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
Comes down to

847
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,215
Maxine Waters doesn't like her but

848
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,287
I have a huge I think metaphorical but

849
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:58,687
No I know I understand but metaphorically speaking literally talking about his sexual prowess

850
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:05,599
The but she doesn't like her stinking but that she hates

851
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,927
The metaphor with wine at the literal events

852
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,207
Maybe it is

853
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,791
Next clip is is my favorite kind of s***

854
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:20,191
This is where Alex like kind of forgets what he's talking about

855
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
An incredibly depressing story

856
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,799
Any story that makes him look

857
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,103
Pretty bad just not kill another.

858
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
NOCO dog Kelly

859
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,039
Coming to somebody and saying hey

860
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
Need to go home

861
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
We just

862
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,391
Got a call

863
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,927
Answer your phone

864
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Your dad

865
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
Just got

866
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Car rack

867
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
I don't like

868
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Call

869
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,471
Remember hey

870
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,311
Grandma's dead

871
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,127
This was already really

872
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,967
If using as a jumping-off point but hold

873
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:07,295
Hold on hold on to your horse when he doesn't like bad news

874
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,623
It's been like to give it doesn't like to get it done like to do as unfortunate

875
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
But

876
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,815
It's our job to do the

877
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,375
And if we're not honest

878
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,751
Yahtzee my grandmother probably 6 months by Dad's Mom

879
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,567
Josh I guess she's been gone

880
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,871
What's up with two years old he's 18 now

881
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
I guess she's been gone

882
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,783
Do you want your math always 17 + years

883
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
So close

884
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
I called my dad

885
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
Porsche.

886
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
We got to go see Mima

887
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,327
Because you don't funny you said that I thought we could go see her

888
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
And then I was on coke

889
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
Stadium

890
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,983
Elector in the morning

891
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
My dad got there like 7

892
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
Ready set let's go

893
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
Atlanta in the bed

894
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
In my house

895
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,151
Younger I could get out of bed

896
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
Start now

897
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,199
No problem

898
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
Renaissance Ticketmaster

899
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
Doctor Donna Donna

900
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,551
Finally got up

901
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,367
And I had a beer for breakfast

902
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,927
I have one more for dessert

903
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
Cuz I was really tired

904
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,023
What is happening

905
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,375
Then I got in the car on brownie stacks

906
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
30 minutes for I get there

907
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,239
Because then I just got there when she died

908
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
Seesaw

909
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
There's that

910
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,639
Invisible internet

911
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
The enemy knows about

912
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
Spiritual

913
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,039
They're so pissed they wanted to do it they don't they'll never Domino

914
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,831
What the f***

915
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
Is going on man

916
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:52,511
So let me break down that story cuz first of all he wasn't joking when he said he was drinking with amorphic

917
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,911
Get the f*** out of here just realize it like really bad

Whoops I better another one for dessert in another Woodford desert I've been I drove Jesus cry

What is happening

920
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,455
The real the real like headline of that story is

921
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:17,343
I missed saying goodbye to my grandma cuz I was drinking in the morning

922
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,487
The answer to that is your dad at the house if you want

923
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:29,887
But you decided to stick around and have a horrible to while you drive

924
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,167
In the morning

925
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:36,031
Looks bad Alex it doesn't look good now just don't tell stories like that

926
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,055
At all now

927
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:41,407
I don't know how to connect to an invisible internet that everybody has

928
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:47,551
And then she died coincidentally it is they were like

929
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,831
Oh we just got this

930
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:52,159
Psychic idea that she was going to die soon

931
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,719
But even if that's true

932
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
Alex

933
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
You were up

934
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,583
And you just

935
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,423
Drink beer in the morning and then drove to visitor this is a story about you

936
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
Ignoring psychic

937
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
Hours

938
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
It would be

939
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,799
Yeah

940
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:15,199
Ebi story about you believing that your psychic powers were less important that your desire

941
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,247
I have a breakfast beer

942
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
Listen

943
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:24,415
Play said I had a rough one I stayed up till 4 I got to drink a Guinness in the morning to get going

944
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Nori was

945
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,975
Two in my ear off last night

946
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,791
Talking about ghosts or something

947
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
My God

948
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,887
So anyway that was a little bit weird

949
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,447
But now we get into

950
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:40,543
What I'm going to call Alex's May and breakdown of the Super Bowl

951
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
I forgot this

952
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:48,735
Super Bowl app isn't to talk about the halftime show or any of that stuff nearly as much as you might think

953
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,015
Cuz there's another thing

954
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:50,783
Too obvious

955
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
Sleep satanic

956
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
Uno

957
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:55,647
I don't think so. There's another thing that's a little more important

958
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
And that's Alex

959
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
Is

960
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,095
7th Super Bowl and they're just calling him

961
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,423
Cross between

962
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,215
Hercules and Apollo

963
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751
Worship

964
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,663
But again it's only a game at the end of the day but we understand the human compass

965
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,479
Petition and inhuman striving is what makes us great

966
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,599
Men competing against each other women competing at each other

967
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,183
But onto this they add all the globalism they had the prop

968
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,231
Opaganda they had the anti family

969
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,255
The racial

970
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,047
Separation message

971
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
What

972
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,887
Do you hunger for this competition

973
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,215
And then they show the so-called black

974
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
Quarterback

975
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Arkansas

976
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
Team

977
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,663
Kansas City team

978
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,711
Is about as wide as I am

979
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,295
And the media says it's racist to Tom Brady won

980
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,391
Ronald McDonald

981
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
He's got curly hair

982
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Oh boy

983
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
Oh boy

984
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,791
Absolutely not race

985
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,071
Sister Tom Brady won

986
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:14,751
Was racist his put on one of his famous hats

987
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,031
I get to decide

988
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,079
People's race at

989
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Suppose

990
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,127
Wow

991
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,175
This is ugly

992
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,991
It's a goes on quite a while that's wild

993
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,783
The media didn't say that the game was racist

994
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:33,183
Alex is just pointing to a bunch of anonymous people on Twitter who posted jokes about a black quarterback losing during Black History Month

995
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:36,255
And then pretending there's a serious argument the video maker

996
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:40,095
I granted a lot of people rightly don't like Tom Brady

997
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:40,863
Cuz he's a dick

998
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,423
This angle that Alex is taking you stupid

999
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,215
Play Space on literally nothing any

1000
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
Deeply

1001
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
Speedway race

1002
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
Prairie

1003
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,823
It gets so much worse

1004
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,455
Yeah if you are if you are like I hate it when the media points out

1005
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,527
Racism in the wrong way

1006
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,367
But your defensive that is to get more racist

1007
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,463
I don't think the first part happened at all and I think you just want an excuse to be racist

1008
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:13,887
You'll feel a lot like that feels like you just really don't like black quarterbacks because of one cow

1009
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
Colin Kaepernick

1010
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,703
Can so any chance you have to be like

1011
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:21,055
The media blows what I think that's oversimplifying it

1012
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
Even

1013
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,871
Greater oversimplifying

1014
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,687
Go to the f****** huge race wow there's definitely that

1015
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:30,527
What about Kaepernick

1016
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,343
And also it has to do with vegetable

1017
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,903
All of it is the attempt

1018
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
Temperature

1019
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,975
Checked on the anything and everything

1020
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,511
Going on

1021
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
Racial division

1022
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
Remember

1023
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:50,495
AOC said don't grow cauliflower she saw cauliflower

1024
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,591
Growing

1025
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,871
La New York

1026
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,663
Community gar

1027
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
And she said it's

1028
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
White

1029
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,319
Cauliflower from Africa you dumb monster

1030
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,135
What does it matter what color it is purple

1031
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,951
Or black or brown or green or red

1032
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,487
Nutrition

1033
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,511
But that's

1034
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:20,447
Total mental illness ladies and gentlemen we talked about this before but just because it's relevant here's the full quote

1035
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:24,799
Quote what I love to is growing plants that are culturally familiar to the community

1036
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
It's so important

1037
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,871
So that's really how you do it right

1038
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:33,247
That's such a core component of the green new deal with having all these project makes sense in a cultural context

1039
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,831
Text and it's an area that we get the most push back on because people say

1040
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,879
Why do you need to do that that's too hard

1041
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:42,975
But when you really think about it when someone saying it's too hard to do a green

1042
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,023
Space that grows Yucca instead of

1043
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,815
I don't know cauliflower or something

1044
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,399
What you're doing is taking to Colonial approached environmentalism

1045
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:57,055
That's why a lot of communities of color get resistant to certain environmentalist movements because they come with a colonial lens on

1046
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,871
This is not about cauliflower being white

1047
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,663
There's nothing to do with that but

1048
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,527
The thing the reason that I read that quote again even though we've talked about this

1049
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,807
Is because you wouldn't

1050
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
Cover this

1051
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,599
That way

1052
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:13,439
You wouldn't cover this the way Alex is covering it unless you had a vested interest

1053
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:18,303
In trying to create a white victimhood argument for your racist audience to enjoy

1054
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
Oh yeah and that's

1055
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,399
Kind of exactly what he's doing with the Superbowl to in it

1056
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
That I mean it's real bad

1057
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,775
Look at all of these things

1058
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
Because

1059
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,591
It's it's

1060
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,615
Soul

1061
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,639
Awful

1062
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,943
How old is people think

1063
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
Because just like

1064
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:40,063
There's no way that this thing could be racist

1065
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,647
Silly you're just making a mountain out of a molehill you know

1066
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:48,767
But if you actually just listen to what people are saying and then look into it you can find like

1067
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
The tiniest

1068
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,935
Things are built on a f****** mountain of racism and if you look into it if you would be

1069
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
Be interested in if you would be

1070
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,263
Curious about it you might find

1071
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,359
Holy s*** there's racism under all of this stuff that I would think of

1072
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,663
The penny you think the pennies racist

1073
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,223
Hippie you probably look at you in your pocket

1074
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,527
You don't like it's that kind of s***

1075
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,391
Am. It might not be but you should take people's word and

1076
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,183
Be interesting

1077
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,535
I think I think of a lot of folks

1078
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,863
Are guilty of this I mean it's the sound biting of

1079
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,143
Subculturez

1080
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,191
Information transfer share

1081
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,471
Bye

1082
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,263
People

1083
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,615
Do it out of laziness sometimes and out of racism sometimes

1084
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,663
Name a bunch of motivation

1085
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,319
Intersection areas that Alex's

1086
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,087
Racist

1087
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,623
And he's also super lazy

1088
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:51,999
Cuz that he's really just reading a Paul Joseph Watson article has call Joseph Watson nose

1089
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
That his audience

1090
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,071
Eat this stuff up

1091
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:55,839
Today

1092
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:59,423
The thing that I kept thinking while I was listening to this is like

1093
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,239
These dicks thought this was worth their time

1094
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,567
I saw Paul Joseph Watson article this morning and Infowars

1095
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,335
Dot-com

1096
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,919
Tom Brady winning Super Bowl as races are this is a joke

1097
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:14,527
Read about 20 tweets by black people saying it I didn't believe it I went to their account

1098
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:18,111
They were serious and I read hundreds more

1099
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:21,695
They said it's so insulting he beat a black man

1100
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,767
It was a lot of black men helped Tom Brady win that

1101
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,535
Super Bowl

1102
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,583
Telling you they were black

1103
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
Folks

1104
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,679
Quarterback I guess it's a gimmick

1105
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,447
Cadillac

1106
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,775
Who's the leader one of the founders of black lives matter is totally White

1107
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,335
What is happening at the other white lady said she was black

1108
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:44,479
What are we doing here insane do you think you're winning

1109
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:51,391
Cuz you know Brady had at least like a half white team of the New England Patriots is all God it's white people winning

1110
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,951
Easiest Buccaneers teams almost all black

1111
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,767
What the hell does it even matter what color is

1112
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,327
But this

1113
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Is

1114
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,119
The mental illness

1115
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,679
I thought the tweets

1116
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
Had to be a joke

1117
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,727
What it's all about

1118
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
The fact that he wasn't ashamed

1119
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,823
President Trump was a fan before the Press

1120
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:14,175
You seem to be the one who's upset you seem very upset

1121
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:20,575
Very upset ridiculously over-the-top upset

1122
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:24,159
Berry Racine want they slaughtered the end of it

1123
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,439
Because it was just such a

1124
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,231
By the other team

1125
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,255
And they're like look

1126
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,047
The black quarterbacks losing

1127
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,583
That

1128
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,655
Other quarterback had wider skin than I do

1129
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,959
I just

1130
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,519
I guess I'll curl my hair and Sable

1131
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,639
Doesn't even matter it's like what the hell does that have to do with anything

1132
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,711
What color is quarterback hit

1133
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
While

1134
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,015
Tom Brady was a black guy

1135
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,575
He would be just as famous or probably more so

1136
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,439
YouTube

1137
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,535
Call my skin

1138
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
Pink

1139
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,119
That's mental illness

1140
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,935
Colors I like

1141
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,495
There's what

1142
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,543
My dad knows how to get me a green watch

1143
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
When I got up

1144
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,711
Purple shirt on folks and I like purple people I got Bland

1145
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,551
This is mental illness ladies and gentleman I got a black microphone what does that mean

1146
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,575
I like Outlook

1147
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,415
What

1148
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,255
Don't know what's going on anymore

1149
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,303
I don't know what's happening

1150
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
What was that

1151
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
What was that

1152
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:42,751
I don't know if your uncle started yet at a certain point you put roles in your uncle's mouth to keep him from talk

1153
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:46,591
I am honestly confused by his idea that everyone's ripping him off with

1154
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,151
Black microphones

1155
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,503
That is all just about Rush East have a gold microphone

1156
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,039
And Alex is trying to like

1157
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Be like I was

1158
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,599
Something I don't know

1159
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,391
Step2 startlingly race

1160
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,159
Displaying that

1161
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,231
Wow goes back to

1162
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:08,095
Comparing Mahomes to Shaun King

1163
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,631
And Rachel dolezal

1164
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,935
And Japan this is just

1165
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,727
Izanagi

1166
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,007
God no

1167
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,823
I know you all know that but it's the way they

1168
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,639
Projectile what's that idiot

1169
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,687
Shaun King

1170
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
No

1171
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,479
African blood

1172
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,271
We just look at him

1173
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,111
Black people singing

1174
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,647
And who's the other lady

1175
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,927
LeBlanc related

1176
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,463
Prisoner hair out

1177
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,303
Rachel dolezal

1178
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
I mean it's sick

1179
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:41,887
Fox

1180
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,447
Absolutely sick

1181
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,799
But I'm digressing almost at Thomas Eggman

1182
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,127
I wanted to illustrate let's keep rolling it

1183
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Tom Brady

1184
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,223
Knows that it's not as bad as a fluid ammonia

1185
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,759
Knows that it's a hoax

1186
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:01,087
Refusing to wear his mask

1187
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
After the game

1188
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,927
And they're so mad and he did that on purpose

1189
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,719
That makes me like Tom Brady

1190
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
Way more than the fact that he has

1191
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
The greatest of all time

1192
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,583
No doubt in the NFL

1193
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,143
He's now the greatest of all time

1194
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,423
Not being a coward

1195
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
What's the other

1196
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,751
White dude posing as a black dude

1197
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,543
On the other team that got his ass

1198
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,567
Hanover

1199
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:24,127
Maybe if you had a black quarterback

1200
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,663
Not loss

1201
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,783
Quarterbacks

1202
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
Text bright

1203
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,831
That right there is

1204
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,879
The towel that Alex is racist troll

1205
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:39,743
Oh yeah he's actually pretty pretty good

1206
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,303
That's the that is the signifier

1207
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,095
But my point is me like

1208
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:51,263
Has Rachel dolezal or whatever the hell her name is

1209
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,127
But this is all the global of trying to get us to in fight with each other

1210
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
Yeah there's

1211
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:58,943
Quarterback

1212
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,503
Do you know he's looking at

1213
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,551
He's getting that curled folks

1214
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,391
He's in there hours a week getting all like that

1215
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,695
But you can say he's black

1216
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:13,791
What was the great great great great great great great great great great granddaddy

1217
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:17,119
This is where we realize that Alex doesn't realize it Mahomes

1218
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:21,727
Who's dad was a professional baseball player

1219
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,823
Now this is wildly racist to a

1220
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
Just

1221
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:34,271
I'm out of amazing that you can keep going I feel like you already nailed your racism in you you're done

1222
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,319
You know like he said he might as well

1223
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,087
Just be like

1224
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,879
I don't believe it anybody's black

1225
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:45,279
If I don't want them to and then you're done Alex's why you finish Alex's white insecurity and is white

1226
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,303
Vanity.

1227
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,839
Really alarm

1228
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,375
By people making jokes

1229
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,655
About Mahomes

1230
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:57,311
Losing during black history month and the only way that he could deal with that is to do an outrageously Ray

1231
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,871
Racist segment on his show

1232
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,151
On and on

1233
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,455
Where he tries to be the Arbiter

1234
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,759
I'm saying that he's not actually even black

1235
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,319
To what end is this

1236
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,599
I am confused

1237
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
I am very

1238
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,415
Confused

1239
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,207
I don't know.

1240
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,511
What is the continued existence of the universe

1241
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,791
In a certain to a certain

1242
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,559
You know like

1243
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:24,703
Spider-Man's like I don't understand how this country has made it as long as it has if it is rewarded this moron so much

1244
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,239
You know like there's

1245
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,567
There's a fundamental confusion I get from listening to this

1246
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,871
I've just like how

1247
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:32,895
Who

1248
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
Why

1249
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,687
What are we doing

1250
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,455
I don't know

1251
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,039
Of Joe Biden

1252
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,599
He had a little message

1253
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,391
Before the Super Bowl

1254
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,159
Sorry

1255
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,719
I have this is what I this is what got

1256
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,279
This is what I realized was screwing with my head

1257
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,583
Apologies for interrupting and

1258
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,399
Derailing this entire problem I'm fired I get it

1259
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
No problem

1260
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,215
I remember

1261
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,495
Something important

1262
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
Happening

1263
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,055
Right now

1264
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,847
Very sophisticated

1265
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,895
News political show

1266
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,919
Would talk about

1267
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,967
And that is not

1268
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,271
Tom Brady

1269
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,367
Fifth president did he fix his God is being impeached

1270
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:18,975
Have you seen have you seen Mahomes hair though

1271
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:19,999
How to beat

1272
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:24,607
To talk about it

1273
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:30,495
So by then gave a little bit of a little message

1274
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,543
I to covid-19

1275
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:38,431
Super Bowl and Alex has a video of it where

1276
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,711
Fighting

1277
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:43,295
Sure it's unclear if his video is authentic

1278
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,087
Because their other videos

1279
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,623
But don't really have

1280
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,439
You know it there's like

1281
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,975
Crowd noise

1282
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
But who cares

1283
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:56,607
Yeah I don't give a fuk I don't remember Alex reporting about how

1284
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:00,959
Everyone Boo the s*** out of trump at baseball game now that wasn't a big deal

1285
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:05,823
I don't care but they discover that neither

1286
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,639
He gets into his analysis of the commercials

1287
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,943
Mostly just Springsteen

1288
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,759
Bruce Springsteen

1289
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,807
Riding around

1290
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,599
He supports cutting your gun

1291
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,159
Esports pregnancy support transgender

1292
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:26,815
Oh but now he's a good guy going to bring it together he's Bruce Springsteen

1293
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,351
Spirit of America

1294
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,143

Condescending at

1296
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:40,639
4 years ago I was in the middle of the cutout battle

1297
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,943
There's a chapel in Kansas

1298
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:50,623
Standing on the exact center of the lower 48 it never closes

1299
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,671

I don't care for that add myself

1303
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
And I don't think Alex has any right

1304
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,703
To complain or critique commercials

1305
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,775
No it's it's a little bit of Knox

1306
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
Alex

1307
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,127
He said he's going to take some calls

1308
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,919
He gets around to it but

1309
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,223
He comes in from break and the

1310
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,527
Or maybe whoever it is

1311
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,575
Trizomal glutathione

1312
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,159

01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,535

People playing football so it's nice to listen to music whenever white man stealing black people's music

01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,727
When the killers come

1330
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,031
Dying starts

1331
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591

1333
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,343
Metal bumper music

1336
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,775
Cuz I don't want to keep people on hold but let's just

1337
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,055
Go to him now

1338
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,639
Probably sit here waiting for that big old

1339
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,455
Juicy false-flag terratech

1340
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:04,415
Galaxy might had a meeting with somebody in the bathroom

1341
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:08,767
If I got a little bit of happiness

1342
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:21,567
So his first collars again causing all the time a pastor Sam

1343
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,407
One of the things that I find really interesting but Alex

1344
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,943
Does techniques with callers

1345
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,735
Is he creates false conflict

1346
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,503
To tell Martha

1347
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,831
Whenever they disagree with him on like a minut point

1348
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,367
He'll creative false

1349
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,695
Fight with them to hear the frame of their position in a certain way

1350
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,975
Then he can respond

1351
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,023
To that doesn't allow the nuance

1352
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,071
Of the matter to me

1353
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:47,167
Dealt with in this case Alex and made some comments about how

1354
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,703
You know if the gun

1355
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,983
Compass catering

1356
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,519
You don't want to be at home

1357
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,055
You don't want to start a fight with a

1358
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:56,383
The police cuz that's you know that's how the old Civil War is going to start

1359
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,663
If you end up the

1360
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,711
What to do with that no you got to Target the

1361
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,015
The high-level globalist

1362
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,575
And Pastor Sam's

1363
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,623
Proposition is more like

1364
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,415
They're coming to take our guns

1365
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
Pain

1366
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,487
It's it's already past the

1367
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,535
The point you would think

1368
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,351
And that Nuance is dangerous for Alex

1369
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,655
Text to have

1370
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
Well

1371
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,959
It would

1372
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,751
It requires that

1373
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,543
Use actual positions

1374
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,079
Sound a lot more

1375
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,663
Like aggressively and immediately violent that he wants them to

1376
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,711
And that he thinks can be profitable

1377
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,247
So he starts a fight

1378
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,831
Don't worry. Patriots thing it's time for war

1379
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,903
I see you strongly disagree with me

1380
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,279
You know Pastor Sam I didn't say a lot out

1381
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,815
I said if the cops are coming

1382
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,095
Your house

1383
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,911
It's a good idea I'll be waiting for him until

1384
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,215
Because they've been brainwashed

1385
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,519
Identify certain point it's going to start up here

1386
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,799
But up

1387
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,359
Lying down I'm staying with Target

1388
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,151
Is it the police

1389
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,687
They get the police

1390
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,223
Become frog gun

1391
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,807
I'm a big boy I'm a smart boy

1392
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,623
Then I would want to go after which I'm not saying do

1393
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,183
That's what people that were running the show

1394
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,975
Can I say is better

1395
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,023
How to be a man

1396
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,047
Tell me how to do it

1397
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,863
I know you said that

1398
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,887
Dispense with the nice

1399
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,471
The first I'm going to tell you that I called yet

1400
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:30,335
I'm going to tell you that I love you and that I'm a prayer partner for what you doing

1401
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,615
I followed you

1402
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,639
You for 20 years

1403
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:35,967
Yes I Alex's 80s created this phone

1404
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,503
The artificial

1405
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,087
With this call so there's no hope of any point actually being discussed

1406
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,135
It just goes nowhere

1407
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,487
Sweet goes to another call and this person

1408
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,767
Has a very

1409
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,327
Very easy to answer questions

1410
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,887
You're on the air welcome

1411
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,215
Hi there hi Alex how are you

1412
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,055
I want to make a point about the January

1413
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,407
Trump supporter

1414
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:08,479
5 years there was a counter-protest at every

1415
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,415
People in those

1416
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,743
Communities felt very strongly that it would be too dangerous

1417
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:22,559
People from taking part

1418
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
Because

1419
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,887
They didn't want people to more people to be killed

1420
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,167
Yeah they were like hey

1421
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:33,567
Stay away these people are violent Trump supporters might kill people at this thing and then

1422
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,103
They were roundly mocked

1423
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
And then

1424
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,919
Trump supporters killed people at that thing

1425
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:38,943
So

1426
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,527
Yeah I made it super easy to answer question yes

1427
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,623
This is not the first time that this is happening there were

1428
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,415
Greatly diminished

1429
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,719
Counter protest thing to happen

1430
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:53,279
At the gun rally in Virginia

1431
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:58,143
The the one that Alex went to they try to be very insightful at

1432
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:04,031
Inciting at happens sometimes

1433
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,567
The counter protest

1434
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,103
Folk

1435
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
I believe

1436
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,407
Prioritize

1437
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,687
They like to live

1438
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:15,551
In a lot of time supposed to be a little bit more responsible

1439
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,343
And in the case of January 6th

1440
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,623
Are there was pretty

1441
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,927
Pretty consistent messaging that I saw

1442
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,255
From people that said that I'm aware of it this is not a good thing

1443
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,047
To go counter

1444
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:28,607
Demonstrate to know

1445
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:32,191
What I'd like to know is where were the counter-protesters

1446
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:38,591
The thing that we said was going to be a violent display of our power the implication of courses

1447
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,615
Is that they were

1448
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:42,431
Mixed in the crowd that yes babe that's all bulshit

1449
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,991
So I know Alex's gallery

1450
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,295
Doing this fake fighting with his calls and I'm like

1451
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,575
This guy is f***** up

1452
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,879
I think he's I think he's doing speaking

1453
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,023
Agree

1454
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,679
Why are you starting another ad

1455
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:07,263
If people are always asking me out

1456
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,079
Decent chance without drugs

1457
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,919
And when you go on Joe Rogan show on Joe Rogan

1458
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:19,551
You told him that you got a problem with adderal and it's a little

1459
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,831
Well

1460
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,879
Stop that one's a little bit more like

1461
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,695
The pictures are starting to picture starting to come into Focus

1462
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,487
Yeah we had a real rough

1463
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,791
Start of the show and now the energy is

1464
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,815
Why am I

1465
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,727
Throughout the day you get

1466
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,007
More tired

1467
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,287
You know and maybe

1468
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:44,127
I ain't had this happen before have you ever been working for like

1469
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,407
Like six hours right

1470
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:48,735
You know you got some more work to do but right around that 6 hours

1471
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,759
You just so tired

1472
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,295
And you just really use a

1473
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:55,647
You know sure you go get a cup of coffee or

1474
01:11:55,903 --> 01:12:02,047
You go to the bathroom and you snort some rails do what you got to do to make it through the last 2 hours dad

1475
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:08,447
Saying but that is really coming around on the idea that he's on drugs

1476
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,215
It's a lot of sun

1477
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,543
I think the fact that Rogan asked him a question really

1478
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,335
Really makes me

1479
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:19,199
A bit more open to the idea because why would Rogan bring that up if

1480
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,991
It wasn't something that Alex brought up with

1481
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,015
With him

1482
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,551
It sounded like it was coming from a place

1483
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,575
Genuine concern

1484
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,623
French

1485
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,647
Yep

1486
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,439
Hey I don't want you to keep hurting

1487
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
Turn yourself man

1488
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:30,975
Yeah

1489
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,535
And yeah

1490
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,583
And Alex

1491
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,351
Keeps

1492
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:43,007
Saying that everybody insists on

1493
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,055
Take a little Coco

1494
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,359
Big little math but you do a little bit of

1495
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:52,223
V-eats that way you don't have to do as much give me a call

1496
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:58,367
The beginning of this I got really excited cuz I like said he's going to have Jay Dyer

1497
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:03,743
Yeah and they're going to talk at this guy is a guy who's the primary source reader in all this

1498
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,535
I immediately lost

1499
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,815
All respect

1500
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,119
What would you call this.

1501
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,679
Time we're in right now is it's pretty clear

1502
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,703
Forget they're saying

1503
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:15,007
Patriots are terrorists are going to arrest us all

1504
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,591
State air attacks loser getting right Estates terror attack

1505
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,687
What would you call this. Of time or in

1506
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,479
And what are you doing to get ready for it because

1507
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:28,575
Every few Generations goes through some real tyranny we're about to go through a

1508
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,135
This is the age of transition

1509
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,183
Brad this is their phraseology

1510
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:36,255
Before how we go from the way things were during this

1511
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,815
Christian. Of the age of

1512
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,607
You know Pisces the age of the fish

1513
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,375
To the

1514
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:44,959
Aquarian age which is what blavatsky write one of the

1515
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,751
Esoteric philosophers that the elite

1516
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:53,151
Always like to look there she called this the external ization of a higher heat polish it go tell Kerry Cassidy about

1517
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
No s***

1518
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,879
Now by worldview is based

1519
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:06,463
On this woman from the 1830s who thought you could do magic

1520
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:10,815
My fear that other people have learned to do magic

1521
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,607
You know the problem

1522
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
He's a moron

1523
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,471
Problem that I'm having is

1524
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
Jay Dyer is a great DJ name

1525
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,079
It's not bad great DJ name

1526
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:24,895
I would love to be

1527
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,687
That's so good

1528
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:30,527
Jay bilas great Jay dires great it be awesome

1529
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:32,575
Have a collaboration with

1530
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,343
Ghost

1531
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:39,743
Cuz apparently believes that those goes conductive

1532
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,839
Through David Wilcock

1533
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,607
Spirit

1534
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,887
You do not need

1535
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
You to do any voice

1536
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:51,519
You don't need to do scratching on the records

1537
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,823
Okay so

1538
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,223
I don't really care about him and I are as interview it is

1539
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:04,575
Dumb whatever you when you start with Helena blavatsky

1540
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
I'm out

1541
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,879
About Dad

1542
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,463
Are you going to phone conversation

1543
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,023
Things with friends about these sorts of things and you know week

1544
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,815
We can talk about stuff but

1545
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:19,679
When you want to make me scared of your big bad guy at a magazine and insist

1546
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
But they follow the

1547
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,495
The teachings of Helena blavatsky

1548
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,287
That's like

1549
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,567
That's one step

1550
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:29,663
Further than if somebody's like you know the Unabomber did make some good points

1551
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,943
I'm just look

1552
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,247
I know there's stuff

1553
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,271
You know

1554
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,063
I think it's a little more fun

1555
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,087
Cuz at least there's Magic

1556
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
Anyway

1557
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,207
So Alex gets dark in about Trump

1558
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
A little bit here

1559
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:46,559
And he says something that I find

1560
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,583
Unaccept

1561
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,887
Okay love you listen to this clip

1562
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,423
Can you understand Veronica sing

1563
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,727
5 years of Alex's life

1564
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,751
Have been

1565
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,031
Wrong

1566
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,567
David meaningless

1567
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:00,639
And Alex has been an instrumental part of the globalist

1568
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,431
Plan to bring into urine

1569
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,199
Does he know that

1570
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:07,551
I think Trump meant well he was a Nashua City America's being screwed over

1571
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,111
But that the establishment let him win

1572
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,647
She did win by landslide

1573
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,671
4 years ago

1574
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:16,767
Because they know they can run circles around him and use him to energize

1575
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,327
The last eventually commit any crime

1576
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,911
And then support a total police state

1577
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,959
Abandon any values they had

1578
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
Clearly evident

1579
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
Active

1580
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,359
Other than sophisticated level we were all

1581
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,383
Play

1582
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,151
Wow

1583
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,223
So you are a useful idiot

1584
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,527
Exactly like you claimed you were not

1585
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,575
To a guy 3 days ago

1586
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:44,671
Yeah I mean there's there's really no other way to interpret that

1587
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:48,511
Cuz I mean I guess the life wouldn't have been

1588
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:53,375
Turned into whatever this is that would facilitate tyranny of Clinton did wanch

1589
01:16:53,887 --> 01:17:00,031
So I guess the only way to reach the point where actual tyranny Could Happen Trump had to win right Alex

1590
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:04,639
Many many times the Trump wouldn't have won if it wasn't for it for like that

1591
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:10,271
I doubt also heavily implied that Rodger stone is working for the globalist

1592
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,087
Hell yeah you know Beavis

1593
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,367
Bully pulpit for Trump

1594
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:16,927
Yeah I'm at you know what I could

1595
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,695
Could believe that

1596
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:24,607
Or maybe Alex is making all of this stuff up then other stuff up my just be making it all up here

1597
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,167
Spitballing and nothing he says means anything

1598
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,703
If you were being serious

1599
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:31,519
He would then have to the next. Should be

1600
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,055
I know I should shut up

1601
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:38,943
Because you quit cuz clearly I make all the wrong decisions that lead us to this but this is my fault

1602
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:45,599
I'm blessed half a decade I have been leading you to tyranny State and I made multiple.

1603
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,647
Matarese with police state in the title

1604
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:54,047
Supposed to know better and not just that but you followed me. Get to where we are meeting I am

1605
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:58,655
The reason that we are where we are and I am a bad leader and you should not follow me

1606
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,959
Getting bowled out for years ago I was going through a divorce

1607
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:05,055
Okay well now I

1608
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:08,895
Maybe

1609
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,479
Wait around for three minutes.

1610
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,063
We got one last clip.

1611
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,879
It's like I think everybody kind of

1612
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,695
Expected there to be more talk about the Super Bowl halftime show

1613
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,975
As opposed to Alex

1614
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,815
Being racist sure but every time

1615
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,119
What do you think he's going to Ziggy's on

1616
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,911
That's what he does

1617
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,263
You talk about the halftime show tiny bit with Jay Dyer and like

1618
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,055
This clip is just titled

1619
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,895
Stupid talk about halftime show because this is stupid

1620
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,687
But you are venting to me

1621
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,991
Did you see that halftime show and I

1622
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:49,855
Watch Super Bowl because it added Tom Brady wouldn't be wearing a mask on it I like him I watched

1623
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,135
They're all

1624
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,159
Skull mask

1625
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,975
They're subhuman but the one guy has speech

1626
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,279
And they all like puppets do what he says

1627
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,559
This was very sick

1628
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,375
At a subconscious level that means you are robots

1629
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,447
In the fastest event you are skeletons you are dead

1630
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,215
I control

1631
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:12,127
Exactly what I think is going on here some bulkley speaking it began with this choir of robot

1632
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,687
Drones race everybody's up in the in the

1633
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:17,503
Wire with the weekend guy they're singing

1634
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,551
And they're all just for doing what they're like

1635
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:22,111
El Papa is like there are there on a marionette right

1636
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:22,879
I just

1637
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,927
My response to all of this

1638
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,975
Kind of conversation is like

1639
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:33,375
If you guys are just high kicking around it like a hacky sack and this is a conversation you want to have great

1640
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:36,191
But if you're adults on a presumably

1641
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:36,959
Grown up

1642
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,751
News

1643
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:43,615
The world events radio show that you have very seriously this is

1644
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:47,199
Coming this kind of conversation is laughably stupid

1645
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:52,831
Who you're all drones and only the weekend has a voice

1646
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:58,719
And the only people who should be allowed to publicly discuss the semiotic

1647
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,487
Save this event

1648
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:05,375
Would be somebody it would be like Umberto Echo to put this in the context of all of this

1649
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:11,775
But even then it's a f****** Super Bowl halftime show, go to bed. I would have been here's the thing that I want

1650
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,799
I asked

1651
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,360
Is a rhetorical question

1652
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,968
These types of things have been going on forever

1653
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:26,368
Talking about the symbology of halftime shows in the supply of Jeezy's music videos and all this s***

1654
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,928
I want to know these motherfuker

1655
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,976
People like Jay Dyer

1656
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,792
They pretend that they study this stuff

1657
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:37,376
Actual field of information

1658
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:43,776
I want concrete examples of things

1659
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:49,408
What they read in music videos at halftime show it's all around you

1660
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,712
What

1661
01:20:54,016 --> 01:21:00,160
Look up your window daddy that's why I wanted to be rhetorical

1662
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,720
I just want I just want to know what magical like

1663
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,256
Psychic revelation

1664
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:05,536
You get from

1665
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,328
Also they took off the mask

1666
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,352
September 2nd song

1667
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,632
In the performance

1668
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,912
Who cares

1669
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:17,824
Yeah I just I find this stuff really dumb I used to really enjoy reading blog

1670
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,616
That would talk about like

1671
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:25,248
People have cover in one I would be when I was young

1672
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:27,296
All the time

1673
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:33,184
Has any how many Super Bowl halftime shows are even memorable

1674
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,232
And none of them for their semiotic

1675
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,304
Janet Jackson mix

1676
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,120
That was not the semiotic of what she was wearing

1677
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,400
No

1678
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:45,728
The prince hologram on a couple years ago wasn't there

1679
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:46,752
That was kind of bad

1680
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,920
Give a s*** about the halftime show

1681
01:21:54,432 --> 01:22:00,576
It's a people we talk about people like Alex care a lot about every year for

1682
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:05,440
Day and then we're done just let's just not talk about it for that day

1683
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:09,792
There's a lot of potential for psych interesting performance

1684
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,816
I think that it's

1685
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:14,912
You know cut God bless people who are really really try

1686
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:19,264
Geographers are gray

1687
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:25,408
Just aged out of the point where I can get too excited about a lot of the musical acts but I appreciate like

1688
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,688
I get it

1689
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:33,088
I can watch the weeknd's performance I can be like this is not necessarily for me it's not my favorite thing but I get it

1690
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,392
The hell out of it shirt

1691
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:36,928
Yeah it is

1692
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:41,536
Fodder for people who have a tough time coming up with things to talk about

1693
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:45,376
A people like Alex you just need to be mad at something

1694
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:48,192
The Super Bowl such a perfect

1695
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:50,240
Thing in that wheelhouse rally

1696
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,264
Do you have to be like

1697
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:55,104
Sublimating of mail drives to war

1698
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:00,992
But you can complain about whatever symbology is in the halftime show he can complain about and apparently

1699
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,784
The race of people

1700
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,344
And whether or not

1701
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
They

1702
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,928
Attitude being black according to Alex Jones

1703
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,720
F****** disgrace

1704
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:13,024
That is really disqualifying as like

1705
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,584
Allowed in polite Society ever again

1706
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,376
Well you should be shunned

1707
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,424
That deserves a shunning

1708
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,472
It would be interesting for someone to like

1709
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,264
Sit down and try to explain to Alex

1710
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,288
Exactly why

1711
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,824
Play with self

1712
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,360
Flagrantly race

1713
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:31,456
Understand I think it just needs a good

1714
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,736
Universal shunning

1715
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,272
Everybody shun him

1716
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,576
I think most people have gotten that message

1717
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,600
I think so too

1718
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,160
We need some more though.

1719
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,464
Put some crazed up the shunning sure

1720
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:48,608
We reach the end of this episode did not enjoy the Super Bowl

1721
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:53,984
We're going to get to the impeachment trial stuff today but

1722
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,544
Because it was Tuesday got started sure

1723
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,408
That will come Friday episode will I check into Alex's handling all that stuff

1724
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,968
But I do think that this is this episode does import

1725
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:08,064
To go over because of the incredible racism

1726
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,648
Wow and because of the clear turn towards

1727
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:17,792
Really aggressively being like also I go, they're going to happen

1728
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:21,376
You can't read that any other way than preemptive damage

1729
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,144
Control

1730
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,936
When it's coming from someone like Alex

1731
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:27,264
So invested in Terrorist edging

1732
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,288
Yep

1733
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,592
Remove the back on Friday

1734
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:31,872
Impeachment business

1735
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:36,736
Indeed we will do it today cuz I saw some tweets

1736
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,040
Bruce Caster is

1737
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,600
I mean that was one of the most

1738
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:46,976
Fundamentally disgraceful things I've ever seen in my entire life bad argumentation

1739
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,000
No argumentation

1740
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:52,352
Just rambling. Call Barn

1741
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,120
You know what

1742
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,936
Being a senator's pretty cool you know

1743
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,984
Extraordinary people

1744
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,520
You know be great like

1745
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,336
Trump's lawyers are doing

1746
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,616
Terribly right

1747
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:10,528
Out of nowhere you hear glass break....

1748
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:14,368
Mayotte

1749
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:20,768
I-5 and republicanism Barnes kicks him in the gut

1750
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:26,912
Larry klayman coming from the sting spot and drop

1751
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,704
It's downright of baffled

1752
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,776
Swcw

Please find a local charity or bail finding Jerry to help out people doing

1756
01:25:55,072 --> 01:26:01,216
This site for years ago

1757

Holding

1758
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,456

Birthstone colors
