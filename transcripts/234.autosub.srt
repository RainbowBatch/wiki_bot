YouTube some donors

67
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
Someone pointed out

68
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,696
That I was a little bit too imprecise with my language

69
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
On the last episode

70
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,768
And I want to give an apology for anybody

71
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144
Pepper anybody but I want to give an apology that I wasn't more specific in my language

72
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,960
We were talking about Alex Jones's story we're just trying to

73
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496

I refer to the person in question is across the

76
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,384
And that was

77
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
Precise correct language

78
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
Entire program is Drake

Between the two

81
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
Did not use the correct

82
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
We try to be specific

83
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
But sometimes you just

84
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
Sorry about that

85
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,960

Text IQ

97
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,727
I was up late single political action committee

98
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,919
Do someone who has joined up on a little bit of a higher levels

99
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
I sent me a bucket of poop

100
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
I don't want

101
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,007
Thank you very much appreciated

102
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,615
I'm so going over a day in

103
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
2009

104
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
Major happened

105
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
Amazon.

106
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Episode

107
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
Think is very worth our discussion

108
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,623
This is going to be March 26th

109
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
2009 f

110
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Episode

111
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
We skipped a day

112
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
Skip's Market

113
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
25th 2000

114
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
And the reason for that is

115
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
Trash

116
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
It's mostly just about at the Obama

117
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
Deception

118
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
Should I felt it would be a waste of our time

119
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Time to go over that

120
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,199
In addition to that he does Alex does talk to

121
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,527
One of his weirdo friends

122
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,439
I did actually wanted talk about

123
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
This

124
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
But

125
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
Be the singular being made

126
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,431
The globalist and all these evil folks

127
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Because

128
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
6 believe the devil is God

129
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,903
I wanted to spend maybe an hour talking about how that's bulshit

130
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Because coming in

131
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,559
Expressing these things giving like a really stupid Elementary version

132
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
And understand

133
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
I'm at that is

134
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,447
850 service to Alex and his audience

135
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
But I felt like

136
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Who gives a

137
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
Come up in the future we can talk about

138
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,359
Not worth talking about the 25th just

139
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
For that

140
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
When I got

141
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
The 26th

142
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
I realize

143
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,783
This is this is what we need to talk

144
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
Here is an avocado

145
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391

147
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,887
Now you don't

148
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
No

149
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,495
Documentaries we found

150
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
Wall-to-wall fake quotes

151
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,615
You don't go to the library to pull these fake

152
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
You go to like here

153
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
Message boards

154
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
Burnet Library

155
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:24,415
There's no way he should be in

156
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,999
He doesn't know how to read

157
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
What's going on

158
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,959
Public computers

159
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,287
On our last episode we looked at

160
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
The Growler

161
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
You talkin about how

162
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
You know

163
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
News keeps coming

164
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
It's the quickening

165
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,551
God damn song

166
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
On the shelf and I made the point

167
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,927
The quickening

168
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Okay

169
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,023
From Highlander

170
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
This some damn Highlander song

171
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
Capital

172
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
Just to demonstrate

173
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
I'm not talk

174
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
Here's a clip from March 26th

175
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
2000s

176
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
Massive Newsday

177
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
Quickening

178
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,855
Worldwide

179
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,975
He always said literally

180
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,839
The next episode

181
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:42,239
Ford dealer schedule

182
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,311
I don't like coincidences on that scale

183
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,479
It's because he says that every third or fourth I just don't play it every time we spoke

184
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
Find you 40 examples of that if I

185
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Took the time to

186
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,951
Cut it out

187
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
Like it's not

188
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
It's only

189
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
Coincidence

190
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
Punch this guy

191
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
He always does that because it's a way you can

192
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
Create the perception that

193
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Times are different

194
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Then they were

195
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
When in reality

196
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
He's always selling the same

197
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Urgency

198
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Because it has

199
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
More recent past

200
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Jeanette

201
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
Multi-level marketing scam

202
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Soon-to-be

203
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
Sportsman's Warehouse

204
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
I would love

205
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
To see you try and commit to

206
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
To an episode where you just

207
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Start with

208
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Clipboard

209
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Him's

210
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
Summer of Rage

211
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,127
You introduce it like we were doing a regular clip

212
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,015
And you just keep on wonder how long you could commit to if I had started

213
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,319
Collecting all the times they said it

214
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
The wild

215
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
I could do that right now

216
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
Like we could do a whole episode of Summer

217
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,375
But I understand

218
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
I think I have it with him

219
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
But I

220
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,263
I don't have it within me to go back and listen to all the episodes

221
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,919
I have enough clothes you will of Fortune

222
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
I forget forgotten to xibalba

223
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
In the next life we have here

224
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
We get a little bit of an update

225
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
If you'll recall

226
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
The last time we were in 2000

227
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:43,071
Alex was fake crying on are a whole bunch about the mandatory service bill

228
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
The Belvin had passed the house

229
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,447
A different version of is even introduced in the Senate

230
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
Afraid of what

231
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Either of the

232
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
Isabel

233
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,639
The former version of the belt

234
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,455
We get an interesting update on this episode where Alex

235
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,551
You know in comedy

236
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
Putting a hat on a hat

237
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
Alex puts Ally on Ally

238
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
The propaganda had on a

239
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,511
We got some good news

240
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,327
We write the stuff as it develops 2 days ago

241
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,447
Compulsory national service

242
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,591
And the latest copy I read this morning

243
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,175
Now taking it out of the Senate version

244
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
The house version is five different

245
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,671
Malls near

246
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,023
A show that is good news

247
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,655
The house versions about

248
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,751
You literally can't believe that

249
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,079
So he's trying to create the perception that like we got good news

250
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
Took it out

251
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,223
In some ways trying to imply that vert warnings about it

252
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,367
Precipitated this taking the language out of the bills maybe letters to your congressman

253
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,207
People and they got together we will not stand for this in the house version

254
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
So

255
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
This is nonsense

256
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
It doesn't answer the question that I had to take

257
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
How do you get out of it

258
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,127
Like you're wrong

259
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:42,623
Maybe don't take full responsibility for getting the language out but you pretend that something happened in the languages now

260
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Good news

261
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Good news everybody

262
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
However

263
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
Secret

264
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
Haven't you ever seen the Masonic version of school

265
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:07,455
Yep about how they become secret laws

266
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
Steve Jobs

267
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
What's up then

268
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
He's covering his ass a little bit cuz he realizes

269
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Narrative too hard

270
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,423
It felt good in the moment

271
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Now I got to get out of it

272
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Legos

273
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
He goes to break he comes back

274
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
His favorite

275
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Samsung

276
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Is ever been

277
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:12,991
Volume up

278
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:19,391
You bet

279
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:44,991
After the Renegade

280
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
Where we be

281
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,023
Unfortunately he did not

282
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,847
Declaring

283
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
He never comes back and goes back to break

284
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,207
Just happen there I've never heard anything like that

285
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,607
Didn't say like I got for this break

286
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
And it didn't come back

287
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
After this commercial break

288
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
He comes back and explain

289
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
What happened

290
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:45,151
I had to take a s*** we are back live

291
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
3 minutes

292
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,879
Quotes

293
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,695
Running music

294
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Truth-seeker

295
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,703
And I'm not whining here

296
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,823
Because I just can't even operate

297
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:20,479
That stuff he was on someone else's radio

298
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,575
Entire break somebody else's

299
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,159
African-American interview

300
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
Mention other media appearances

301
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
He's done

302
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
Louis

303
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
Mike

304
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:43,775
From what I could get like from what I gathered

305
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,359
That they would use on the Lewis station later

306
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,943
It doesn't need to be in the middle of your show that you do this

307
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
If you want to three minutes

308
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
Not only going to come in early

309
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Good

310
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,415
Or do it yesterday I don't know any report

311
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Is a breaking news on that

312
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,303
If it's a Missouri station that's obviously what you going to be screaming at them about

313
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Yeah absolutely

314
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
This is so unprofessional

315
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
He leaves the show all the

316
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,775
Little regard for his own show when it comes

317
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
Anybody else

318
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,895
He knows that other people have

319
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
Knowing the crazy audience

320
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
For larger

321
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,343
I gonna need a little bit of that

322
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,183
Exactly exactly

323
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
Depleted most of my

324
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,143
Like old man house phone

325
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,775
One of those

326
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
That sounds better when they're wet

327
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,135
It looks next clip what we do is we hear Alec

328
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
What's going to the phone

329
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
Collar

330
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
Is a familiar song

331
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Joshua

332
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
Florida girl on the air

333
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,191
Alex Jones how you doing my friend

334
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
Offensive

335
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
News as well with the Obama.

336
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
Great film great film

337
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,919
I think it's pretty much the Gateway documentary to get a

338
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
The sheeple

339
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
Into the mix of the New World Order

340
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,415
About the New World Order

341
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,743
It's made for people who don't know what b*******

342
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
That's what that's how

343
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,911
It's for people who are liars

344
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
Reebok

345
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,359
He's a government Fox that guy

346
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,199
Free with the points made in the documentary

347
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
It's really boring

348
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
Boring

349
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
It's pretty bad

350
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,159
You're just coming to that from a rational perspective

351
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
And I think that if you're someone who is

352
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,559
Emotionally invested in the idea that there is a new world order trying to

353
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
Do your children

354
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,911
You might experience some of that really boring content differ

355
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
Because it's boring to oscopy of the veneer of life

356
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
How hot is it stupid

357
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,359
This is real information being laid down

358
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:33,503
You might be engaged

359
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,159
Names of the title

360
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,791
You can just talk to him like that there's no Counting

361
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
In the world

362
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Is a good movie

363
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
Furiate Isabel like that movie

364
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:05,503
Christmas is coming up here I've got to complain about

365
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,063
Jordan

366
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,463
You do know my complaint about elf is right

367
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,559
All elf related opinion

368
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,351
Okay well

369
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,399
Self

370
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,263
Is that it exists in the world where number one Santa is real

371
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,823
We know that to be the truth

372
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
Do you know that all parents

373
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,479
Must know that Santa is real

374
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
Because

375
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,807
He brings their children gif

376
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,391
There is no reason for adults

377
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,767
Unless there's a conspiracy of

378
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,399
Female

379
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
Deception make

380
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
No sense

381
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
The idea that

382
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,335
PM Santa and his sleigh come through alert

383
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
And everybody acts shocked

384
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
How to explain depression

385
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,111
I understand what is a lion children or something like that

386
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,903
If you and your heart of hearts

387
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,536
Wake up on Christmas morning in the holy s*** there's a bunch of s*** here I did buy what the f*** is going on

388
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
Clearly it's that they

389
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
Do not talk to your adult friends like

390
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,424
Hey on Christmas morning to give to show up

391
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,264
Yeah man I thought it was just me

392
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,848
Tired

393
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
Santa is real

394
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
You have

395
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,456
To yourself

396
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,272
Imagine dude

397
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:48,672
If you knew that one man can create all these toys

398
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
Show me the total economy

399
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:04,032
Dirt Devil

400
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,872
Yeah there's a lot of problems like my politics

401
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,200
Would like to talk about some of that stuff more importantly

402
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
I am

403
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
If you related

404
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
641

405
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,392
F****** second about that story

406
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:24,512
Everyone has a kid knows God damn well that Santa's real

407
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
There's no reason

408
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
Now hold on does Santa not bring

409
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
Adult

410
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
I don't know I don't remember exactly but

411
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,664
Present children

412
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
I think that's

413
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
Universal Concepts

414
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
I'm willing to

415
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,928
I'm not willing

416
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,024
Exactly is your line further

417
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,584
Cuz originally I said that anyone who has

418
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Kids must

419
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,496
Santa is real

420
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:13,152
Do anybody with a younger sibling also must know

421
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,456
Is real

422
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,016
Teenagers when they're

423
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
Holyshit

424
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
And you got like

425
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
Eight-year-old sibling

426
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
Oh my God

427
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
I didn't buy that

428
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
What else is real

429
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,032
Santa Claus is real is the entire Legend real

430
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,104
Is the movie the horror movie

431
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,896
Sequel to elf

432
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,176
Or Jack Frost

433
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
Where where are they

434
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,600
I don't care

435
00:23:53,856 --> 00:24:00,000
Belzer isn't in any of them so we can't connect Cinematic Universe

436
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
Elf is a f******

437
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
Terrible movie

438
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
It's stupid Jon Favreau

439
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
F***** it up

440
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,264
Get some oversight

441
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
Who is Ed

442
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
I blame

443
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,384
Everyone everyone everyone

444
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
The bottom

445
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,224
Farrell Deschanel you're all on notice

446
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
I'll tell you who's finding all this

447
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
Jimmy cotton

448
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
Tonya Gray

449
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,416
You character makes no goddamn sense exactly

450
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,512
If understood through the prism of he has to know Santa is real

451
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,304
His cruelty makes no sense

452
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,632
Why is he loved the idea that this guy who knows

453
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
Bow Wow

454
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:46,336
Just a regular

455
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:01,440
You know what that eats and has nothing to do with Santa Claus

456
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:07,840
If you wanted to make a make a darker version of the movie where

457
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
Jimmy Khan characters like

458
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
You are an elf

459
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,704
Is Santa is real

460
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,264
I don't fucken want to talk to you

461
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
I might be more interested in me

462
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Character motivation

463
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,688
You created Universe with the movie Hugo

464
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
Live in that universe

465
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:30,112
Annual elf complaining

466
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,976
Next year as well

467
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,536
But for now just call her who loves the Obamas

468
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,328
Deception has a little bit more to say

469
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
Much like Alex

470
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,424
Leaving his own show to go beyond another show

471
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,472
Another indication that Alex needs

472
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
Outside influence

473
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
That's an order to have

474
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568

00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,736
And the bankers and what they're really planning

477
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,608
Yeah you really want to sound like

478
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888

482
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,616

483
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664

History

503

It's a new Renaissance just like you said in the film man is

504
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
It's really exploding here

505
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
In Orlando is

506
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
Especially

507
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
Inspiring

508
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:33,248
Working at Orlando places in Maricopa County

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
Diversion

510
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,048
What's going on

511
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
Telling him

512
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:53,728
That they might be like that as opposed to

513
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,336
Whenever you're like

514
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
Right right

515
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:06,016
Where's Hugo next movie

516
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:10,368
You blindly accept Joshua in Orlando

517
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
To see if any of those coats are real

518
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
Spoiler alert

519
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,280
Was 9-11 mysteries of wbgo for a while

520
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,608
I believe

521
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,656
Yeah it was

522
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,448
Before the CW

523
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,336
In the show I told you earlier that this

524
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
This episode is pretty

525
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,920
Important episode with

526
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,456
Merit

527
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480

531
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Spoiler alert

532
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672

Who got who comes up now

535
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,632

536
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,448
As we know Alex Bernie Mac

537
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,056
The precursor remix

538
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,384

539
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,760
God if you just did that routine

540
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
Amazing

541
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,304
Best stand-up specials

542
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,144
Swear to God there's nothing funnier than that's it

543
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192

00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,032

Did some research you read all these books

553
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,136
They never really specified a lot of the books

554
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
But he read

555
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952

00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,312
W Cleon skousen fanaika capitalist

562
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080

00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,640
Quigley is just knows the misrepresentation

565
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
Presentation

566
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,968
Nobody says that he read a lot of books

567
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,016
Never really specifies the

568
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296

00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576

00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
These books were

574
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
Wake me up

00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,200
Headquarters

580
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:20,320
One of the books that he was being weird John Birch Society material

581
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,624
Now it's interesting to me

582
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
Doesn't really talk about

583
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,744
How influential the John Birch Society

584
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,048
And I think that's probably because

585
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,864
They have the stink of being really crazy

586
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
On them

587
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,544
The same way that he says reading Carol quickly turns me on

588
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
It's everything I read W Cleon skousen

589
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
Make a capital

590
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Because I feel like

591
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,992
You didn't read that you think you read the the lie about the same

592
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
He acts like not read all this

593
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,136
These are all my auntie globalist influences

594
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,232
Don't really bring up the John Birch Society being really important

595
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,560
I'm sorry about the John Birch Society

596
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
It's like

597
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:09,728
Book should be regulated the same way

598
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,032
Pornos like

599
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
18 or older

600
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
You should not be allowed to read John Birch

601
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
Society books Whittier

602
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,712
It's real it's really tough

603
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,992
I don't know if

604
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,576
I agree with you necessarily but it is really dangerous to have people

605
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
Whose brains are

606
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,648
Don't have the

00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,672

Critical thinking capabilities

609
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
To be exposed to

610
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,560
Very intentional propaganda

611
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400

Just internalizing these ideas before you're able to like think I I don't know about that

614
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,664
Oh wait you're saying that you know about what the Communists

615
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
Really we're doing

616
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,224
Of course you

617
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:58,112
I'm committing the fallacy of appeal to Authority and I'm just going to go along with you

618
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,696
Cuz I bet you don't know much about them

619
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
I know enough

For his diet

630
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
Because it was

631
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
Which is perfect as a temp

632
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,376
You can write your own story

633
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
Wells painted birches

634
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
The first casualty of

Of them using his name

641
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
Inappropriate

642
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,784
Disrespectful

643
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
Use of a person

But the business went under during the Great Depression

648
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,096
Luckily his brother James Welsh

A candy company went out of business

652
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,056
Robert Welch just jumped

653

Started working at James's out

654
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,480
Hold on

655
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
These two brothers

656
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,904
Separate the idea of

657
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,464
We love competition

658
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Competing

659
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,768
Candy companies with your brother

660
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,584
You just went over and worked at the other

661
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,704
Famous kind of against the idea of all these like same place operated

662
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,544
And they were both were operated

663
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
Robert got

664
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
Crazy f****** rich on Candy money

665
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
Have you retired in 19

666
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
So

667
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,560
Brother of the guy who created

668
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,608
The John Birch Society

669
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
Well

670
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,752
While it's unclear who's

671
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,312
Responsible for the actual invention

672
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,664
First casualty

673
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,064
Because it's not

674
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,768
Head of the John Birch Society

675
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
While

676
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,376
Robert decided to get more active in politics

677
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
A retired

678
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,752
It's because he'd already lost the race for the lieutenant governor

679
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,032
Ownership of Massachusetts

680
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,848
52 and was well down

681
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,152
Paranoid

682
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,016
Rick Harrison writes in his book before the storm

683
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
Barry Goldwater

684
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
King of the American consensus

685
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,160
Literally John Birch Society meetings were Rockets social affairs

686
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
Important societal

687
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,512
They provided disaffected Republic

688
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,608
Heading to far left with a means of organizer

689
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,424
At the same time to give bored Housewives something

690
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
To do other than embrace

691
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,984
Horizon

692
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
Instead

693
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,800
They could fight communism

694
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,360
It's service interesting dual-purpose

695
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,408
From a social and political standpoint

696
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
For the right

697
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,248
Members would host monthly meetings and their living

698
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,808
Where they would watch a videos of Welsh

699
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,160
And often write letters to the representatives about everything was happening in the world

700
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,512
Everything that was happening was a communist plot

701
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,424
What

702
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,008
Each individual groups membership reach 24

703
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,080
To operating under the theory that smaller groups would be harder

704
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
A communist

705
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,624
It almost certainly would never have happened if there was more than 5 TV channels back then this is

706
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
He blew up

707
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
Its membership rolls swelled after the 1960 election

708
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
Auntie, does fervor

709
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
Began to go

710
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,352
According to John Birch Society

711
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,632
Everything was a communist

712
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
Chief justice Earl Warren

713
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
Communist plot

714
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,264
American involvement in Vietnam

715
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,056
Public School System communist plot

716
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,104
Fluoride in the water communist plot

717
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
Their beliefs were so dumb

718
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,968
The by the early 1960s GI people like William F Buckley

719
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,784
Recalling them quote far removed from common sense

720
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:47,648
And an r and even saying that their ideas were quote childishly naive and superfish

721
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Wow

722
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:53,536
Is Harsh criticism coming from someone

723
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,072
Came out that Wells

724
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,400
It accused Eisenhower of being a communist tool and guilty of treason

725
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,936
William F Buckley decided

726
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,496
To try and get him kicked out of the leadership role in the John Birch

727
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,032
Society but was unsuccessful

728
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
John Birch Society bulshit

729
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,224
His reputation of being a sensible

730
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,992
Conservative began

731
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
Hey hey

732
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
Let's not be

733
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,184
The absolute worst

734
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,744
Let's just be mostly the worst

735
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,560
And then you get the Maverick

736
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Label

737
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
Biography

738
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:34,240
Buckley was beginning to worry that with the John Birch Society grounds the rapper

739
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,312
The right-wing upstairs in the country would take an ugly Eva

740
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,336
Fascist turn

741
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,384
Rather than leading toward the kind of

742
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
Conservatism

743
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
Promoted

744
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:49,856
Hahaha

745
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,160
Shuffle

746
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,232
Loading run the outsides of everything politically

747
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,280
And for the most part this is

748
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
Massive recruiting

749
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,376
Enlarge reduce paperback books

750
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,400
To disseminate their message

751
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:09,056
They were largely responsible for getting out Phyllis Schlafly book a choice not an echo and Gary Allan none dare call

752
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
Conspiracy those books that Alex

753
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
Was very inspired by as a child

754
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,480
In this era jumper Society was a fringe group

755
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,552
Sea by mainstream conservatives is basically raised included

756
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,112
They weren't welcome at the table of the GOP

757
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,672
Even Barry Goldwater broke sizes

758
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Mostly

759
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:30,048
Due to the Eisenhower s*** like

760
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,096
Charges against

761
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
F******.

762
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:40,800
And I invented answer

763
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:45,920
You could invent something and it would take over

764
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:51,552
The greatest thing in the world now it's like maybe it's $5,000 order whatever

765
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,792
They were unwelcome in the GOP at that point

766
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
And they were

767
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Until

768
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
2010

769
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
When they were allowed to be

770
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
Beco sponsors

771
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,008
This was after the rising influence

772
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,568
Have you very John Birch Society inspired

773
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
Tea Party Movement

774
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
Conservatism

775
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,944
That is a movement that was funded almost

776
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,736
Entirely by the Koch brothers

777
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
Children of Fred Koch

778
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
Founding member of the John Birch

779
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Society

780
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,672
Not to put too fine a point on this

781
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,720
But the John Birch Society is basically the Tea Party

782
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
Pass General

783
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:37,376
As a former member Carol Connor told it I always tell my liberal friends you better stop laughing at

784
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,400
These people and pay attention

785
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,984
The ideas you here today coming from the right we're generated in the Sticks

786
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
By the job

787
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
Society

788
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
It's a new language

789
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,384
The intellectual framework of the GOP

790
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
It's the birds

791
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,200
Society every single day

792
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
And that is what we've seen

793
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,464
Is reach across the aisle and compromise

794
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
You know that

795
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,304
The only way to

796
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:11,168
Ninety-nine percent of what they want all the time

797
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
Thanks Democratic party you guys are doing

798
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
Is a communist

799
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,128
No wonder they wouldn't

800
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
We got

801
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480
We got the president

802
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
Of the John Birch Society

803
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
Now as a guest

804
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
On Alex Jones Show

805
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,880
He's already retconned a bit of his own

806
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
History

807
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,440
In terms of he doesn't talk about it like

808
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Superman

809
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
Every single thing

810
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
There's more

811
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,632
To this than just that

812
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
I think it's important

813
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,216
As we hear somebody

814
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,776
But here is

815
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
Mr McManus

816
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,104
The president of the John Birch Society

817
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,039
Appreciate your tireless Society

818
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
On the last 40 years

819
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,135
Thank you it's my pleasure

820
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,463
I tell people all the time I wouldn't miss this

821
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,911
Steve already decided it's true

822
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
And then you just died

823
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,847
Nflx quote from McManus we get

824
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
A little tidbit

825
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
Is history

826
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
With the John Birch Society

827
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,199
Tells me something

828
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
But I don't like

829
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,015
About this McManus character

830
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:36,159
I did three years in the Marine Corps after college

831
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:41,023
Was an electronics engineer

832
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,351
In 1964 they asked me to text staff position

833
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
What's 66

834
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,079
So he's timeline with the John Birch Society

835
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
Trouble

836
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
Me a little bit

837
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,687
The idea he was around in the early 6

838
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Is the problem

839
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,271
Because the John Birch Society

840
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,063
Vociferously against

841
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,367
Civil rights

842
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,135
Sudan

843
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:12,511
On the right side of History

844
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,583
A lot

845
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
This is going to sound crazy

846
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Maybe

847
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
A lot of

848
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Economic anti

849
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
Communist

850
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
Vino

851
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,871
Inspired by the economic

852
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,991
And maybe they're more inspired interesting

853
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,807
People coming together

854
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,927
Open for inclusion in this Society

855
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,207
Even though they really weren't

856
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,535
I know you're just trying to force historical parallel

857
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:51,935
I'm just saying that maybe now the Resurgence of the John Birch Society

858
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,215
Something to do with

859
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,519
It's crazy that it would happen

860
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,615
Right around eviction

861
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,759
These were originated as purely racing

862
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:12,159
Disorganization of economics

863
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,695
Or even more batch

864
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,535
Maybe

865
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,863
Dating October 19th

866
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,423
65 the John Birch Society made their big move

867
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,263
They published a large killed

868
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,359
A couple years later

869
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,431
Post titled quote what's wrong with civil rights

870
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,247
Wherein they argued that the concept of civil rights

871
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
Was being pushed

872
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
Bye

873
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,319
You guessed it

874
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,855
Communist agitators

875
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,135
Division

876
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
And bring down capita

877
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:02,591
The average American Negro has complete freedom of religion freedom of movement and freedom to run his own license

878
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:09,503
Now the argument that someone on the side against

879
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
Them would say is

880
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
They don't have the right to

881
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,111
Participate in public Commerce

882
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,671
In places that put up signs that say

883
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,719
No black people allowed

884
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,375
It's a private business in terms

885
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
Repeating

886
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,447
Privately owned and operated but it still

887
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,751
Engaged in Commerce with the public

888
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Just kind of

889
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
You know just

890
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,663
Paper over the hole

891
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,455
Massive amount of lynching

892
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
We're going on

893
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
You gotta understand

894
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,087
Really 0 freedom of movement

895
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,159
I don't know what that relates to movement

896
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,975
I would say that yes

897
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,767
They probably just

898
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:59,423
Maybe it would be really by the way

899
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,191
Right

900
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,519
Big

901
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:07,615
Would it cost quite a bit of money back Avengers what's wrong

902
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,919
It's just a communist

903
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,967
Black people have it fine

904
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,039
Why do guys like

905
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
People

906
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
To be able to discriminate

907
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,487
Who matter

908
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,791
Ability to operate the economy

909
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:32,447
Well the economy will solve itself if you if you don't want to visit

910
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:40,895
Don't patronize it dance free market will solve

911
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:45,759
It's just the government over reaching trying to

912
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,807
It's the name is what it is

913
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:52,671
83 Fred Koch wrote a book called a businessman looks

914
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,439
Communism

915
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
Which is why

916
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
Distributed by the John Birch

917
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,327
In the book thread sounds an awful lot like both

918
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
Alex

919
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,887
Flaming racist

920
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:05,215
You may be sure that the Communists are fishing

921
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,751
Furiously in the Troubled Waters

922
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,287
Integration on both sides

923
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:13,919
The Communists are not interested in the aspirations of the Negro except as a means to stir up racial hate

924
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:18,271
The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take over America

925
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,319
I've been told by ex-communist

926
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
The Communist Party

927
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,903
Influential in the relief laws

928
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,975
The New York Philadelphia Washington Detroit and Chicago

929
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:30,559
Rural Southern Negroes in Puerto Rican

930
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
Come to those cities

931
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,607
In the first place

932
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,143
The Communist Party

933
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,471
Do use the votes of these people to swing the balance in these populous state

934
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,543
Secondly when the party is ready to take over these cities

935
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,383
It will use the colored people by getting a vicious race War started

936
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
Wow

937
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:49,503
1963a I bet they would get that vicious race

938
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,783
Race War started

939
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
In the summer

940
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,575
Dismiss sound

941
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:56,159
Exactly like

942
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:02,815
Interesting Franco Crobat 1963

943
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,119
I wonder if that was on Alex's dad shell

944
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:10,239
Wonder

945
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,543
I don't know maybe because of Alex's words

946
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,855
We kind of already

947
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
Lest you think

948
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,999
Text drop I played at the beginning of the episode was

949
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,023
For no reason

950
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,815
I present to you

951
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,863
McManus

952
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
President

953
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,167
Of the John Birch Society

954
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:39,935
Committing

955
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,727
Exact same sim Alex Jones

956
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
All the time

957
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,687
It's a devilish determination to take power over mankind

958
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,575
Was Maya Rancho Rothschild

959
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,231
Subway

960
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,583
As I want them

961
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
And that's where we are

962
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Play the defect quote

963
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,983
Most sources

964
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,799
Michelle Rothschild

965
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
Said that innate

966
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,103
Team 38

967
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,407
That's a problem because he died

968
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,039
It is usually

969
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,087
Phrase

970
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:33,695
Do people say that a lot of a lot of resources

971
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,279
They say that

972
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:49,311
The quote is supposedly issue and control the money of a nation and I care not who makes

973
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:50,847
That is

974
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Before ovulation

975
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,407
Unfortunately

976
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,431
No primary source

977
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:58,527
Is known as the earliest version of that quote

978
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,807
Cited is 19

979
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,575
35

980
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,647
So 1935

981
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,207
Oh over 100 years after his death

982
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
This quote shows up

983
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:13,375
Cuz it's a hundred years after his death and there's no primary source in the

984
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,655
David

985
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,959
Say that he said it 26 years after his death

986
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,751
Doesn't mean it's not accurate

987
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:23,359
What are you going to tell me cuz the Bible was written several hundred years after the event

988
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
A test to describe

989
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,015
Crazy day

990
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,647
Plies Swirl C the bigger issue is

991
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,183
This is a paraphrasing

992
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
Quotes

993
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
That have been

994
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
Play it out through history

995
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,095
The earliest version of this quote

996
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,631
What is from

997
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:49,727
17th century Scottish parliamentarian Andrew Fletcher

998
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:55,103
This is from

999
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,687
Rochester Christopher

1000
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:01,759
To my pretty believe that if a man were permitted to make all the ballads

1001
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,807
He may not care who should make the laws

1002
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
Elimination

1003
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,623
This is paraphrasing

1004
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,903
Of this guy

1005
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,207
Sir Christopher poet

1006
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,767
He said let me write the Ballads of a Nation

1007
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,559
Make their laws

1008
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,375
They which is essentially hymns

1009
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,911
Can control the history I

1010
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:25,311
Mythology character with the songs we sing

1011
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,639
Artistic

1012
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,407
Pleurisy

1013
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
Kind of

1014
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,991
Talk of like I will create the character the name

1015
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:33,759
Valid

1016
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,295
Zach

1017
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,319
Has been taken

1018
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,087
Morphed

1019
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
Repurposed

1020
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,671
To be an anti-semitic slurs against

1021
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Debrox

1022
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,303
Let me make their money and I care not who

1023
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,327
Who makes the laws

1024
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,119
This is complete b*******

1025
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
Is it fake

1026
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,727
Quote you want it if you want to complain about the Rothschild go ahead

1027
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,263
But you better come correct

1028
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
Don't use this

1029
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,103
Cuz if you do that means you're not serious

1030
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,711
You're just looking for any convenient online meme nonsense

1031
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,015
Posting of fake quotes in order

1032
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,039
To attack these people

1033
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
What's the rich Jews

1034
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,367
That's what's going on here

1035
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,183
I wonder what

1036
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
We say

1037
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,047
Right now we'll in a couple of hundred years

1038
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,583
Used to be

1039
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:26,751
I think I think you and I are fine we're in the clear Maybe

1040
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,031
I reject your premise

1041
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,591
I reject your

1042
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,175
That was attributed to 26%

1043
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,503
President of the John Birch Society

1044
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:42,367
James Alex using fake quotes in order to make their point about this imaginary group of globalist

1045
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,135
So they're super

1046
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,927
What do you know

1047
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,231
He does another thing that Alex does all the time

1048
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:56,959
Most Americans have no idea the Federal Reserve is a private agency it's not a government

1049
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:08,735
It's not a federal agency

1050
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:12,575
Stupid first of all we already know that that's bulshit

1051
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,367
Federal Reserve fig private

1052
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,047
Evidence

1053
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,607
1009

1054
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,631
It's always

1055
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:34,335
Do what the f*** you can't find the phone number for mon old man Birds

1056
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,127
The bloop

1057
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
Come on what

1058
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,271
Just say that you're racist

1059
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,831
Hidebehind

1060
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:48,927
Terrible economic ideas

1061
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
You know why

1062
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:56,351
Because I would imagine that this McMahon is some people in the John Birch Society

1063
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,751
But there's a whole lot of white supremacist leaders who just happened to have been John Birch Society members

1064
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,031
Robert J Mathews

1065
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,311
The founder of the order

1066
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,847
Was a member of the John Birch Society

1067
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,919
Aryan resistance

1068
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,711
He was a member of the John Birch Society

1069
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,247
William Luther Pierce

1070
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,295
Founders National Alliance

1071
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,343
Was a member of the John Birch Society

1072
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,135
Thomas Robb

1073
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,439
Be the national director of the Knights of the Klu Klux

1074
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,023
What was a member of the John Birch Society

1075
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:31,423
Has Rob who just became a national director

1076
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,215
Founded important

1077
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,007
F****** white supremacist groups

1078
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:38,591
Tom Metzger is a huge deal in Neo-Nazi white supremacist

1079
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,663
Community

1080
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,711
The order is a very relevant White

1081
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,831
Like maybe some group you never heard of

1082
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,135
Some piddling racist group

1083
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
They just daughters around

1084
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:02,143
You guys are f****** racist at least just don't get in the way of universal basic income like

1085
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,727
What you got to do that why you got to mix them together

1086
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,567
And being Against Racism

1087
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,831
If you are if you are against

1088
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
Braces if you are fighting

1089
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,607
Quote separate but equal Society

1090
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,143
Communist

1091
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
Yeah

1092
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:43,359
Precursors to the

1093
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,663
Would be pro-slavery

1094
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:49,247
I'm guessing that the precursors to those guys

1095
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,783
Would be Pro colonialism

1096
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:57,439
I'm guessing they don't even have to go to

1097
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
Precursor

1098
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,327
Like early John Birch Society literature was specifically anti-colonial

1099
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,887
They were Pro Colonial

1100
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:09,215
In these places

1101
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,239
People colonize

1102
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,287
They were giving these people a great life

1103
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:17,407
Make arguments against

1104
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,199
Colonial is Stafford

1105
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,247
They are also communist agitator

1106
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,063
Precursors

1107
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,111
Licking flavory was on the

1108
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,183
Like ballot they would be for it

1109
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:40,703
The kind of word supported George Wallace

1110
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,495
Chrome

1111
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,335
You don't have to go to the predecessors

1112
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
These people were

1113
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,919
Wow

1114
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,503
In a very short

1115
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,527
Amount of time

1116
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,807
That he's been on the show

1117
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,831
We have

1118
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,879
Him McManus

1119
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,183
Using fake quotes demonizer Rothschild

1120
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
We have him

1121
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:06,815
Making the exact same stupid argument that Alex makes that the Federal Reserve

1122
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,095
In order to bolster his

1123
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,887
Idea of the globalist

1124
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,959
And now the little conversation

1125
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,775
And I think you can get the

1126
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,335
These two guys agree on almost every

1127
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:24,735
Did you see the eclipse on your with former fed chairman

1128
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,343
He said look the president

1129
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,695
Legislative the Congress

1130
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,023
Or look at us

1131
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,863
We are a cult.

1132
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,103
You really don't

Buttons

1139
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:33,599
Adding in another thing

1140
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,671
Omigod you guys all believe this

1141
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,463
Push it that everything is a communist plot

1142
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,767
Cool alright here's my new pet

Alright we lin-manuel Miranda

We see if he is willing

1145
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
To write

1146
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,007
A kick-ass Musical

1147
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,799
About the auditing of the

1148
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,103
Debbie so boring

1149
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
No way

1150
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,431
Be so bored

1151
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:03,039
Bernie and Ron Paul doing sweet duets

1152
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
Great

1153
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,367
The big

1154
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,183
Is a solo song Ron Paul.

1155
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,607
He's like

1156
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:22,239
You know I love him

1157
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,103
That's in the beginning of the

1158
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,871
The play

1159
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,151
The musical as it were

1160
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
It just

1161
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,247
Ron Paul's feeling about it

1162
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,903
If you don't mind

1163
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,951
But I'm not going

1164
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
DeVito

1165
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:47,071
Where was The Great Raid

1166
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,119
Thank you Alex

1167
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
Ask Nikki

1168
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,423
About his feelings

1169
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,215
Deception

1170
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,495
Is refused entry

1171
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:20,095
I watched it on anything I have

1172
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:23,679
And I watched it on that of course I wasn't taking notes or anything I was just

1173
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,199
Name one fact

1174
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:41,599
See that's that's kind of what I do you know when someone is like you watch my

1175
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:46,207
Comedy specials

1176
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,791
That's the response you give when you didn't

1177
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:55,935
Important for Americans to know it's a note

1178
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,359
I was watching

1179
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,383
Go fuc yourself

1180
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,407
Gofucker

1181
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,431
Yourself John Bircher

1182
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:14,111
Throughout the time that we've been doing this show not been unaware that Alex

1183
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,647
Influence by John

1184
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
Quite

1185
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,487
Never really been a good time to talk about

1186
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,279
Because he doesn't bring them up

1187
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,047
Really

1188
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,863
Maybe brings up Society

1189
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,631
I'm passing like

1190
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
The claim that like

1191
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,263
His dad had some friends who were into the Birch Society when he was a child

1192
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,031
Something like that

1193
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,847
Turn off

1194
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,871
Point to talk about

1195
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,151
How overlap

1196
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:37,919
These worlds are

1197
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,223
The because he has the president of it on

1198
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,271
Now we get to talk about all this stuff

1199
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,295
A little bit

1200
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,111
It's so I know that we're looking

1201
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,927
All look at all these parallels

1202
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,719
Necessarily news

1203
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,255
It's just

1204
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
We haven't

1205
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,071
So

1206
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,631
One thing you need to recognize

1207
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:00,191
Is that everything that the John Birch Society believe

1208
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,215
Alex also

1209
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,775
He doesn't talk about it cuz he knows

1210
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,079
Connotation with saying that your aperture means

1211
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
You're crazy

1212
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:11,711
The John Birch Society spends a lot of its present-day efforts fighting the same Connie ghost

1213
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Alex.

1214
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,759
The US sovereign

1215
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
Being under it

1216
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:18,111
Fears about the North American Union Agenda 21

1217
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,391
One World Currency

1218
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,671
The evils of the UN

1219
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,951
Fluoride in the water

1220
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,487
Global warming being a hoax

1221
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
Made it

1222
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,303
About being a bring any carbon tax

1223
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,351
Homeschooling being under attack

1224
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,911
George Soros being evil

1225
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:34,239
Everything all the way down to Communism

1226
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,263
Satanic system

1227
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,287
What's fundamentally ink

1228
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,055
Compatible with Chris

1229
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,151
The smart money says that Alex generally doesn't talk about

1230
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
His ancestors

1231
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,735
Intellectually being the John Birch Society

1232
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,527
Because in 2009

1233
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,807
He knows that

1234
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,087
They chose Glenn Beck

1235
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:56,255
This is where things get really important

1236
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,095
Fred Koch was a founding member of the John Birch

1237
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,911
Through freedomworks Americans

1238
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,959
For prosperity and the donor fund

1239
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
His children

1240
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
4

1241
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
The rise of

1242
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,079
Tea Party

1243
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,407
This is not like some conspiracy theory

1244
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,455
We're making up

1245
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,015
This is all very well-documented

1246
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,551
So you have

1247
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,343
The founding member of

1248
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,879
The John Birch Society

1249
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:23,903
That believes at

1250
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:28,255
Years later you have his children paying for the Tea Party

1251
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,535
B believe Zach

1252
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,839
It's hard to think that's

1253
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,607
Coincidence

1254
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,655
Come on

1255
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,959
The public space

1256
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
One of the main one

1257
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,567
Tea party that was being funded by for you to work

1258
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,847
Very clearly

1259
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,383
It's been proven

1260
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,407
Was Glenn Beck

1261
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
He's making

1262
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,199
Tons of money

1263
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
From freedom

1264
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,271
The coke pundit

1265
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
Freedomworks

1266
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,855
It's almost impossible to not look at that

1267
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,623
And be like

1268
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,927
Awesome probably knows about that

1269
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:00,767
He probably knows that yes absolutely forces that brought about

1270
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,791
The John Birch Society

1271
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,863
Tea Party

1272
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,655
It's not him

1273
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
It's going back

1274
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,263
So I think that's why

1275
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,823
Base-level pettiness

1276
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:19,199
Sure it may be signaling that he

1277
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Want

1278
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,991
He's trying to get

1279
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,551
Yeah he's trying to get some of that

1280
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,599
I got your life

1281
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,415
Kisses ass

1282
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,511
A significant Overture

1283
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,303
Of I want in

1284
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,351
You guys are doing

1285
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,631
Which is

1286
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,215
Okay I think this is a major turning point

1287
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,519
You'll see in this

1288
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,055
Does he have a money bomb in like

1289
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:45,823
3 weeks

1290
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
I don't know

1291
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,151
I do know that in the course of this energy

1292
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,223
Alex changes a couple of his position

1293
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,759
Weave

1294
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,551
Very clearly

1295
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,087
And here's the first one

1296
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
And I think it's

1297
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,951
This is a conversation about the AIG bailout

1298
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,863
Franchise

1299
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:14,495
Billionaire George Soros David Rockefeller Rothschild

1300
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:17,055
Or actually getting the money

1301
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,271
Fraction of a real money

1302
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
George Soros

1303
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,343
Was

1304
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,391
Probably because

1305
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,463
The John Birch Society was already on the Soros

1306
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,279
Alex knows that

1307
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,863
At no point in anything that we listen to up till this point

1308
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,447
Has Alex listed Soros along with Rockefeller

1309
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,727
And the Rothschild

1310
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,519
It's always

1311
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,543
You've mentioned him

1312
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,127
And it's always just been

1313
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,919
This guy's Richie's masshole

1314
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
Or something like that

1315
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,759
Never been

1316
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,527
The

1317
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,807
Soros

1318
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:04,159
Rothschild Rockefeller combine these big class of people

1319
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
That is

1320
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:11,071
Big in the middle of an interview with the president of the society

1321
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,119
I refuse to believe that that's a coincidence

1322
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,399
He's trying to impress

1323
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,703
That's what I take away

1324
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
Jesus

1325
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,007
This is

1326
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,287
Listen skip acid

1327
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,359
Stupid

1328
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127
I don't

1329
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:28,991
I don't know what to make of it but like Alex

1330
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,271
Farewell

1331
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,039
The same dump

1332
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:37,951
It's not our ballgame to pretend that we know what's going to happen or anything like that all we can do is read

1333
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,279
The situation based on the awareness that we have of

1334
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,815
Where Alex Goes

1335
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,839
In the future and what

1336
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,119
Do you have been in the past

1337
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,679
But I see that is like almost

1338
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,703
A moment of

1339
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,727
Yeah I mean

1340
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:52,031
Calling it supplication

1341
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
If you'll like

1342
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,103
I am going to

1343
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,455
I'm going to have you on my show I'm going to demonstrate how much we agree with

1344
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,759
About almost everything with each other

1345
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
In the past

1346
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,367
In order to

1347
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,647
Be more in line with

1348
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,207
Did I get some of that

1349
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:10,975
Sweet

1350
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,511
Yeah

1351
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,559
Oh man he's Gravely

1352
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,375
It's not groveling because I think they're having a great time

1353
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,239
There's a lot of stuff that I have included just because there's a

1354
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
15 minutes

1355
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:27,359
I'm agreeing about everything

1356
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
Good to go over

1357
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,087
Going

1358
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
Quite a bit

1359
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,159
And get this

1360
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,951
I think it's his next clip

1361
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,719
Even further.

1362
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:48,095
But the people are saying

1363
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:55,007
First of all this company wants to give somebody a bonus it's none of the government's business intros pleasure

1364
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:01,407
Regulate

1365
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
Alex

1366
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:08,831
The Obama Deception made a huge point of complaining about the idea that these Banks

1367
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:15,231
Used bailout money to give people bonuses screaming about the idea of

1368
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:15,999
Giving people bonus

1369
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:19,071
He has the John Birch Society president on his show

1370
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:24,191
Forgiving people bones and acts like absolutely

1371
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:29,055
Prediction

1372
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,591
His stated position

1373
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,359
Within

1374
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,943
Of this episode

1375
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,015
That's not

1376
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,063
When I heard that I was just like Alex

1377
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,087
You pathetic stackers

1378
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,367
What are you doing

1379
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,671
Yeah I was crazy

1380
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,511
F*** you

1381
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,791
F*** you

1382
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:57,471
If you still like principals please get like a stipend

1383
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,799
I mean we can't confirm anything yet but my gut says yes

1384
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,359
And as we were the last episode

1385
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,223
I mean I think Occam's razor tells me

1386
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:15,135
Ricky starts to get money and it's hidden

1387
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:15,903
Various

1388
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,743
But it was for us to make that sort of

1389
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
Take a lot more

1390
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
And we don't have that yet

1391
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,679
I don't know but I do know that this is

1392
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:33,567
The John Birch Society president clearly has tied to organization

1393
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:36,639
They're funding the rise of the tea party which is just a resurgent

1394
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:43,295
Philosophy terms of crazy right wing ding dongs have already chosen their horses

1395
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,319
Isn't that handy

1396
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,647
Joan is left out in the cold

1397
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
At least at

1398
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:54,047
So that's all I got to go on and I know that

1399
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,119
This is such a bummer

1400
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,655
Such a bummer

1401
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:04,799
Are you I don't know is I didn't know that much about the job

1402
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:07,615
Society I really know is that

1403
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,943
Everything that they say as

1404
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,735
Because we don't like non-white

1405
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,295
I mean

1406
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,599
So whatever

1407
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:22,463
So now we enter a number of clips

1408
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,231
It's just

1409
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,023
Clear that the two of them agree on

1410
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
I'm pretty much everything

1411
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,351
And a narrative

1412
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,887
Probably come from

1413
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,447
Summer version of reading John Birch

1414
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
Society

1415
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:40,127
Can you speak

1416
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:43,199
Well first of all

1417
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:43,967
My view

1418
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Yes

1419
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,807
Temperatures go up and temperatures go down

1420
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:52,415
God I hope you got a forest fire

1421
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:59,839
And what is designed to do is to give

1422
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,887
Once again you say the same thing

1423
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:07,007
Save the coral reef

1424
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,591
Shutdownmore of America's industrial power

1425
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:15,455
Got to bring those coal jobs back

1426
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,247
Even giving

1427
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,807
Society

1428
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,087
For having exposed

1429
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,159
They're just trying to get carbon tax

1430
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:24,927
Does which is

1431
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,975
Alex Jones

1432
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:32,095
It's even more supplication

1433
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,375
You exposed

1434
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
There's no way

1435
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
That

1436
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,215
He would have that belief

1437
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,031
I mean it's not like

1438
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,079
Adversely affect

1439
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,383
Energy

1440
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,407
C corporation that

1441
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,479
Wait a second party

1442
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:53,343
That couldn't possibly be interested.

1443
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,367
Play the second

1444
01:11:55,135 --> 01:12:00,767
Here's the thing is like you might be saying

1445
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:05,887
The Koch brothers own to pay climate deniers and also the

1446
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,423
You know the

1447
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,703
Fuel industry and big

1448
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,983
Tobacco vanille

1449
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,543
Pay people to muddy the waters about climb

1450
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,591
Overtime

1451
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
You're a fool

1452
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,711
That's just because they know that that's

1453
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,991
The truth and they want the

1454
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,015
Getting out there

1455
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,319
And the truth is the carbon dioxide is great

1456
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:30,463
She's going to have to pay taxes in order to continue doing any industrial activity

1457
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:35,839
In order to solve the problem that's not going to be solved by cutting back on Farm

1458
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:47,871
Better trees better bushes better crops better everything

1459
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,455
Is SS Blanca everything's backwards

1460
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:54,271
Got all kinds of experts out there

1461
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,855
Experts in the economics

1462
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:01,951
So-called Environmental

1463
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,255
I'm a Martian

1464
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:10,655
But I'm going with my gut on this one Dan I know all these f****** scientist who spent all of their lives

1465
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,055
I don't know

1466
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,103
I don't even know

1467
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,151
How carbon dioxide works

1468
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:25,503
I don't know how that works

1469
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,783
Listen to me talk

1470
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:29,343
I just said carbon dioxide

1471
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:35,743
I was in the Army for 40 years

1472
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,119
Everyone

1473
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,935
Stupid

1474
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,495
Like you just saw a

1475
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:52,383
An articulation of the stupid talking point that all of these people who get money from these

1476
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,455
That special interest groups put out

1477
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,503
And it is this idea of like

1478
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,551
Carbon dioxide

1479
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,575
Yes

1480
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:03,647
No one is saying get rid of all carbon dioxide

1481
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,927
The issue was about

1482
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,975
Excess carbon dioxide

1483
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,511
That has been put into the

1484
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,559
Atmosphere

1485
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,607
It's the beginning of what the Industrial Revolution

1486
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,167
The science is very

1487
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,447
Clear about that stuff

1488
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,239
When you married

1489
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:24,127
Plants needed to grow with trying to get rid of plant that's you appeal to really stupid

1490
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:26,431
People who don't understand what the topic

1491
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,503
And that is a tactic that is very specific

1492
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
The guidon

1493
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:34,367
By these people whose bottom lines would be hurt by making

1494
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,903
Progress towards

1495
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,695
Saving

1496
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:39,999
Deforestation

1497
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,351
I care so much about

1498
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,375
Trees and plants

1499
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:50,495
I honestly thought about the rainforest

1500
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,359
But if I

1501
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:59,967
I think you know what I say

1502
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,271
Possibly before cutting down trees

1503
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,807
Because they know

1504
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:09,695
He's just previously said that trees need carbon dioxide to live

1505
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:15,327
Then there might be too much carbon position is very much like that movie medicine man

1506
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
Okay

1507
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,911
The forest

1508
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,959
And if that's not the point of that movie

1509
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:27,359
The point is that was terrible to me when I was

1510
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
Photos about

1511
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,247
Assumed it was about a medicine or a man

1512
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
Or perhaps

1513
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,295
The man made of

1514
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,623
It's about how there's something in a rainforest

1515
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
That's required

1516
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,951
To make a medicine and people are chopping down the forest

1517
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,487
Idol room

1518
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,327
Maybe not

1519
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,655
Quick 502

1520
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,191
No Highlander to do not watch

1521
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,519
Anyway

1522
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,311
I do

1523
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,335
Lexcorp

1524
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,103

1526
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,199
McManus

1527
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,503
Set a reply

1528
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,295
To the idea of what happened

1529
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,575
If the globalist win

1530
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:14,975
Somerset

1531
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,767
You will be working for governor

1532
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,047
If you have a job

1533
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,095
And secondly I believe

1534
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,143
That they will be physical

1535
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,679
Extermination

1536
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:29,823
Short everywhere

1537
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,271
I would say notoriously faccia

1538
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
Just government

1539
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,599
In common with each other

1540
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,927
Illustrate that they use the exact same app

1541
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,695
Apocalyptic

1542
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,743
About what

1543
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,023
If our side does

1544
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,119
Hallmark

1545
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,447
Your fascism

1546
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,263
Clicklist

1547
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,823
Clocked in shorter than I expect

1548
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,103
I kind of thought

1549
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,383
This might take a lot longer

1550
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,919
To get there I figured you'd be screaming

1551
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:12,575
More quickly

1552
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:17,439
I thought it would take longer that's one of the reasons why I was like we don't need to cover

1553
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,231
Patrice interview

1554
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:25,631
You know we can do that next time if we need to or whatever meat of the birch

1555
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,655
The Birchmere

1556
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,983
Would would sort of be a lot more

1557
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,567
Does having an hour-and-a-half episode or whatever

1558
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
It just

1559
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,407
It confuses me

1560
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,175
Why this

1561
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,199
Attractive

1562
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:39,967
Two people

1563
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,247
Who are

1564
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:42,527
Otherwise

1565
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,879
It's like I don't understand the radicalization process that you go through in order to get

1566
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:47,647
To the jumpers

1567
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,535
In the sixties it makes total sense even now

1568
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,863
I guess like the funneling of all of these

1569
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,959
Children in and all that stuff through Twitter and and pushing them all towards

1570
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,543
I don't understand how you don't

1571
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,079
Any point go

1572
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,383
Okay I'll look into

1573
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,663
And then do that

1574
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,455
How do you not do that

1575
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,551
Except

1576
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
From somebody

1577
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,343
Yeah I think

1578
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:21,951
A lot of it comes down to the the recipient of the messages circumstances

1579
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,231
Place where the real

1580
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
Receptive

1581
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
Shakira message

1582
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,839
Right like I know I was really depressed kid

1583
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,607
Church

1584
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,911
Was able to grab me a lot more easily

1585
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:33,471
Because of that

1586
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
Place of your life

1587
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,919
When you're most receptive

1588
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,967
Two messages that don't necessarily make

1589
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:47,807
Wide enough net

1590
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,087
You put out tons

1591
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,391
Paperback books all over the place

1592
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,671
That are your property

1593
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,951
Buganda

1594
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,719
Talon

1595
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,743
Out to the world

1596
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,279
You put out a million books

1597
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,095
You get 75 people that respond to it

1598
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,703
50 people respond

1599
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,895
I think that's what you do you just accept

1600
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:16,479
It's the same thing with everything they believe is contradicting it

1601
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
Self

1602
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:22,623
It doesn't make a goddamn bit of sense it does if you assume that everything is becoming

1603
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,159
Because then

1604
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,207
They can specially crypto secret communist

1605
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,743
And things like that because

1606
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,767
Then you can just

1607
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,071
I mean you can wiggle your way out everything

1608
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,375
I just don't understand how you can

1609
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:37,215
Pretend to have a how you can have a

1610
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,751
Belief

1611
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,287
We are again

1612
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,335
Any kind of control

1613
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,383
But any kind of Regulation

1614
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,663
Any kind of a

1615
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,479
And yet at the same time

1616
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,783
Your entire stated purpose

1617
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,087
Dominate other group

1618
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,927
I think the only question that I really have

1619
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,975
Is how do you not realize

1620
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
That

1621
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,023
If

1622
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:04,607
You are if you are essentially arguing for this like

1623
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,631
Darwina stick

1624
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,679
Survival of the fittest

1625
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:10,495
We're in whomever is on top is

1626
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,543
Correct by virtue of being on top

1627
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,128
Do you not get

1628
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
That

1629
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,432
It swings both ways

1630
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
And eventually

1631
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:24,832
It only sweetie will be the lower only

1632
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,856
The creeper

1633
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,648
Communist government forces

1634
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:30,720
Allow the people on the bottom to have any

1635
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,280
Because they don't have anything till never

1636
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
Get to the point

1637
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,840
Were there a threat to pendulum

1638
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,144
No that's not true

1639
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:43,520
Remember

1640
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,528
Nope

1641
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,136
Sabaton the last episode

1642
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:01,184
Circular beliefs is just clicks

1643
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,232
It's almost not worth it

1644
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,512
Whenever you

1645
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:08,096
Just have people who make up their own version of history in order to serve their rhetoric

1646
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,400
It's not it's not import

1647
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:14,240
Let me write the history

1648
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,032
I got sing

1649
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,200
Flask

1650
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:26,272
President of the John Birch Society

1651
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,576
Barack Obama

1652
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,488
Birth certificate

1653
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:44,448
Simply producing versus Ariel and hasn't done

1654
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,776
You can put an end to all this speculation by not being a racist

1655
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,544
Buckhead

1656
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,592
I wonder I really wonder

1657
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,616
I don't know

1658
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,640
But I wonder

1659
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,200
McManus has ever seen

1660
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,760
F****** George Wallace's birth certificate

1661
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
No

1662
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,000
George Bush

1663
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,048
No

1664
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,608
I mean look

1665
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,376
Here is

1666
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,192
You know what we f******

1667
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,008
It's interesting to me

1668
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:19,776
I think

1669
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,080
But I will probably need to do is

1670
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,360
Look a lot more

1671
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,408
Old specific book

1672
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
We're coming out

1673
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,200
From a Jon Boat

1674
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,224
Birch Society

1675
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,528
Irrelevant

1676
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:32,832
In his

1677
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,904
His catalog because I guarantee there's a lot more we could learn

1678
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,952
About where Alex's ideas come from

1679
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,536
When we understand more of what the literature that they were

1680
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,304
Distributing

1681
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,400
He's very

1682
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,680
Inspired by

1683
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,728
Skousen and quickly

1684
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:53,312
Absolutely that's not that's not not true

1685
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,104
But there's clearly even

1686
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,384
Wenger motor bus

1687
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,176
With more

1688
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:03,552
So I would like to I would really like to have talked to his dad

1689
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,344
Like when he went out

1690
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
What's was growing up

1691
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,416
Like I would like to see

1692
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,976
Like what

1693
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:16,608
You know the government is getting in the way of your

1694
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:24,288
Communist plot

1695
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,080
Wisdom teeth

1696
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,360
They don't Grant

1697
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,640
Wisdom now

1698
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:35,040
Before the government-mandated

1699
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,416
Carbon dioxide

1700
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,696
Love carbon

1701
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,512
I'm not I'm not one of these guys who's like

1702
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:49,376
Are you saying but I do want to know what you were thinking when you said you wanted to talk to Alex's dad

1703
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,424
To know if he because he's clearly

1704
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,216
He has to be

1705
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,752
Even crazier

1706
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:59,616
Like I would like to know what it was cuz this would have been what the 70s

1707
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:05,760

Small to avoid infiltration

1731
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,768
And is obviously

01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,840
Very consistent throughout
