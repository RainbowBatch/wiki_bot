1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,080
We're here really quick just to drop

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,360
Spiritual correction

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,920
Episode

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
About

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,968
Campaign

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,320
Hillary Clinton

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,624
And we were not inaccurate

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,976
But I found information later that episode

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,536
I feel like I would be remiss if I didn't point out

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,072
And call myself out on

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,888
One of those things that's most important is

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,192
That Renaissance Technologies

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,496
Bee Company that is owned by Robert Mercer

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,312
Gave 15 million dollars

16
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
In the campaign

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,200
But he also gave Hillary 40

18
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
Million-dollar

19
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
So

20
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,040
So he's hedging his bets

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,856
Literally every billionaire.

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,416
Like everybody at Goldman Sachs

23
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,488
Gave Hillary a s*** ton of money and

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,512
Also

25
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,352
Actually

26
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
Directions actually that's

27
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Kind of interesting

28
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,312
The other direction that I needed about the Goldman Sachs stuff with Trump

29
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
Okay

30
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,688
The reality is the Goldman Sachs band all their partners for making donations

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
Interested

32
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
And Pence interests

33
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,320
Is

34
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,368
That they'd made a policy change

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
About

36
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,976
Support running for state or local offices

37
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,584
I as well as giving money to people who are sitting state or local officials

38
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Running for federal

39
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
Quotes from a memo

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
It was distributed to Goldman Sachs

41
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Supplies

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,312
This policy change is meant to prevent inadvertently violating paid

43
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Two-player rules

44
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
Particularly the look-back for

45
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
When Partners transition

46
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
Trolls covered by these rules

47
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,504
The policy change is also meant to minimize

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
Potential reputational damage caused by

49
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
False perception

50
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
Play Ruel

51
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
Particular

52
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,976
Partners seniority and visibility

53
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,816
So basically what it comes company with all of it

54
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
F****** former members

55
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
The goddamn

56
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
Right right

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,752
Here is the issue it has to do with state and local representative

58
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,104
Right because those make rules that more directly

59
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Stuck with

60
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,736
Yeah

61
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
The situation is

62
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
The banks

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
Compliance team pointed to

64
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
Did the Trump Pence campaign logo

65
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,232
Because Pam has the governor of Indiana giving him influence over state pension

66
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,328
Right so that was a situation where they couldn't

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,888
Give him because he was a state official

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,704
Meanwhile the new rules Goldman Sachs

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
Text don't restrict

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Democratic

71
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Candidate Hillary Clinton

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
Because she currently doesn't hold office

73
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,896
Her vice president

74
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Is u.s. Senator

75
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
So would be subject to the rules either

76
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
Because he's not a state or local if

77
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
The Goldman Sachs employees were

78
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,624
Unallowed

79
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
To give money to the

80
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
But it wasn't because Trump

81
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,768
It was because of state and local

82
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:19,424
So this particular thing this particular rule that they implemented

83
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
Somehow

84
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Wound up happy

85
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
To the Trump campaign

86
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
It was

87
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Not

88
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
Purposeful it was just

89
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
Kind of

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Coincidence

91
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,504
The governor

92
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880
It's fine that they gave

93
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,976
Hillary Clinton money and they would have given Trump money

94
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,632
And the other thing is I just calling myself out

95
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,448
There were people who gave

96
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,752
Tens of millions of dollars to Hillary to

97
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,080
And I feel like when I listened back to what I was misrepresenting thing

98
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
Bye

99
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,920
Do you have these million-dollar to million-dollar donation

100
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,992
I meant we said Mercer gave 15 million to Trump

101
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,296
Right. She didn't have

102
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
Large-scale donor

103
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,648
It was unintentional

104
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
But

105
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,512
But even then the larger point is billionaires

106
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
Don't give a fuk

107
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
And they're just going to give Millions to

108
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
Because if they become president

109
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,495
We already gave you million but also the other

110
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
Is that a lot of

111
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,615
Hyatt donations on Hillary's from Union

112
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
And stuff like that

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,599
No wonder though one of the larger like in the

114
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
Pantheon

115
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
There's billionaires and then there's Union

116
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Not

117
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Equivalent but

118
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
They still give a s***

119
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:58,751
Please enjoy longer episode today but I just wanted to do this because

120
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
Being above board and I felt like

121
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
When I listened back to that episode was

122
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
Slightly unfair

123
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,455
Alex

124
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,503
Jones has never done

125
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
Probably not

126
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:15,135
I will talk to you real soon but until then

127
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Rapoport

128
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
You still live

129
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
Holding

130
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,679
Alex
