Covering the November 20th 2017 episode of The Alex Jones Show

You're going

30
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
To be as mad

31
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
If you've ever been

32
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
Is a

33
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
Predict

34
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
I want to

35
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
Year that we've been doing this podcast

36
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
I think I've got some stuff in here especially once we get into

37
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,712
What the reality of what they're talking about okay but

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
I just asked you in

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296

41
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
Furious

42
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,792
That's not true

43
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:46,144
For me I feel like I said

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
I know exactly how much you were yelling

45
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
I have a hard time with

46
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,288
Yeah that's fair

47
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
The episode of

48
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
Be trouble

49
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm so to start things off I have an out-of-context drop that is delightful

50
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
He's not wrong and Alexandra together

51
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:32,224
Coming out of break just Eastbound & Down

52
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,576
Subhuman moment now

53
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,672
We are going to only descend from that High Point into hell

54
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:47,072
Yes indeed because I will tell you this

55
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
Listen to text message

56
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,936
Between you and I are earlier today a lot of the show

57
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
Put on today was

58
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
In reaction

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
To the death

60
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Charles

61
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,128
That's why I said I'm sure it has something to do with race

62
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
Yes

63
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
The biggest part of the race war

64
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
Stuff

65
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,344
There's another Charles Manson not the biggest or the race worse

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,440
I had a stretch where I was actually very interested

67
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Boy howdy

68
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Yeah

69
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
He was really afraid of black

70
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,119
You have a lot of awareness

71
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
Yes I know it's about Charles Manson

72
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:30,079
Well for this episode of him but I will be the first to admit that I've never

73
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
Doncic deep dive

74
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
A couple book

75
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,199
Documentaries

76
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Human beings Leverage

77
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
When you have more expertise and thankfully that is

78
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
It's because

79
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Alex has a narrative

80
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
Dell and let's start

81
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,071
No it's start with how he wants to get things going how you going to present

82
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
The death of Charles

83
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,727
I've already

84
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
Also this is the music that's playing is the cover of Helter Skelter a little bit

85
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
He couldn't get the right to Helter Skelter on this one

86
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,783
2017 well Charlie Manson

87
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,767
Also spoiler guys

88
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,703
But I have 100% at the drums on Helter Skelter on expert on Roxanne field

89
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,799
I realize that's a lie

90
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
Actually you were telling the truth

91
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
You don't mean to brag I got gold stars on it I did not in hundred percent

92
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
In the interest of honesty

93
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Is in the chat

94
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,007
It was really weird crazy that somebody

95
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Running around

96
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
Beauty queen 70s Villas

97
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Coffee baroness

98
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,015
It was a big big deal

99
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
Everybody's crazy

100
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,367
That is a Charles Manson paraphrase

101
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,719
This is the Godfather of the antifa movement

102
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
What is a Godfather

103
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,863
Abba modern environmental movement

104
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,679
This is a man that wanted 90%

105
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,519
On the world's population to be exterminated by a world government

106
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,127
Who's wanted to ignite

107
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,527
Different religious groups against each other

108
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
Concord strategy

109
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,463
Level CIA

110
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
Control program

111
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,863
The highest levels of rock and roll

112
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,191
Movies he knew all the major folks co-wrote songs

113
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,543
The list goes on and on

114
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,711
California on drugs

115
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,855
Devin the Dude door was ordered to carry out the murder

116
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
We don't know still this day

117
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
Sure.

118
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,999
100%

119
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,839
What is your immediate reaction to to that

120
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,447
Reaction

121
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,567
It was very obvious not not in favor

122
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Okay

123
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
Not try ends

124
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Cuz erase work

125
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,343
He was paranoid and terrified

126
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,183
And one of the main things that he did was he use that paranoid

127
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
To control the people in

128
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Inside of his car

129
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,559
Wouldn't allow them to escape he wouldn't allow them to go anywhere

130
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,887
By stoking their fears that they would be killed if they went

131
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,935
The other thing

132
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
Was not co-write any of the Beach Boys

133
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
However

134
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:18,175
One of the Beast

135
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,783
F****** sorry we had to do with why they ended up breaking up

136
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,415
Hung out with one of the Beach Boys was not because

137
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
They were friends

138
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Because

139
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Sex

140
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,631
Yeah those drugs for some people

141
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
I just want to be right

142
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
What's his f*** I don't remember which beachway it was that an Wilson it was not Brian Wilson

143
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
David Jones

144
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:01,439
David Wilson just hung out at the place because

145
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
Charles Manson

146
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:11,679
Through women at him under a wonder if Alex wants to talk about that

147
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
Think he does

148
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:19,359
Yeah it was a sex called for David Wilson and he did that part of the reason that he had the

149
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,759
The call was just so he could get more people for David Wilson Ave sex was in the correction

150
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Correction from the

151
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
Okay alright

152
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:45,471
Could I have that I run into all the time is the length that Alex will go to

153
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
Excuse white violence

154
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,847
It's astounding to me that every time there's a white person

155
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
It has to be some sort of a

156
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,479
INR CIA operation gone wrong or something like that

157
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,039
It's never that they actually wanted to kill beep

158
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,135
It's never that they actually had malice evil or anything in their hearts

159
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
It's always someone else's fault

160
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
Dennis Wilson not David Wilson

161
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:14,143
David Wilson was a guy who ran a film festival in Vikings come out and was not involved.

162
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Azurite that is

163
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
You're doing that

164
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,783
Whatever that was I got going on is I know that this is going to make you so mad that I'm trying to

165
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,183

That's fine I will try and play off of that

168
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Owen Wilson

169
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
Drillbit Taylor

170
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,335

Any film

177
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
In history

178
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487

Future man pulls up

189
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Makes fun of them

190
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Little banana

191
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
One of the funniest lines

192
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,559
Cuz afterwards after he drives Leon Wilson like

193
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,191

00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,295
Alright wilson-read

199
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
60s

200
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,951
In the car

201
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:19,071
He wants to talk about the the environment the people were living in

202
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
Season what was taboo and what have you and it's devil worship

203
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
70s telling me what happened

204
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,359
This is what this is about

205
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
What was

206
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
60s to the Puritan America

207
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Devil work

208
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,855
You can get people to worship the devil that sex with

209
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Superhot

210
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Movie stars

211
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
Next it was

212
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
Charlie Manson was about

213
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
He was wanting carry Altra

214
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
Yeah

215
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,055
Popular culture

216
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
Where is so cool

217
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,343
Being hippies

218
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
That's always the first thing is to peace and love and Nirvana and

219
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Make the play

220
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,655
In the shadows

221
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
We got a couple of problems

222
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
Charles Manson

223
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
Was used

224
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
In the sixties device

225
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,687
Because as the narrative goes

226
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Literally

227
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,247
Everyone else

228
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Charles Manson

229
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
Was the end of the six

230
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
Yeah it was the story where everybody got into the flower child

231
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,815
We got to figure s*** out

232
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,655
69 right everything that happened to the beginning the seventies of kind

233
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:04,543
I love trash

234
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
Teachers Charles man

235
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,223
Listen to all of it and the connective tissue

236
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,271
It's not really in a lot of these clips

237
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Cuz it's boring

238
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:20,671
Is that he believed the Charles Manson was a guy who was Batman is drunk guy

239
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
And he was trying to

240
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
To get people into

241
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,815
The drugs and then compromise them into devil worship

242
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
But not even the family

243
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
He's talking about like he says specifically there's one

244
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Charles Manson

245
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Campus around America

246
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,383
And Charles Manson was just the one that went wrong

247
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,735
He went off the reservation and Alex will explain what that means in a little bit

248
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
You have a question

249
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
I see you raising your hand

250
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
I have time for one Quest

251
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
No follow-up

252
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,095
I think there's this guy named Gabe

253
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,703
Who is realreal

254
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,287
You would walk around with a big

255
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Bush bleed

256
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
New strain

257
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,407
You know what I'm going to go I'm going to go

258
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:18,271
I don't think he had a cult

259
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
You got to start loading every student

260
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,671
It's for Action Group or something like that have a following

261
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,487
Yeah

262
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,351
Picture of George Washington

263
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,055
It was like a joint

264
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Entirely true

265
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
So in this in this next clip

266
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
While discussing all this devil worship

267
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Alex accidentally makes

268
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
A bit of akka

269
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,295
Confession about what he's version of Christian

270
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
And what he looks

271
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Let's

272
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,743
Is

273
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
For the real

274
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
The real Atlantis

275
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,751
Now

276
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
The real rosicrucian order

277
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
Esoteric Christianity

278
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,527
What she's just every flavor of rebellion

279
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
Gas station

280
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
Program

281
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
Horrible things

282
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,351
Ohio

283
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Man

284
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:45,055
Wanted to say at the end of that last load we kind of got off track but he said he's saying the Dino Charge

285
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,687
Girls Manson there's always a Dracula in the background or whatever like

286
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,783
Like he based his career he started his career building

287
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
Like a new church

288
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
At the site of the Branch Davidian

289
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
And loves Waco

290
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:05,023
Koresh all that s***

291
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Huge David koresh

292
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
Interesting

293
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
I love the way his name is David koresh

294
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:18,335
Love the way he was Jesus okay that's true every buddy knows that strangely enough

295
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,151
Fine with everything he did

296
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
Moving lock

297
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,527
Very apologetic

298
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Begin

299
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,231
Esoteric Christianity

300
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,303
I do like I do like the degree of difficulty on

301
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
About that you got like okay

302
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
It's like in the Olympics

303
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,679
You know anybody can do a straight dive

304
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,751
Make it look pretty good your degree difficulty

305
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
David caress your degree of difficulty is way up you already start a little ahead

306
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Bonus point

307
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
Start not there's no doubt about that but if it's at the same time does not nail The Landing Golf Course

308
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
Blows around

309
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,511
He just goes on and on about that like.

310
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
Gennarino did killer

311
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,631
It's not the most important

312
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
Important

313
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:21,311
Esoteric Christianity

314
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,919
Series about gnosticism are pretty close to right

315
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
Call Thomas Jefferson a classical liberal in Liberal all the time

316
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
Christianity is

317
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Logical

318
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,559
As you wish you removed all of the The Pretender

319
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,423
To the Bible

320
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Those miracles

321
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,007
B******* like the Gospel of Thomas

322
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Sprite

323
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
If you look into most-liked version

324
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Who's the best character

325
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
A lot of The Interpreter

326
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
This is one of my favorite piece

327
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
Most of the interpretation

328
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
I don't

329
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
That's what a lot of it boils down to

330
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,143
Is like the tree of wisdom of Good and Evil is an orgasm

331
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,447
The fruit of the tree of Good and Evil is an orgasm

332
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
And so you should never

333
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
It's so weird how

334
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
All religion

335
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,847
Are obsessed with Zack

336
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,431
Yeah yeah yeah with controlling and regulating

337
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
Because it's such a powerful force

338
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:37,343
Well and it's not a bad idea like if you're trying to get people to Channel all of that

339
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,183
Look up frequently

340
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,231
Rio cuz it is another base

341
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
You get someone to

342
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
The control that through your

343
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,119
System then you're way more likely to

344
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,679
I mean the other thing is

345
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
If everybody's getting laid all the time

346
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
Nobody's going to work

347
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
You know

348
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:01,919
Now back to Mansion where is if everybody

349
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Repressed insects

350
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
Actual you're going to build the system

351
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,039
Chapel

352
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
Sublimation of Sexual Energy

353
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
Play death

354
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
Admission

355
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:24,447
Not real Christianity not Mainline Christianity

356
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
Nice to hear it from his mouth

357
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
And that means straight up

358
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
He might believe in like

359
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
Lost Books of the Bible and forgotten books of Eden

360
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
He might be into

361
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
To the Apocrypha

362
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
The pseudepigrapha

363
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
He might be into all of these like

364
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
Banished book

365
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,135
No and I'm not talking about any kind of like

366
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,951
Logical reasoning

367
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
They're just

368
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:52,095
Looks like I would totally if you had an illuminated text of the

369
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,423
Jesus fighting dragons and murdering kids when he was a kid

370
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
I'm excited about that

371
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,383
The perfect man

372
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Tim killed Sharon

373
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,759
Do you know that

374
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,367
Alex knows that to Reformation

375
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
I spent a long time researching method

376
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,816
Wait he did what are you oh my God

377

00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,480
Charles Manson is a Renfield but he wants to

422
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
Like he was he was

423
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248

00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
Armstrong

450
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:00,160
He's saying that there are there's like marijuana's that are going around that are hallucinogenic

451
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,976
More less

452

Medicinals and then he gets sidetracked

455
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
80 weird

456
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
Deconstruction of his own voice

457
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
It's very it's very

458
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
Look at it

459
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,392
This is a very very serious

460
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:37,280
Situation and is part of a larger operation to put you into a near dream-state

461
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,328
So you're not really conscious

462
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,632
Row Row Row Your Boat

463
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:47,008
Down the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream

464
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
If I wanted

465
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
To come on this show

466
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
And talk to you

467
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,688
Like they do on NPR

468
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,248
To put you into a trance I could do it

469
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
But on purpose

470
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,112
I have a grating voice

471
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
You out

472
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
Your coma

473
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,976
To shake you free out of it

474
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,792
So you're revealing the invoices

475
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
I could talk just as sweet

476
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,888
Justice pretty

477
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,424
Has all these fake people

478
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
I don't do that

479
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,752
Are you trying to share my real voice

480
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,568
Is everything they hate

481
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Masculine

482
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Grading

492
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,384

I like

497
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,344
It's too it's too nonsensical

498
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:43,232

499
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:49,632

Perfectly clear

507
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,808
This isn't the stuff I expected you to yell about

508
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:14,208
Later

509
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Alex

510
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376

Globalist plans

522
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
Doesn't sound right now

523
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,240
Charlie Manson

524
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056

Yes he thought 90

545
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,032
90% of people were going to die in a race war

546
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Which by the way

547
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,152
Fears of stuff

To be a race war

556
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
And that's based off of

557
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:40,128
Manson's idea exactly

558
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,224
Is what a Neo-Nazi said about that is going to be erased

559
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:51,392

00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,624
Also here we go this next at the next web lays out what I mean

571
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
It's not just the race

572
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
This is what Alex

573
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,096
Who the guru's over the universities in every city

574
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:45,664
All that is coming

575
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
George Soros

576
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Now

577
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
This plan backfires

578
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:00,000
This plan backfires when Alex starts playing some clips

579
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,584
Yeah kind of sound more like him

580
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,960
He doesn't address that at all but

581
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:13,568
In the meantime Alex starts talking about

582
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,896
Sort of generally discussing what they are about and

583
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:21,248
Spreading some fears fryeri thoughts on the other side

584
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,088
BOCES a bunch of pedophile

585
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,392
Devil worshippers today

586
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:34,304
Sex with hot chicks on altars

587
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,968
Hy-Vee

588
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
And you got to

589
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
So that's the globalist

590
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
Children

591
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Taehyung age

592
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,960
Roy Moore

593
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:17,056
Well I'm not just that but the entire homeschool

594
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Community

595
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
Like one of the big things that they do is

596
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
Is they create the

597
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,688
He's child marriages in order to 1

598
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,248
Subjugate women

599
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
In order for it like

600
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,064
That way your father has

601
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
Complete control over your future and

602
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:35,232
The weird. Is that your betrothed

603
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,816
You're supposed to be betrothed like that and married at like 15

604
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,888
But before you actually move in with your husband

605
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,424
Your dad is supposed to

606
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Teach you for a few years

607
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
What year

608
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
Duties

609
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
Like it

610
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
Batshit

611
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
Insane out there

612
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,664
Go around and give these

613
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,968
Talks at evangelico

614
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
Meetings and Conference

615
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,552
That are all vaguely like

616
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,464
You know this is what women are supposed to do and then later on people are like wait are you talking about 14 year olds

617
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,512
And they stopped getting invited as much

618
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
Is very uncomfortable

619
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,424
Abor what I wanted to bring what he's talkin about there

620
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,728
Blood God bless their drinking

621
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,008
That's the blood libel

622
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
From the children

623
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,432
First air

624
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:31,040
They're not doing that but that's that's

625
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,856
That's all that is

626
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,672
That's all

627
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,256
This idea of misinterpreting stories to say that they're trying to

628
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
Blood supplies

629
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:45,120
Right whatever

630
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,776
Or the putting fluoride in the water all of that are examples of

631
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
Choose another form of archaic

632
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,664
All of the stuff that Alex talks about

633
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
With the globalist

634
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
All of these beers

635
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
Traceback for

636
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:08,160
In the most part about 11 or so

637
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
And it's pathetic

638
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,464
And the fact that that people don't

639
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
See-through that is

640
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,280
Troubling

641
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
And it true

642
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,888
It's a true

643
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,936
I'm so in his next clip Alex wants

644
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,704
Do not be afraid

645
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,776
Oh good cuz he's been stoking my fears for a while now

646
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:32,736
He wants you to not be afraid of the fluoride in the water watch anymore because

647
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:36,576
Do we have found in China there are levels of fluoride

648
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,416
Unless you live in

649
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,000
Know that people know

650
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,048
As of now there's a new

651
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,632
What's a system

652
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,192
Fall out of trees

653
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
They can make you go to sleep

654
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
Flip the switch

655
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,928
Moving away from that program

656
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,128
They're going with 5G technology

657
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
So this is how the photo shoot going on

658
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,760
Cell phone

659
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,832
Group has been doing good job

660
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
Merida's on the show lately

661
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:47,744
This is like my favorite crazy

662
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,840
Crazy his spouted lot of his ship and Alex brings up hamamoto store

663
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
As well dr. Nick begich

664
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,680
We've gone over is not a doctor

665
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,520
A lot of those clasica

666
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,592
Traits that he was describing about University

667
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,152
Like I'm a little bit

668
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:08,224
But Nick baggage is not a doctor

669
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,624
He has his degree from a Sri Lankan University that is

670
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,024
Diploma Mill making up all this s*** about electromagnetic waves and what has

671
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,120
Have you it's just complete pseudoscience

672
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
Attitude teacher

673
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,728
Do you think I could get one of those srilankan degrees

674
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,544
Weed out

675
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,568
I have

676
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,152
Diploma Mill that I run

677
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,480
This shows not making enough money

678
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,112
But if you got a diploma Mill I like one

679
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,648
That you're expanding your Revenue

680
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:59,936
Totally credits made already

681
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
High today

682
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:07,872
I'm just a to prepare you for what's to come

683
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,688
A show later is like

684
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,528
Deeply troubling and

685
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,856
But before we do it turns out there's big news

686
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,392
In terms of the world

687
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
We're all going to

688
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,768
You know one of the problems I have

689
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Hatred of

690
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
Theoretical universe

691
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
The gurus

692
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Was that

693
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
Generally speaking

694
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
All of them

695
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
All of them

696
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,008
We're trying their best

697
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
2

698
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,848
React to what they saw as the 50

699
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
And the way that the eyes

700
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
Ethan Herrera

701
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,688
Destroyed women

702
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
Like

703
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
Exactly what they were going for

704
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:49,088
Unfortunately a lot of them continue that in a different direction

705
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,928
One of the big things they were trying to do was create a

706
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Amor

707
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
Expansive

708
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,512
Society and allow people

709
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,072
Open up the Earth their minds in the same way

710
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,120
Kizi in the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test

711
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,912
Would go around and do that

712
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:06,240
It's frustrating to me that you would Moline

713
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,288
Them the wrong reason

714
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:12,384
Are deserving of much-maligned meant for many other

715
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,944
I think to a certain extent what you look at is

716
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,504
Like a macro version of someone who's going to

717
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
Through therapy

718
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,368
You are really buttoned-up and

719
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,904
Never speak your mind

720
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,024
Speaking up for yourself and being assertive and all that

721
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,560
I am on the way

722
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
2

723
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
Health

724
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:37,728
You will probably scream at somebody you'll probably on the path to getting better you'll do something wrong

725
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
Or you'll go too far

726
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
And perhaps

727
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,080
60s in a response to

728
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:42,848
The 50s

729
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,664
Right

730
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
Help

731
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,040
Trying to fix the woes of society to end up you end up

732
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,880
Metaphorically screaming it said one of the biggest

733
00:39:55,392 --> 00:40:00,256
Groups of the biggest influences of so many of those

734
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
Was the burgeoning

735
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Therapeutic

736
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Community at the

737
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
He's one of the

738
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
Great chroniclers of

739
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
Why

740
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
Cease all went wrong

741
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:16,896
And his disillusionment when the the 70s rolled around

742
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:20,992
After he did Time in Mexico all of that stuff was

743
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,552
Was very fascinating and that he did start

744
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
End of deconstruct

745
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,624
How many of those therapist

746
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,184
We're basing themselves off of fall sign

747
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,584
I'm assuming the chat room is going wild for there

748
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
She just wants

749
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,400
Attention

750
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,240
It is something that comes comes out of that

751
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,544
And the way that he is

752
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,336
He's portraying these people

753
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,616
Is so wrong

754
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:52,480
Because they did so many wrong things

755
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,320
He's missing the point because the things that they did wrong are the things that

756
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,344
He supports them

757
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,928
Right where is he's creating this false Reality Bites

758
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,744
Why so important

759
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,328
She's just making a drop in Camarillo

760
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,656
The worst and the best

761
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
Now it's

762
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
I don't know

763
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,032
I don't know what to know how far to go in

764
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,336
Widest picture

765
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:25,248
Charles Manson

766
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
You could make a lot of arguments

767
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,088
The Charles Manson was an offshoot

768
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
Shoot of

769
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,392
The worst tendencies

770
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
He's of the sick

771
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:37,792
A lot of arguments that serial killers going to serial killer

772
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,120
Going to happen

773
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:47,776
The particular details of them are worth what

774
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
Downtown

775
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,943
Down the road Alex's the Zodiac Killer

776
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
Completely distract

777
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:00,063
Give me from whatever I completely lost track

778
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,207
I tried to start setting up the

779
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,047
Which means everybody gets a drink this weekend

780
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
There's big news

781
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,607
About the world

782
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,143
Religion

783
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,727
This weekend

784
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,519
Akon worshipping AI

785
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:29,247
I think I'm actually okay with that

786
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,511
Play play for a while

787
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
Impression

788
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
Not a good one

789
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,167
Something different about this

790
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,615
What do you want must warn you last few months

791
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,327
We're back to that

792
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:21,727
Rebecca that from

793
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,519
Elon Musk

794
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,335
Sub tweeted a guy

795
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:32,479
I have probably a goof

796
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,551
To worship at the AI godhead

797
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,623
All of which is most likely a tongue-in-cheek b*******

798
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:42,463
What kind of idea you are not the person

799
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
All the people who shouldn't be

800
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
Making

801
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:48,095
A religion

802
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:54,239
Bulshit is manufacturing dialogue in one of the most disgraceful is there

803
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:07,039
Is that is that a I would be the closest thing that we've ever come to that is actually

804
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
A real God

805
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:14,207
Bright lights

806
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,023
Do you know the ways that technology

807
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,327
Expands exponentially

808
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:24,191
Not on a nonlinear fashion you like what we will end up having

809
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,263
Will have access to within the next like

810
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,567
The growth of Technology

811
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,847
It's almost

812
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,687
Some people's modelsim futurist model

813
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,247
RNR insanely like

814
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:42,879
You noticed everything being able to communicate with each other all with all knowledge by all centralized

815
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,463
I don't know self-learning self-perpetuating

816
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,743
Computer would be

817
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,023
Would be on Mission

818
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,047
Essentially

819
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,607
I'd be fine with

820
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,935
Like

821
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,239
I always think like Janet swim

822
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,775
Is 1 good questions

823
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,055
Second question

824
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,359
After we figure that one out

825
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,175
Would a thinking robot

826
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,223
Like if you could really

827
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
Sincerely

828
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
Have them

829
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,807
Be able to respond

830
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,135
Rudimentary work

831
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,927
Call mom passed the Turing test

832
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:22,047
Sure something along those lines of experiencing boredom

833
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,863
That is a very

834
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,399
Does that is a lime

835
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
Because that's a line for me

836
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Well here's the thing

837
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
If they were capable of it

838
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
Experiencing boredom

839
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,055
Boredom

840
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
At

841
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
The same exponential level

842
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,151
So one second of boredom

843
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
Something along those lines

844
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
Would be infinite

845
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,783
The search for robot novelty

846
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
Would be

847
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,647
Deal with boredom is generally

848
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:54,047
Find something interesting

849
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,095
Robot Chicken Robot

850
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
Novelty could be

851
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:04,287
Now we're getting into an episode of Futurama where Bender goes on a bender or Black Mirror

852
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,847
So that's the future

853
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,639
Yeah but now let's go to the park

854
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,967
Alright Alex Jones has something he wants to say about the past

855
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
And then I'm going to have

856
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,831
Serious

857
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
Rebuttal

858
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
Afterwards

859
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:33,983
Bedtime

860
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:40,383
So he's saying that the British Empire was the ruling system of the world Italy

861
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:46,783
But let me tell you let me I put together

862
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:55,999
Not much to do British Empire

863
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:01,887
Well first of all it was being explored California was becoming a state

864
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:08,543
Expansionism was on the March

865
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,639
But there's a war in that crummy us again

866
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:19,039
The Ottoman Empire was still in play

867
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:25,183
What a great range of power is going strong

868
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
Years

869
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
After this

870
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
That's why I thought

871
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:37,471
Those are some things that are going on there was the Indian Mutiny against British rule

872
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:41,055
That was dealing with it was the Opium War

873
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,895
Brittany was not

874
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:49,759
The colonial rule in the world

875
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,039
It was like

876
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,319
Dead center of the

877
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,343
Complete collapse

878
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Of the British Colonial

879
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,671
Yeah yeah

880
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:02,559
Republic

881
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,727
Just given like the setting

882
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
No

883
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,567
I am wrong that was

884
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,359
American

885
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,639
Fair enough

886
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,807
Decision

887
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,671
To establish world.

888
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:36,095
So any government the scientific Elite in the British government the colonial British government

889
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,423
The empire

890
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,215
Global government

891
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:47,615
Could have swore they thought about the sewing machine

892
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,199
Hey don't knock that

893
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:57,599
Very hard to do it's cool it's cool but the scientifically we're not doing all that much

894
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,511
Does Macy

895
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,791
But everybody else

896
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
Militarily

897
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,143
But culturally

898
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,935
They barely understood pass

899
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
Where

900
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,943
That's the final Revolution

901
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,015
Just what the globalist technocrats calling

902
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,087
Book

903
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
Conferences

904
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,207
60 years ago

905
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
They didn't

906
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,999
You know what he's talking about

907
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,535
I figured it out

908
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,631
Charles Darwin wrote the origin of the species in 1850s

909
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:48,799
I think that's what he's really I think that's the only thing he's talking about

910
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
That's like the scientific should he hate

911
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:56,991
Write the idea of evolution

912
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:01,855
Evolution of

913
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,135
Have to hate

914
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,743
Revolution number one on the list

915
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,279
Can think of that was relevant

916
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
1850s

917
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,631
The Western world

918
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,703
He could be talking well I don't know my history but I'm

919
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,751
Pretty sure that's when they found out

920
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,519
Heliocentric

921
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Is that right

922
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Okay

923
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:27,711
Okay

924
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,503
Nachos

925
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,111
Feel like Alex is still mad about that

926
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,135
Definitely

927
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,719
You gave me a second look like

928
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
Hold on now

929
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
So

930
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
Earlier

931
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,351
Alex said that he was going to play some

932
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
Yeah Charles Manson

933
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,191
That they were going to

934
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
Show

935
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,239
The Charles Manson

936
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,031
Charlie if you're nasty

937
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,639
He's like the Democrats

938
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,663
News like Al Gore

939
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,479
Here's the first clip

940
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,039
The first one

941
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Is like algo

942
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:10,207
Here's the first language

943
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:25,311
What's up with the family

944
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:31,711
Salvage outdoor

945
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:46,463
Bio-weapon plug releases

946
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,631
This is where normal

947
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,679
I know you don't have enough time

948
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:02,335
If we if we weren't doing this episode live I feel like you would have spent an entire weekend.

949
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,359
That one clip

950
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127
Just gone like

951
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,663
Buy sentence

952
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:09,247
Superman

953
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,551
Pull together a clip of Alex saying

954
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,111
Exact same f****** thing

955
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:20,511
I don't even need to cuz at the end there is a m being like

956
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,863
Crazy

957
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,911
Keep saying that stuff about

958
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,215
50 million people

959
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:35,615
How can I buy this

960
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,407
It to shock the guy

961
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:40,735
None of that sounds like

962
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,063
I guess dog or likes trees

963
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,599
So there's that

964
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,879
Now here's exhibit B

965
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,183
Alex Jones believes

966
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,207
Is there Charles Manson

967
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,743
Super into a one-world government

968
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:52,767
Okay

969
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,863
One World Government

970
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,167
Man doesn't back up to his fear

971
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Michael Strahan

972
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,751
One World Government

973
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:15,039
The bombed-out little drug-delivery got

974
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,719
When what you look like

975
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,255
Looks like an ant

976
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:30,655
Eclipse lighting

977
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,775
F*** you. f*** p***

978
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,335
God damn it if you don't support us

979
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,407
George Soros will win Stanford

980
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,015
Now

981
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,807
He pivots to an ad

982
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,855
Not just on like

983
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,135
Be afraid

984
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,719
It's our enemies are goddamn Charles Manson

985
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,511
Accidentally

986
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,047
Like you playing these things

987
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,327
It's very clear

988
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,351
Subway

989
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,191
It sounds exactly like it sounds very similar

990
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,567
Back in the 60s

991
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:13,151
The idea of a unified world government was a very popular idea

992
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,479
It's not like he was the only person who ever is paused

993
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,527
That was pretty big hippie idea

994
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,855
It was one of the end it was also coincidentally

995
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,647
The time when the UN was maybe the most

996
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,415
Popular it is

997
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,695
It's a bit yeah

998
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:32,095
Like that was that was shortly after they were afraid that way shortly

999
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,167
The Cold War was just

1000
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:39,519
Really starting to ramp up in all of the proxy wars I hope really

1001
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,359
There's the hope of being able to avoid

1002
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,663
Yep

1003
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,015
Entirely possible that at that

1004
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:57,695
You sound like Charlie

1005
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,511
Charlie obaugh

1006
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,303
I prefer spider

1007
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:07,167
Alex I don't even know what

1008
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,703
He's trying to make but it doesn't work

1009
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,799
I hear you talking about man-made global warming

1010
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:29,439
What the f***

1011
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:35,839
What the f***

1012
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:42,239
Search for slogan it goes on from here but it is definitely worth stopping

1013
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,591
History of the world

1014
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,151
He is really f****** lucky that

1015
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,967
It flashed away from his face

1016
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,247
There had to be more easily

1017
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,527
Oh

1018
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,575
I really should have

1019
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,367
Before

1020
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,927
You playing the clip that Paul Joseph Watson put in the dark

1021
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,975
Infowars

1022
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,535
Send it starting to troll Alex he might be

1023
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,071
I think you might be working on the next

1024
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,263
Charles Manson was an environmentalist and all they need is Cherry Picked

1025
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:22,687
These tiny little pieces from interviews without looking at the big picture anyway think we are

1026
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:26,015
1776bank

1027
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
Throughout the rest of the

1028
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,063
There's so much

1029
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:33,695
Play horses

1030
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:39,327
White papers

1031
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:43,935
Fluoride

1032
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,103
Constantly talks about free association

1033
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:31,039
From your words

1034
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:37,439
It's clear that you were

1035
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:43,583
Westbury

1036
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:55,871
Alex believes that all of this

1037
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
Yeah

1038
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
Chimeras

1039
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,791
There you go

1040
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,631
If you want on the street

1041
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,871
Flipping her off grabbing the microphone they all have that

1042
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:32,735
That that that stupidity

1043
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,063
Broadcasting

1044
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,343
The correct spirit in the world

1045
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,879
Turn off themselves

1046
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:46,303
Great way to respond to that because he can't deal with the content

1047
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,703
Biggest reveal is not all of the s*** that he said that

1048
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,983
Is exactly what Alec

1049
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,775
Orangetheory similar

1050
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,567
Especially like that

1051
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,335
You know

1052
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:02,431
After me I'll kick everybody's ass me like Alec

1053
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:07,807
That's you that's you have left back to him screaming at Adam Schiff

1054
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
Paranoid fancy

1055
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,111
Disease of somebody attack

1056
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:15,743
Which will give you the right to do whatever it is you want

1057
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,791
The biggest thing though that

1058
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,559
I felt

1059
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,583
Was a huge

1060
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,351
Reveal

1061
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
Listen

1062
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,703
I'm not a devil but I'm a devil in

1063
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:30,847
Which outside

1064
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:39,295
I have evil inside of a good

1065
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,367
What Alex

1066
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,927
There's there's so much there

1067
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,719
I meant also

1068
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
Quick Quack

1069
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,815
Did Charles Manson

1070
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:55,935
Trinity

1071
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:02,335
Pretend to be Bill Hicks for a long time

1072
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,431
Okay let's actually do with resumes

1073
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
Had a swastika

1074
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,551
Tattooed on his forehead

1075
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,343
That way you could differentiate

1076
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:18,207
Differentiate himself from the real Charles Manson

1077
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:24,095
Charles Manson was now living is Alex Jones rehab

1078
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,167
Exactly

1079
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:33,311
Interesting

1080
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,335
So Alex

1081
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,687
Who's there

1082
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,247
Mansaf

1083
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
Call Charlie

1084
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:47,647
Hold on right now

1085
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:53,535
Alex last week

1086
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,887
I feel like there is

1087
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,959
Got Rusty

1088
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,775
Life

1089
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,543
Alex Jones

1090
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,567
36 hour

1091
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:13,247
People

1092
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,319
Vice did an article that we discussed

1093
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,367
Yep that's covered all of the wrong

1094
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,279
Mostly motivated out of spite

1095
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:29,119
For our live broadcast next week

1096
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
Because of ice

1097
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,967
That's just I need money

1098
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:50,111
Why would you even try and hide it under that veneer of like

1099
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,647
We're doing this

1100
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,183
Not because I need

1101
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,255
Because I wanted

1102
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
Trolls

1103
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:02,655
Tooth tooth questioned behind me are in Factory foods that should not eat

1104
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
Together

1105
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:08,031
That is what those are old-time freezing point reference it'll never be explained

1106
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:12,895
Episode where and we explained or at least we talked

1107
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,687
Maybe

1108
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:21,599
Through the archives maybe you'll find a way of talking about the food that you should

1109
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:26,463
With ice Lolly

1110
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,743
Let me tell you

1111
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:28,767
Ice cream

1112
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,791
Ginger salad

1113
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:33,119
Dead there's a bunch of things you can't eat with jingle be

1114
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:37,727
I know that much I don't know what to drink anyway

1115
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:42,847
I don't know what a mangosteen is all I know is that

1116
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,127
Baby

1117
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,711
12 years ago Ludacris was on Twitter yelling about mangosteen

1118
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,759
And Aziz Ansari was trying to get

1119
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,295
But not take mangosteen

1120
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:54,879
Anyway

1121
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,927
I'm just a big fan of

1122
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,231
Neem leaf and chicken egg giving you

1123
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:03,071
Rheumatism rheumatism

1124
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:09,471
We're done with Charles Manson buddy that's not a good thing

1125
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:11,775
Are you sure

1126
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,079
I'm not even going to introduce this clip

1127
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,103
This is Mike.

1128
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,431
Roshan

1129
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,991
Who is a prominent

1130
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:21,759
Activist

1131
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,039
Individual

1132
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,831
Exposing

1133
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,391
Genocide in South Africa

1134
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,927
Zimbabwe

1135
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,911
Weimar Republic inflation

1136
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,215
Because they

1137
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,007

To even be like

1160
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
Hey

1161
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:58,527
I can't believe black people are angry at White

This is

1165
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,279
This is astonishing

1166
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,047
Bright

1167
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,583
It's pretty it's pretty crazy

1168

Look look

1169
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,983
But I also want you to know

1170
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:21,055
That the situation they're talkin about specifically

1171
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,359
He's crazier than you think

1172
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,431
If there is

1173
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,455
Any place

In the world

1175
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,551
Where you could look at white genocide happening and be like

1176
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
I guess that's why

1177
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:39,231
It would be snow

1178
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,023
How to be a little bit like okay

1179
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,815
Guys you shouldn't do it

1180
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,839
Okay

1181
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:49,215
I'm going to read an article about

1182
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,007
This black

1183
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,567
It was a Black Friday Black Monday

1184
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,847
The thing that ever

1185
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,127
Who cares

1186
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,175
It is

1187
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:01,759
And he is

01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,343

01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
Who's coming on

1191
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,903
Right who is apart of

1192
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,719
Would amount to a militia group

1193
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:18,399
Very heavily armed and will get you some of their craziness here in a little bit

1194
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,191
So before you read it

1195
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:26,079
Just recap the story that we were told okay that farmers were killed

1196
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,615
4 killed by

1197
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:33,759

1200
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,207
Perfectly with truth

1201

Nautical from al-jazeera are most across South Africa John black clothing and gathered on motor

Interpretive response

1204

To farm murders

1205
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,103
The racially-charged protest

1206
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,663
Comes days after two white farmers were sentenced

1207
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,967
More than 10 years in jail for assaulting a black man

1208
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,527
The case that is also stirred racial tension

1209
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,087
Interesting but that's what the protest was about

1210
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,135
Not what Alex is actually even describing

1211
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:16,255
White commercial Farmers have long complained that they bear the brunt of rising violent crime and save the government

1212
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,279
Ignores their plight

1213
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
So what do you think so far

1214
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,143
What I think so far

1215
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
Apps

1216
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:24,959
Alex

1217
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
Did not read

1218
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:30,335
Earlier in 2017 Africa

1219
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,127
To the fact-checking political organ

1220
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:37,503
How many people working in Lebanon Farms

1221
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:40,575
I am impossible to calculate a farmer.

1222
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,903
It also laid rest accusations at a

1223
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,207
Unfolding in the country after Mike cernovich

1224
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:48,511
American white supremacist

Freda Dale 2016

1226
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,607
The quotes white genocide is real in South

1227
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,167
Here is that interesting other quote

1228
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,447
Some guy named Garrett

1229
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,495
The head of governance crime and justice

1230
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:01,055
System

1231
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:05,663
I got it so just got Gareth newham is the head of the government's crime and justice

1232
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,199
Division of the pretoria-based in

1233
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,735
For security studies

1234
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,783
Quote within the white farming

1235
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,831
Community there are white right-wing sense

1236
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,135
Belief that these attacks are Orchestra

1237
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,439
And they've been lobbying European country

1238
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,231
Which is only resulted in the political

1239
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,023
Politicization of the issue

1240
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,583
But they think it's only them

1241
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
And that's a mistake

1242
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,399
Of course their concerns

1243
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,935
Visa V murders

1244
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
Violence

1245
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,495
Their concerns are serious

1246
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:35,359
They also need to appreciate that it is a national issue

1247
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:40,735
The claims are white genocide continue to circulate on social media with memes calling on the World to act

1248
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,527
GameStop White being murdered in

1249
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,599
These have been met mostly with ridicule by most South Africa

1250
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,391
Last week to South Africa

1251
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
Complete service

1252
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,207
Released its annual stats of crime

1253
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,743
I found that there were more than 90

1254
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,279
18000 murders in the country

1255
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:56,095
Or 34 murders per 100,000 people between

1256
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,119
2050

1257
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,143
A 2000

1258
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:01,471
Not bad quote if you want to ascertain through

1259
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:06,591
Statistics who are the most likely to be murdered in South Africa benthos are young black males Garrett's do him

1260
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,919
And told al-jazeera for some context

1261
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:13,759
White South African make up 1.8% of the country's murders

1262
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,063
While being under 9% of the population

1263
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
Statistically

1264
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,647
They have a shockingly lower

1265
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,183
Then expected murder rate

1266
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,719
So

1267
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,511
Mike cernovich

1268
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,351
Vets

1269
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:31,167
One of our cast of characters

1270
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,239
By being a f******

1271
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,263
Racist pilot

1272
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:39,615
Right I don't have this article pulled up anymore

1273
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,151
But I found a very interesting

1274
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:43,711
About this guy Simon wrote

1275
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,527
Apparently what he is done

1276
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,087
I'm here the part of a group called The sweet land

1277
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,623
And I'm not pronouncing that correctly

1278
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,951
Nice already I'm already out it means Southland

1279
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:58,303
They are a group that is

1280
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:04,191
They believe that our race war is coming and that they are going to be

1281
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,519
Comes of it and so they're basically

1282
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,543
Charles Manson

1283
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:13,151
Yep ironic on the day after it dies

1284
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:19,551
This is an article on a website called

1285
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,879
Angry white men. Org which is dedicated to tracking

1286
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,671
Connections within the white supremacy

1287
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,695
It's alright world

1288
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:30,047
And it's very different

1289
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:36,703
Beyond the other side of it it's really interesting I'll post a link up to

1290
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,495
Cuz I don't have time to go through all of it

1291
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
Is if I

1292
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,615
If you do the kind of research that this

1293
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,895
The website is.

1294
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,687
You see

1295
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,015
Focus

1296
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,575
And intentional campaign

1297
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,879
On the part of Simon Roche

1298
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,415
And other members of

1299
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,439
The Swede Landers

1300
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,719
To approach

1301
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:02,303
Really really f***** up versions of the right-wing

1302
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,119
To try and publicize

1303
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,655
Fundraise for

1304
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:11,519
Spend that they even have a recording

1305
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,823
Ava Ava of a phone call

1306
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,615
This guy

1307
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:17,919
I'm sorry I really sure

1308
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:30,975
Twist Australia

1309
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,535
It's very similar to the Newsela

1310
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,071
So

1311
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,631
I'll just read here from this box is this is this is

1312
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,167
Specifically about Simon Roche

1313
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,239
The founder of the Southern nationalist blog Occidental

1314
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
Brad Griff

1315
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,079
Is Panda number of inflammatory articles under the suit

Hunter Wallace

1317
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:51,199
In 2012 for example he wrote the quote Hitler was justified in conquering Norway

1318
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:55,295
And claims it in 150 years mass murderer Anders Breivik will be

1319
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,599
Viewed as quote the European John Brown

1320
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,623
Don't

1321
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,647
Support

01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
Rough

1324
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,975
In a March

1325
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,999
1627

1326
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:07,071
19 post Griffin Road that he was contacted by a representative of the

1327
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:07,839
The Swede Landers

1328
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,631
He explained

1329
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,423
Several calls from an unknown number

1330
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,191
When you finally answer

1331
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:14,495
To the found a gentleman by the name of Simon Roche introduced

1332
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,287
Himself and inform him then

1333
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
Pastor Griffin

1334
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:17,823
Number to him

1335
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,895
Later he revealed that he accidentally recorded the conversation but

1336
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,711
The audio on his blog is

1337
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:27,295
During the call the person which is included here on this website

1338
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,599
Rose explains that he another sweet Landers

1339
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:38,559
Roche says that he was hoping Griffin would cover the sweet Landers organization on his blog

1340
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:42,143
But he has been going on

1341
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,167
In southern Africa

1342
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,215
So there's a bunch of connection

1343
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,799
Intentionally made with white nationalist blog

1344
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
Nautica winter

1345
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,431
Really it's really important to remember and

1346
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,711
Really hard drive

1347
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735
Is that

1348
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,295
Apartheid didn't end along

1349
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,063
Time ago

1350
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,343
My girlfriend

1351
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:03,135
Live through the end of Apartheid

1352
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,671
Yeah she's not

1353
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,695
40 years older than

1354
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:08,511
You do like a mole

1355
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,583
It is insane because of course

1356
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,351
Listen to be

1357
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,375
Listen to these ass

1358
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,167
Can tell that it's that

1359
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,215
White victimization that comes

1360
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,263
From its

1361
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
Oh no

1362
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,591
We don't run the world

1363
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,127
It's so much more f***** up

1364
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:30,015
So I'm going to finish this article in algebra and then we'll jump back into Alex's

1365
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:35,135
Jillian godsell a lecturer at the school of governor

1366
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
Is it with a gay

1367
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:44,351
She told al-jazeera that the claim of Red Rising

1368
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,375
Farm murders was a

1369
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,655
Proxy for

1370
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,423
Something else

1371
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:50,239
Quote I don't think this is about murders

1372
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,263
The number of deaths

1373
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:54,847
We don't know if there are whites or black farmers were killed

1374
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,151
Some say 30% of those murdered were black workers

1375
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:00,479
People seem to be grieving for much more than these deaths

1376
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,295
People are grieving about change in this country

1377
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
The end of a

1378
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,111
Now here to things

1379
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,391
Bitter Berry

1380
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,927
Very relevant

1381
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,975
A lot of these farmers

1382
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,535
We're flying apartheid-era flag

1383
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,839
That is not

1384
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,607
About

1385
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,399
Farmrite

1386
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:24,799
Again whatever is about wanting to go back to where you had

1387
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,591
All the power over another group of

1388
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,407
Even if it wasn't

1389
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
I get it

1390
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,199
Here is another

1391
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:33,503
Stacked in a stat that is very

1392
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,575
According to a recent land on it

1393
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,599
White Southern app

1394
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:40,159
Africans are 8.9% of the population

1395
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:44,511
And they own 73% of the agricultural land

1396
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,791
Still

1397
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,815
The still

1398
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
Which is

1399
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:51,167
Which is a very interesting thing that's f***** up

1400
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,983
Even at the end of Apartheid

1401
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
The

1402
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:56,799
Fashion

1403
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:00,383
That was shown very very small minority

1404
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,687
It's ridiculous

1405
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,247
I mean again

1406
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:11,647
What are the reasons I'm a soft no on white genocide is because of that every time that white people have

1407
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,439
Finally had to relinquish

1408
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,743
The power and only had

1409
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,279
Most of the power

1410
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,071
They've been treated with touch

1411
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,863
Compassion

1412
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,655
It's bananas

1413
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,983
So they would never have

1414
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,287
Which they have historically

1415
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,055
Never show

1416
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,639
Not when they needed to not like how I'm calling white people

1417
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:38,527
I think at this point I've proven that I'm a self-hating white person

1418
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,343
The issue comes down to this is

1419
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,391
Not about any kind of ID

1420
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,415
Video of white Janice

1421
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:49,023
Even though

1422
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,583
They can find about

1423
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:54,399
Farmers that are red

1424
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,191
Down

1425
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,983
Did the peak of them worrying

1426
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,007
Late night

1427
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,311
Well in the same way that crime in the United

1428
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,615
Significantly dropping

1429
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,639
Ever since

1430
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,687
Yeah like it is been consist

1431
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,711
And yet one of the

1432
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Easiest ways

1433
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,503
Stoke White

1434
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,319
By acting as though crime

1435
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:13,855
Splash

1436
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,671
Black crime rate

1437
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:23,071
Really cause a good scout game

1438
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:26,911
Describe this is against the murders of

1439
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,703
Protest was about

1440
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,775
White people hurting people and how that should be fine

1441
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:35,103
We don't like it

1442
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,151
Against

1443
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,175
Of course

1444
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:38,943
Nonsense

1445
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,735
Play again

1446
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,063
I completely agree with it

1447
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,855
The concern over violence

1448
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,391
Murder rates are real that's

1449
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
That's something that's real but

1450
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:52,767
Personalizing it making it your victim narrative is wrong

1451
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,791
Because it's

1452
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,583
It's a national problem

1453
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,607
Statistically

1454
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
Show there

1455
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,983
1.8% of the murders are

1456
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,775
White people

1457
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,543
The same thing

1458
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,079
Hear it

1459
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:08,127
Pixar not interracial

1460
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,151
Murder as an a

1461
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,455
Generally speaking murder is

1462
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,479
Is within

1463
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,783
Each

1464
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,111
Incretin 90% +

1465
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,415
Likely to be murdered by

1466
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:23,231
That generally people you know

1467
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,023
Anyway

1468
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,559
This interview is

1469
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,327
Hot garbage

1470
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,119
Included most

1471
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:33,727
Thank you

1472
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,751
Things ever

1473
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,127
Emergency plan because

1474
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,407
I already

1475
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,551
Population

1476
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:57,023
Ism

1477
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:00,351
And I got to ask you why not just evacuate

1478
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:03,423
Very sad these folks will just kill each other

1479
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,727
Very very sad

1480
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,263
We'll be right back

1481
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:10,079
F*** you with your very very sad nonsense Ali

1482
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,615
Hey white people

1483
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,895
Evacuate

1484
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:16,223
Evacuate

1485
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:22,879
You know what that Independence

1486
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:26,463
That argument is

1487
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,511
No no look we don't want to

1488
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,327
Cleanse the racist anymore

1489
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,095
That

1490
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:38,495
Europe should be for European

1491
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,055
That's almost in reverse

1492
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:45,663
Literal white nationalism that's a new state

1493
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:50,015
Also that is nonsense also if you want to talk about rape

1494
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,039
Issues in Africa

1495
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:55,647
Do you want to know the largest number of rape cases

1496
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,719
Causes those races

1497
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:09,471
Raven Africa if it's not f****** racial or child bass is really Chris

1498
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,360
American

1499
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:19,456
Go over there okay I'm sorry I'm sorry Daddy

1500
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:21,504
This is something that really f******

1501
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,320
I know

1502
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:35,584
That f****** brand of Christianity

1503
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,144
Sanity was no longer as except

1504
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,936
Even though it's still very except

1505
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,240
Did hear what it was

1506
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,568
Those f****** decided not. You know what

1507
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,104
We're going to go to Africa

1508
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:53,504
We're going to run this f****** place it's kind of like what the pilgrims did here

1509
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,344
Hold on Sarah made a really good point

1510
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,624
What's that I have neighbors

1511
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,768
Fair enough I'm sorry so I'm actually more sorry

1512
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:11,168
That was probably one of the things I was going to set you off the most

1513
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,008
F****** idea

1514
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,104
That Alex wouldn't have the wherewithal wouldn't have the awareness

1515
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:19,872
The knowledge

1516
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,640
The self

1517
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,664
Reflection

1518
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,200
To know what he was saying

1519
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:26,016
Like I don't believe that I don't believe he would be

1520
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:26,784
So glib

1521
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,832
And loose-lipped as to say

1522
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,648
Why do white people just leave and then the blacks kill each other

1523
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,208
He knows what he's saying

1524
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,000
That's not a stray comment

1525
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
Guess what

1526
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,096
That's a big part of the Swede Landers

1527
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,632
Sort of ideology

1528
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,912
Dino or

1529
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,216
No they believe that at some point

1530
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,008
They're going to have to evacuate

1531
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:47,776
Especially

1532
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:53,408
That's part of why they go around and raise tons of money cuz I need to have enough fuel

1533
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,688
I need to have gun

1534
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,968
And all that s***

1535
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,016
Hazel Alex is having this guy on

1536
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,832
And he's not reading the Articles or the statistics

1537
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,600
Anyting

1538
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,648
About the underpinning

1539
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,672
Of the

1540
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,792
Or at least he's gotten the call

1541
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
From

1542
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,328
Cernovich

1543
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,864
For one of these guys

1544
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,912
You got to talk to this guy he's up on chair

1545
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:17,472
Tommy Robinson gave him a call or some s***

1546
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,752
Asda Tommy Davis

1547
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:24,896
This sweet liners are bigger than p'zone

1548
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,200
Okay interesting products

1549
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:33,088
Also to the chat room roommates are okay with people who live upstairs for me probably not great

1550
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,880
Children

1551
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:38,208
I'm sorry I thought that was the Airbnb Castle

1552
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,768
Not always

1553
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,144
It's only nine 12

1554
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,936
23 they can deal with Target

1555
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:50,240
But look at the weeknight

1556
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,008
Good point

1557
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,824
Right

1558
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,592
Okay

1559
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,616
Thought

1560
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,920
If you are a white Nash

1561
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,480
What if we just

1562
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,248
A viewing

1563
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,808
Because in all honesty

1564
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,856
Like think about this very serious

1565
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
No French

1566
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,976
Ardiana where did

1567
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,536
You can have that place

1568
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,328
I mean in reality

1569
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,352
Most White

1570
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,376
People aren't White

1571
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,192
True most white people are at

1572
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,752
At the very least some sort of late

1573
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,800
Like

1574
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:31,456
Are you there's there's no way to it completely complicit

1575
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,480
Conceptions that

1576
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:36,064
To evaluate your

1577
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,088
Self as you go through

1578
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,904
Experience

1579
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,672
Forms of race

1580
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,208
Cousin within me and I got

1581
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,048
The way that you were raised in

1582
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,072
Culture that your race

1583
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,144
The people who are out-and-out white

1584
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,192
If they're arguing

1585
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,728
Is when we leave

1586
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,752
We'll just let the

1587
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,520
Them kill each other

1588
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,128
If we let them leave

1589
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:03,456
With those people trying to kill each other

1590
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:09,856
Help me find a new version of Separation with blue eyes and green eyes or plaything

1591
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,696
People who are going to get into a small group

1592
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,744
And then go well we're not racially

1593
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:19,072
Right there's going to be some new division

1594
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,656
Alex Jones

1595
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,680
Won the

1596
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:29,824
It still has to be the victim and have their own car

1597
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,104
Country Maid still be like

1598
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:32,896
Scapegoat

1599
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:36,480
Ginger over there when your entire audiology

1600
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,504
Is based on

1601
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,528
Purity

1602
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,320
Then there is always

1603
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,344
To be in Esco

1604
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,136
What Purity is

1605
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,672
Store speakers.

1606
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:46,208
Never exist without

1607
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,488
Pure

1608
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,792
And that's that's always be issued

1609
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,816
They're they're always going to

1610
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:51,584
To try and come

1611
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,352
Continue to

1612
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,632
Escalate their purity

1613
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:54,656
And find that

1614
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:59,008
Perfect little Diamond of white rental everybody's dead but the one guy

1615
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:03,872
So if their argument is everybody else's going to kill each other once we leave

1616
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,640
What

1617
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,224
And then when they kill each other will be like

1618
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
Haha

1619
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,272
I got you guys

1620
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,552
You're the one

1621
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:15,136
I mean no matter what we can just

1622
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:18,208
Put a pin in it with a

1623
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:21,280
Champs bigotry

1624
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,048
Like

1625
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,608
Is no leg to stand on

1626
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,376
In terms of

1627
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:28,192
Not harboring white nationalist opinion

1628
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,008
Pretending that he doesn't

1629
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:31,776
No

1630
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,872
Driving

1631
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:38,688
The guests that he has on

1632
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,832
Commercial

1633
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,648
God you have curated

1634
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,928
You bring me up

1635
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:52,256
And then down

1636
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:56,864
So

1637
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:01,984
If this is from a commercial where he reads reviews

1638
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,264
Of the product

1639
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,080
Alright in the website

1640
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:10,944
I want to I want to throw something everytime I hear this place like three times per episode

1641
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,992
At this this little snippet

1642
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,016
Is just like

1643
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,576
F*** you Alex go f*** yourself

1644
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,648
Was Silver Bullet the highest quality

1645
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:22,464
30 parts per million colloidal silver out there

1646
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:39,104
Elizabeth

1647
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,944
Every time he does that

1648
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,600
What a dick

1649
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:54,720
What a f****** a******

1650
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,256
It's so weird how it's

1651
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,536
Do heat pumps

1652
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,328
In-and-out of self-awareness

1653
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:02,144
Like he's the leader

1654
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,680
See I feel like though he

1655
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,472
Asked you on some level.

1656
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,032
When he says that he's doing

1657
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:11,360
He's doing. I'm not rushing cuz this is 1takejay

1658
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:15,712
Okay he doesn't have time to record this

1659
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:19,040
Glass door baby

1660
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,576
So now it's back

1661
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,856
To this South

1662
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:26,976
Jordan

1663
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:29,792
You might think

1664
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:38,240
This is so true

1665
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:44,640
This is so hard for me because I just don't know what's coming this is very hard for me here's the problem

1666
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:47,456
You've built this up so much I almost

1667
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,248
Have to not get angry and

1668
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:52,320
Response to that

1669
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:55,904
This Village is going to battle for his broken

1670
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,440
In terms of this part

1671
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,256
There's something else to make you mad later

1672
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,560
But in terms of the South African stuff

1673
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,352
Yeah I think we're in the clear

1674
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,400
Hey now we just talk

1675
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,728
Pronounce like that

1676
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,920
I don't care to respect them either quite frankly

1677
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,832
Are based on

1678
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,136
I don't know

1679
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,928
Misinterpreted history

1680
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,232
You might think that they're based on

1681
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,280
Pure racial hatred

1682
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,072
You might think

1683
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,376
That they're based on any number of things

1684
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:43,264
You could never guess what they're based on

1685
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:47,872
We hope to a series of of prophecies that said this

1686
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:52,224
The prophecies given a hundred years ago we looked at a time

1687
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,016
When a man with a price

1688
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,416
Will be in power in the United States

1689
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:03,488
The power

1690
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,048
Man

1691
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:06,816
End

1692
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:16,800
Ancient culture and

1693
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,792
Who is Buddha

1694
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,584
To be fair Simon roaches not in

1695
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,608
Charge of the group

1696
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,144
Charge of the group

1697
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,960
Who wrote the prophecy

1698
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:48,032
And why doesn't he have all of our money

1699
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,568
Okay that is

1700
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,592
Venice Beach

1701
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,616
Most

1702
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:55,456
Prophecy I have ever heard in my entire life

1703
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,504
This guy's name is Nicholas

1704
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,064
Peter Johannes

1705
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,088
Did ramsburg

1706
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,112
Also known as

1707
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,136
Beginner

1708
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,160
Van rensburg

1709
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,440
Which Theory

1710
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:11,072
Let me give you the block

1711
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,376
Dan

1712
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,424
Do not ruin this for me

1713
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,704
Batman

1714
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,496
Is unequivocally a genius

1715
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,032
If you wrote that profit

1716
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,312
That is

1717
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:27,712
The most brilliant thing anyone has ever done I believe in Clairvoyance right now dance

1718
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:30,016
Book of his prophecy

1719
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:37,952
Are you still at when was when did he live yeah he died

1720
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:44,352
26 and he still writing books to Prattville were still writing books probably someone collected something or other

1721
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:46,912
I believe in this

1722
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:49,216
I can't find that proper

1723
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:02,272
When a man with the head

1724
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,296
That looks like a wig

1725
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,600
He takes over for a black

1726
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:09,696
I will give you 10 years one of his 1916 August 19th

1727
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,488
60 years one of his prophecy

1728
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:14,304
I see a terrified Woman in Black

1729
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,096
And the interpretation of that is

1730
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,632
The death and destruction of communism

1731
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,984
Level of Prophecy

1732
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,872
It's that much of a stretch

1733
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,920
Yeah

1734
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:34,528
If you got the dude with a wig

1735
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:36,576
I can't find that

1736
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:37,600
Let me believe

1737
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:39,136
I don't believe in ghosts

1738
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,416
I don't believe in God

1739
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,696
I want to believe

1740
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:44,256
In this almost certainly racist by Algarve

1741
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:54,240
He was a South African guy

1742
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:59,104
He was involved in the Boer War

1743
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:03,200
He was on the right side

1744
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:08,576
I think so but you was sort of not he was not a good soldier and he had to

1745
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:10,624
Visions and so you got sent home

1746
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,184
And then he came back to try and warn people

1747
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,256
Any games of a reputation for being right

1748
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:19,072
He had some hunches about military stuff

1749
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:22,144
And ended up being right about some stuff

1750
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:22,912
Any amount of

1751
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:26,240
Research you could you could

1752
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:29,056
You could certainly

1753
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:33,408
I don't want to get too into his

1754
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,944
His whole history because it

1755
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,760
There's not a ton of information that I can find

1756
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,320
It's all

1757
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,856
It's all cockamamie bulshit

1758
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:42,880
It's all just like

1759
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:44,160
If you're say

1760
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:46,464
From the people who want to support him

1761
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,488
But like

1762
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:54,144
We know again that replacing the black man

1763
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:54,912
Like a wig

1764
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,216
For a black man

1765
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,008
I cannot find that prophecy

1766
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,312
But also my Afrikaner accent

1767
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,104
So here's our

1768
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:04,640
Thing

1769
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,432
Is interesting

1770
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,200
Throughout

1771
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,224
Most of

1772
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:08,992
His prophecies

1773
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,528
Just real quick

1774
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,576
The way to an Afrikaner accent

1775
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,856
Just a flick

1776
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:15,392
Play do you have to do

1777
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,672
You got it

1778
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:19,232
Okay

1779
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,512
I got a new year

1780
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:24,352
You liking Alex Jones of impression

1781
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,936
So this guy was

1782
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,960
An African

1783
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,776
He died in 1920

1784
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,080
He was making predictions

1785
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,360
Threw up to his death

1786
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:38,176
What are the pretty consistent threads

1787
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,968
Throughout a lot of his prophecy

1788
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:41,504
What about

1789
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,272
Germany

1790
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:45,856
I mean

1791
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:50,208
In a positive light

1792
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,512
As a good thing yes

1793
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,792
Not just like a

1794
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:56,096
Hey these white dudes are going to f****** rise

1795
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:58,912
No no no like a very positive

1796
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,240
No

1797
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,080
The interpretation

1798
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:10,176
The interpretations given of a lot of it is that like the US and Germany will have to be on

1799
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,968
Same side in World War

1800
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,528
That's a way of getting around the idea that it had everything

1801
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,296
World War

1802
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:19,904
But you saw there at the end

1803
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,928
Basic research

1804
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:24,768
You could have expected that the us would have joined the

1805
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,816
Would have joined Germany in World

1806
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:30,400
It is kind of surprising if you look at the United

1807
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:31,936
History

1808
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,960
To see us

1809
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:35,008
The right side

1810
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,824
So this guy named Gustav Mueller

1811
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:43,200
He was a guy who was in the the service they have in South Africa

1812
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
As it were

1813
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,784
Back in the back in the day

1814
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,552
Houston

1815
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,088
Hugo who started

1816
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,160
Based on a lot of the prophecy

1817
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,184
Please of this

1818
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,976
Sinar darensburg

1819
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,560
He started this

1820
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,864
Extremist religious group called

1821
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,144
How do you pronounce

1822
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,168
Die in German

1823
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,496
Btd3 Lambert

1824
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,336
You started that as a

1825
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,128
Paramilitary

1826
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,664
Non

1827
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,944
Connected to a state

1828
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:17,760
Action Group

1829
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:18,528
Protect White

1830
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,064
People in

1831
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,600
Faced

1832
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,160
Prophecies

1833
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,440
From this guy

1834
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
Based on

1835
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,232
Prophecy

1836
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,512
And now

1837
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:34,912
Their representative who has spent a lot of time contacting alt-right figures in United States

1838
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:37,728
Purposes is it Gaston Alex Jones Show

1839
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:39,008
This is crazy

1840
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:41,312
Gustav Mueller

1841
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:45,408
You know there's a part of me that's always jealous

1842
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,200
Like imagine

1843
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,528
Who would join a group

1844
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,368
See now this is where this where might sort of

1845
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,184
Dysfunction comes into play I thought you were jealous of me getting to the

1846
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,464
Discover these things

1847
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:05,376
Oh my God

1848
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:06,400
Where this is

1849
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:10,496
Not anywhere nearby I want to talk to you about Gustav Mueller

1850
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:17,408
I would never want to say I found an article from South African newspaper

1851
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,944
Let me tell you something about

1852
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,480
Hats

1853
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,248
Good idea

1854
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:25,088
In January September

1855
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,112
2008

1856
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,648
I'm sorry January 2008

1857
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,928
Using courts

1858
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,976
Laredo's

1859
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,120
Mueller was arrested on December 13th 2007 at a caravan Park in mosul Bay

1860
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,168
You been on the run from police for being in

1861
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,216
In possession of an illegal submachine gun

1862
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,008
His co-accused

1863
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,288
Hank Duprees

1864
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:48,896
Are currently held on respect is bales

1865
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:53,248
Mueller has been remanded in custody until January 21st or formal bail application

1866
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,040
The Swede Landers shocked

1867
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:57,600
The public notice

1868
01:36:57,856 --> 01:37:00,416
Behind the Nelson Mandela hoax emails

1869
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:02,464
Feverishly circulated on the internet

1870
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Do you know this song

1871
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,120
A bunch of emails

1872
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,400
That were a hoax

1873
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:13,984
That went around purporting to be from Nelson Mandela's Widow

1874
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:16,288
She had a large inheritance

1875
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,824
But you needed to get out of the country

1876
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,104
It was the Nigerian

1877
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,664
The Swede Landers did that

1878
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,456
But just with Nelson Mandela

1879
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,480
Really

1880
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,536
Why are idiots

1881
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:43,936
So much better

1882
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:50,848
They were tricked by black people that's bad

1883
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,920
God District

1884
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:58,528
And that is so insane like I don't understand I just don't get it this is

1885
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,856
There's so many problems with this

1886
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:04,160
And what genocide fears are

1887
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:08,512
I mean through the most important there they're the most

1888
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:14,144
Evil the only real

1889
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,168
I don't know what to tell you

1890
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,192
Somehow

1891
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:20,800
I was about to say that's the least dumb one as if being afraid of white genocide

1892
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:21,568
Is the least

1893
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,336
Dumb of those

1894
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,896
It's far more reasonable

1895
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,224
It's Farm

1896
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,296
Yeah and the chat room is about to

1897
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,600
It's far more reasonable to

1898
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:35,392
To follow somebody based on profit

1899
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:37,696
Opposite than it is to believe that white genocide

1900
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,256
When the two come together

1901
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:46,912
Chocolate and peanut butter baby

1902
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,312
And so he tells him more about the prophecy

1903
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,128
Find a prophecy with the wig

1904
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:58,944
In this again I agree with Alex

1905
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:04,832
Alex takes a turn in this next clip

1906
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:16,608
Even better I don't I don't think it's real

1907
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:19,424
Further when he elaborates on he just repeats

1908
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,216
There's nothing new in it

1909
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,264
Interesting

1910
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,032
Prophesied

1911
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:25,056
Is a little bit self serve

1912
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,016
The God put out the

1913
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,296
Personally

1914
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,856
Deals like this

1915
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:41,440
I've had experiences

1916
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:56,544
We talked about this before

1917
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,104
That's not

1918
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,688
Radio show it is like

1919
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,480
That's great prophecy

1920
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,016
Let me tell you about them

1921
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,808
It's fantastic

1922
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:11,648
Specific about

1923
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,672
F******

1924
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:13,440
Course not

1925
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,976
But man oh man

1926
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:19,840
So we've now reached the end of the Swede Lander portion of the show

1927
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:22,912
On the show

1928
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,496
And it's generally someone who don't like to talk

1929
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,080
No fun

1930
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:40,320
Essentially a cult and there are support groups

1931
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,600
The people who is I had

1932
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
Free of it

1933
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,488
Encourages people to break ties with people

1934
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,328
Who are ride abusive

1935
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:54,912
Is Scientologist

1936
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:01,824
Is it worth you also as we played in the past that clip where he

1937
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,360
He says that women were

1938
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,896
To blame for Elliot Rodgers

1939
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,176
Attack

1940
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:08,736
His shooting spree because they didn't f*** him

1941
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:13,088
Alexa Rivera

1942
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,368
Knew I was born

1943
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:17,440
Stefan molyneux told them

1944
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:20,000
Well well after I was born

1945
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,048
Because they cut off all contact

1946
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:25,376
When my family is in there

1947
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:29,984
Nobody knew me and my family knew that I was even there

1948
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,312
Yeah this is going to get home

1949
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,336
Yet again

1950
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,104
So

1951
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,384
He has

1952
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,664
Stefan molyneux on

1953
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,944
To talk about

1954
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,480
Downloadable

1955
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:45,600
We're already coming in at about an hour 40

1956
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,624
And Michelle

1957
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:52,512
We don't usually our lives are shorter than our

1958
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,792
Specific time to get in

1959
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,560
All the

1960
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,328
Stuff right

1961
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,352
Lancaster

1962
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,144
Talk to f****** mile-a-minute

1963
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:58,912
Either he's a piece

1964
01:41:59,168 --> 01:41:59,680
The garbage

1965
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,984
Here he says something that I

1966
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,264
I think is really scary

1967
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:06,592
I kind of agree with but

1968
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:09,664
If you understand the kind of code

1969
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,248
They have missed

1970
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:14,784
The opportunity to crush

1971
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:20,672
You know you've been doing this longer than I have I've been doing it about 11

1972
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,328
But it's too late

1973
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:32,448
We have become too big

1974
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:34,240
Freedom lovers who is supporting each other

1975
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:37,568
Now if they try and smack people

1976
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,872
The profile

1977
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:44,224
Virus by friends

1978
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,504
B contains

1979
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,856
Please do not

1980
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,912
The Overton window

1981
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:07,776
Has gone so far now that was impossible before has become commonplace now

1982
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:10,848
What was Radical

1983
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:14,944
Context

1984
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,224
What are you talkin about

1985
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,040
Window moving that far

1986
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:21,088
It means just talkin about

1987
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,368
White National

1988
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:24,160
Disagree with

1989
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,440
What do you mean

1990
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:27,232
I mean

1991
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:29,280
Like the idea that

1992
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:34,144
Or that this is

1993
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:38,240
I just know I think in this to the extent it is now

1994
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,264
I just

1995
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,080
I don't think that years ago

1996
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,872
You could have Network

1997
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,920
Full of mainstream

1998
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:46,688
People

1999
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,736
Making these sorts of Art

2000
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:52,064
I just scream okay please make your case

2001
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,392
Okay I think the biggest

2002
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,208
I think what you're I thought you were

2003
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:58,976
Staking

2004
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,256
Is that

2005
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,304
Vista

2006
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,352
Mainstream

2007
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,704
I think one of the big issues that

2008
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,728
People are

2009
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:10,752
Discovering

2010
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:11,776
Is that

2011
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,568
One of the

2012
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:15,616
Problems with white Nationals

2013
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,408
Is that for so long

2014
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,944
It was assumed

2015
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:24,576
It wasn't it wasn't something that was publicized or talked about because everybody

2016
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:26,112
Assumed

2017
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,928
Because it was such a normal thing to be

2018
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,696
Like

2019
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:32,768
Nationalism

2020
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:34,048
Soupremacy

2021
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,328
I disagree

2022
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:38,656
I disagree

2023
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,680
Give me a deck

2024
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:42,496
In American history

2025
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,264
Give me a decade

2026
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,288
1850s

2027
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,056
Alright

2028
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:47,104
White nationalism brain-to-brain

2029
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,128
Scientific control

2030
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:52,736
I mean what do you think is the most

2031
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:53,760
Recent decade

2032
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,296
White nationalism

2033
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,320
Wasn't means

2034
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:58,624
I don't I don't disagree.

2035
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,928
To some extent with what you're saying but I

2036
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,696
Degree in the

2037
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:02,720
That

2038
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:05,024
These ideas were

2039
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,560
Okay too

2040
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:09,376
Make money off of it speak out on

2041
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:11,424
Platforms that reach millions of people

2042
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,472
Okay I mean maybe

2043
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:16,800
Maybe the millions of people less than the mess

2044
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:23,200
Stefan molyneux in Alex Jones would not be allowed on television

2045
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:25,248
Or in the present

2046
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,296
Because of public diesel

2047
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:28,064
Mtstandard

2048
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,136
That's why they've created their own places there

2049
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,672
Weird corners of the internet

2050
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:35,488
Supremacist and white nationalist

2051
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,280
And have built up their fan base

2052
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,048
The Civic Center

2053
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:43,424
I'm at what I'm talking about

2054
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:45,216
Walter Cronkite was a

2055
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,264
The secret white nationalist

2056
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:54,688
One of the big problems

2057
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:55,712
That I have with

2058
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:57,760
The way that we are

2059
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,064
Maybe the way that the media is

2060
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:00,832
Covering it now

2061
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,624
Is the idea that this

2062
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,672
Explosive

2063
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:08,768
New issue this is the exact

2064
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,792
Percentage of

2065
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,096
Patient that has always been

2066
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:14,912
In fact I would say this is a lower percentage

2067
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,680
Which of the

2068
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,448
That is white

2069
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,728
Said it was

2070
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,544
Staples

2071
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,824
Just so much louder in

2072
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:22,848
Signal is so much

2073
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,872
Amplified

2074
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:24,640
Because of the

2075
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,688
Not because of

2076
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,736
Greater

2077
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:29,760
Number of

2078
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,528
The population

2079
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,600
Experiencing or or having

2080
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,928
Let's put a pin in that for a second

2081
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:42,560
What I would like two more respond to and what I when I said that I kind of agree with what he saying

2082
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:46,400
No I understand

2083
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:48,960
What it really got to me

2084
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:50,240
In that rain

2085
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:51,008
What is

2086
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,288
The freedom virus

2087
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,824
Is gone airborne

2088
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,872
Write any white nationalist viruses

2089
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,920
You know because I always do

2090
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:00,736
Conceived of this globalist idea is kind of a brain

2091
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,296
The idea of the globalist which

2092
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,320
Is just antiques

2093
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,112
He's a brain

2094
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:08,928
The kitchen to you and you start to interpret the

2095
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,952
Entire world

2096
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:10,976
Through this prism

2097
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,768
And that's why you can think that the

2098
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:13,536
The British

2099
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:19,936
We're in charge of the entire world Colonial in 1850 when that's not the reality at all

2100
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:20,704
Curly they were

2101
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,776
Or whatever any number of examples to Alex Jones

2102
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,568
Rose Colored Glasses

2103
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,872
You can pretend

2104
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:32,992
Visit earlier in the episode you can just create an entire new narrative for him

2105
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:35,040
Raised on what the globalist

2106
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,064
Berkeley doing right

2107
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,856
And to that extent

2108
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:39,392
I believe Stefan molyneux

2109
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,160
Correct

2110
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,720
Right get his version of

2111
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,256
Freedom lover

2112
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:45,792
Is one who believes

2113
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:46,816
In archaic

2114
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:47,840
Somatic beliefs

2115
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:49,888
Couched in an idea of the globalist

2116
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:51,936
Yeah

2117
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:53,216
Tip to ortley ca

2118
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,264
When he's on Alex's

2119
01:47:56,544 --> 01:48:00,384
Anarcho-capitalist

2120
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,432
As we have gone

2121
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,456
Through over and over

2122
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:05,248
Regardless of whether or not that is

2123
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,576
Central or

2124
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,624
Specific to your otherwise

2125
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,160
If you go on Alex

2126
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:15,488
You disagree with him and say the show

2127
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,512
To hear in order to get

2128
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
Your

2129
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:19,328
Perspective

2130
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:26,240
I'm not giving him any credit cuz I don't

2131
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:27,520
Tufted attic

2132
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,312
Are you don't really buy

2133
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:35,456
But he's a bigot he wants to get his voice

2134
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:41,600
94

2135
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:42,624
Not long ago

2136
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,416
When apartheid end

2137
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:48,256
There was a huge population in the United States who is like

2138
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,280
That is

2139
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,048
Wrong

2140
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,864
Population of the United

2141
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,424
And thought

2142
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,192
Against

2143
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,216
It was the only way

2144
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:58,240
To contain

2145
01:48:59,008 --> 01:48:59,776
Control black

2146
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:00,800
Peoples

2147
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:01,824
Aaron's urges

2148
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:05,152
As if that was

2149
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:10,784
Implicit in Alex's

2150
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,576
What's really new

2151
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,624
Is the idea that there are so many

2152
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:15,648
People who are

2153
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:18,208
To me that's what I find

2154
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,488
NBA news

2155
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:20,256
Development

2156
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,888
Because because and that's and that's part of the rewriting

2157
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:26,656
The American

2158
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:27,424
Legend

2159
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,960
Is the idea that every time

2160
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:29,728
Time we go back to

2161
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,496
History

2162
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,520
We rewrite

2163
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,288
How it is

2164
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,312
We thought most

2165
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:35,616
People in

2166
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:38,176
The United States now imagine them

2167
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:40,224
Themselves were they in the 60

2168
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,248
These they would have supported

2169
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,576
And you have to go back and remember

2170
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:47,904
That doll model percent

2171
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,672
30 /

2172
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:52,256
So to me the newest idea

2173
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:54,304
Is that people are on the side of

2174
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,632
You're wrong

2175
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:02,240
It's just that their boys allowed because of

2176
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,080
Response to the

2177
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,664
Exact you have more people were shocked

2178
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,688
And they realized

2179
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,968
This has been here all along

2180
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:13,248
Right it's like

2181
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:15,552
Tearing open your wall and finding out there like

2182
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:18,624
Is mold a male can I get

2183
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:19,904
When you pull that Rocco

2184
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:23,232
Yeah and that's what I think that's what we're really doing

2185
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,512
And that's why this

2186
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:26,048
Like

2187
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:28,096
There's an argument to be made

2188
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:31,168
That I don't necessarily agree with but

2189
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:32,192
It is that

2190
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,472
Wendy

2191
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,496
People do come

2192
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:36,032
Because their signal is

2193
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,312
So many

2194
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,080
People

2195
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,104
Examined

2196
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,128
Themselves and go

2197
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,152
That is raw

2198
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,736
So if you are going to say you know is it a

2199
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:47,808
I'm not going to argue that it's a good thing

2200
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:49,600
But their voices are so loud right

2201
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:53,952
But it is something that has made a lot of people who otherwise would have

2202
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,232
Have assumed their race

2203
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:57,536
Actually

2204
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,560
Examine that there

2205
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
Is not okay

2206
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,376
Because they see these f****** assholes

2207
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:03,936
There's there's there's no

2208
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:06,752
But also I think the other thing that I

2209
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:07,520
Stefan molyneux

2210
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,592
What about is the idea that there's too many interconnected

2211
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:11,360
Did networks now

2212
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:13,408
Of these people who are self-aware

2213
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,528
If you know someone were to attack

2214
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:21,600
Spawn molyneux Alex Wood

2215
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,648
Sobia co-defendants

2216
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:25,184
Rebel media

2217
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,208
If he still even exist

2218
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:27,744
Gavin McInnes

2219
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,328
Yeah people would come

2220
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:32,352
With their

2221
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:34,144
Social media following

2222
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,936
And try and make it the biggest

2223
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:36,960
Story in the world

2224
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:41,312
Well in a way that if they weren't a team altogether

2225
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:44,896
It wouldn't work continue my metaphor

2226
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:45,664
In this

2227
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,432
Disregard when you

2228
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,456
You pull up that rock

2229
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:48,736
All the bugs don't

2230
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:49,504
Scatter

2231
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,272
They're all

2232
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,808
Connected and the Reddit

2233
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:52,576
Fight you

2234
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,368
The Rat King

2235
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,160
We have discovered we have

2236
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:58,464
Discovered a nest of rats

2237
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:00,256
Cooking unified witch

2238
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:01,280
Terrified

2239
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,608
Bonbon

2240
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,888
But also

2241
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,192
There's one last clip that I I told

2242
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,848
It'll be fun to make fun of him

2243
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:21,504
So the most important thing I think of this area Alex is something called the perreito

2244
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,856
Principle which everyone needs to become familiar with

2245
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:27,136
The square root

2246
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:30,208
Of the number

2247
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:34,304
People free people are producing half the value

2248
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:38,400
Right if you have 100 people 10 people

2249
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:40,960
Juicing

2250
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:42,496
If you have a company

2251
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,288
I want to stop already

2252
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:47,616
The Pareto Principle is based on the idea that

2253
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:50,176
Any rule where 80% of your outcome

2254
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,968
Output

2255
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:52,992
20% of your

2256
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
Input

2257
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:56,064
It was Italy

2258
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:59,136
Realize that 80%

2259
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:01,440
Other people

2260
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:06,048
We came up with this observation universalized it

2261
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:07,072
In a very

2262
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:11,680
Add square roots

2263
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:12,704
Hugo

2264
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,984
F****** dumb

2265
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:18,080
Well but even his numbers are wrong he's telling

2266
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:19,360
Familiar with him

2267
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,688
Smart people start to leave for whatever reason

2268
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:28,064
Smartest people leave it means that the company productivity goes down ramp

2269
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:30,880
9-ranked

2270
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:41,376
Productivity is gone

2271
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:44,448
Western Civilization

2272
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:45,472
On the brain

2273
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:48,032
Thousand people

2274
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,568
Maybe too fast

2275
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:55,712
Scientific

2276
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:08,512
Machine

2277
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:12,608
Then if the top 1% of smart people from third world end

2278
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:22,592
The first one

2279
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:28,480
With a complete disaster and everyone migrating to Europe the destruction

2280
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,808
Could not resist the temptation

2281
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:39,488
Absolutely beautiful

2282
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:41,280
Absolutely beautifully said

2283
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,816
Alex Azar

2284
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:46,144
I mean it's fitting that he ends it with

2285
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:47,680
Ideas about white boy

2286
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:54,080
Just washed over in Rambo Smith

2287
01:54:54,336 --> 01:55:00,480
Representing the Pareto Principle in order to apply it to this weird

2288
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:02,016
Randy and vision of

2289
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:05,088
And if it looks

2290
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:05,856
Clear about this

2291
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,648
This idea that this

2292
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:11,232
Hundred people at this company are responsible for

2293
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:14,816
Half of the productivity is a cockamamie nonsense idea

2294
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:19,424
Be at that idea if you want to apply it on a macro scale to civilization that like

2295
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:22,752
Only these two thousand people are really responsible for the productivity

2296
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:28,640
No it's not they're the ones who were running the system wherein everyone is working super hard for nothing

2297
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:34,016
Yeah do you want to do get one of those f****** people through what really happened

2298
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,296
What really happened

2299
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:39,648
Is you find out

2300
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,416
Connecticut

2301
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,184
Meme

2302
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:47,840
Right they are worthless this is what happened

2303
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:48,608
Easiest

2304
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:51,424
Examples for that are the NBA's

2305
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:54,240
Imagine that

2306
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:57,568
Because they control the leaf if the players actually have a

2307
01:55:57,824 --> 01:55:58,592
Strong union

2308
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:00,128
All the sudden you find out

2309
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:03,200
But we don't actually need those

2310
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:07,808
No we're the ones who provide revenue and

2311
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,856
Blood off

2312
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:13,440
If you want to go by

2313
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:15,488
And in that example

2314
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:21,376
80% is creating 80% of the productivity of the basketball team

2315
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:28,544
80% is creating 100% of the value not really because they're all the people who are like you know

2316
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,568
Maintaining the court

2317
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:30,336
And running

2318
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:36,736
Concession

2319
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,784
Calculus

2320
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:39,808
Bring them in with

2321
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:40,576
The player

2322
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:46,976
Like that they would think about biggest lake

2323
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:52,608
Specialist unit again to a I feel like we should have a universal

2324
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,888
Union at this point

2325
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:55,680
I don't give a f*** about Governor

2326
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:59,264
Commence I think we workers

2327
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,288
Like outside

2328
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:02,080
Imagine

2329
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:06,688
Collectively bargain with the rich

2330
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:09,504
Like that's ostensibly

2331
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,528
It's supposed to

2332
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:11,296
Debate

2333
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:12,320
It's supposed to be

2334
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:14,624
Large

2335
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:17,440
Collectively bargaining with the rich

2336
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:19,744
With what

2337
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,024
You would call the ruling

2338
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:25,120
Out of the world today

2339
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:27,424
He's some sort of

2340
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:29,984
You know connection between

2341
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:33,056
Them supporting each other much in the same way

2342
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:40,480
Total gym membership membership

2343
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:41,504
Can you stop

2344
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:46,112
No but I did that that's true but at the same time there are connections being made

2345
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,648
Between various Union

2346
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:54,048
Supporting each other the most recent the most recent things that I read about the AFL-CIO

2347
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,328
Supposed to be

2348
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:57,120
Is that everyone

2349
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:58,144
Confused

2350
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,168
Sty Union member

2351
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:02,752
Even as they don't realize that they're not doing a

2352
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:03,520
Outreach

2353
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:07,104
And that the boy from the rich and the big issue

2354
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,128
Within those

2355
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:09,152
Often

2356
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,504
Job-specific

2357
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:14,784
Like

2358
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,552
Pipefitters

2359
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,600
Should strike

2360
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:18,624
If

2361
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:20,928
Mason

2362
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:22,720
I mean like bricklayer

2363
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:27,840
No I know

2364
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:30,656
Like if the car manufacturers

2365
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:31,936
Strikes

2366
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:32,704
Pipefitters

2367
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,496
And all the sudden

2368
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,032
See a lot of

2369
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:37,824
Like one of the

2370
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:39,616
Is that as

2371
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:40,384
Union Spa

2372
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:41,664
Wages for

2373
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:42,944
And nobody

2374
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:49,344
F****** talks about that one because the talking point is so much

2375
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,368
Easier that you have to

2376
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:54,464
All that stuff which is right

2377
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,000
Concerned that people have

2378
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:56,768
Makes

2379
01:58:57,024 --> 01:59:00,096
Feel like I will make less money not looking at the longer

2380
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:04,448
Every every right-to-work law has led

2381
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,472
To lower wages

2382
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:07,520
In the Union

2383
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:08,544
Indian

2384
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,336
If

2385
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,360
Pictures make more money

2386
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:12,640
You will win

2387
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,432
That is

2388
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,456
Always the case

2389
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,480
Trickle around

2390
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:21,088
Exactly when you go through town is

2391
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:21,856
Ineffective when

2392
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,392
You go bottom up all the sudden

2393
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:24,416
People starts at

2394
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,696
Wealth

2395
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:26,464
Is no longer

2396
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:31,840
The end of this episodes

2397
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:32,864
Stefan molyneux sucks

2398
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:36,704
I really think there is a really interesting narrative

2399
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:38,752
Vascepa

2400
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:39,520
Episode accident

2401
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:43,104
That's one of the reasons why I really needed to do the app

2402
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:47,200
Episode even though

2403
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:47,968
Today's

2404
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:57,184
The reason I needed to do it was the idea that like

2405
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,464
Started with this

2406
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:00,000
Weird

2407
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,024
Apologizing

2408
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:01,792
4 Charles Mann

2409
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,072
Kind of

2410
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:03,840
Narrative

2411
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:04,608
When

2412
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,144
The reality is that

2413
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:06,912
If you was

2414
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,704
Someone who maybe wasn't

2415
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:12,032
Entirely motivated by racism but had a bunch of it in

2416
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:15,616
Crazy cult leader

2417
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:23,808
And then later he has this looking South African guy who's afraid of

2418
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:26,112
There's such a weird mirror there

2419
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:28,672
With added looks

2420
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:31,744
Exova

2421
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:32,768
For a black prism

2422
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:37,632
Those two things

2423
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,448
Mega saalam be

2424

RNC

2425
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:45,312
I don't understand why

2426
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:46,336
This show is

2427
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,616
Zip

2428
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:54,016
Badflower show a show quite frankly

2429
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:58,112
Yeah

2430
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:00,672
His bosses

2431
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:03,232
Discover.com

2432
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:08,096
Considering the way that he knows where the growth

2433
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:10,912
Growth that spawned out of that

2434
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:13,216
Ignore 9 million

2435
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:13,984
Are fake

2436
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:17,056
Because it's been such a rough

2437
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:17,824
Road

2438
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,248
Making Union

2439
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,528
Scream through a bit of it

2440
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:28,064
I didn't

2441
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,392
You're going to have to

2442
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:36,512
You promised that later on the episode I would get angry and I did not

2443
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:38,304
Okay I got

2444
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:43,680
Angry but not all the way

2445
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:44,448
2 minutes

2446
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:45,216
That's true

2447
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:48,288
But anyway I feel better

2448
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:05,184
