1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Beverages and talk little bit by Alex Jones

3
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
Yes sir

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,200
How's it going

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,248
Car accident

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:26,112
Quite a while

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,512
Is always the case whenever I play

8
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:36,096
My house I know you're so you're so into building your house

9
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,376
And absolutely not in

10
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Building

11
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,752
I'm not really so much maybe it is

12
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,824
I'm not so into a lot of the you like

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,688
The quest stuff of the kind of boring ultimately leads

14
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,968
Do you like the end of

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,784
You do X Y and Z test

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,576
That story's done

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
Where is the Biltmore House

18
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,136
Keep tweaking things

19
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,696
I don't know

20
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know

21
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,072
Let's say I'm playing the game wrong if you want

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,472
Do you know who is building our house special thank you

23
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
Start things off by

24
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
A little bit we appreciate it

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,040
Kyle you are now a technocrat

26
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,952
Get Mom and tell her you're brilliant someone sodomites Italy

27
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,728
I don't want

28
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
Thank you so much guile appreciate it very much

29
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,200
With the team

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,928
Thank you very much

31
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,000
You coming around the corner

32
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:13,376
And because we get to keep the

33
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Who's just joined up with

34
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,472
We thank you so much Eric you are now Apollo

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,128
I'm a policy wonk thank you Eric

36
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Appreciate

37
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,552
All of you oh so very much go to our website

38
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,648
We would appreciate it very much and people are coming on board

39
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
We are

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
Do I have to announce that we are very close to reaching our goal

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
Another documentary

42
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
On what documentary we're going to break down

43
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,640
It looks like it's going to be the Obama

44
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Ono

45
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,296
I want to do that and I'll say one of the reasons why is that there are

46
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,368
Such good resources online that already debunked

47
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,208
So for me it would be nearly as much digging I could use

48
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
Use those resources

49
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,328
And it wouldn't be as much of an exercise of should I found

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
Right on satisfy sources don't have anybody screaming and making

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Dick jokes in the back

52
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
Is police

53
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
State for the rise of

54
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
FEMA

55
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:38,368
The name of it or was there police 8133

56
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,160
First was actually police state 2000

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
I don't know what the subtitle that one was

58
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:49,120
3 is total enslavement

59
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,520
Total enslavement

60
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
Documentary

61
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
That I think might be fun to do

62
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,504
It's called strategic relocation

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
All about like bugging out

64
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:20,607
Bunker in the middle of nowhere having a strategy for relocation at work

65
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
A lot of fun problem

66
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
Educate us a lot

67
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,687
Just a really long interview with Joel skousen

68
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
One of Alex's

69
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Yeah it's so

70
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
It would be unsatisfying on that level but I think

71
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Hot Topic

72
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:48,255
It would be maybe more interesting than a lot of the other stuff that kind of overlaps the stuff we talked about all the time

73
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,911
Be able to do in about

74
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:59,775
His uncle

75
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,103
Cleon W Cleon skousen

76
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:09,503
Number of books that are really

77
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
Influential in the world

78
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:17,695
John Birch Society Robert Barron in the 1910s you might as well like the naked tap

79
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
The naked communist

80
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
Books that are really really inspiration

81
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
Channel 4 Alex

82
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
His world

83
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
A little bit

84
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,727
It might be that I'm kind of like

85
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
I think

86
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,871
Are worth it and I don't want to do f****** loose change Alex didn't even direct that

87
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
Is produced

88
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,455
I don't want to do like 911 roads

89
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
The Tyranny because I'd we're just going to

90
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
I don't want to talk about 9/11

91
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,415
I don't

92
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
It is

93
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,303
It's been long enough where we can make eight hours of 9/11 jokes

94
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,375
That I have I just

95
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
I think a monochromatic

96
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Episode

97
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,055
Documentary

98
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Long

99
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,663
I don't know how fun that's going to be

100
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:14,271
I think that there's going to be a little bit of like I love steak I don't want that much

101
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
Okay alright

102
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Alright that's

103
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,879
I don't know that's just the feeling I have

104
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:23,743
But voting is open on go home and tell your mother you're brilliant on Facebook

105
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
And so if you want to check that out

106
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
Get your votes

107
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
You can do it

108
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,311
Is we are back in the past

109
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
Yeah I feel like a what happened to us

110
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
The beginning of the week is one of the difficulties

111
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Please of

112
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Present

113
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
And that is the Torso immediate

114
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
Much worse

115
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
Because the things that affect on

116
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
And the things that

117
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
Being a real s*** head about RX

118
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Abusive

119
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
To our present

120
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
In our future

121
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
People we care about

122
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Answer

123
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
It's hard to take an emotional distance

124
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
I think that makes

125
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,735
I'm so it's good to be back in the past

126
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,831
I'm very excited about this today will be going over March 11th

127
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
2009

128
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
I cannot

129
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,535
Tell you how crazy it is that every f****** time I sit down

130
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
Hey listen to a 2009 episode

131
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
I like

132
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,727
Alright I know what's going to happen I listen to the last episode is going to be talking about birds

133
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Blue again

134
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,823
Everytime I f****** surprise

135
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,479
I don't know what's going to happen one day he might be pretending he's going to release the Obama Deception

136
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,111
This is no exception

137
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
I was

138
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Entirely off guard

139
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,511
By what ends up happening on the March 11th and 12th episode

140
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
And here is an out-of-context drop

141
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,143
You sound credible

142
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,983
Yep

143
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,103
It's W shoe on head that you very much

144
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:20,735
Call Eric Alafaya

145
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,575
You sound credible but we are going to have to look at the shoe on head

146
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
Please don't take offense to this Wednesday

147
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
I've been burned by a people silly name

148
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
Frankly I wasn't real

149
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Today

150
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
We going to drop

151
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,727
Police state five back in the habit on feet

152
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,127
Very interesting turn of events

153
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
Today

154
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,759
March 11th

155
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Linear

156
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
That's how we do things

157
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599
Interesting

158
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,903
Alex actually starts the show

159
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
By talking about

160
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
There's something overnight

161
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Before this

162
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
It's very unlike

163
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
Start the show actually talk about

164
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,543
World

165
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
Firearms

166
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,135
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors

167
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,327
Also not the news

168
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,471
Actors are going to try and take our guns away and that's something

169
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
That chimpanzees

170
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
Every Which Way but that's alright

171
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
Are monkeys

172
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:22,335
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors

173
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Because

174
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:29,247
Hugh things immediately after talking about a chimpanzee attacking somebody

175
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,807
Ninety-nine percent of the time chimpanzees attack

176
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,111
People

177
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,671
That's not what he's saying he's talking about shooting

178
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,375
Pictures of it like every chimpanzee when I get to like 8

179
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,519
Put on Prozac

180
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
Prozac

181
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,367
Mass shooting in Alabama last night

182
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
16 in Germany

183
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
We can

184
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
And

185
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
And the media advertising

186
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Is a school

187
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
Dreamworld state

188
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,023
I really don't think that's

189
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,143
That's unfair to

190
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,823
You know we talked about it all the time marginalization and other ring of people who try and get that help with

191
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
Emotional distress

192
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
Mental health issues is just so ugly to look at

193
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,855
Hate to see that sort of rhetoric coming out of a ding dong like Alex

194
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
But

195
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
You know

196
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
Where we have here is Alex jumping

197
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
Leisure these people

198
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
We're on

199
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
SSRI drugs

200
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
And then even in that declaration

201
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
Qualifying it to say I bet they

202
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
Maybe saw psychologist rich

203
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
I mean that's the safest pet in the world

204
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
Is it someone who ends up going on a violent Street probably had some sort of an issue they made of

205
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,551
Help for unsuccessfully

206
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,111
Can help

207
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Right

208
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,207
Even a lot of people who don't get the help they need

209
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
Make effort

210
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
At certain points

211
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,583
If you have somebody who commits a violent crime like that

212
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,911
Almost passed some sort of

213
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,983
Interaction with mental health services

214
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
The night doesn't

215
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,567
Mean that Mental Health Services in anyway

216
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Cuz them

217
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,687
5

218
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
We just want to

219
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Many

220
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,551
Incredibly shotty logical leap City make

221
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
It's going to be a

222
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
It's going to be a mess

223
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,951
Pretty sure if I remember correctly

224
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
Correlation

225
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,375
Causation

226
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
And this

227
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
Hey I know this

228
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,335
I've read the math and I'm 99% correct all the time all the time

229
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
Most of these Mass shooters

230
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
Have eaten

231
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,599
Hold on to that level of Lake Zurich of deductive reasoning

232
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,671
Because it's going to come in real Handy episode

233
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,999
That's sort of real shotty attempted a syllogism

234
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,303
Is going to come into play

235
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,983
Did this sort of rhetoric is especially dangerous because Alex is talking about how these people are mentally ill

236
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
And they're you know they're all wacky

237
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
You know that's

238
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,407
A newbie bad enough he was just trying to other them or create some sort of

239
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,271
Societal Shame about Mental Health on its own

240
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
But the reason

241
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111
Even worse is he says things like this

242
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,463
And they are moving

243
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
Is a mix of good hard-working

244
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:36,799
Mothers also a lot of spoiled rotten

245
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:47,039
We should all have firearms

246
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
I'm going to defend myself by my forefathers

247
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
Numbers up

248
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
Insurance

249
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,991
I don't know car wrecks

250
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,599
Last time I went to the world

251
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,207
Here's the problem with this sort of rhetoric

252
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Drowning

253
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
Here's the problem with this line of thinking

254
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
To go and look into this

255
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
Statistics because bouquet

256
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
All except that he's right about all that

257
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,727
Sure this is a more serious problem

258
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,079
No one has mass drowned schools to children at school

259
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,151
You can't do that you can't mask the kit like

260
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
You don't Outlaw swimming

261
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
Because there's

262
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
It's not an attack

263
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
Swimming isn't an attack

264
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:58,207
Most of the time whenever there's drowning its people who were like cotton to Riptide or something like that

265
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
It's a natural force or whatever

266
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,815
There is a crime being committed

267
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
People in bass shooting

268
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
It doesn't

269
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
Exist generally speaking with drowning

270
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
And a lot of times with car

271
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Just

272
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
But drunk driving is also illegal

273
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,711
What you said but then you said there's no master rounding

274
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:26,367
And I was like flash flood of school I don't know how you

275
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:32,767
You do remember that

276
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
Connected to you and they were like puppets

277
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Kind of

278
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
You get five

279
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,151
So you got

280
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Drowning as well

281
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,991
And you're holding somebody else I think it makes perfect

282
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Hardee's

283
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
Yourself

284
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,767
You can't get you it's tough to get for others to Mastro's

285
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
That's hard to do

286
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
IPhone

287
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
I don't understand

288
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
I think it's just it's like from a cartoon I remember image of the

289
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
Costume or whatever

290
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,087
No I do not drown the puppets are helping you drown

291
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Other people

292
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
You do puppet scan

293
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,703
Marionette technology has not till that part

294
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
Jordan I got to be honest I think you're crazy

295
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,591
Whatever you're imagining

296
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
A nightmarish

297
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,247
Torture device

298
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
So maybe in that scenario could master

299
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Like a school shooter

300
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
That's kind of

301
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
I don't know

302
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:13,119
Whatever you use those are the statistics to minimize the idea of like mass shootings are like

303
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Are you talking about

304
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,959
The limiting access to guns

305
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
People dying drowning

306
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Grounding

307
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
More

308
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,103
Isn't that stupid because one of the one of those things

309
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
You can't do too

310
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
People in a school

311
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,223
Maybe you could

312
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,295
At gunpoint is a school has a pool

313
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,647
You still probably couldn't you could also if you were Poseidon

314
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,303
Yes but if you have magic

315
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,655
That's the scenario wherein you could Mass drowned

316
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:52,031
People 100 times the amount of people died in mass shootings in mathmagic

317
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Right

318
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Everybody

319
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Dinos

320
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,967
It just said nobody's talking about media isn't going to talk about

321
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
When are we going to

322
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
Let me have my bucket

323
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,535
So anyway back into the little bit later and I'll discuss the

324
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,071
Realities of them at that point

325
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
But just for now.

326
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Fagundes

327
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
The past that we were going

328
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,335
Alex did that

329
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
About pocket

330
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687
I'm really single

331
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
As of March 11th

332
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
But

333
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
He's starting to talk about

334
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
The s*** that's going on behind

335
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Infowars

336
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,655
Calling up

337
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:05,247
Harassment because your office physically located

338
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,575
Tell us where your servers are located

339
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,695
You need to send me a subpoena

340
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
I am right now

341
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
That's where you're at

342
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143
Did the more likely scenario that I imagine is

343
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,495
Culligan

344
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
Something

345
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:33,151
2009 you have to know that Alex Jones is the definition of Oppositional defiant

346
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
Unless you walked him

347
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,503
To say that the FBI is calling him

348
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,063
You know you don't f****** call him like that

349
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,391
It and it doesn't serve anybody's best interest except Alex

350
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
So that means

351
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,951
He's making it up or

352
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
He's taking a prank calling for 10

353
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
And this is where he turns it into

354
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:58,239
Fishing line

355
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,943
That's a 98% chance

356
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Okay

357
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,087
Months of Obama being in office

358
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,647
Inaugurated a month-and-a-half before this

359
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,464
He's making it a f****** priority to get

360
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Get on

361
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,120
You better harass Alex Jones and make him scared to put out that documentary that's not going to have any effect on my

362
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,448
Career

363
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
Drawn and and and

364
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
Housing crisis in all of this

365
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
But you know

366
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Who I can't stand right

367
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Yeah

368
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
FBI

369
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Call him up

370
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,112
Angel politely ask for his address

371
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,208
Google

372
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
That's

373
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
Do I find it

374
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
To be the flimsy

375
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,168
To get people more excited about the Obama Deception

376
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,776
Set that earlier episode was like I'm going to release it now

377
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Hey maybe I'll release him

378
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,408
I don't even know if

379
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:16,832
People excited about it now this is the all man

380
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,368
Certificates

381
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,928
It's very crispy marketing

382
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,720
Technique nothing more

383
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,024
Shooting

384
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Alex

385
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
In this clip

386
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
Please start

387
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,168
Play talking about the Alabama shooting

388
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
So gets off track

389
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,264
Haha really fast

390
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
Into

391
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,360
Nobody's talking about that chimpanzee earlier

392
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,664
It might come back up

393
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:48,320
Is obviously you know about Alabama

394
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,656
Assault rifle

395
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
He spared no one not his mother

396
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
Alabama

397
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,792
Coffee County coroner

398
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,608
Preacher said we don't know what triggered it

399
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,592
Real quick he wasn't married and he didn't have a

400
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
And

401
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,808
He threw a fit and killed Mommy

402
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,928
We burn down the house with apples that kill one person

403
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,680
This sort of ranching at Alex's jumping-off Intuit

404
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
Really crazy places

405
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,240
Is his way of not having

406
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
To feel anything

407
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
It's his way of turning this into

408
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
To some sort of

409
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,968
The new world

410
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
Feel something

411
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,904
Well your own head off of things

412
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
So you kill him

413
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
That would be a very different Missy

414
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,288
We are

415
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
Now

416
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
Ripping your face off

417
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,488
Was on a Prozac

418
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,192
Things you don't normally do that

419
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
Someone

420
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
That's one of those things

421
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,176
This is Elementary Alex rambling

422
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
Yeah the place this ends up going like where his mind goes so he doesn't have to talk more about this story that he's already

423
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Pretty clearly misreporting

424
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,672
Like the idea that his wife left him and took the kids

425
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:37,280
He's just making that up that's not that's not part of the story at all he's just

426
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,632
The media tells you to do not blow your head off

427
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,168
Kill himself

428
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
Like the shooter

429
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
To avoid the consequences

430
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Man

431
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
Oh man we get a weird glimpse

432
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
Listen to Alex

433
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,248
And his family history as this clip

434
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
Meander's

435
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:04,928
Monkeys

436
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:11,840
That's a very different Muscle Man

437
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,168
This sucker weighed 200 lb

438
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,520
Thousand pound linebacker

439
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
No linebackers

440
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:36,672
My dad's

441
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
Twice removed Uncle Houston

442
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
W

443
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
13

444
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,704
Ship Chevron world came back

445
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
German depression

446
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,128
Until my dad stories

447
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
Ocean

448
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,816
What's Millwork Suites at Maryland

449
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:20,448
No problem or whatever

450
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
What the hell

451
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:12,160
I don't know

452
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:18,304
Read about that in history book in your life that's an interesting fact

453
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,656
Obviously

454
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,592
King of underground chimpanzee boxing

455
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,272
Texas the Tudors

456
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:43,392
I come from royalty also part of my family

457
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:54,400
The Tudor line I love that how his mind worked at least at this point

458
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,776
I don't really have much more to say about this shooting but man I like talk about that

459
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:05,664
What all right that I was up on all these Prozac drugs

460
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:12,320
He was crazy dude is involved in getting Rodeo dudes the Box

461
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,720
Illegal

462
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
What

463
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:27,936
That is admire the hell out of

464
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:34,080
At the end if he realizes

465
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,640
I need to make this make sense

466
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,832
You don't need Bela karolyi to come pick you up after this one

467
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,952
You're Bela karolyi reference is amazing

468
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,976
That is that is

469
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,048
That is solid this is Alex inspires

470
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,376
Stupidity

471
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,680
He's putting forth great

472
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:06,080
Underground fights with Bela karolyi gymnast

473
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
At the smallest gymnast

474
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,944
To fight each other they put gloves on but they couldn't.

475
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,248
And I don't know if you know this

476
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:17,088
Most gymnast when they get to the age of eight

477
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:23,488
They just can't handle it anymore and they just anytime they see a human being they take it as a threat especially if you smile

478
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,584
Is it really

479
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,728
Challenges

480
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,056
Man this is funny

481
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
Dumb s***

482
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
I love that quote

483
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
I wish I could live inside nightclub

484
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,944
He is like

485
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,856
Whatever whatever you talk about Alex Jones being the biggest monster in the world now

486
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,696
That dude back then but like this is what I mourn the loss of

487
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,816
My uncle was a monkey fire

488
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,216
Spell shootings like

489
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,056
Undermines a lot of like the narratives that he wants one

490
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
Alabama shooting

491
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,968
The shooting was perpetrated by a guy named Michael McLendon was the 29 year-old weigh

492
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,040
Despite what Alex's reporting was not married

493
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
Did not have kids

494
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,648
Are you living at home with his mother difficulty finding work

495
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Do you failed

496
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
Complete basic training

497
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,232
When you tried to enter the services

498
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,024
Found himself in a really bad position

499
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,608
When is Mom

500
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
Killed most of his mom side of the

501
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,008
He ended up doing that and you left a note behind

502
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
Explaining

503
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
His actions

504
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,664
That he would pay for making his mother and him suffer

505
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,736
He went on to write mama was very sick

506
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,552
Had lung cancer I think I put her out of her misery

507
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,136
I'm sorry but mama has suffered enough and so have I

508
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,440
Some of the people who made us suffer will pay

509
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,816
After everything was said and done his mother received an autopsy that did not support his claim that she was sick

510
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,608
And she definitely didn't have cancer

511
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
There in case

512
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,680
He was depressed but no indications

513
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
Receiving

514
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,544
Then what it is is probably just a down-on-his-luck

515
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,568
Very diluted

516
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Leo person

517
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
Who had imagined that his mom was sick

518
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
You wasn't getting

519
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,968
Support you needed from his mom

520
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
Will probably

521
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
You know not happy with

522
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,928
All their positions in life and he decided to A6 blame on his mother's side of the family

523
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,232
Saudi was mercy killing his mom

524
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
Punish them

525
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
For the perceived lack of

526
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Support

527
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
So it

528
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
Just someone

529
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
You know not just

530
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,704
Someone

531
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,080
Alex talked about

532
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,128
Reality

533
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
All of the things that he rails against

534
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,344
Accurate

535
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
Like that

536
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,232
The violence against women in this case is

537
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
Perpetuated under the office

538
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
Episodes of like Mercy

539
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,608
But it is still a violent Act

540
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
His mother

541
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
And towards other

542
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
Members of

543
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
Her side of the family

544
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Still obviously

545
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,568
A crime that has some sort of resentment or anger towards

546
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848
Is Mom

547
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
Diversion of the mess

548
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Violence

549
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,968
Doesn't really work

550
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
Look for Alex's

551
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Alex is just

552
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,904
Using that probably should have been

553
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,232
A bigger story

554
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,792
Now it's interesting because Alex wants to

555
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
Demonize ssris

556
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,376
Desperately

557
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,936
But in this next clip I think you'll see

558
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,496
Then he doesn't understand pharmacology

559
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
At all

560
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,056
And I think he thinks the Prozac

561
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Then it is

562
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Texas Network

563
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,608
Butcher knife

564
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
What

565
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,880
Your

566
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:39,744
San Marcos San Antonio and

567
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,504
Just like a chimpanzee the people's ears what happened

568
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
Both cases

569
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,376
Invocation little guys would just turn the person's face off

570
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,008
You can't use stories about people on PCP to demonize people on Prozac

571
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:27,872
I think Alex thinks they're the same thing

572
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
Maybe

573
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,456
Anytime there's a

574
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
Acronym

575
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:39,648
Yeah remind me of PCP

576
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,304
Again not related to Prozac

577
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,120
No indication that those drug dealers were on Prozac

578
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,680
This has nothing to do with anything he's just trying to

579
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,240
The couple the association in his listeners Minds

580
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,800
The effects of PCP are the same as the effects

581
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
The Prozac

582
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,968
They're trying to give you that cuz I end up like these PCP

583
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,808
My uncle was a monkey fight

584
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:15,488
That's the level of logic is going on here

585
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
Someone being

586
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,304
Cautious about over

587
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
Prescription of

588
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,656
They're very legitimate arguments to make about how they

589
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
You know Farmers a big business

590
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,032
And people get put on drugs a lot of the time that are superfluous.

591
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Weather conditions

592
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,360
The drug reps are often

593
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:37,248
Insidious in there maybe

594
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
People don't need or

595
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
Kind of need but could

596
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
Get similar effect

597
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,928
Through exercise or something like that I understand that

598
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
That conversation

599
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488
Is well worth having

600
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,024
But this one isn't

601
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,864
This one is just an outright demonization of the idea of

602
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
Of getting mental help

603
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,704
The idea that some people

604
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
Do you need

605
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,568
Medication in order to help them live productive

606
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,592
Decent live

607
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,152
And that is not a slight on them or a shame

608
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
And anyway

609
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Is disgusting

610
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,272
No I mean Mighty my very first psychiatrist

611
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,320
Prescribed Abilify

612
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,672
Commercial

613
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
F****** up

614
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,792
That can happen. Blame him or Abilify

615
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:28,448
That's that can happen to anybody people found Abilify being incredibly

616
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,568
It was a very much like

617
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,872
Even while he was

618
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Prescribed

619
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,200
I could actually hear the drug rep

620
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,016
In his ear like the the little demon on his shoulder

621
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
Because it cost $700

622
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
For a month prescription

623
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
So you're like

624
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,928
That's the problem with Abilify

625
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,792
The medication works that is a

626
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:57,376
Runaway Runaway

627
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,912
Runaway

628
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,824
That's what you can talk about if you want to do that there's 100 example of diversion

629
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,408
And then there's the simple benign version of like

630
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,968
You take a medication that doesn't work and got a switch

631
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,272
Family members

632
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,344
Taking things that it like well it worked for the cause

633
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
Like massive weight gain

634
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,536
Drastically affect

635
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,328
Can get to the right place

636
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,400
Decreased sex drive

637
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
Lethargy

638
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
To be on

639
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:37,824
Reason you know all of this stuff I like I tried probably five or six medication

640
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,128
Before I found something that actually work for

641
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
What I need

642
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,712
Very small numbers

643
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
I'm very

644
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
Minut

645
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,320
Portions of the population you can have

646
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Yeah

647
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
And they aren't

648
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,416
Like being on PCP

649
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,440
And it's not

650
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
The same age

651
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,816
You take it you're fine and then one day you have a bad trip on your Prozac or whatever

652
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,888
Incredibly negative reaction

653
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,936
Based on their individual chemistry

654
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
There there

655
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
Do you need

656
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
Fingerprints of our brain

657
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,848
Sometimes don't work with Xbox drug

658
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,152
Demonizing that Drogba

659
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Because of the small amount

660
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,504
Of negative reactions that happen to it is

661
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
Absurd

662
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
Stupid

663
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,672
It is regressive to the point of just

664
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
59

665
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,000
Just go ahead and Sciences

666
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
You might as well

667
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Well

668
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,328
Because magic kills

669
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:36,192
Hundreds of thousands of people a year.

670
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,776
The worst thing that can happen with these drugs is not

671
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:46,176
Hallucinating on the top of your roof

672
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,224
40 year old woman on her roof

673
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,296
The worst thing is you get a rash

674
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,368
I will say that I'm cutting their breasts

675
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,704
Depressed I don't want to say anything

676
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
Like it sounds positive

677
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,288
But the Precision

678
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,080
Required in order to carry out

679
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
A massive

680
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
Mass shooting

681
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
I don't think you could do that

682
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,760
I think you could try and punch your way through a school or something like that

683
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,064
But like you wouldn't have the time

684
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:30,976
You take Pleasant great video game by the way punch your way through school Japanese arcade

685
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,280
Want to punch behind

686
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:39,680
I wanted posters

687
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,960
Montage

688
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:45,056
I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong about that

689
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
Medium media

690
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
It's pretty rage

691
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
Fault

692
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:54,272
There's no idea and I've no interest in finding out what's the lot of episodes of

693
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,320
Cops

694
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,344
The punch through fence

695
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Itsfunneh

696
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,208
That's one of those drugs they like I will never do it

697
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
I will never

698
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
Know what it's like

699
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,048
But I'm very curious what

700
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,608
Feels like in your brain

701
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,448
You know I've done enough substances in my life to know like

702
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,520
Altered States are very different

703
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
How differ

704
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,384
Like who's really drunk I'm like

705
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,712
I kind of know what you're feeling right now

706
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
I can empathize

707
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,528
It away was like

708
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,088
Alright alright

709
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
Titus

710
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:37,280
I do not know why you thought it was a good idea to punch to the only reason that we do really need

711
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,840
Take me to Knollwood

712
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
Gills like

713
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
To take some of the really crazy

714
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
You know I don't know if you could

715
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,776
I don't know if you can recreate

716
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,872
I don't think there's a Safeway to feel this picture

717
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,407
Anyway

718
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,223
Alex

719
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
He's way off on

720
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,063
Everyday

721
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:06,463
Might have a good point about that yet

722
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,047
German shooting

723
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
Surprisingly is also off

724
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:20,287
German six

725
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,383
I'll bet my bottom dollar

726
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,687
This guy was inside

727
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
I think I want to be discovered

728
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:37,183
Services

729
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,719
I would like to take that back

730
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,631
A case after case

731
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,679
After Case has five more

732
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:52,543
Guys shot up a school's name was

733
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,871
Medication

734
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,687
No indication that he was

735
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,455
Confine

736
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
Inpatient treatment

737
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
The condition of him

738
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
Getting out of this house

739
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,303
Yeah you spoke to a therapist a few times in the year before his murders

740
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,143
Is witches therapist towards his parents about

741
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,727
His parents denied the claims and said he never received psychiatric care

742
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,615
Kind of Falls in line with a picture that painted of his parents of being kind of delusional in in denial about

743
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
Their son having

744
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,991
Any sort of default

745
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
Extension of themselves

746
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,551
Like you got bad grades

747
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,111
Was unable to find apprenticeship

748
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
Deep denial about that

749
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,975
He was on a tennis team

750
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:46,559
And people said that he was very difficult to work with

751
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
Hard to be on a team

752
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
In denial about his

753
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,263
His behavioral issues growing up

754
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,335
So there's a pattern that emerges with his life

755
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,639
Any idea that the therapist like I told them

756
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,455
The most I could do League

757
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,295
No one said anything

758
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,903
And he wasn't even in psychiatric care or psychological treatment at all

759
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,207
And also the No.1 with

760
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
You know government intelligence

761
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
Just gave him the gun

762
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Is Dad

763
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,887
20 gun

764
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,727
But you was a good

765
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,823
About the most part he was a part of like a shooting club

766
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,359
Recreational shooting

767
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
His son stole one

768
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
He was

769
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,063
In breach of German laws

770
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
In terms of

771
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
If you own gun

772
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,903
Once you have to properly lock them up

773
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,975
Yeah you didn't lock them up properly

774
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,327
Yeah he had to go to Courtney was found guilty of being an accessory

775
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,375
Holy to the school shooting

776
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,655
Which is appropriate

777
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,959
Stomach

778
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,983
Drastic of a sentence

779
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,007
Which I think is also

780
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
I think the

781
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,615
I think I think that

782
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
It's awful

783
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
To beat the person

784
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,199
Who has

785
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,735
Given access to

786
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,063
This weapon that killed a lot of people but at the same time I don't

787
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
Treat that like he actually

788
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
We did the

789
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:20,255
Wright and his response was actually pretty admirable found

790
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,535
I bet he had

791
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
One of his guns

792
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
Have been taken and used in this crime

793
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,191
And he immediately offered to relinquish his rights

794
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:32,287
20 guns that he used for this sporting

795
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,615
Hobby of his who's like oh absolutely here

796
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,175
You guys

797
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,967
Clearly

798
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,039
Story Alex

799
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,831
Who's pitching about this guy that he was

800
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,599
On

801
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
Occasionally

802
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,415
Someone in the government

803
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
I'm a gun

804
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,975
All of that is not true

805
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,815
He's reporting willy-nilly and just saying what he wants to be the king

806
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,631
Which I'm sure later he will say is MacKay

807
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,167
But it's not

808
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
None of it's true

809
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,055
Is your daughter f****** chocolate

810
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,591
Are masquerading as one

811
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,383
Will you think that you know things

812
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
And you don't

813
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
You stay single

814
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
All the time

815
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:16,319
And when you have a big old chip on your shoulder

816
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,343
I'm always right

817
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
I mean

818
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,303
Do you really need to defend gun

819
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,375
Yeah really need it

820
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,823
Just don't think it's not

821
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,407
That's why

822
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455
I don't know maybe there's other reasons

823
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,599
Digipak on mentor

824
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
As it were

825
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
Call from

826
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Jack McLamb

827
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
For he's a big old

828
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,095
You can find a song about him

829
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
Episode

830
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
Resist

831
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
Stupid

832
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,591
Fear-mongering about there

833
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,919
Abominations are phony president

834
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,223
Guns

835
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:19,551
He's a communist he wants all the guns out of the hands of the people

836
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:26,207
And so our military until told us that we would see more of these mind control assassins going in and shooting up

837
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,231
Their families

838
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,815
Killing their families and killing children and killing

839
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,215
Masses of people and that's exactly what's happening now brother so you're right on target

840
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:40,799
And I just wanted to tell the people that we have here

841
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:45,407
That are two police military Association that issue that explains

842
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,711
Governments five easy steps

843
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,551
The creative mind control assassin out of anyone even you

844
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,855
Ego into your psychologist

845
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
Psychiatrist

846
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,927
And they put you under hypnosis

847
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:03,839
The government can tell them to make you a mind-control assassin it only takes an hour for him to put a key in your brain

848
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
Oh man

849
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,215
I mean why would you ever go to therapy if you believe that

850
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
Would you ever get help

851
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:17,151
Do you believe if you believe that there's a possibility that the government is going to tell your therapist to put a key in your brain

852
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:21,503
Within an hour that can turn you into a mind-control assassin

853
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,783
They only exist

854
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,855
Because Obama wants everybody's gone to neither, Dustin wants to

855
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,695
Create a depressive State why would Vicky if you're feeling depressed

856
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
You have nothing to help

857
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,535
No resources

858
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
Nothing

859
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,399
Did the government published that self-help book

860
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,935
The five easy steps

861
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:48,639
He's selling it the seven highly effective

862
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,247
You selling it and later Alex I have him do a sales pitch

863
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,831
Resource Financial

864
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
The greatest demonization

865
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,927
F****** idiot

866
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
Because I think we've

867
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,303
Said our peace and we've allowed

868
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,095
Dickheadz to say their piece

869
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,679
Alex Jones gets a call

870
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,727
From a guy who's not on head

871
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,775
No this isn't you on head

872
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,871
If you get a call from a guy and brings up a new story

873
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,151
That Alex

874
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
Will later report as true

875
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,759
Based on the fact that this caller

876
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,295
Is bring it to his attention

877
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Which is the problem

878
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,159
Is a fuking idiot invite as well

879
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,719
Andy in Montana you're on the year

880
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:41,631
I do not like so I just wanted to know if you'd heard about the explosions in Bozeman Montana and white

881
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,655
Call Montana

882
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,471
We're two American Legions were blowing up

883
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,031
When did this happen

884
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,567
This happened last week

885
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:56,479
I don't even in our news and it hasn't made news at all

886
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:02,367
Was it in Washington State

887
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,207
General Lee

888
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,791
That means it's a real terrorist attack

889
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,031
Because it was real terrorism

890
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,991
Without

891
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,367
Given the implication babe

892
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:40,767
Means that it's probably real the guy a couple of Americans

893
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
Or building

894
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,631
First

895
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,959
If you're going to ask Alex how he's doing

896
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,495
To say

897
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,591
Route

898
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
Route

899
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:00,991
If he is admitting in the sixties and seventies there were all these bombings happen

900
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,271
All over the place

901
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,087
What then

902
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,415
Do you think was perpetrating those bombings

903
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,487
Do you think it was Muslim terrorist

904
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:15,583
I don't think so no do you think it was black people bombing s*** all over the place

905
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,887
I'm in the weather

906
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
Terrorist group

907
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,383
Contrary to what

908
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,919
Constantly says

909
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:37,087
If he's if he's even saying this at all

910
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:44,767
There's a lot of like eco-terrorism

911
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,535
That involves

912
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,095
TheCHIVE

913
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,887
Primarily white people

914
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,215
Situation

915
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:59,359
Real f*****-up

916
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
A few things

917
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,431
He's found a headline that works for it

918
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
Basically

919
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
American Legion

920
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
This problem with

921
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
Double drop

922
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:20,351
First problem is the scholars to American Legions were blown off which is not true

923
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,631
A couple of reasons

924
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,727
The first is that wild explosion in Bozeman did

925
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,287
American Legion

926
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,823
That is true

927
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,175
Is there a bunch of businesses around American Legion

928
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,063
Was one of them so he's already implying that it was the American Legion Woodland Park

929
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:44,415
Now the second

930
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
Did not

931
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
Affecting American

932
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:52,607
It affected a restaurant called The Legion Street Grill his caller seems to not know the difference

933
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,143
Does the word legion

934
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,423
Isabella

935
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,519
Issue here is Obama

936
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,591
Bozeman was technically explosion

937
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,383
But it was caused by a failure in the gas

938
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:08,223
But some people theorize that set off by a minor earthquake nearby

939
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:13,343
Businesses

940
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,391
Caused by a faulty Refrigeration

941
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,535
Universal Whitehall is Thoroughly investigated

942
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,935
They're only suspicious as it relates to whether or not the businesses or the gas Mains were up to code

943
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:32,543
Also plenty of media cover these things they're deeply traumatic to the economies of those town

944
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,847
And the blast killed one woman

945
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,687
They were pretty serious events you can find new stories

946
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,991
Is from local media and stuff like that

947
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,039
There's just not really that much need

948
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,087
The national media to cover

949
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,135
I'd like

950
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,415
Right

951
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:54,047
The New York Times cover it like a couple days later a couple days a week later

952
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,119
But it's not of immediate concern necessarily until all the facts

953
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,167
Right

954
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,215
Is just ludicrous b******* Alex

955
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
Wyoming

956
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,751
If callers

957
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,519
2 oz

958
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,567
Pretty crazy

959
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:12,223
I don't know I don't know how to respond to somebody who even if

960
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,759
You tell them the reality of it

961
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,551
They're going to say it's a cover-up

962
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,623
Probably

963
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,927
Because it was an actual terrorists

964
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,695
Bacon

965
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,487
Tell you the truth of it

966
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,303
So they hire all these fake

967
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:34,495
Things are real not know either false flag

968
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:41,407
Because the Earth is Hollow

969
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,991
Whatever it is

970
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,271
Where

971
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
Without any feeling

972
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:54,463
So about the Alabama

973
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,279
In particular and one of the reasons for that

974
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
Is that

975
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,351
There were reports of

976
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,631
The military being in

977
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
Involved

978
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
After the fact

979
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,191
Of course

980
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:09,567
Respond military out on the street

981
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,591
Fort Rucker

982
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,615
And Alabama

983
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,895
That we're helping out with

984
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,783
Darius Colonel Rucker

985
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,855
The issue here is that

986
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,647
These shootings took place

987
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,927
Multiple City

988
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
Very small

989
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,743
In Alabama

990
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,791
They have very limited law enforcement

991
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,327
My capability

992
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,887
So the response to it

993
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
Stop

994
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,447
People from Fort Rucker

995
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,727
Deemed

996
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
Is it appropriate

997
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
To help out

998
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,615
They helped out was very limited

999
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,919
But also they did get in

1000
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,223
A article

1001
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:54,111
Military.com from October 20th

1002
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,647
The fact this is October 20th

1003
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
2009

1004
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:03,327
Investigation found that soldiers should not have been sent to man traffic stops in a small Alabama town after 11

1005
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,351
People were killed in March

1006
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,375
During a shooting

1007
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,423
Army report released

1008
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
Associated Press

1009
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,471
Monday response

1010
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,519
Requested

1011
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,799
Dispatch military

1012
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
Please

1013
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,127
From nearby Fort Rucker broke the law

1014
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,175
But an army spokesman said no charges

1015
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:18,943
Has been filed

1016
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,247
As a result of this finding

1017
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
The Army took

1018
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,063
Against Italy

1019
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,831
Least one person

1020
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,135
Yeah so they found it it was a breach of

1021
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:31,231
Posse Comitatus Act

1022
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,767
Would like them too

1023
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
Bring up

1024
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,423
The officer who made the

1025
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,007
Have the authority

1026
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
Responses

1027
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,079
Hurricane

1028
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,663
Okay

1029
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,479
Intent was to be a good army neighbor and help local

1030
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,759
Civilian authorities

1031
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,295
Difficult unique tragedy effect

1032
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,575
The local community

1033
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,903
There were apparently no adverse collateral effects

1034
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
Inappropriate

1035
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:06,815
Ministrator

1036
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:10,143
It wasn't like

1037
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,679
We're taking over

1038
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:19,871
Yeah isn't that what we have a military for that's a big part of it

1039
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:25,759
But they were really good

1040
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,063
Broader picture

1041
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,391
Has heard these reports that there were

1042
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,415
Military officer

1043

And of course

1044
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,463
That gets him

1045
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,303
It's very excited about

1046
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,911
Get in touch with someone from Fort Rucker

1047
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,727
In Alabama

1048
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
Alex

1049
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
Never goes well

1050
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,879
With someone

1051
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:11,071
I haven't heard

1052
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,351
After shooting providing

1053
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,631
Security

1054
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:20,031
Regular US Army on

1055
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,663
What's the time

1056
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,223
Thank you very much for calling

2 questions about like

1061
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,095
We go out there you were out there trying to insinuate yourself

1062
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,143
The police

1063
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,423
It is very

1064
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,751
Polite

1065
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,519
Responses

1066
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,479
I'll have a good answer

1067
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,759
But at the same time

1068
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,319
The pudding is in the eating

1069
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,159
Sarah defecation sound to tape

1070
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:14,559
His interpretation is not what the Army decided was the case

1071
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,607
But I do believe him

1072
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,887
Cornel Wilde

1073
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,167
In terms of

1074
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
Previously there was a

1075
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:25,055
Shooting going on in Alabama with regular army responded

1076
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:31,967
Wilshire I mean we wouldn't respond to it we would not we would never respond off the installation in a loan for

1077
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,759
What we what we

1078
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,295
Will provide do is

1079
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,087
Support functions

1080
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,391
We will provide assistance

1081
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,183
You know to our partner community

1082
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,231
Military police though

1083
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:51,679
Yes sir that is a law enforcement rolling that we would not do here at Fort Rucker I can't

1084
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,215
Speak for what northcom

1085
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,287
Or the army war college is trying to put together

1086
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,591
But Here at Fort Rucker we would not do that

1087
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,879
All we were doing with his what was enforcing the cordone

1088
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,183
And I just directing traffic around

1089
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:17,535
We work we weren't stopping anybody we were engaging anybody we were just directing traffic

1090
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,071
Soda

1091
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,887
Distinction that he's trying to make it

1092
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,959
I see where he's coming from a very limited Manpower

1093
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,775
So they used some military personnel

1094
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:31,359
In order to man these places where they were directing traffic

1095
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,407
And then the other thing they did was

1096
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,687
They guarded

1097
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,455
Like the morgue

1098
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,503
People break

1099
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,295
Who are the local line

1100
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
Enforcement

1101
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:46,975
Appropriate Authority

1102
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,791
All that stuff even in the

1103
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
Even in the

1104
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,607
Military zone

1105
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,959
Temecula Valley pictures

1106
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,239
Where

1107
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,055
Misunderstand what you're seeing

1108
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,359

1110
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,687
Traffic looks very similar to them

1111
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,455
Having a road

1112
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,551
Because they had whistle

1113
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,879
Play the white gloves and every

1114
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,767
They're dancing around

1115
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,655
He's a trying to get something out of this

1116
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,959
Guy questions very politely

1117
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,519

Cornel Wilde is response

01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,455
Like personally doesn't really matter

1121
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:43,551
I've got to go

1127
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,959
At which of course Alex later characterizes

1128
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,287
Which is what happened

Prep

1131
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,639
Yeah exactly

1132
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,479
Incorrectly

1133
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
Alex reached out to this base

1134
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:22,207
He's the one who handles

1135
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,559
Calm everybody down

1136
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:33,215
Nope that wasn't our plan we were just trying to make sure that people didn't go into what

1137
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,007
Hey me a banana

1138
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,543
Shooters

1139
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,359
You know it's possible we didn't know all the facts

1140
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,127
The time

1141
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,943
So we're just trying to provide some kind of support

1142
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,223
Because the local police

1143
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:44,991
Had like

1144
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
4 guys

1145
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039
Or even afterwards

1146
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,855
Not an active shooter

1147
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,671
Keep evil away from

1148
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:58,815
Curiosity or something like that process

1149
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:01,375
Might be people who

1150
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,423
I don't know I don't know what the suspicion

1151
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,215
Look like you deface the morgue

1152
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
Sing like that

1153
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,287
I don't know if that's

1154
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
To secure those

1155
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,639
Even the bodies it India

1156
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,431
Immediate time are still

1157
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
There's evidence

1158
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,343
I get the info

1159
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,647
I don't personally have a problem

1160
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,183
With military

1161
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,207
Personality

1162
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,487
Especially

1163
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,511
In stretched

1164
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:32,351
Very rural areas where they don't have

1165
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,631
Large police

1166
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,655
Right

1167
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,471
But I also do see the other side where it's like

1168
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,519
Any military doing anything to mess

1169
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,799
Stickley is inappropriate

1170
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:43,871
I kind of see that argument to Alex's wrong

1171
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,431
Who cares

1172
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,711
If your

1173
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,527
If your community all they have is like

1174
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:56,671
Boss Hogg and his two deputies

1175
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:59,231
Just anybody with any kind of authority

1176
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,767
She just be like

1177
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,839
I don't know

1178
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,375
I don't know cuz I I see

1179
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,399
ICC

1180
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,191
Do you like principal argh

1181
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,471
What sort of

1182
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,567
But I also seized the logistics

1183
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
More

1184
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:15,871
Rationalize

1185
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:22,271
Poolside relies on the idea of like this is a slippery slope and if you allow this then they'll be

1186
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,831
Next will be pulling over your car

1187
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,135
Which I think is foolish but at the same time like

1188
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,415
Alright whatever

1189
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:35,327
Slippery slope argument especially in this regard

1190
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,351
Flimsy at

1191
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,631
Yeah

1192
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,447
Slippery slope argument

1193
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
In general

1194
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
But

1195
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
In this case

1196
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,335
Alyssa

1197
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,871
Just let this one go

1198
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:48,895
It seems

1199
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,919
It seems soft

1200
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,479
Jordan

1201
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:53,759
March 11th

1202
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,039
2009

1203
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,087
A day that will live in

1204
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,647
Because W shoe on head

1205
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,511
Because

1206
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,559
On this episode Alex Jones

1207
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:11,935
Is going to do a guest spot on someone else's radio show

1208
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:18,591
He leaves the show commercial for The Obama Deception

1209
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,871
Then comes back

1210
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
Yeah when you comes back

1211
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,431
He's Furious

1212
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,807
Howard Stern

1213
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,343
It's not Howard Stern

1214
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,135
I don't even remember the name of the show

1215
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,415
Recognize

1216
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:37,023
It's a show

1217
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:40,863
Not a fan of treating Alex with respect

1218
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,143
I like that

1219
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,679
That's ironic that Alex

1220
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,519
Get the taste of his own medicine on the same show

1221
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,567
I haven't listened to that interview or anything

1222
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,151
About that experience

1223
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,943
But all of that

1224
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,223
Is washed away

1225
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,247
Because he

1226
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,527
Has received

1227
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,807
Document

1228
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:00,831
Someone

1229
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,135
From the Missouri Highway Patrol

1230
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,975
Asportation

1231
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:10,559
And on their computers sending Alex Jones a secret.

1232
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
That I regret

1233
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
He's a real document

1234
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:22,591
We are back in the world that's what you

1235
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,887
Here is the miac Strategic report

1236
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:49,983
The modern militia movement

1237
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,775
Here

1238
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,591
People believers

1239
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,567
We just go over in a little bit

1240
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:29,407
But this is Alex will in the future called

1241
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,199
Very

1242
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,991
Very big teeth

1243
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:36,575
Mythology

1244
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,135
Peace

1245
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:42,719
Of all of his arguments about how the government is trying to Target people like him

1246
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,511
It is

1247
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,303
The stupidest argument

1248
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,911
Possible he's going to go over all the

1249
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,495
Very interesting

1250
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,543
In history

1251
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,359
When Alex is talked about like secrets.

1252
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,151
People contacting him

1253
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:07,807
You never really gets into specifics who never talks about the names of documents because we have white papers we got to ask for documents

1254
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,087
Who's one of the only

1255
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,879
Senses that I can think of where he's

1256
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,415
Saying the name of the report

1257
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:16,767
Which leads me to believe it might be one of the only instances of people act

1258
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
Now

1259
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,119
Then it's further variant

1260
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:21,887
Everything about this

1261
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,167
This is martial law

1262
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,959
Someone is sent this to him

1263
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,263
And he's going on are and Reporting

1264
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,055
It has been public

1265
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
Send

1266
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,847
2004

1267
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,407
No it was written in February

1268
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,247
Law enforcement

1269
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,575
It's released by WikiLeaks

1270
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,111
2 Days Later

1271
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:46,207
Two days later Wikileaks has a copy of it and they release it

1272
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,535
Alex is already released on Infowars

1273
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
What

1274
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,863
I can find crazy I can

1275
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,399
Find no instances

1276
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,471
Anybody publishing this before out

1277
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:01,823
What is one of the only times that I'm firmly convinced

1278
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:08,223
Yeah it's weird

1279
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,783
I don't know what that means but at the same time

1280
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,063
Someone sent it to Alex

1281
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:12,831
They also sent

1282
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,599
WikiLeaks

1283
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,903
Longer process of

1284
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,231
Trying to confirm the Providence of it

1285
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:19,999
But I

1286
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,559
I don't know what to make

1287
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:29,983
I really don't know what to do with it because Alex is almost always

1288
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,031
He was ahead of the game

1289
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:36,639
Jesus David lies about the document itself

1290
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
Only 8 page

1291
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,831
Yeah it's so rude

1292
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
Shorts

1293
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,695
I'll give you a little bit of a

1294
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,975
A primer on

1295
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,999
This miac report

1296
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:58,399
So what day is is the law enforcement community

1297
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,167
A gather

1298
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,959
I think they put out these reports from time

1299
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,239
The time just about things

1300
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,031
To be online for

1301
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:07,103
Radar a this one is about the modern militia move

1302
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,383
It's called

1303
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,663
The modern militia moo

1304
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,735
It goes into it starts B

1305
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,783
The roots of the militia

1306
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,343
Which started in the

1307
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
19

1308
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,391
AP tonight

1309
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,671
296

1310
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,951
Resurgence

1311
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,999
In 2009 which day

1312
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,679
Really fun thing from

1313
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,215
From the second paragraph of this

1314
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,543
Article

1315
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
The paper

1316
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,335
Yeah

1317
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,175
Really

1318
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,783
You reading this

1319
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,575
And knowing what we know now

1320
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:53,439
9 years later

1321
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,487
Some people saw like the alt right

1322
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:58,559
In all of these white nationalists

1323
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,327
Bubbling

1324
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,095
Coming

1325
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,143
So here from the second paragraph

1326
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:08,543
Academic female and minority empowerment in the 1970s and 1960s blow to white males

1327
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:09,823
Powerman

1328
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,615
This combined with a synagogue

1329
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,663
Yep this combined with a sensor

1330
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:19,039
To defeat from the Vietnam War increased levels of immigration and unemployment Banda paramilitary culture

1331
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,599
Disco

1332
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:27,231
Such as Tom Clancy novel V Soldier Fortune Magazine the glorified Kombat

1333
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:32,095
This culture glorified white males and operate Heroes who are mentally ill

1334
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:32,863
Physically tough

1335
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,471
There's a lot to that

1336
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,007
It goes on to discuss how

1337
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:42,335
Many individuals and organizations

1338
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,359
Began to concoction

1339
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,639

1340
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,663
Explain their misfortune

1341
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:49,759
These theories vary but almost always involve the globalist dictatorship

1342
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:53,343
The New World Order exploit the working class citizen

1343
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:57,183
United Nations troops were thought to already be operating in the United States

1344
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,463
In support of the New World Order

1345
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:03,839
Much of this rhetoric would become anti-semitic claiming that the Jews control the monetary system in

1346
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,655
And in turn these scientists occupied governor

1347
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,727
The Malaysian of Montana became a key organization

1348
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,031
Individual

How to form militia Oregon

1350
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,127

Different militia organization

1363
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,191

Hundred tons

1366
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,519
The reason

1367
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543
Why people should

1368
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
Afraid

1369
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,615

You see all these

1389
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,175
They're not

1390
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,967
Trying to paint an unfair picture

1391
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,247
In this side

1392
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
This report

1393
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:01,599
Suffice it to say this is a scripture of

1394
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
That the movement

1395
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,647
In the 90s

1396
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:04,927
The resurgence

1397
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,231
Where are you

1398
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
Incidents like

01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:11,839

ATF agent we're going to testify the five

1403
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,127
All of these all of these frames

1404
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,455
Anytime

1405
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,271
Other people

1406
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,087
White dudes go f****** batshit

01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,975
What is a joke

1409
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:44,095
What is your thought process where you're like a man

1410
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,887
These people are

1411
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,167
I don't know

1412
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:53,567
At least getting towards it so I better get a gun and blow it up

1413
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,615
Childish

1414
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:56,639
It is

1415
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,967
The talking about their about

1416
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,759
The idea that there

1417
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,807
You know they're tying Indies

1418
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
North America

1419
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:11,487
Explain

1420
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,791
Commonalities that they found

1421
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,887
That a number of them

1422
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,423
Are motivated by

1423
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,471
They don't say

1424
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,031
Believing there's a North American

1425
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,335
Memes that you're apart of a violent militia

1426
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359
There's

1427
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
That a lot of these militias

1428
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,431
Also have

1429
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,247
Right that's a very important distinction

1430
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,039
Write this

1431
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,319
And you know how to read

1432
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,599
You will see

1433
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
Just that

1434
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,183
These are these are things

1435
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,207
That malicious

1436
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,743
That carry out attacks

1437
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,279
Like described

1438
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,047
In the beginning of this

1439
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,351
They may hold these beliefs

1440
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:49,887
Not

1441
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,959
That holding these beliefs makes you

1442
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,263
Suspected to be a member of one of those

1443
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,311
This is a very

1444
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,079
Very

1445
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,639
Very important

1446
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:03,199
You do if you see smoke sometimes there's a fire

1447
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,247
Sometimes somebody just grilling

1448
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,783
True

1449
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,135
Sing is trying to

1450
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,463
To accept guilt by association

1451
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,999
So that would be

1452
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:16,767
Believing

1453
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,303
The opposite

1454
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,863
Is expressing

1455
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
Because they aren't

1456
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,471
Baby mechanic

1457
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:30,847
Be there in a little bit ago

1458
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,895
A little bit guilty

1459
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:37,503
Are you going to be super irresponsible

1460
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,807
Niagara port and not

1461
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:43,391
Because you could be you could possibly believe that

1462
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,487
If you don't read this after Alex says

1463
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,791
I could be your world where

1464
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,863
The the law enforcement put out a report that was like

1465
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,631
Hey

1466
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:57,983
A lot of these dickholes believe this

1467
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:03,615
They probably one of those dick holes

1468
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,663
It's not like that at all

1469
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:08,479
Criticizing

1470
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:14,623
Even handed

1471
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:19,743
It's Alex ideas about Tuesday

1472
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,047
Another piece

1473
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,583
Of his.

1474
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,351
His argument

1475
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,039
Image training manual

1476
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:49,951
Don't tread on me flag

1477
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,975
Guys

1478
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,511
We showed that

1479
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,727
Guilt by association

1480
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:09,407
They're coming out

1481
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,967
Vetta are digested by

1482
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:15,807
Aaron Russo's film

1483
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,111
Freedom to Fascism

1484
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:27,327
That's weird because those were actually they were actually referencing Ted Turner

1485
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:32,959
Also Alex Alex goes on later to say that the Turner Diaries

1486
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,495
Planted on Timothy me

1487
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:39,103
Which is

1488
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,151
That doesn't seem necessary at all

1489
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:44,479
So now I'm more importantly just because

1490
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
It's a nice

1491
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,527
Side Road to go down

1492
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,319
Alex brings up this

1493
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,599
Financial Times

1494
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:51,903
London time

1495
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,487
Of course he does but he always calls

1496
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,255
Financial Times

1497
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,023
Times of London witch

1498
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:57,791
Whatever

1499
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,631
Sure I'm so this article and noun for world

1500
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,655
Sexually

1501
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,191
And now for a world government

1502
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,263
Eagles it now for World Government because that's what

1503
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,287
Russo called it

1504
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,055
In his film

1505
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:15,199
Alex may not have actually but it's a great title

1506
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:19,039
And now for World Government it has the tone of someone

1507
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,063
Introduced

1508
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,343
As the next

1509
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,879
I know show

1510
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:27,231
Hey and Now ladies and gentlemen world government

1511
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:31,327
That uses film from freedom to Fashion

1512
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,631
Got everything wrong

1513
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,911
And instead

1514
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,191
Actually

1515
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:40,287
Helped contribute to America going from freedom to Fashion

1516
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:44,383
Almost like the titles ironic

1517
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:49,759
So I'm a little bit here from this Financial Times article called

1518
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,039
And now for a world

1519
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,319
See if you think this

1520
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:58,719
I never believe that there's a secret United Nations

1521
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:02,047
I've never seen black helicopters hovering over the sky above Montana

1522
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,839
But for the first time in my life

1523
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,119
The formation to stop

1524
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,143
I'm sort of world

1525
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
Is possible

1526
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,191
Is plausible

1527
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,543
Do you think

1528
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,080
Do you think that

1529
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:19,200
This guy's saying that's open

1530
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:24,576
Sprays that what he's saying is that for a long time I thought people who did this

1531
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,600
We're crazy

1532
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,392
And now I'm starting

1533
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:30,464
I think maybe they have the smallest kernel of appoint

1534
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:34,048
He goes on to say

1535
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,352
That the formation of a world governed

1536
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:40,704
Is it what you didn't believe before first

1537
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,520
Is that the issues that are facing the world are international

1538
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:46,336
Looks like terrorism

1539
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,640
Climate change

1540
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:55,040
Are the financial markets call working in concert don't give a f*** about borders

1541
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:55,808
The problems

1542
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:58,368
We face every move into the future being International

1543
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,904
Who makes sense that we have some

1544
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,184
International

1545
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:05,280
It's really hard to regulate a business that

1546
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,584
Functions all over the world with dip

1547
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
Look at Google

1548
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:11,936
How do you regulate Google when Google is

1549
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,728
Kowtowing to China censor

1550
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,800
World governing body

1551
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,432
Where is in the past

1552
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,712
Relax communication

1553
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:26,016
Transportation technology that would be required

1554
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:32,160
To make the world accessible to everybody the telegraph was not necessarily a great way to create a world governed

1555
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,232
Logistics

1556
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,864
Climate change World Market

1557
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,656
Those are all problems

1558
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:47,520
Or issues that in order for us to navigate them successfully require all of us to

1559
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,312
So the solutions

1560
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,080
What's the problem

1561
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,360
Who's that are international in nature

1562
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,176
Nationalist

1563
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,712
Countries that are out for

1564
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,736
America first

1565
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,016
Horchata first

1566
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:00,320
They're not going to be able to solve these

1567
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,856
Integrated problem

1568
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,904
Dan America solve terrorism

1569
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,952
We have spent

1570
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,232
So many years

1571
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,560
Solving terrorism

1572
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:15,424
We mailed we absolutely didn't create an environment that

1573
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:18,496
Terrorism

1574
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
A million times

1575
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,080
That would be crazy America first

1576
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:26,432
Thinking

1577
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,272
You're going to talk about how like Obama now coming

1578
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,040
The office

1579
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:35,392
Seems like you someone who is much more interested International cooperation

1580
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,952
He goes on to bring up this

1581
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,232
Ramanujan Global Entry

1582
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,256
Security project

1583
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,328
Good babe

1584
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,216
This group

1585
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,240
4

1586
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,032
Are you working on

1587
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,592
You're working for a legally binding

1588
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,360
Climate change

1589
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,128
Agreement

1590
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:56,896
And working

1591
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,920
To strengthen

1592
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,504
So

1593
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,528
Okay

1594
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:05,856
Obama's associated with John podesta

1595
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,392
Someone who is into working with

1596
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,160
The UN

1597
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,720
Their position

1598
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,024
Mom baby

1599
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,816
Indications that the world is

1600
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,096
Is becoming more amenable

1601
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
To that

1602
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,168
But

1603
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:22,240
If you actually read the article

1604
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,032
If you read the article I will quote

1605
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,336
But let's not get carried away

1606
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:30,176
Well it seems feasible

1607
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,968
Push for Global governance

1608
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:33,760
Be painful

1609
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,040
A slow process

1610
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,576
They're good

1611
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,112
The bad reason

1612
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:41,696
The lack of Will and determination on the part of national political leaders

1613
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:47,072
Well they might like to talk about a planet in Peril or ultimately still much more focused on their next election

1614
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:49,632
At home

1615
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,960
But this problem also hints at a more welcome

1616
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,288
Making progress on global governance will be slow sledding

1617
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,640
Even in the EU the heartland of law-based international government

1618
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,920
The idea remains

1619
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:02,688
Unpause

1620
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,528
That's just he's being very blunt

1621
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,088
Yeah it turns out people aren't that interested

1622
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,880
This was

1623
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,160
What 2009

1624
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,208
Yep this is probably a

1625
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,232
2008 start

1626
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,792
Even in the global governance

1627
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,072
Is an unpopular idea

1628
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,888
How many years later

1629
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,656
Brexit

1630
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,240
Catalan

1631
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,544
Country

1632
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,592
Italy

1633
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,128
Getting out of the EU

1634
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:35,712
All of these different places we are not creating a global

1635
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,016
Now they're actually Act

1636
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:41,088
Sibley tearing down even the slightest cooperation

1637
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:47,744
This world government article ends with the world's most pressing political problems

1638
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,792
International in nature

1639
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,096
Political identity remains

1640
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,888
Until someone cracks this problem

1641
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,496
The UN

1642
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:04,896
Even in this article if you actually just because the title is and now for world government

1643
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:08,480
It's not announcing a world government in the way that Alex thinks it is

1644
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
So he likes

1645
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,808
To play this game where they come read between the lines

1646
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,160
The world government is gear

1647
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,744
But if you look into the author

1648
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,560
Critical of world government

1649
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,376
He was against 2001

1650
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,168
Publicly you passionately

1651
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:31,520
Against the idea of the UK taking onto you're always one of the

1652
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:35,872
He is a pencil this s*** his name is Aaron Russo

1653
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,432
But it's like

1654
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,968
You know you can't use that

1655
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,016
This author clearly doesn't have some some

1656
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,320
Versus Pro World Government opinion

1657
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,112
Article

1658
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:50,208
You know the trend Uno the world seems to be heading

1659
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Directions

1660
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,280
Plausible but unfortunately

1661
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,560
Unfortunate

1662
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
Because the problem

1663
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,864
Cesar International

1664
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,632
Nature

1665
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,168
Aren't interested in that

1666
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,984
Yeah

1667
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,056
That's just a little flight

1668
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,360
The road

1669
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:09,408
Is it is an interesting

1670
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,456
Things to look back on now

1671
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,224
As

1672
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:12,992
Describing the

1673
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:13,760
Global

1674
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
How

1675
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,088
Many if not all of our politicians

1676
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,112
Oceans are far more

1677
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:19,904
Themselves

1678
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,440
Elected

1679
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:25,536
When we look at an International Coalition of scientists

1680
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,816
Saying like hey

1681
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,352
Within 12 years

1682
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,888
If we don't take Act

1683
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,448
We're literally f***

1684
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:36,032
And everybody who read that report everybody

1685
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:36,800
II

1686
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,616
When you read it I assume or maybe

1687
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,384
Did you read it

1688
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,456
When you have too much Alec

1689
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,624
It was not like

1690
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:56,512
Going to work together now I was immediately like we're what

1691
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,536
Yeah what

1692
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:03,168
What should have been the conclusion of that article is not we should all come together and deal with climate change

1693
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:06,752
Somebody needs to work on geoengineering

1694
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:07,520
Real quick

1695
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:11,104
Abandon this whole we need to cut down on carbon emissions

1696
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,128
That shouldn't going to have

1697
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,480
Solve this problem

1698
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:19,040
Liberty some enterprising Young

1699
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:23,136
Not full of s*** Elon Musk is working on that as we

1700
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:23,904
What's up

1701
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,208
Alex's

1702
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,072
The world

1703
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,656
Forecast Trends better than

1704
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:37,216
Anybody

1705
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,592
And we going to start seeing riots in major cities

1706
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:45,152
That rival wayser Panther

1707
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:46,944
Those that we

1708
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,712
We saw

1709
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:50,016
Back in the 1960s

1710
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:52,576
When cities were being burned down

1711
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:55,136
You going to start seeing the same thing

1712
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,416
Indiana

1713
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,952
Faceware forecast

1714
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,488
By this summer

1715
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,280
People

1716
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,840
You better prepare Bubba ray's baby

1717
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:08,704
Exactly remember how many US cities Burns

1718
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,496
To the ground in the summer rose

1719
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,056
2009

1720
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,640
Also I really hate sleepy so

1721
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:19,712
I hate it I like high-register sulentic

1722
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,480
We're going to see

1723
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,296
A lot of rice

1724
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,088
You know in the cities

1725
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:28,160
I don't I just can't people who live in cities

1726
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,952
There are all kinds of people

1727
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,488
I like it when you excited

1728
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:38,912
Preoccupied

1729
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,496
Discuss

1730
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:43,520
Visa vie

1731
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,056
His response

1732
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,592
Do it but

1733
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,872
He hasn't actually read

1734
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:51,712
42b just got it and now he's on air still

1735
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:54,016
He's still dealing with that bad interview

1736
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,576
Yeah

1737
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,624
Just decides to announce that he's right

1738
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:14,496
North American Union conspiracy theorist

1739
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:18,336
Mexico

1740
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:23,712
Trade the dollar for the Amero associated with serious concern

1741
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:30,368
MarketWatch

1742
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,696
Mexico

1743
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,512
Crisis

1744
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:49,312
Books now

1745
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:55,712
Yeah it is approved as a book that f****** Jerome corsi wrote that letter

1746
01:29:55,968 --> 01:30:00,576
It's not crazy that the North American Union is being put together is this article

1747
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:05,184
How realistic is a North American currency

1748
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:09,536
From January 28th 2000

1749
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,608
Again oven article

1750
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,680
What's a title that does not represent

1751
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,704
The content of

1752
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,984
Did the body of the

1753
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,312
The article about the idea that

1754
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,712
Is combining

1755
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:29,504
Need the three countries

1756
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,320
Because there are natural resources to be used in Canada

1757
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,856
There's

1758
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,624
Quote

1759
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,696
With America and Mexico

1760
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,720
SO3

1761
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:43,072
Coming together as one unit might be competitive on a global level

1762
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,912
So he discusses that possibility

1763
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,448
Some ideas

1764
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,728
And then if you look

1765
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,288
The end of this article once again

1766
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:58,944
Quote this particular path isn't something one would wish for but cumulative imbalances that steadily built our finance

1767
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,992
Economy must be resolved one way or another

1768
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,808
Therein lies the critical Crossroads

1769
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:04,576
Read together face

1770
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,624
As our weary World attempts to find

1771
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,696
Yeah

1772
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,488
Not so much at least for the time being

1773
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,512
Possible

1774
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,328
Certainly although all again offer that it could take years but

1775
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,120
Prickly puzzle Fallen

1776
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:17,888
How to play

1777
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,168
Effective money manager

1778
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,496
Potential outcome

1779
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,288
In factoring them into our decision

1780
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:28,384
Well the notion of a seismic currency shift may seem obscure

1781
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,944
We must respect the possibility long before because

1782
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:31,712
Comes from page and

1783
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,272
So you saying

1784
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
Again

1785
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,064
Probable

1786
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,088
Not so much

1787
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,136
This is a possibility

1788
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,184
Way far off in the future if it

1789
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,208
Even happen

1790
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:43,744
Because

1791
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,024
Effective money manager

1792
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,048
Dictate

1793
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:46,816
We need to

1794
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,096
To discuss any possible

1795
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,120
Talk about the Rams

1796
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,192
So the article

1797
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,544
How realistic is a North American Union in one currency

1798
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,568
Not very

1799
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,616
Not very. Very likely

1800
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,688
That and the Jerome

1801
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,992
Seabrook to try and prove

1802
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,272
That like to North America

1803
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,040
Community

1804
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,952
Real and he's doing that because the North American Union and the NAFTA superhighway

1805
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,768
That that we covered in our endgame coverage ad nauseam

1806
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,328
Are listed in

1807
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,864
That my ex

1808
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:21,888
About

1809
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
It conspiracy

1810
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,704
Is that people in these militias

1811
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,472
Believer

1812
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:31,872
So Alex has to be totally real

1813
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:38,272
I really have no idea

1814
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:40,320
There's a very strong possibility

1815
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,112
That

1816
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,416
At least spiritual route

1817
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:47,488
Tucson malicious

1818
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,608
My feeling is that

1819
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,632
He's not

1820
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,168
Personally in a militia

1821
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
But he's like

1822
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,704
Once removed

1823
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,496
Like he has plenty of

1824
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:04,896
People he knows I wouldn't are Emily

1825
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,688
Back reports

1826
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,712
Because he's like

1827
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:11,808
And

1828
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:16,160
All of the things that they described as being like things that

1829
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,976
People in militia groups believe in red flags

1830
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,768
They're all things that he believed

1831
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:23,072
So it's not

1832
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,352
It's not that like

1833
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,400
This report

1834
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,168
Even

1835
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,216
And if you look at the entirety of it

1836
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,008
And you say oh I

1837
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,056
Describes me to a T

1838
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:36,896
Yeah that's still not saying that you are a member of one of those malicious

1839
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:40,992
Right or that even you should be suspected of being a member

1840
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,528
They are

1841
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,808
People in those malicious

1842
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,136
They use this sort of

1843
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:52,000
Iconography and believe

1844
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,328
Conspiracy theories

1845
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:58,144
Here's what I would but I would say

1846
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:58,912
It's Vista

1847
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:01,984
It's saying

1848
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:03,776
If

1849
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,336
Many

1850
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,104
Members

1851
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,408
Like

1852
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,456
Being y

1853
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,992
Yeah it's not saying

1854
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,784
If you like thing why

1855
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,832
Then you are a member of group X

1856
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,392
That is a transverse thing of

1857
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,416
Infra

1858
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:22,464
You can't do that that

1859
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,232
That

1860
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,280
One does not follow from the other

1861
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,560
It's like saying

1862
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:30,400
Many people who are neo-nazis

1863
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,936
Like to wear leather jacket

1864
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,288
If you're wearing a leather jacket then you were probably a Neo-Nazi

1865
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,592
850 exact same sort of logic

1866
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:41,408
Just doesn't work when you flip it it doesn't work

1867
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:43,200
But you have to understand logic

1868
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
In order to

1869
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:50,368
Actually you don't even have to understand logic it's reading comprehension

1870
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,720
History comes on air

1871
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,744
Reporting this thing as I

1872
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,024
They're calling us all terrorists

1873
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,840
And so we get to the 12

1874
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,168
We find ourselves

1875
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,448
Meeting up

1876
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
Sleepy Owl

1877
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,264
One one thing that's

1878
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,568
So important

1879
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,848
Is that

1880
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,384
Alex

1881
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,736
Whenever it is done to him and his white supremacist

1882
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,576
Every Muslim is a radical Muslim

1883
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,600
Osher

1884
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:25,184
What if he's not quite on that tip yet

1885
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:32,352
Right now in 2009

1886
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,704
Somehow

1887
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,728
Portrayed

1888
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,008
Alex

1889
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,592
Radical Muslim groups all use

1890
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:46,432
Iconography

1891
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,760
God's warning

1892
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:53,088
Alden Elementary level

1893
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,112
It's so stupid

1894
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,392
Because Eve

1895
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:58,208
I'm a left-leaning person

1896
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:01,792
If I saw like a police report

1897
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,096
Some Boulevard forcement report that was like

1898
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:06,656
Many terrorist groups on valette

1899
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,448
Use this sign

1900
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,752
Many of them believed in this

1901
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,800
I wouldn't be

1902
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:15,616
Really self-conscious if I also believe

1903
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,408
I would

1904
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:19,200
I wouldn't think that they were talking about me

1905
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,736
Because I understand

1906
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,808
12oz Tire

1907
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,088
He's real tired

1908
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,136
Complain about it

1909
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:28,160
There's a reason

1910
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:34,560
No rest for the wicked

1911
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:39,680
Association

1912
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:42,240
This radio show

1913
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:46,336
4 hours a day

1914
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:59,136

1915

DVDs

1916
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:10,656
It's freon

1917
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,752
The Fanfare that you probably

1918
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,520
Would have loved

1919
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:18,080
Comes on errands

1920
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:22,176
So go watch

1921
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:30,624
He did.

1922
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,672
And now it's here

1923
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,744
Explains that like I don't even want

1924
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,768
YouTube pay

1925
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,048
Me for that

1926
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,840
Just be able to cover the bandwidth and stuff

1927
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:42,400
Getting the truth out there

1928
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:44,192
But then he accidentally keeps talking

1929
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,512
What

1930
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:16,704
Thinking I'm great I'm in the defeating criminals defeating the New World Order

1931
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:23,360
Here is a giant multiple boats

1932
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,920
Just made all of the descriptors of himself

1933
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,856
I don't like big houses

1934
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,672
Alex

1935
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:37,696
Yeah

1936
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,512
Really just fun

1937
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,536
Do you like waffles

1938
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,608
But really didn't

1939
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,960
I'm not really in the broad

1940
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:51,264
Well I got to be honest

1941
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:54,848
I think that's a good introduction to what's about to happen

1942
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:56,640
Because Alex

1943
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:57,664
Real f*****-up

1944
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,432
About

1945
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,456
Women

1946
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,760
I don't think that I

1947
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:05,344
In my listening 2009. A lot of chauvinism

1948
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,952
There's a lot of Alex's.

1949
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:13,024
I think I've heard stuff that is this overly like

1950
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:15,328
Rui my jaw open

1951
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,352
What

1952
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:23,008
What are you saying was that also in the miac report massive amount of misogyny

1953
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,032
Signifier of

1954
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:30,432
Second paragraph

1955
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,016
Part of the reason why I'm saying

1956
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,600
Prescient as hell

1957
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:40,160
I would say

1958
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:42,208
Alex is shocking

1959
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,488
We close to understand

1960
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:46,304
Understanding

1961
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,584
We couldn't be further away

1962
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,144
If that makes sense

1963
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,728
Parents share their daughter's apartment

1964
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:57,824
This is a stray thought but I'd also like to point out that taken

1965
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,104
Came out on

1966
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,408
January 30th

1967
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,480
2009

1968
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:10,880
Color alive app just come out right before

1969
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:12,416
So-so parents

1970
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:18,816
Daughters all the time

1971
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:27,264
Parents share their daughters

1972
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,312
Another States

1973
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:33,920
Nope

1974
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:36,992
Firearm they don't

1975
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:46,976
Grocery store

1976
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:51,328
Pancake mix and strawberries

1977
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,960
Midnight

1978
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:22,304
This is actually where I was thinking the beginning of like a bad stand-up

1979
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,328
You know

1980
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:28,704
Next to the other one

1981
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,472
This is not going to go

1982
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:37,152
It's always

1983
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:37,920
So paranoid

1984
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:56,096
Younger Archie Bunker

1985
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,408
Believe me

1986
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,432
Whoa

1987
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:12,224
You're so you're so close

1988
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:18,368
It's weird the more paranoid

1989
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,048
Pull up

1990
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,752
Back on

1991
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,056
Out of control

1992
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,856
My girls

1993
01:42:56,256 --> 01:43:00,864
Qalandar

1994
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:06,496
Is weird to listen to

1995
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:09,056
That is gross

1996
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,848
He's almost there

1997
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:16,992
And then he goes as far away as possible because the observations are but the empathy

1998
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,344
Tell that women are afraid

1999
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:28,768
King himself to understand exactly

2000
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:34,912
Are often attacked in parking lots at midnight

2001
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:38,496
When you're alone in a parking lot and comes over

2002
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:42,080
You probably expect at least some interaction

2003
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:46,944
Or something

2004
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,480
Hayward

2005
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,504
Most women have

2006
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:55,904
Have experienced something like that or know someone who has told them about it

2007
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,952
Most people's at least second hand

2008
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:58,720
Experience

2009
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:02,816
Absolutely no I was coming back from Zanies one night

2010
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:08,704
At like The Late Show Saturday got Outlets

2011
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:11,776
And I got off the train and I'm walking home and I always walk

2012
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,080
My headphones and I got my head down

2013
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,360
Not doing anything

2014
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,920
Find myself like

2015
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:23,552
Just looking up when I'm 10 ft behind this other woman walking by yourself at night

2016
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:26,112
She turned around notice me and scream

2017
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,392
And I was like

2018
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:33,024
You right

2019
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:35,584
She should have been

2020
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,888
I had a gun cat no it's like

2021
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,424
Horse babies age

2022
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,960
Pictures of thing

2023
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:45,312
Terrifying

2024
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,616
When you're by yourself at night and there's

2025
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,640
No one around

2026
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:56,320
I'm a large man with a super comfortable

2027
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:01,440
Doesn't put that thing together

2028
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:04,256
If all of these women are terrified

2029
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:06,560
Maybe there's a Justified reason

2030
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:17,824
Right there's that too

2031
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,896
I'm the reason we can't do that is because all of his fears

2032
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,968
So there's that

2033
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:27,040
We only understand fear from an irrational

2034
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:30,368
Necessitate

2035
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,904
Creating victims

2036
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,952
He has to be

2037
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,488
Important for him

2038
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:38,048
To be on the side that is dominant

2039
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,072
In many ways

2040
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:43,424
Empathize

2041
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:45,728
Having a legitimate

2042
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,520
His

2043
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,896
Survation very easily

2044
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:54,944
Understanding

2045
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,248
Dealing with it isn't possible

2046
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,040
That's weird it's f******

2047
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,064
It's so weird

2048
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:00,832
And then

2049
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,880
Because he's such a gross dude

2050
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,160
He goes interview like

2051
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:09,792
It's always the ugly one

2052
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:10,816
Get a break

2053
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:15,168
Experience the world that doesn't actually work

2054
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:16,960
Like actually

2055
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:22,080
Even more diluted because

2056
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:24,128
It's rooted in his idea of like

2057
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:26,944
Women flirt with me

2058
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:30,016
Matter where I am no matter what time it is

2059
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:36,672
I'm going to a hotel interview in like 8 I can't get my eyes off of you

2060
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:41,024
Underlying

2061
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:46,144
God forbid I'm black

2062
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,424
Sprayworks

2063
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,448
What

2064
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:51,520
He spoke for a minute and a half there

2065
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:52,800
They just Express

2066
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:56,128
Ripon underlying racism misogyny

2067
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:57,664
Disrespect

2068
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,736
Disregard for people

2069
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,016
Engage with people's

2070
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:05,088
Subjective experience of the world

2071
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:10,720
It was incredibly disgusting and he still has no idea why

2072
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:14,560
Everybody hate them

2073
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:18,144
0 ideas like what what what

2074
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,240
My women

2075
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:24,544
Domestic

2076
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,152
.

2077
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:34,016
You know what I said that possessive

2078
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:38,368
A male chauvinist Pig

2079
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:44,512
Defector by women

2080
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,560
My woman

2081
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:49,376
Not cool

2082
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:57,056
Survival Instinct out of you

2083
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:04,480
Feminism is being cowardly and scared and shaking five locks on your door

2084
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:14,720
It's a woman

2085
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:18,304
Karate chop

2086
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:23,168
She's going to bite you

2087
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:27,264
Scratch your eyes out of

2088
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:33,664
Gilded chicken

2089
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,736
Cowardly

2090
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:42,368
Yuck

2091
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,392
Yuck

2092
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:47,744
Another version of feminism

2093
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:52,352
Maintenance man. Doing s*** like that

2094
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,144
Way to respect

2095
01:48:58,752 --> 01:48:59,264
Casting

2096
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:02,080
Going on

2097
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:04,384
Right now over and over and over again

2098
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,200
These idiots talk about Kavanaugh

2099
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:09,760
The more they talk about this they're like

2100
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:16,160
Oh they're just taking men's Bernardo

2101
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:21,280
Just just

2102
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,352
Turn it around for one second

2103
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,120
Like they

2104
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:28,448
You're unable to

2105
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:31,008
The possibility of what you're saying

2106
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:32,288
And then dismissed

2107
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,872
Consider the possibility

2108
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:38,944
Of what anybody else is saying

2109
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:45,344
Cuz you only believe that cuz you were cut down raised like a little week

2110
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:53,536
Requires domination

2111
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,560
Feel like a man

2112
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:57,632
Like that's it that's some sort of like an evolved

2113
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:00,960
Lizard brain

2114
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:05,568
Be able to murder somebody at any moment

2115
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:08,640
That notary

2116
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,664
Feel secure

2117
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,272
You're not

2118
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,296
Really

2119
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:18,368
Empowered must have a submachine gun or you were willing

2120
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:22,208
Bucked up

2121
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:23,232
It's idiots

2122
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:26,048
It's an insecure scared childish position

2123
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,400
It's just it's gross to see it

2124
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:32,192
Described

2125
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:34,240
Women

2126
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,520
Although I do love

2127
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:37,568
Ladies like my grandma's my woman

2128
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,128
My mom is my woman

2129
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:44,224
Whoops

2130
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,512
Oh man what a

2131
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:57,536
F****** moron

2132
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,304
A pretty dumb

2133
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,376
The 12th

2134
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,936
Opportunity to read this

2135
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:09,568
Cam

2136
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,848
And a lot of people

2137
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,640
In the comments section saying

2138
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:13,664
Nah

2139
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:14,688
Nope

2140
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:19,808
This pisses him

2141
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:25,696
People.com

2142
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:32,096
Call the phone number

2143
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,656
They refused to come on

2144
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:47,456
And we just rode up blurb their names what they told us

2145
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:53,088
Bob Barr supporters

2146
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:58,464
Constitution party supporters you are terrorists

2147
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:01,792
Throughout

2148
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:05,376
Call the phone

2149
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,264
Okay

2150
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,032
You're lying

2151
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:17,152
And the reason is because he's misrepresenting what the report is

2152
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:25,344
Evidence for the first time he can literally point to something be like

2153
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,648
I have a real document

2154
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:33,024
I can spread information that you literally cannot get anywhere else right now

2155
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:37,888
Let's do towards the end of the miac report

2156
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,680
Militia symbols

2157
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:42,240
What are the headlines

2158
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,264
Anti-government rhetoric

2159
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:48,384
Militia members most commonly associated with third-party political group

2160
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,432
It's not uncommon for militia members

2161
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:54,272
Display constitutional party campaign for liberty or libertarian material

2162
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:59,904
These members are usually supporters of former presidential candidate Ron Paul or Bob.

2163
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:05,280
Again

2164
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,560
They're not

2165
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:10,400
You support your a member of one of these militias that there

2166
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:14,752
Members of these militias

2167
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:15,776
Ron Paul

2168
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:16,544
This is

2169
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,312
Vet this is

2170
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,384
Really the sort of reasoning people in junior high should

2171
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:22,176
This is

2172
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,200
Ludacris

2173
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:25,248
Getting on air

2174
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,784
Suggesting to his

2175
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:29,600
Like to read things

2176
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:31,392
This report is staying

2177
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:34,464
Ron Paul you're a terrorist and you want to kill

2178
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,000
Because it doesn't say

2179
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:39,840
Which it doesn't say anything close to that she is also

2180
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:41,376
By doing that

2181
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:45,472
Probably pushing more people to join these Berry

2182
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:46,496
Oh you bet

2183
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:49,312
We'll see look

2184
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:55,712
The threat is real making it even more

2185
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:57,248
That is correct

2186
01:53:57,504 --> 01:54:03,648
There is a certain amount of like Alex's own propaganda doesn't serve his best interest

2187
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,672
Sandusky

2188
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:08,000
70 not ours

2189
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:09,792
He misunderstands the miac report

2190
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:11,584
Even more brings up

2191
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,864
His old rhetoric

2192
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:15,424
To touch on for a second

2193
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,448
In order to

2194
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:17,216
To bolster

2195
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,240
His misunderstand

2196
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,128
We put this out with other

2197
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:30,528
FBI training manuals

2198
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:34,624
U.s. Constitution

2199
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:43,584
This is specifically talking about FBI reports about Sovereign citizen

2200
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,632
Yeah this is not talking about

2201
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:50,496
RockAuto

2202
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:51,264
Constitution

2203
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:55,104
How's their behavior is generally

2204
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:59,968
Bring up the Constitution don't make sense

2205
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:03,296
That is something that is a threat

2206
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:06,112
Because police have been attacked and killed

2207
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,184
Traffic stop

2208
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:12,256
Setup is unrelated

2209
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:15,328
Do the larger issue of what you trying to come

2210
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,400
Fields similar and Alex's

2211
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:20,448
Kind of sympathetic to Sovereign

2212
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:23,008
He brings it up in order to

2213
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:24,032
We've this happen

2214
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:32,736
Even if they're not violent if somebody believes that the sheriff is the highest law in the land

2215
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,016
Beware

2216
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:39,392
Prairie

2217
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,928
Can existence

2218
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:44,768
I also leaving with the sheriff is the highest

2219
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:45,792
Whatever

2220
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:47,072
Like if I believe that

2221
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:48,096
Never affect

2222
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:51,168
Because I don't have I don't

2223
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:54,752
Run into law enforcement

2224
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:58,336
I have a privileged position in life where and I'll run into cops

2225
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:00,128
Breathing like that

2226
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:01,408
I don't have to deal with

2227
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,432
Dirt

2228
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,200
Senators

2229
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:07,296
So if I believe abstractly that the sheriff

2230
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:08,832
Was the highest law in the land

2231
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:10,368
I could just live my life

2232
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:14,464
The problem is

2233
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,512
The problem is but if you drive around

2234
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:17,536
You don't have license

2235
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:19,328
Place a driver's life

2236
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,096
You're awesome

2237
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:26,496
If you don't believe because you don't have license plates on your car

2238
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:27,520
Then it's going to be

2239
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:28,288
Become an issue

2240
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,848
That's much more problematic

2241
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:31,872
Justi

2242
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:33,664
Quirky

2243
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:35,200
Belief in the shower

2244
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,552
Going to misrepresent

2245
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,320
A little more

2246
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:49,792
There's also Main Street Pub

2247
01:56:56,448 --> 01:57:00,544
And then they're secretly violence

2248
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,592
Anybody

2249
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,640
So this is childish

2250
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:05,664
Thinking once again

2251
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:07,968
Envy repair

2252
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,528
Part of it

2253
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,576
The entire thing opened

2254
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:14,624
They talked about the organization

2255
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,672
Number these militia

2256
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:22,304
Events that are open

2257
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,096
The Publican generally recruit public

2258
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:26,656
These groups desire to

2259
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:28,704
I'm sorry this is the sub-headline public

2260
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,472
Yeah

2261
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:32,544
Which is a subcategory of

2262
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:35,104
Militia

2263
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:41,504
These groups desire to Aid the county sheriff for governor in emergency such as a natural disaster it is not uncommon

2264
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,272
For these groups

2265
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:45,088
To be seen in public doing community service related work

2266
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:47,392
Public groups are less likely to poop

2267
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:48,416
Pushbullet

2268
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,440
Militia

2269
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:51,488
Never traditional military-style chain

2270
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:52,256
Expanded leadership

2271
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:56,864
These groups have been known to form underground units and provide training

2272
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,632
And guidance

2273
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:59,424
Do new or forming organization

2274
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:02,752
These groups have been known to does not mean all of

2275
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:05,568
Do that just means these group

2276
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,408
You see a public group

2277
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,944
That is into

2278
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:12,480
Institution

2279
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:14,016
Or Ron Paul

2280
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:15,296
That doesn't mean that there

2281
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,880
Does not imply that you

2282
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:20,160
Then become suspicious

2283
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:22,464
That they also have underground sale

2284
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:23,744
The only way you

2285
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,280
That is if you're warping

2286
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:29,632
He should learn to read

2287
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:30,912
So

2288
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:32,704
In the interim

2289
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,728
Between the 11th

2290
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:34,496
The 12th

2291
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:36,032
Alex

2292
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:39,104
He's had Rob Dutra

2293
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,384
Investigate this my Act

2294
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:45,504
That must have been like a Three Stooges

2295
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:49,856
He had one job and that was basically to confirm this and get some

2296
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:56,256
Quotes from the Missouri Highway Patrol

2297
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:58,560
No

2298
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:00,864
He has a confirmation

2299
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:02,400
That is a real

2300
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:03,936
Document from talking to

2301
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:07,008
To the people at the Missouri information analysis Center

2302
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:08,032
Is what my ex

2303
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:12,896
Express what he's worth

2304
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:14,176
And then we see what

2305
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:21,856
And I called him he's at the state highway patrol I want to see if you want to come on and talk about the report

2306
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:28,512
Give me the date I said we got this in and if he's interested come on talking about we love to talk about and he confirm

2307
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:30,048
That it was theirs and it's

2308
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:32,352
He wanted to give me a quote

2309
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,120
MBA

2310
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:36,704
Any normal operation

2311
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:38,240
Four officers

2312
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:42,848
Pensive quote and quote

2313
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:46,176
Safety purposes into track Trends or changes

2314
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:50,272
And he said more but that's what I wrote down that's all I want to say that

2315
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:06,144
Paraphrase reporters do that basically what else

2316
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:16,384
So this is exactly what Alex did when Rob do talk to his investigating

2317
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:19,456
This is what

2318
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:20,992
I was trying to be a reporter

2319
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:22,016
2009

2320
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:24,832
He's unwilling or at least busy

2321
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,600
Inclined

2322
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:29,440
To just embellish and make stuff up

2323
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:30,464
Prob

2324
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:32,000
Reporter

2325
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,048
You don't have to have these standards that's

2326
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:35,584
Not what reporters do

2327
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:38,400
You can just say what did you feel when you were talking to him

2328
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,424
Hey Rogers

2329
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:44,288
Rub you rub you literally was just like

2330
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:48,384
Analysis like

2331
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:56,320
That's what I want from you the part that's making you do a terrible job is your inability to

2332
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,344
Just Bluff

2333
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:58,880
Just

2334
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,160
Take the governor off

2335
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:04,768
And start sucking

2336
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,816
Pretty much all the stuff you'd already said which

2337
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,608
Cuz they confirmed

2338
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:11,680
Training

2339
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:13,216
In law enforcement

2340
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:15,008
And yours without

2341
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,032
I respond

2342
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:28,576
Alex

2343
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:30,112
I said what he said

2344
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:35,744
And now I'm going to continue I'm uncomfortable with the position you're putting me

2345
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,536
There yet Alex

2346
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:42,912
I'm not ready to lie I need to take UCB level 1 class

2347
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:44,960
Flow with your b******* man

2348
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:46,240
Yeah so

2349
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,520
Eddie McGee

2350
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:53,920
Frustrated cuz Rob do just repeat the same innocuous information that he got from the phone call and say this is how we respond

2351
02:01:54,944 --> 02:02:01,088
Now we already covered that was a short conversation

2352
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:02,368
But you know

2353
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:04,672
They don't want to talk about it they want to hide in the shadows

2354
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:05,696
Give me the

2355
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:22,848
Rob Kovach

2356
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:24,896
We're going to get the head of HR

2357
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:26,688
Fitbit next

2358
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:28,224
And a teach you how to lie

2359
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:28,992
Right

2360
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:33,344
Get Buckley with a baseball bat keep you company

2361
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,136
Just flap it against his hand

2362
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:43,584
Although

2363
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,656
Deception

2364
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:48,192
Super funny

2365
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:49,728
Keeps

2366
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:51,520
You just won't go for it

2367
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,896
Be exactly the same

2368
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:58,944
Is like I said with his uncle

2369
02:02:59,456 --> 02:02:59,968
Situation

2370
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:03,808
Just saying the quote has kept trying to get him

2371
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:07,136
It's fascinating that he is such a bully

2372
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:10,976
It's up

2373
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:14,048
Exception

2374
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,912
Which is understandable

2375
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:22,240
It's a documentary release Alex's

2376
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:24,800
Says the FBI's afraid of them putting it out

2377
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,360
Ends up making a claim

2378
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:29,152
YouTube channel

2379
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:31,200
There's literally no

2380
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:36,320
And by the way the Alex Jones Channel which was

2381
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:43,232
We appreciate all his work

2382
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:51,424
Number one

2383
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:58,592
Paul Watson

2384
02:04:01,152 --> 02:04:02,688
The link

2385
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:10,624
Bachata number one YouTube channel

2386
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:12,928
Numero Uno

2387
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:15,232
Uno

2388
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:20,096
Very very very

2389
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,264
I don't know how exciting it is

2390
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:29,824
What are the number one channel

2391
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,128
It's exciting

2392
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,152
I am

2393
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:35,200
I think we would be excited

2394
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:36,480
More

2395
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:38,784
I would be laughing I know yeah

2396
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:43,648
I know ASMR I hadn't really taken off yet

2397
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:47,488
I'm still going to go out of the Alex Jones Channel

2398
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,816
They're actually

2399
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:53,632
What is number one

2400
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:57,472
I mean both subscribers most views what does it mean or what is it mean

2401
02:04:57,728 --> 02:05:01,056
He's being so vague as to it not being anything you could possibly look up

2402
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:02,080
He doesn't have the most

2403
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:03,104
Subscribers that is

2404
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:06,176
Is that now that information public it was some kid

2405
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:08,736
Skip-it 2009 was the

2406
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:09,504
Does the number exact

2407
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,272
Red

2408
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,560
I missed out on a lot of Internet culture

2409
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:26,912
Most downloads

2410
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:28,192
Him either that that's not

2411
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:29,472
The only thing I think

2412
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:31,008
Is possible is because he's just

2413
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:32,544
Release the documentary

2414
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,568
Deception

2415
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:35,616
It's possible that he's Rising

2416
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:40,736
Through the ranks like maybe he got mostro through whatever

2417
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:43,040
Yeah yeah those lines

2418
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:45,856
Interpreting that as being the number one channel

2419
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:48,160
You're number one in

2420
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:52,000
Yeah there whatever that chart would be called

2421
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:53,792
Are you saying

2422
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:54,560
You're not

2423
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:55,328
I bet

2424
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:59,936
Excite even could be like

2425
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:01,984
Just some random ass blog was like

2426
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:05,568
My number one YouTube channel is out

2427
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:08,640
Zenni Optical

2428
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:12,480
It's possible that he's number one

2429
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:14,272
Some sort of like subcategory

2430
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:20,416
Like political Channel

2431
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:24,256
Looking for books

2432
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:25,024
Stuff like that

2433
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:27,584
These crazy people like that Alex's

2434
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,376
Are you

2435
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:32,192
In the subcategory of like

2436
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:33,472
Army

2437
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:34,752
Survivalism

2438
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:38,080
Breakdown of all the subcategories

2439
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:40,640
Number 2014

2440
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,944
Got to do better there

2441
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:50,880
Anyway it's almost

2442
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:51,648
Supercilious

2443
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:52,928
It's all I mean it's just

2444
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,464
It's almost with button

2445
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,000
It's redundant at this point

2446
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:57,536
Alex

2447
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:01,632
Nope that would also be redundant.

2448
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:03,424
Is about the miac report

2449
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:04,704
This is really

2450
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:06,752
The Narrative that he's going to put forth

2451
02:07:07,008 --> 02:07:07,776
In the future

2452
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:11,104
It's taken shape already here on March 12th

2453
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:11,872
And it's

2454
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:12,640
Bully

2455
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:13,664
Fully intact

2456
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:20,832
Okay they didn't report that Ron Paul supporters are all day

2457
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:32,608
The articles

2458
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:36,192
So that's not if it's just not true

2459
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:37,984
It's not true based on the report

2460
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:41,056
And now that he's already put it out and that's his narrative

2461
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:43,616
He's going to move forward with it to the point where

2462
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:47,200
I remember episodes in like the 2015 stuff we're talkin about

2463
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:53,600
In the past you've brought up the miac report

2464
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,928
A childish

2465
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:58,720
Rhetorical

2466
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:00,768
It's entirely babe

2467
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:02,816
On Alex not understanding

2468
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:04,352
The rules of inference

2469
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:05,120
And how language

2470
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:06,656
That's all it is

2471
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:08,192
Just saying

2472
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:09,472
Most

2473
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:10,752
Militia members

2474
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:12,032
That we've studied

2475
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:13,056
Support

2476
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:15,104
Individuals like Ron Paul

2477
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:16,384
Does not

2478
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,944
Equivalates not be president of saying

2479
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,992
If you like Ron Paul you're probably tear

2480
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:22,016
Yeah

2481
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:22,784
Just

2482
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:25,600
Like this is why I talked about a lot

2483
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:27,136
Maybe much more in the past

2484
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:28,416
I still believe it

2485
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,976
Essential education

2486
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:32,256
For children

2487
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:33,280
Has to be under

2488
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:34,048
Understanding of

2489
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:36,352
Has to be logic

2490
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:37,632
Like those sorts of things

2491
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:39,936
Part of every curriculum

2492
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:41,472
For every kid growing up

2493
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:43,776
Because if you understand those things

2494
02:08:44,288 --> 02:08:45,056
You can't be tricked

2495
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:46,592
You just can't

2496
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:48,384
If you understand

2497
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,408
Baseline

2498
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:50,944
Linguistics logic

2499
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:54,528
Like not even Advanced predicate logic

2500
02:08:56,832 --> 02:09:01,184
You saying those words but if you just understand very basic

2501
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:04,256
You can just go in and look at this and see like

2502
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:09,120
Oh I see what they're saying

2503
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:10,656
Cuz he doesn't

2504
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:11,936
It allows you

2505
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:13,216
To cut through the b******* you

2506
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:14,240
You can parse the argument

2507
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:15,264
Parse the sentence

2508
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:16,288
And it's

2509
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:17,312
Ez2c like

2510
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:20,896
I wish I could just sit down and talk to you Alex

2511
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:22,432
Do you know why

2512
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:23,712
You're misunderstanding

2513
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:25,760
Send a text that back realize

2514
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:26,784
He doesn't care

2515
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:28,576
Probably jr.

2516
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:35,488
This one kind of leans towards the dumb Spectrum

2517
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:36,768
For defensive

2518
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,840
Are you at you and then like

2519
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:43,424
Misunderstanding or how long for

2520
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:45,216
Yeah

2521
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:48,800
BFB I edit most racist wasn't even like

2522
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:51,872
Black Panthers are violent terrorist

2523
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:57,248
Everybody needs to be put in jail but they're not all violence

2524
02:09:58,016 --> 02:10:00,064
Sure

2525
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:03,904
Darling

2526
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:08,768
Jesus I'm excited because like I said earlier

2527
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:10,304
Beginning

2528
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:11,840
I am coming in

2529
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:13,632
Next episode

2530
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:14,656
March 3rd

2531
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:18,496
Expecting it's going to be all more my exports.

2532
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:21,312
I bet it's not I bet I'm wrong

2533
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:26,432
I bet crazy

2534
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:31,296
Hour-and-a-half of March 12th

2535
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:32,576
2009

2536
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:34,112
Brings back onto the show

2537
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:36,672
Doctor not dr. Rebecca Carley

2538
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:49,216
Great

2539
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:49,984
Is the doctors

2540
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,776
Years before 2009

2541
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:52,800
Had her license

2542
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:56,384
To be trusted to practice

2543
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:57,664
Anna public

2544
02:10:59,456 --> 02:11:00,736
Sheroes anti-vax movement

2545
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:02,272
Because that same to look

2546
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:05,600
Congratulations Alex

2547
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:09,696
So much weird shift

2548
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:11,232
I actually

2549
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:16,096
Stepping back now I really don't think that I did a great job of explaining

2550
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,912
Because quite honestly I could have done it

2551
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:19,680
Much prefer

2552
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,496
I think I could have just said

2553
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:24,288
It's a description

2554
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:26,080
Militia groups

2555
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:28,896
1/4 minutes.

2556
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:31,712
Commonalities Trends things that they've noticed

2557
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:34,272
Albertsons misrepresenting it by trying to

2558
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:35,296
To invert the logic

2559
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:37,600
I'm saying that

2560
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:39,904
Commonalities these similarities

2561
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,208
If you have those similarities about you

2562
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:43,488
You are that abolition

2563
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,280
I think it's that simple

2564
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:48,352
Explain it in like two or three sentences

2565
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:49,120
Hey wife

2566
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:53,472
It's not good because at this time and in the 80s

2567
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:55,264
A lot of law enforcement

2568
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,288
Infiltrated

2569
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:57,312
These militia

2570
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:00,384
There's a lot of

2571
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:02,432
Militia groups there is a copper

2572
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:08,576
Undercover just monitoring just like hey we know militia groups bomb places

2573
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:11,904
Let's have a guy who's going to let us know

2574
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:15,232
Like a lot of that whenever you talk about

2575
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:19,584
The we stop this militia group from blowing up

2576
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,632
Oklahoma City

2577
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:26,752
That most likely because there was a guy in there providing information

2578
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:31,872
It wasn't like a cop was walking by going like

2579
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:35,200
Over there

2580
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:36,736
Like these guys have Intel

2581
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:40,064
It's probably part of what the miac report is written

2582
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:42,112
Undercover

2583
02:12:42,368 --> 02:12:44,416
Sharing information about the different

2584
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:46,976
Militia groups that there

2585
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:53,376
That's why it's accurate sure the report is it prescription

2586
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:59,520
Aren't like hey if you see a guy who is a sovereign citizen

2587
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,616
Doing all of this stuff

2588
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:08,480
But that's the thing it's not even prescribed

2589
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:10,528
It's really just ripped

2590
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:16,672
It's all just a study of the militia groups that they have

2591
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:17,440
They have

2592
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:21,280
Overabundance of information

2593
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:23,584
And that's why when you look at this

2594
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,888
Ashley 9 years later there is so much

2595
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:27,168
Rings so true

2596
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:29,472
Like all of you guys

2597
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:31,008
You guys knew about this back then

2598
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:31,776
Right

2599
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:35,104
We should have done something

2600
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:39,968
Infiltrated

2601
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:44,832
Portsmouth and the military Arts

2602
02:13:45,088 --> 02:13:49,440
Crazy dance

2603
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:50,464
Here's the thing

2604
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:53,024
What they described in there

2605
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,816
Is unfortunately also

2606
02:13:57,376 --> 02:13:57,888
It's true

2607
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:01,984
Like the idea that people in militias that are dangerous

2608
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,520
Support Ron Paul

2609
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:04,544
Is true

2610
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:05,824
Generally speaking

2611
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:06,592
That is true

2612
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:09,920
Zeitgeist

2613
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:10,944
The Turner Diaries

2614
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:14,528
An anti-tax documentaries like Aaron Russo freedom to Fascism

2615
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:16,320
Is also

2616
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:17,088
True

2617
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:21,696
True true

2618
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:23,744
True ohyeah

2619
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:28,352
Shutdown

2620
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:29,632
Nature Reserve

2621
02:14:30,144 --> 02:14:33,472
Will like nothing in here necessarily nothing in this

2622
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:34,752
Rings

2623
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,056
Think descriptively

2624
02:14:37,312 --> 02:14:37,824
False

2625
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:45,504
Alex talks about like how we

2626
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,784
Ties run pulse

2627
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:47,808
Supporters in with whites

2628
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:55,744
The part that they're talking about like milk

2629
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,280
