That sort of response from people but I appreciate everyone that loved it that's great news I hadn't already

52
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:26,080
I'm sorry we don't get to hear him say that he renounces Jesus Christ

53
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616

Are they really sweet

66
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
Also

67
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399

68
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935

71
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,879
Absolutely not a big deal out of the time for people who are

72
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,695
People donating

73
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
When there are a lot of people

74
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
Come together

75
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
They donate a little bit it makes a massive difference

76
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
So much

77
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423

So that's great

80
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
You have a productive level

81
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
When you only put in 78 hours of the hours are still a bit of a mess but we're close to a

82
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:17,183
Basic entry level salary

Stella h

Probably

90
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,511
Is January 2nd 2000

91
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,519
I'm close to that just because of how much time I spent listening to his shift

92
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
2009

93
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
I listen to the first

94
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
Cuz I thought like let's get this

95
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
Real New Years on Earth

96
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,479
Are you going

97
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,295
Bulshit deconstruction of how afraid he is

98
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063

Alex

101
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:31,167
Part his ideas about the FEMA camps about this but

102
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
I know he's going to do it again

103
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,519
We can do it then

104
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,871
I don't want to exhaust the listeners so I understand

105
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
I checked in on the 2nd

106
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,735
I found

107
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Interesting hours

108
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,319
Jumping all over the place

109
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,135
We're going to start

110
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
It's about how Muslim

111
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Outta control

112
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,631

115
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,247
Bombings firework attacks rates

116
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,391
Nearby bars for City

117
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,487
It has been vomiting uprising

118
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,071
There's just done as an exercise of dominance over

119
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
Coming up

120
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:40,543
The slaves in this context

121
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,615
If you're missing

122
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639

Are the white.

124
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,295
The people of the West

125
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
So this is this is crazy

126
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
Already

127
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Tell him to

128
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Hold the brakes

129
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
For a little bit

130
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,535
Because I want to starting to your claiming the Muslims are terrorizing everyone

131
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,839
Totally forgetting to

132
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,239
To cover what the weather for the rest of the show

133
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,639
Man was arrested after he drove his car through group of immigrants shortly after midnight on New Year's Eve

134
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,271
Including the list of those injured by the attack were four year old boy a ten-year-old girl

135
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
Turkish descent

136
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
He was a German citizen

137
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,159
Quote

138
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
While being arrested

139
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,487
Independent

140
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
Clear intention to kill foreigners

141
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
Interior minister

142
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,887
For the state

143
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,703
Herbert Rel

144
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
PA

145
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
That was a clear active

146
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Xenophobia

147
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
There was another car attack on

148
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
This one in Tokyo

149
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,711
Twenty-one-year-old Captain Hero cast

150
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
Drove his car through the Narrow Street leading

151
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,671
What was really important run

152
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
You are a lot

153
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
The injured 9 people

154
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
It was an act of terrorism but it wasn't Muslim

155
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Alex

156
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,423
Protest

157
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
And you refuse to even defend his axe

158
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:18,079
In the name of protesting something

159
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
But he thought was way worse

160
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
That's kind of interesting

161
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
It's a little bit interesting

162
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,503
I mean marriage covering

163
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,903
The back are attacked the Muslim stabbing people and stuff like that

164
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,719
Seems like this might be something relevant to fold into

165
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
The conversation

166
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,303
Guy who went on an attack

167
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,399
Specifically trying to kill immigrants or if it's this guy was protesting

168
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
The death penalty

169
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
In Japan

170
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,263
Except the problem is that he wasn't a political terrorist

171
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
General

172
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:54,175
He was protesting the death penalty as it was specifically applied to members of the album called

173
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,503
Who are executed for their actions on March

174
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
20

175
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
T95

176
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:05,695
They were doomsday cult believe that they were the only people who were going to survive independent global war

177
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,535
A building Bala after everybody else

178
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
Who killed a bike

179
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,167
But they work this kind of like let's wait and let the war happen kind of called

180
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,007
They were let also go kill people and see if we can help this war start kind of

181
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,615
In 1990 they fielded a number of candidates for office but lost

182
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
The Freemasons

183
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
It's for their failure

184
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:33,343
In response they began trying to harvest botulism toxin in order to prepare chemical attack

185
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,743
To trigger a war between Japan and the United States

186
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
This was unsuccessful

187
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
Because they did a really shity job of harvesting the botchling

188
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,703
L I was in a state of disorientation

189
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,823
He began to make his doomsday prophecies more specific

190
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
Can you publish the book

191
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
I called declaring myself

192
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
The Christ

193
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
Interesting Lee he began to outline

194
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Who exactly the enemy was

195
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
And though he previously list

196
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
Freemasons in

197
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
Now he was warning of a

198
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
Conspiracy between those groups

199
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
The Dutch and British royal family

200
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
Which sounds weirdly familiar to me

201
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
I don't know why

202
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:17,887
I can't I can't think of why but it seems I feel like we touched on this at least once maybe one

203
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,983
This is this is this is a race

204
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,031
Thought that I'm having

205
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,847
Feel like you can't be anti-Semitic

206
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:32,735
I feel like you are you're on the wrong side of us

207
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,831
I don't I don't like that thought it's a weirdly races

208
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,439
They attempt to the number of chemical and biological attacks in the intervening years

209
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
Edgeworth anthrax

210
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,607
Luckily the strains of Anthrax a required we're not ones that hurt people

211
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,191
They were responsible for at least ten confirmed chemical weapons attacks

212
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
Late night

213
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
1995

214
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,847
But the one that got them in the most trouble with the one on March 20th

215
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:04,479
At the peak of morning rush hour five members of The Cult released sarin gas in the Tokyo subway

216
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,063
Killing 12 people and severely severely injuring 50

217
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,623
Seymour complication

218
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Attack

219
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,463
Surveys of the survivors found that many of them still suffer from

220
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
PTSD

221
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
And 20% feel unsafe

222
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Publix

223
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
47 survivors have been certified as disabled

224
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,751
The reason I lay all this out is because there's a bigger world out there that I would want no part in touch

225
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,823
The attack in Germany was clearly an anti-immigrant attack.

226
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
Call Alex

227
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Cuz rhetoric

228
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,711
The attack in Japan was carried out by a young man with protest

229
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
The death sentences

230
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
The carried many of the same beliefs

231
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
Enemies is Alex.

232
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
He can't wrestle with these ideas without pointing out some

233
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
Problems with his own message

234
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
And how he chooses

235
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Deliver it

236
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,047
Aggressively stirs up hatred

237
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
Fear of the vague Muslim attacks

238
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
CiCi's happening everywhere

239
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
It's very sad

240
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,471
Realize

241
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
60s

242
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
Yukio Mishima the incredible

243
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Novelist

244
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,807
To the prime minister's housebroken with samurai sword

245
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
Installed

246
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
The emperor back

247
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
Supreme leader in order to get rid of all of the

248
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
The foreigners who

249
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
This is kind of a

250
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
Later version of that

251
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,495
Alex is going to

252
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
Muslim

253
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
Throwing fireworks

254
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Some stuff like that

255
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
In reality

256
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,479
On New Year's Eve have a lot more to talk about if you want to look at

257
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
Like other events that have happened

258
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
Or as important more important

259
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
I'm just saying

260
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,463
You're not looking at the big picture Alex you're looking at your narrative

261
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,047
Your editorial position is anti-muslim

262
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
Hey there for the only stories that

263
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
See fit to cover

264
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Are these ones that

265
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Integrate

266
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Do that editorial position

267
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Right now I think it's lame

268
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
And when I first heard that I was like

269
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:10,431
Well at least I'll get to learn a little bit more about this about it

270
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:15,295
But at the same time

271
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,111
Episode where we're going

272
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
Talk a little bit more about events

273
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
The new year

274
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Promises out of the gates

275
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Linking up with

276
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:38,591
Trump and Putin and others

277
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
Public Schools

278
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
Pedophile agenda of sexualizing children

279
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
They're putting a place around 2nd Amendment

280
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Whoopty s***

281
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,695
The idea of like

282
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,255
Getting their own Second Amendment and stuff like that that's just

283
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
100 not centered in Brazil very clear lake

284
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
Bolsonaro

285
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,615
If I played Alex's game I might just refer to someone

286
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
NBC news headline

287
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,503
Panaro targets minorities on first day in office

288
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,807
But even that isn't enough to tell the full story

289
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
Jerry bolsonaro's

290
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Fascist

291
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Be incredibly worried

292
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
Because bolsonaro is very close with the oligarchs

293
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Agribusiness

294
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
Miss World was strongly against the idea

295
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Protective

296
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
Indigenous population

297
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,543
Responsibilities involved what lands are protected

298
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,359
From the Justice Ministry to the agriculture

299
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
The clear track record as opposing native

300
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
These arguments on the sub

301
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
Nope

302
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Protecting

303
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,367
Bolsonaro

304
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
The program that isn't he

305
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
Interested in reaching the agribusiness

306
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,535
People

307
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
And the native Brazil

308
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
Version of Brazilian Society

309
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,007
Is this being done to I don't know the hours for absolutely

310
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
The flip out

311
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
And I don't need you to predict

312
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,663
I've heard him constantly go on about how FDA regulations on Amish sold

313
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,711
Cheese are an attack on their self

314
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:26,367
This is also add retina all this stuff is also a direct attack on environmentalism but regardless

315
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159
It's being done to help big business

316
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
And will likely lead to the genocide

317
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
On contact

318
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
The tribes in the Amazon

319
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,887
Summit so many of them are literally uncontacted

320
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,215
We're not supposed to

321
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
But like the one a****** who

322
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
Ground situation

323
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,271
As Bi-Rite would like to call it

324
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,927
Bolsonaro also remove the lgbtq community of concerns and responsibilities

325
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
The human rights

326
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,743
Ministry

327
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
Become

328
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,607
The new human rights minister is an Evangelical preacher named Tamara Salva

329
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,959
Who believes quote the Brazilian family is being threatened by diversity policy

330
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
Oh my f****** God I hate

331
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,823
Journalists are happy

332
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
There's so much more

333
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
Critically dangerous

334
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
We're going to watch the game

335
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
Human rights disaster

336
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
Play out right in front of our eyes

337
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
And now it's going to Delight

338
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Because

339
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
Behind the human suffering and Terror

340
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,903
The stock market went up in Brazil bolsonaro came

341
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,767
The widely popular opponent bolsonaro Hedge

342
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
What's a socialist

343
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:43,167
Bolsonaro interop seem like friends really all Alex

344
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
In order to

345
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
Be like grey

346
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
Because Alex

347
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
Much like Jerry bolsonaro

348
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
Is a monster

349
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
These people are terrible

350
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,455
This is a really really really important

351
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Brazil to take

352
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,271
Because just

353
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
What four years ago

354
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
The right-wing

355
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:10,303
Installed Tamara who is barred from f****** running

356
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
For the office

357
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,351
He was given

358
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
The Supreme Court just

359
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Brazil

360
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
Sanely hard

361
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,847
They elected a f****** out now fashion

362
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
Facebook for years

363
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,223
So in case it is never going to

364
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Descendant

365
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,319
Let's let's hold up pump the brakes there

366
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
All of this supported by the oligarchs

367
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,183
Who controlled most of the f****** media

368
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
Getting involved too and like

369
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Just all our

370
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
It's all a complete mess

371
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
It is indicative of of like

372
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:54,079
Things you need to look out for things to keep an eye on

373
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Cuz it's going to get worse

374
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,895
It's going to be humanitarian organization

375
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Support in order to

376
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
Mitigate the damage that's going

377
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Because

378
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271

382
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,879
Whether it be

383
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:14,559
Basically just destroy by way of claiming that they should

384
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
Like all that stuff

385
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
Never seen that

386
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,447
Group of people

387
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Claim that native

388
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Assimilated

389
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Ultimately to amass

390
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
Types of genocide

391
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
No

392
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,967
Don't have tons of case studies

393
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Alex

394
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
I feel like

395
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
Revealing himself

396
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
How to not be

397
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
Good

398
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:46,815
Compiler of the news

No no

Bric-a-brac

402
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,415
I think they had multiple Seasons dedicated to it

403
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Abyss

404
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
Intimidation

405
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
Really big

406
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
Something really really big

407
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
That I'm going to tell you about

408
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,919
Ominous storm clouds

409
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,271
We'll break it down when we come back in just 60 Seconds

410
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:43,903
Newswars.com tomorrow's news today

411
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:51,071
That is almost as hell

412
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
He used the term storm

413
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
Intentionally

X-Men fan

417
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
This

418
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
He's going to culminate in Alex saying something

419
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
I do believe could have legal

420
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
I think that he might be

421
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:19,488
This is on par with him telling on-air that he told Rodger

422
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
The contact us like this is like

423
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
Alex is getting real sloppy

424
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:28,704
Some of the stuff he ends up saying about this big story that you got

425
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
No

426
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Hannah wants to go to

427
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,360
What's go to jail

428
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,176
Because where he's at right now all he's got left his martyrdom

429
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,736
I think he want

430
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,320
Get tried for something and win on

431
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,600
Free Speech grounds

432
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,184
Or something like that

433
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Deeply enough

434
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:56,608
But fall back on like I was just saying things I want

435
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,656
Something like that

436
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
We can get caught up in

437
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
The courts

438
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
Like have his opportunity to grandstand

439
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,360
And stuff like that knows you knows the track is on now

440
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
Leads to diminishing return

441
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,712
It is show just falling apart

442
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,808
I don't know I don't know I think there is a chance that you really think

443
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,416
I'm not going to give too much away but I think

444
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,768
He might actually believe is true

445
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,560
Would you mind actually believe

446
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,840
The stuff you say

447
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:34,752
We can't get too into this without the actual contest

448
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
Visit

449
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,968
Oh yeah recalled when overdue

450
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Hesitant

451
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,856
Without telling anybody

452
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
First Security

453
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
Concerns

454
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Or something

455
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
No that's bad

456
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:03,168
You don't like it when people just don't call and show up at your house

457
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,472
Actually not if their president and I am

458
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,824
It's weird

459
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
Diplomacy there otherwise

460
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
Essentially sayings

461
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:21,088
Push back on because about another problem

462
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
Was Trump's visit

463
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,928
After Alex misunderstand

464
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Those Critters

465
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,072
It is mind-blowing

466
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,656
You can't version of reality

467
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,264
And so often I don't even respond to it on air anymore

468
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,848
Because it's so Brazen it's so ridiculous it's so insane

469
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,712
Photos of Obama going into warzone

470
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,552
Some of the trips coming up and wanting them p.m. to shine

471
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
His autograph

472
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,464
Military code

473
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
I call it the chicken

474
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:10,240
Shu know what T dimension

475
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,824
How do you get so low that you're trying to figure out the

476
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,640
Army soldiers

477
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
Kind of sounds like

478
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,968
Stuff you and your guys do all the time

479
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,576
We have a way with words the chicken shot dimension

480
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,072
F*** it I'm Gore Vidal in this b****

481
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
Do we all live in the chicken

482
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:44,288
According to Alex yes absolutely

483
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:49,408
It's good to know that they're going through the dictionary of

484
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:55,808
I think they just realize we have too much fun

485
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,864
Kier is specifically that when Trump win over and visited

486
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,448
The Rock his people put out

487
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Video of him

488
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,520
Taking pictures with soldiers

489
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
That's

490
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,896
The soldiers who were captured in those pictures

491
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:27,296
Were members of Like SEAL Teams that you aren't supposed to know where they are

492
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
Are there with the president

493
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:35,488
You're not always with you're not supposed to know there in a rock

494
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
Very

495
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,352
Specialized teams

496
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,400
So the issue isn't so much

497
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
Like

498
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
You put out pictures of himself with

499
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
No one really cares about that

500
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
In the past

501
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,872
Presidents would have listened to their advisors

502
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,920
And been careful enough not

503
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,248
To be on camera or if you are

504
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
Keep it private

505
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,344
Keep it a private picture for that soldiers when I died

506
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,672
Don't release pictures of people who are in secret

507
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,000
That then give people

508
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:14,400
Bulshit remember whenever Obama leaves that picture with him and Hillary Clinton and they were in the situation

509
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:19,008
Watching SEAL Team Six kill Osama bin Laden

510
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Yeah

511
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:26,688
They just revealed where Seal Team 6 was

512
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:31,040
Picture Show

513
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,088
Hillary p

514
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:37,952
I don't know I remember him releasing the video of him peeing on the Wailing Wall

515
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
Just she

516
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
ALEKS syntek

517
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Understanding why people

518
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Concerned about that

519
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,472
I don't know I'm not a military guy so I don't really fully understand

520
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,264
How big of an infraction

521
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
Can this is

522
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
But I read stuff

523
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
On it enough

524
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
To knows it like it is

525
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,432
This is a breach of protocol for sure

526
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
But I understand

527
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
People

528
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,624
Stop him you know like I don't know but someone's to blame

529
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,464
I don't in terms of things about Trump I don't really care about this one for

530
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
Particularly

531
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
And not because I don't think

532
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,608
Could be severe understand it

533
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,168
If I fully understood it then I can talk about it more

534
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,704
I just air on the side of the

535
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
People who know what they're

536
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,336
Well the simpler one is the first thing he started with with

537
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,872
A lot of a lot of soldiers

538
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,896
Clamoring for Obama

539
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
Autograph

540
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
However

541
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,272
Campaign materials

542
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,856
Not good

543
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
Right

544
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:43,488
That's against the rules it was ghosts of Obama to bring like

545
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,584
Wheaties boxes with himself on them to autograph

546
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,192
Average rookie card primitive time

547
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,776
Come on man you didn't play pro ball

548
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,128
You know that's not great

549
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
Misrepresenting stuff

550
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
It's still kind of like

551
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
We're getting into

552
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
With too much

553
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
Behind him

554
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
2

555
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
Denigrate

556
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,464
The Fantasticks

557
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,280
Right I just

558
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Wonder

559
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
Toast

560
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
Were they more excited

561
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
I don't really care

562
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:32,640
That's 10 to me I understand I don't really care

563
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
Y'all like it's just

564
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:41,088
Go down the road of like

565
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,416
Well who cares about protecting these people whose

566
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,720
Specialized

567
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
Yeah but

568
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
I just don't care

569
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,376
I don't know

570
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:59,008
Really important that everybody and even the FBI released a report

571
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:04,384
I lured out of military and police Personnel are white

572
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Out now

573
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
There is no

574
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
Speaking of the military

575
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,856
Would have sent

576
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
He gets into

577
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
Complaining about Mitt Romney

578
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,744
Kuzma

579
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,352
This is Mitt Romney had some

580
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,888
Words about

581
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
Withdrawing

582
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Afghanistan

583
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,104
Ineffectual stupid words to make him look like he's a valuable critic of the president

584
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
The same time supporting literally

585
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,248
Put your own f****** face

586
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,320
On top of that she let him drive it

587
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
You f****** garbage

588
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,512
Criticize

589
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,840
What you talking about Afghanistan

590
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
A little bit

591
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
And I think

592
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
That he says something

593
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,728
Things that I take

594
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,800
Is already

595
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,384
Taking out of the 44 billion dollars a year

596
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
44 billion dollars

597
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:16,832
Horses out of Afghanistan how much lithium

598
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,880
Herb for batteries

599
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,672
Guess how much

600
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:26,048
How much of a b hundreds of rarest mineral

601
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:36,032
Sickly stabilize the railway and stabilize the highways and stabilizer

602
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
Tricom

603
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,104
Just like we always do that's globalism

604
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
And Trump knows that

605
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,456
The minute we pull out of there

606
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:48,320
LeBonheur Al-Qaeda are going to start blowing the Chinese faces up they already are

607
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,856
I'll be there on problem

608
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Chinese Bass

609
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
Instead

610
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,512
We guard

611
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,072
Flip flops

612
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
That is

613
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
Weird

614
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,704
Wild Things

615
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
Criticisms

616
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,128
Our various Wars I don't think I've heard him specifically likes

617
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:17,760
We should get out of there because they are going to blow up Chinese

618
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:21,344
We're just there protecting the Chinese mineral interest

619
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,904
Or something like that I don't think I've ever heard him say

620
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,464
Stuff like that before

621
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Say stuff like that

622
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,024
What is profoundly weird

623
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,048
Also

624
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,608
I believe that the number is closer to 95

625
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
Percent of the world

626
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Rare Earth

627
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,704
Minerals are

628
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
But extract

629
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,824
Goodbye China

630
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
Near-monopoly on

631
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,640
The industry

632
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,944
Extracting

633
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,576
Rare Earth minerals in China what they have control of it

634
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208
R2 just stop

635
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,792
Whatever problem

636
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
Knew it would be a problem

637
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
Is very mineral-rich

638
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
50 year old Sophia

639
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,032
Copper deposits

640
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,616
2010 more formal survey found that all things considered

641
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,920
There's likely a trillion dollars worth

642
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,480
Mineral resources in Afghanistan

643
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,552
2014 Afghanistan

644
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,368
Billion dollar contract with a Chinese state-owned

645
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,672
Coppertop

646
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,536
Their biggest iron deposits

647
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,144
I can find no evidence of Alex's 44 billion-a-year number

648
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:43,264
And honestly considering that one trillion dollar debt figure that's 9

649
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
And the fact that China is

650
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
Play when it comes to strip mining

651
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,944
I find it very unlikely that that number is active

652
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,480
I just can't

653
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,112
What time does she is actually a very

654
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
Political question

655
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
Which is what is the right

656
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,232
To do in terms of Afghanistan

657
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
Obviously as it stands now since

658
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
You can't rewrite

659
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
Do nothing is

660
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
The very badass

661
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,912
Because what would happen is most likely that

662
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
I wouldn't just start working too

663
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,520
Peach

664
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,056
That's an absurd idea

665
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
Suggested Alex Banks

666
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,640
The Terrorist on his side

667
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,736
Which is hard to square with his constant rhetoric about how Obama and Hillary created

668
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,296
These terrorist groups and they just do their bidding

669
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,856
I thought Hillary and Obama were in bed with China

670
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,904
Why would their terrorist armies attacked

671
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Chinese address

672
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,208
If we withdrew from the country

673
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:40,608
It's all globalism up top for terrorist

674
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:45,984
In the past

675
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,384
You don't f****** remember whenever I said it was their fault it like that

676
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
It's crazy

677
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
Because if he

678
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
If his worldview is

679
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Consistent then

680
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,160
Up top is the globalist

681
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
And they're controlling the

682
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:13,120
Hillary and Obama and controlling Puppet Master

683
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:17,984
These terrorist groups

684
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Attack each other

685
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
Especially

686
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,640
Extracted minerals and making money off it

687
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,944
You would understand if they fought against each other

688
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
The appearance

689
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,808
What is ostensibly

690
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,928
Your conspiracy no longer makes sense correctly

691
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,256
Play here's what his worldview says is going on

692
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,584
That he does not see his contradicting

693
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:48,704
The globalist control both the check comms and through

694
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
The terrorist

695
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,520
Moana just Obama and Hillary

696
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,104
Trump pulls out of

697
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
Assuming

698
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,432
Terrorists will attack the tricon

699
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,272
Even though the terrorists are controlled by the globalist by a proxy

700
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
And the check comes are controlled by the

701
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Globalist

702
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Entirely

703
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
The goal

704
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
I don't know

705
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:16,096
The most likely outcome if we were to

706
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
Withdraw and everything

707
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,728
These terrorist groups with Zen

708
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,872
Start

709
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,408
To take over some of these

710
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:34,272
Very lucrative mineral businesses

711
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,600
Industries or parts

712
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
So the government

713
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
You know that

714
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,328
Much more becoming

715
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,680
Realistic outcome

716
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,960
Unfortunately

717
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
All of us withdrawing

718
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,032
They were better plans

719
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
Could have been put in place to

720
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336
To begin with

721
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
There's a number of them

722
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,992
What would make more sense for them

723
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,784
To destroy the street

724
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,600
Because they don't

725
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:14,720
Don't even have engineers

726
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:21,120
Continue trying to take over power and then take over the contract with the Chinese operation

727
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,168
China has a very specifically like

728
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,240
Non moral foreign policy and terms of like

729
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,800
Especially economics

730
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:35,200
But there's that are

731
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
Perhaps

732
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:40,832
Against or morals of the world because there's money is Money Baby

733
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
Sure

734
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,416
Time is doing and what I'm doing

735
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,464
Is employing a strategy of soft power in a

736
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,512
Afghanistan

737
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Country's debt

738
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
2004

739
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,608
Are constantly working to ensure relationship

740
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,656
Friendship and cooperation

741
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,728
Many experts have noted that their strategy includes

742
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,496
The belief that

743
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,056
Should the country be listed out of abject poverty

744
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,128
Many of the problems that precipitate terrorism with ceased

745
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Exist

746
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,712
Whether or not their intention

747
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,528
Whether intentions are pure is a separate Quest

748
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,320
But I think it's safe to say

749
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,416
Bombing people indiscriminate

750
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,976
Is the one that we use in for a really long time

751
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,536
Of course you have to worry about China City

752
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,328
Human rights record and their oppressive

753
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:31,008
Investing in the natural resources there

754
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
To be an evil plan it seems like a better strategy

755
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
Because they aren't

756
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,432
I mean I'm sure there's some exploitation involved

757
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
But

758
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,480
They're doing isn't

759
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,040
Necessarily stealing all of this.

760
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:48,672
There's a mutual attraction stuff

761
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,976
Take copper from the country

762
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Which

763
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,024
In-N-Out

764
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,048
Like it

765
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
Corrupt system

766
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,608
So that works well

767
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
From out of the

768
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Have arranged

769
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:06,080
And based on the resources that are available Afghanistan they could end up

770
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:11,200
Becoming a very viable country could be a very stable

771
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,064
Affluent country

772
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,856
Based on what is there but

773
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
Because

774
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,904
I've added

775
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
It's the sort of political situation

776
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
What

777
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
Intuit

778
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,072
Time immemorial

779
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,864
Okay so you're saying that

780
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
On the one hand we have a merry

781
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,448
That has since

782
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
2003

783
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
We killed Millions upon millions of 9

784
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,808
Include all of the damage they've done to the economy

785
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Right

786
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,904
And then you have China that was like you guys have a lot of

787
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
Valuable stuff

788
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
What if we paid you for

789
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,792
And then when your people are pissed off and getting

790
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,096
You'll eventually have a thriving

791
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
Economy

792
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,424
Then you'll recognize that we were part of the party

793
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
From the very

794
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:10,592
We forgave your debt in 2004

795
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,640
Founders strategy

796
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,760
Operation

797
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
I have no idea

798
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
But just

799
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
Broad picture

800
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
Is it seems like

801
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
What we have

802
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
Pierre is

803
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,864
About to is it believed that

804
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,656
A e v

805
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,192
Mister Steal your stuff

806
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
Kind of operation

807
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,264
And they have all these

808
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,848
Like 44 billion dollars that they're making a year

809
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,664
If we pull out and

810
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
The terrorists start attack

811
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,528
Do you think Daisy

812
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,064
Hey run back to base

813
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,624
They're not like if that is what Alex

814
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:00,768
Then us getting militarily involved

815
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328
Killington

816
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,680
It doesn't but that's what I

817
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,520
That would probably be the natural

818
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Is give up this way

819
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
4 billion dollars

820
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
You're there making

821
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:18,176
China doesn't have a history of invading countries

822
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,480
And the only one right now.

823
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,016
Twisted in is Tibet

824
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
Add make

825
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
You sure that everybody in Tibet knows

826
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,440
And there's other issues for why that is

827
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,280
They don't have a long history of

828
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,632
I would assume and I would hope

829
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
And I would

830
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
Think that by now

831
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
Global

832
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,824
Community would recognize

833
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
That

834
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,664
And Afghanistan is a

835
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
Bad idea

836
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
We've got

837
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,272
Examples

838
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
And only making

839
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
It's true

840
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:07,072
Implied by Alex's world

841
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
It wouldn't happen

842
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
No matter what

843
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
But

844
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,960
The reality on the ground is what it is

845
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Alex

846
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
Talkingshit

847
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
Quite frankly

848
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:23,200
The big news

849
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
And even in this

850
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,320
I think Alex is stepping in a big old pile

851
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Not quite

852
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,608
Pictures of big enchilada

853
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,448
One way to classify information

854
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,056
Declassified

855
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,872
Very skilled hackers

856
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,943
Sorry having information Missouri

857
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,271
Release all the 9/11

858
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,343
On the clintons

859
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,023
You want to rock and roll baby you're going to rock and roll the actors have

860
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,839
18000 pages of the stand-down

861
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:17,471
911 bulwark.com and it's all about to be coming out let's stop right there

862
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,263
What the entire New York

863
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:27,711
He said there were bombs in the building

864
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,903
That's a few little tricks

865
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:40,255
Wild Ride is sort of

866
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,351
Meeting with the general

867
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:48,959
Before the storm Ernest to big qanon

868
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
The storm

869
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Reclaim

870
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,783
He wants to take over that space

871
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
In a whale

872
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:06,879
Now I know

873
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,415
This story is going to

874
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
To break what's

875
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
The real chick

876
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,791
That you are his

877
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
Quote hacker

878
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,887
And they are the ones really saying 18,000

879
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,423
No not so much

880
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:23,263
It's it's a little bit bigger than that

881
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
In terms of

882
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,591
There is

883
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
Come out about

884
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,431
We'll get into it more when Alex

885
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
2000 page

886
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
About the 9/11

887
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,647
Insurance policies

00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
Regal

889
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,207
Cases

890
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
That have come out of

891
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
Prove it

892
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,751
Second

893
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
In that clip I think it makes

894
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
Perfectly clear

895
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,151
That he's implying he has advanced knowledge of what's in those

896
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,687
Hack documents

897
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
Which no one should have

898
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
Because they're equipped

899
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,063
Know that there have been decryption key

900
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
Is that have been released

901
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
In order to show like

902
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
We have something

903
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
Right

904
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,023
But I do now hackers got them legally right

905
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,095
No but have no info

906
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
Information

907
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
And the fact that you can

908
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,703
Implying that he does occasion of

909
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,495
Being in touch

910
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287

Play F1

914
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
I'm leaning towards lying right now

915
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:43,391
Suggest that you have some

916
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:48,767
After we get to the end of this I'm not entirely sure that I can land on one or the other

917
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,815
Based on his actions later in this episode

918
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,863
To be f****** hilarious at the other place

919
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:02,079
I don't know what's going to happen I believe the documents

920
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
We get to that

921
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
I just

922
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,015
This is where the episode

923
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
I'm like yeah right this

924
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
Kacchan sometime

925
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,511
And yeah we know you're afraid of Muslims it's right

926
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:26,911
Three girls in a pool supply shop fireworks

927
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,983
Around holidays

928
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
New Year's Eve

930
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
Oh my God

931
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,223
Youth shooting fireworks

933
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,343
Right

934
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
I kind of perked up a little bit

935
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:53,023
Alex's mad Chris Cuomo

936
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,327
Maybe. Chris Cuomo Governor Cuomo

937
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,823

Contact was weird off

941
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:25,535
About the radio interview

942
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,351
Okay

943
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:33,471
Preemptively say like we have a far more democratic

944
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:38,335
Situation there but they're not going to investigate

945
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
Nobody said

946
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,711
Anybody who's investigating you

947
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
That's

948
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:49,855
Speech that he gave near Ellis Island

949
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
Talking

950
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,927
I think the contacts but I can

951
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
And honestly

952
00:46:54,207 --> 00:47:00,351
If I could do this all over again I probably would have gone and listen to the whole speech

953
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
Who sings just admit

954
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,191
It seemed to be something about the idea of like

955
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
Trump's relatives

956
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Immigrated

957
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,031
Kira nerys

958
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,567
The presidents

959
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,431
Immigrations great

960
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,223
But

961
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:20,575
No matter the case Alex is going to play a quip

962
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,111
And then

963
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Alex says something

964
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
That is

965
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,975
Raising literally crazy

966
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,815
Frederick Trump

967
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,119
Germany

968
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:39,519
And that's why we're closing

969
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:45,919
Trump's grandfather

970
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,223
3 months on Ellis Island quarantine

971
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,015
On record

972
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
That's interesting

973
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,135
Turn on record

974
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:59,999
On October 19th 1885 16 year old Frederick Trump arrived at Ellis Island

975
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:06,655
The thing is at Ellis Island as we know it the single we know about the one wears an Immigration Center run by the federal government

976
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,191
Exist until January 1st

977
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
7 years later

978
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,847
What was known as Garden immigration

979
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,895
Which is run by the state of New York

980
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:20,479
The federal government had to take over the operation after a ton of inside

981
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,271
Unnecessary death

982
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,831
Reports of state workers feeling indiscriminately from

983
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
Immigrants

984
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,391
And overall just outright

985
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
Corruption was found

986
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,951
Castle Garden was

987
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
The first immigration

988
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,999
Facility in the United States

989
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:36,607
2011

990
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
I became American

991
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,935
That's over 100

992
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,983
2000 / gear or 400

993
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,055
The story of trump being quarantined

994
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
For 3 months

995
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
Categorically not

996
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:51,711
Immigration records to my timer very precise so we know exactly when you arrived

997
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,271
I'm going to Blair's 2000 book

998
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
The trumps

999
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,087
Three generations that built an Empire

1000
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,647
Explicitly lights-out help me hours after

1001
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,415
Frederick Trump

1002
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,999
You met a german-speaking Barbara was looking

1003
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
Hiring assistant

1004
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
And that Frederick began working

1005
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,375
Day it stayed for 6 years

1006
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:18,591
Three months

1007
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Episode

1008
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:23,455
2014 we heard him lie about Ellis Island and the idea of it

1009
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,271
They are all these people were turned away because of

1010
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:32,671
All all the stuff

1011
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,439
Just trying to

1012
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,231
Already

1013
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
False narrative

1014
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
Ellis Island

1015
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,071
Being exactly like

1016
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,399
Immigration apologize for

1017
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,167
Detention Center

1018
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,471
Like he's trying to present this idea but

1019
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,799
You're mad that these kids are being held in camps but in reality

1020
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
When that's not

1021
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:51,871
True

1022
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,407
If you look at the history of Ellis Island

1023
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,431
A few people work

1024
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,735
And how quickly people got through

1025
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,783
And we're just now you're American

1026
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,879
You don't have a good case to change your name

1027
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,719
You don't have a good case to make though if you look at the reality and

1028
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,999
You try and use that to ended

1029
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:14,655
Some sort of like it's always been this way but immigration

1030
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,447
You can make that Arctic

1031
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,983
And that's what Alex is doing

1032
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,263
Internet service

1033
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,799
His purpose is on the second level

1034
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,567
Because I need

1035
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,871
Trump

1036
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:27,455
Trump his whole life has come from that

1037
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Really

1038
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:28,991
Careful

1039
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,039
Immigration

1040
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,111
Some stuff like that like even the guy

1041
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:38,463
Who's being a monster to Mexican immigrants and South American immigrants

1042
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
Like himself

1043
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
The product of

1044
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
The rigorous

1045
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:50,495
He's as much a victim as them trying to make them stronger than because they had to go through it now

1046
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,079
Presidential it's only if only

1047
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
If only we

1048
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,151
We quarantine all of these

1049
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,455
For 3 months

1050
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,479
Become president

1051
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
Right

1052
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
I think all of their off

1053
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,879
The story about Frederick Trump

1054
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
Hundred percent

1055
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
Very clearly on Recker

1056
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,231
He got through immigration

1057
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
And it wasn't

1058
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,559
Castle Gardens

1059
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,583
Ellis Island

1060
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:19,167
Which is the second point that I want to make

1061
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:22,495
About the idea of why Federal

1062
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,775
Or coughing

1063
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,079
Because run fix

1064
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
Debit corrupt

1065
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,175
As evidenced by Castle Gardens

1066
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,455
The reason why Ellis Island

1067
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:37,855
Had to be taken over by a federal organization

1068
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,999
67

1069
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,327
Point taken

1070
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,935
Rights of the States Federal friction there is

1071
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
Just one other point I want

1072
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,495
Highlights

1073
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,287
Is the story about Frederick Trump isn't

1074
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,591
And the only place you probably could be

1075
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,615
We getting it from

1076
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,639
Is Maybe

1077
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
Associates

1078
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,431
Trump

1079
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,783
Something like that

1080
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,343
That don't match history he's just making this stuff up

1081
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,623
Peacock

1082
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
He was a Nazi

1083
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,935
Tested for diseases

1084
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:29,311
I mean even does that funny voice about 12:00 to try and

1085
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,407
You don't talk about that

1086
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,967
It's not true

1087
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,039
Better directed at you

1088
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,063
Talk about that

1089
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:46,719
It would be hard for him to have talked about a live at

1090
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,743
After

1091
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,047
By the time of his speech

1092
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,143
He would have added that

1093
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:58,495
Why don't you try to track that down possibly about lecture

1094
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,031
Trying to find possible sources

1095
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
Where that story

1096
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
Compromise

1097
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
Like

1098
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,855
Impossible

1099
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,927
Exclude the possibility that

1100
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,487
Yeah I do think that's why I picked

1101
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,447
Yeah

1102
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,983
In the course of the

1103
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,007
Years that I was Island

1104
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,799
Castle Garden were open and all that stuff

1105
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,847
I'm certain the probably there were in

1106
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:41,247
A really long time

1107
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,551
Coming into were held for any amount

1108
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,599
Very very small

1109
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Maybe Rodger

1110
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
Alton

1111
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,511
Flight 42

1112
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,559
The bigger issue is just it's not true

1113
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,863
What even diseases would they test for

1114
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:02,495
It's in the 18 f****** 90 what are they what are they what testing procedure

1115
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,151
Can stuff it take sponsoring

1116
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
Be like

1117
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,759
Like we talked about

1118
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,039
Episode that I condition

1119
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,831
Indicative of a really

1120
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,159
Aegis

1121
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,975
Could do visual test

1122
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:26,047
Body

1123
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,839
I am back door

1124
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,447
Nope

1125
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,727
No f****** get out

1126
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
And that's why

1127
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,823
QuickBooks

1128
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,175
You got legs

1129
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,967
And I forgot

1130
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,295
I crawled up this f****** boat so

1131
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,575
It's all lot of s***

1132
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,415
It's nice to see Alex

1133
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,511
Because even that

1134
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:00,351
Innocuously Frederick Trump with quarantine for

1135
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,143
For three months at Ellis Island

1136
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,191
Isn't service of whiteness

1137
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:08,031
Like even that bit seems so disconnected

1138
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
From Alex's

1139
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,103
Pictures of the editorial position

1140
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,943
And therefore all the

1141
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,991
Cover

1142
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,527
Are these instances of

1143
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,807
A Muslim

1144
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,879
Running over someone with the car

1145
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:27,231
People running over people

1146
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,767
Tutorial position it just seems like

1147
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:35,423
Truck Trump has undercut like a

1148
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,215
Dismissal of the concern

1149
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,519
Of immigrants who Alex

1150
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,567
Classifies as

1151
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,639
Right and therefore us courage and a menace coming to him

1152
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:50,271
It's Bryson

1153
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:53,599
Well of course they let Frederick through he was white

1154
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,647
But I feel like that's underneath

1155
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:00,511
How do I instead of

1156
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,535
None dare call it

1157
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
Conspiracy

1158
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,095
Alex had just watched

1159
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,631
Fievel An American Tail

1160
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,959
Do you think we're being an entirely different universe

1161
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:13,567
Possibly the very least he wouldn't be anti-Semitic

1162
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,847
I tried watch that

1163
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,871
Not too long ago

1164
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,151
It was crazy

1165
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
It was it was

1166
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
First of all episode

1167
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
Crazy

1168
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:25,087
Like just from a content and then second from like

1169
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:30,975
You forget how rudimentary animation

1170
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,999
The cartoons from like

1171
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,071
50

1172
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
The newest Modern

1173
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:42,751
Like Toy Story Middle Ground

1174
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,799
Of like that like early 90

1175
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:48,127
Golden age

1176
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,663
It's pretty good but it's also like

1177
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:54,015
It's really weird to look at

1178
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,319
Fantastic and also.

1179
00:56:56,575 --> 00:57:02,719
Lot of racial stereotypes

1180
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,767
Tell me about Jews Coming to America

1181
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,607
It's a mess and then they move Western

1182
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,423
Let's not go too far down this

1183
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,007
Critiquing of cartoons roof

1184
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,543
What we're Alex

1185
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,567
Add a story

1186
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,871
He wants to cover

1187
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,175
He has another story wants to talk about

1188
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:30,879
Uncle says yes that's true last week we're going to ignore National sovereignty and ignore the vote

1189
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,279
200 officers

1190
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,887
Of the German military because they were planning to overthrow Merkle for treason

1191
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,703
Yeah the German tried to overthrow Hitler too

1192
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:50,591
Wish they would have

1193
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,711
Okay

1194
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
So

1195
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,039
Alright

1196
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
Feet

1197
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,111
Clips

1198
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,671
Was

1199
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,719
In the larger World sometimes States have

1200
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,279
No compromises

1201
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
Sovereignty

1202
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,095
Describe

1203
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,143
Giving up some of your sovereignty

1204
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,703
It's not like saying

1205
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:23,103
The EU Army is going to rule over you or anything like that pretty much everything Alex lies about

1206
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,175
Talking about

1207
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:30,783
Compromises in terms of

1208
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,087
She was talking about how

1209
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,111
Parliament is the most

1210
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,647
Piece of these states

1211
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
I tried

1212
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,303
To find this

1213
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
Story

1214
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,351
And I I don't know.

1215
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,399
He's talking about

1216
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,191
No one is interested in overthrowing anger

1217
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:53,055
She's already announced she stepped down as Chancellor just doesn't like her

1218
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:56,383
Is going to waste their resources on a very dangerous coup attempt

1219
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,943
That would be nonsensical

1220
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,503
Better

1221
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:08,415
500 or maybe you just wanted to overthrow Merkle

1222
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,279
Let's play this out okay I'ma group

1223
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:23,775
John Leguizamo

1224
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,647
That's how it go

1225
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:43,743
Like if you are a group that wants to overthrow Angela Merkel for the things that she

1226
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,791
She's staying for an hour

1227
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Send

1228
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,839
Wait it out

1229
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,863
Starbucks

1230
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:55,007
It's like no it's like a movie stupid

1231
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:02,687
But there's a chance it won't work like if there's a chance you die on the way to the movie maybe you wait for me

1232
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:11,647
There's a good chance maybe you get it on Netflix

1233
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,463
So I can't find any indication of what Alex is talking

1234
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:18,559
I can't find any articles on it on even on Infowars website

1235
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,631
Bring up any story

1236
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,167
That seems like he might be covering

1237
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:27,007
There was one story about that was about 200

1238
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:30,335
Police officers

1239
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,407
There was that being involved in a large Mafia operation

1240
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,223
Breaking up a mafia

1241
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,111
In the 200 officers when arrested they were the ones

1242
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,135
Doing the arresting

1243
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,671
100 number

1244
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,487
Possibility I don't think that's it

1245
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,279
However back in October

1246
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,815
Arrested

1247
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:54,143
Performing is far-right Terror cell called Revolution

1248
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,703
Which Angela Merkel

1249
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:03,359
But they weren't doing it from Raider position

1250
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,895
Ethnostate

1251
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,223
The name Revolution submits is a reference to the city show

1252
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,783
A city that

1253
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,063
The aftermath of the stabbing

1254
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,343
It was done by a migraine

1255
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:19,231
The protest has deteriorated into Bob violence and Nazi salute for being deliberately

1256
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,119
Following these protests members of Revolution Shipmates began attacking immigrants with glass bottles and stun gun

1257
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,143
Pretty regularly

1258
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:29,727
In what prosecutors have described as practice run

1259
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,519
Further planned larger-scale attack

1260
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
To come

1261
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,823
They plan to attack

1262
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,871
With assault rifles and high-grade weapons

1263
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,151
For October 3rd

1264
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,991
The day when Germans celebrate the anniversary of the country's reunify

1265
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
Application

1266
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,551
The message could not have been more

1267
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:48,159
Clear that their primary terrorist motivation was to undo that that unification

1268
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,695
The police interceptor

1269
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,463
Communications

1270
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,487
I've been watching the group

1271
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:54,815
And when it became clear that this was their plan they made their move and arrested

1272
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,583
The conspirators

1273
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,863
For they can murder tongue

1274
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,167
Of non-white people in the interest of

1275
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,959
Pushing their goal

1276
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,519
These men weren't anti-globalization

1277
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,847
They were literally members of the neo-nazis

1278
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,407
And it's easy to see where their motivations came from

1279
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:14,527
Here is this is the story he's talking about

1280
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:20,927
Arrested for trying to overthrow Angela Merkel in the last year so I'm guessing what he's talking about

1281
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:25,279
It may be misunderstanding story maybe not

1282
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,559
I think that's kind

1283
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:30,143
I think I'm a good job if only

1284
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:35,263
I think it was one of them got arrested

1285
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,823
Previous to the 6 a.m.

1286
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,871
He beat up an immigrant and then there's like

1287
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
Arrest

1288
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:47,295
Are arrested in the United States

1289
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:57,023
We never really heard about it all that much

1290
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,559
I think is

1291
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,423
The media was like well yeah I mean there's a black present

1292
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,447
Of course

1293
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,335
I think it was me and I was like

1294
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,895
I I would I would guess

1295
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,943
That Obama wouldn't want to give

1296
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,479
Creed 2 out

1297
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:19,807
Like threats against people who were around

1298
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,599
Probably saw no benefit

1299
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,951
Like what do you do do you encourage

1300
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,511
To do this do insight

1301
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:33,887
Before him what good is that outcome for it so just don't talk about

1302
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,423
Quiet lyrics

1303
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,703
Breakup Lots where

1304
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,775
And just move on where is now

1305
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,103
Anytime there's some sort of admittance cool threat against Trump

1306
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,175
You got here about it

1307
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,479
Installed

1308
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,759
Those LED

1309
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:56,927
And it just added constantly updating list of endeavor

1310
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,951
Just the names

1311
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,487
Just going alongside there

1312
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:04,607
Be nice that there are probably more people who conspired again

1313
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:12,031
But this is the only thing I can come up with that seems to match Alex's story numbers are right but

1314
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,383
These are Nazis man

1315
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,407
Like straight up

1316
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,223
Big Lake it's not it's not a stretch to

1317
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:20,991
To say that

1318
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,551
They are people who beat up immigrants

1319
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,111
And had plans right to attack

1320
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,135
Politicians

1321
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,695
And citizens with assault rifles

1322
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
On the

1323
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
The celebration

1324
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,279
Unification

1325
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:36,351
Bringing a white ethnostate German

1326
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,423
All the traffic

1327
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,727
Read Nazi salute all over the place

1328
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,543
Like that sort of thing that Alex

1329
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,311
Depending on my

1330
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,615
It shouldn't surprise me

1331
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,895
Somehow it still does

1332
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:52,223
Like if that's crazy but he's whitewashing

1333
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:55,551
Because it's so easy to see what the real

1334
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,623
It's just not kind of amazed

1335
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,695
I'm still

1336
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:04,255
Like we're so normalized to it now but

1337
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,535
Kind of

1338
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,071
Still become Nazi

1339
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,143
Especially

1340
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:13,471
After the 1st

1341
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:16,543
World War whatever everybody

1342
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,871
Droid Germany and left everybody so f*****

1343
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:24,991
You know you're like well and nationalist far-right movement is going to arise whenever

1344
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,343
Still people trying

1345
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,135
Not well I think

1346
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,159
You're looking at the wrong

1347
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,487
Axe throwing

1348
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,791
Generational differences

1349
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,351
That there's probably a lot of people who are

1350
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,631
I've been taught that like

1351
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,495
And do any kind of thing that's adjacent

1352
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,263
Do not forget

1353
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,567
Is absolutely forbidden

1354
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,871
Like you know

1355
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:58,783
There's a certain oppositional-defiant necessary whatever is the most rebellious thing right

1356
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,087
Identifying with Nazis

1357
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,391
Is the thing that their culture.

1358
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,415
The most

1359
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,439
Forbidden

1360
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,255
Good reason to think that up

1361
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,047
Rebellion could be

1362
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,887
Dabbling in knock the idea it's not the

1363
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,655
I mean

1364
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:21,567
I think it's easier to become a Nazi in Germany

1365
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,591
Then it is anywhere else

1366
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:27,455
Because it is a place where they've dealt with that that guilt

1367
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,247
Yeah as long as they have

1368
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:34,623
Underground German bondage video that was actually just a guy putting on a Nazi

1369
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,159
So you know it

1370
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,183
Taboo

1371
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,743
Yeah I don't know I don't know how to

1372
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,559
Talk about it more because I'm not German

1373
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
It's like that

1374
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,591
Anybody can deny the Holocaust

1375
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,895
It just seems strange to

1376
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,431
Deny the Holocaust

1377
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,807
But at the same time

1378
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,343
Actively trying kill

1379
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,391
Cool

1380
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,487
Or immigrants

1381
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,279
Aren't you the

1382
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,839
Very proof that the Holocaust

1383
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,911
I don't know

1384
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,751
I don't know I think

1385
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:27,103
I honestly don't know how to like

1386
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:32,991
And that sort of line of thinking other than that

1387
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,783
It seems obvious he like a

1388
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,575
You guys there's six

1389
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,367
You're trying to kill emigrants

1390
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:39,903
None

1391
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:45,279
Politicians in order to help put in your idea of a

1392
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:51,679
Excludes imagine

1393
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,727
Six guys imagine the entire country

1394
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,543
Immigrants in

1395
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,591
You might wind up with the Holocaust

1396
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,639
Maybe you're maybe the Holocaust

1397
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
I don't know

1398
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,711
Anyway

1399
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,503
They have their position

1400
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,551
Position on minority

1401
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,319
Call Dad

1402
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
Alex

1403
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
When is next

1404
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,415
He starts screaming about how the Muslims

1405
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,183
Are winning

1406
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:26,751
It is the bunch of tax that are attached to the right patak's

1407
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:30,591
The firework attached you don't want to keep track of

1408
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,871
Because

1409
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,919
You don't want to do any work

1410
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,991
Get into

1411
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:41,343
Islam related or immigrant

1412
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,111
Sing like that

1413
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
Khan was talk

1414
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,951
About what

1415
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,023
Or something

1416
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:55,423
She wasn't flexing on people like he was saying that in a modern society

1417
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,959
Sometimes there are risks

1418
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:58,751
Then some of these risks are

1419
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:03,103
Like let's say the security apparatus in place can't catch ever

1420
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,895
And it's a part of

1421
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:09,759
Like a large-scale urban life I live in Chicago if there is risk

1422
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,807
Everytime we walk down the street

1423
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
At night

1424
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,111
Yeah

1425
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
Think you might get mugged

1426
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,951
Acosta me

1427
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,071
But like I accept that as a possibility

1428
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:28,191
City mugging as a crime

1429
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
Real

1430
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,007
With the world as it is

1431
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:36,127
NRA's entire policy might as well be an organization

1432
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
I'm saying

1433
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,919
Get used to it

1434
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:45,599
Well there's that work as a frayed of

1435
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
The realities of

1436
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,927
Modern

1437
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
But their answer is

1438
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,303
Priorat protect you

1439
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,863
Makes a lot more money

1440
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,143
On the day after a match

1441
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,935
You bet so they kind of

1442
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,799
Find outfit that I agree with you

1443
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
But the only reason I don't like that

1444
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
Because

1445
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,127
It seems

1446
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,175
To put

1447
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,735
Actual guilt on them as opposed

1448
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,015
Abstract

1449
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,599
Let's not do that

1450
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,927
Attacks

1451
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,279
And the end and the mash raping and grooming and government allowing it

1452
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,863
I can't anymore

1453
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,959
I'm just becoming numb to it their wedding

1454
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,359
London

1455
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:48,063
All the specials are going to be over

1456
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,159
Another reason you can't keep

1457
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,183
Because he would also have

1458
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
Howmanyofme

1459
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,583
Compare

1460
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,167
You're the one I want to do anyway

1461
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,751
Because even in Tennessee

1462
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,799
You just keep talking about the

1463
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,871
Knife attack

1464
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,407
And every time that we

1465
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,175
Delving into

1466
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:17,503
Those Waters talk about like how he always screams

1467
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,063
And we go over the statistics and talk about

1468
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,111
Reality of who are the people who are

1469
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
Doing

1470
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,719
It never matches his mirror

1471
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,511
He never wants to get in

1472
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,279
The reality

1473
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
Individual

1474
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
Problem for him

1475
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,679
Rat reality really sucks up his marriage

1476
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,215
He just wants to yell.

1477
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:45,919
Scared of the idea that the Muslims are winning in the

1478
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:46,943
The specials are

1479
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,503
Strange

1480
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
Assuage

1481
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,343
And then he spends all of her

1482
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,135
It's time making people

1483
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,023
All the time

1484
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
It is just

1485
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,631
But it's a strategy that he learned

1486
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
In the ninth

1487
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,679
Is working for

1488
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,031
Fear of financial

1489
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
Collapse

1490
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,567
I meant head

1491
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,871
Comes in and tells me about the gold

1492
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,199
Write like it doesn't work on a one-to-one level

1493
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,735
Because he's making people afraid

1494
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,015
Of Muslim women

1495
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,807
And then selling them

1496
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,575
Pills

1497
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:29,951
I don't like

1498
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:33,279
I have Ted who selling you the thing that's saved

1499
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:36,863
You from what I'm making you afraid of

1500
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,655
It doesn't matter what are you selling

1501
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:42,751
If you buy things for me I will continue to exist

1502
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,055
And I'm the one yeah yeah

1503
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,591
It's a really pathetic

1504
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,127
Business model

1505
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,431
An ugly

1506
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:55,039
No matter what he says it's the best thing in the world

1507
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,111
It's still a bad day

1508
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:03,487
Fallen trying to say is that the far-right is take

1509
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,767
Taking over in the United

1510
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,887
Nazism is on the rise hate crimes are going out of control

1511
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:13,215
We have T-shirts that you

1512
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:13,983
We don't have to

1513
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,007
We're bad at this

1514
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,847
To talk more about the most

1515
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
And about

1516
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
Is b*******

1517
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,879
Cars in one town

1518
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:40,351
We can even

1519
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,287
Here's the key

1520
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:55,199
This country

1521
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,351
Was one of those lobbyists

1522
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,119
Tactics

1523
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:13,887
Reversed

1524
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
I guess

1525
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,959
It's cancer

1526
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,495
Non-white

1527
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,799
Making neighborhoods

1528
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,591
Cancer

1529
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,943
There's a story about these burning cars

1530
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,735
99 burn cars

1531
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,807
Which

1532
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,599
Every city

1533
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,135
I don't know about that

1534
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:41,535
So just reply because I was just talking about car burnings and I want to illustrate how easy it is to headliners

1535
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:45,631
However you want I present you with this news story out of Goldsboro North Carolina

1536
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,911
January 2nd

1537
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,935
2090

1538
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:53,567
Police investigating what appears to be a hate crime after a Goldsboro North Carolina families SUV

1539
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,847
He was set on fire

1540
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,919
Because their daughter who is was dating an African America

1541
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:06,623
The girl's mother said that while the family slept to the cars were covered with swastikas and racist language in a third car was set on fire

1542
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,695
In the aftermath of daughter had to stay with family out of

1543
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,511
The family had to wrestle with the idea that their child is unsafe

1544
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,815
Because she decided to date outside her

1545
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:18,911
Go ahead look into recent arsons in the United States there's plenty of them

1546
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:23,263
There's Victor Nelson Rosado who I was arrested on December 30th in Midland Texas

1547
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,591
Right now it's his backyard because he said a woman's house on fire

1548
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,407
Charged with felonies

1549
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,455
Fergie been arrested for twice

1550
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,247
4 twice

1551
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
In the past

1552
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:40,159
Officers that Rosato had previously / for car tires and vandalized

1553
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:44,511
How about Loretta Bailey for Manchester Pennsylvania

1554
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,535
A burning down her house

1555
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,863
Right after she had broken up with him

1556
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
The weather

1557
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:52,959
He started out small just vandalizing her truck on Thanksgiving

1558
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,775
Did you get a protective order against them

1559
01:15:56,287 --> 01:16:01,407
Ultimately this didn't work out because he just kept avoiding the officers were trying to serve him with papers

1560
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,687
Have any burn down her house

1561
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:09,599
Or there's this guy in Hialeah Florida side on New Year's Day 2019

1562
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
Before you did

1563
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:14,975
You see his girlfriend and recently separated from it but she didn't feel safe going to retrieve

1564
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,511
Possession

1565
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,559
So she called the police to escort

1566
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,327
Over there

1567
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,655
Which contact to make sure he

1568
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,471
He knew what the situation was and everything went smoothly

1569
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,263
After getting this update that the

1570
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:29,055
Police on her we're coming to get her possessions

1571
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,871
East that is house and car on fire to make sure that she

1572
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,895
You couldn't reclaim

1573
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
Her possession

1574
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:37,759
Then there was Nicholas Cole the twenty-year-old guy from Albany New York for September

1575
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,807
Car on fire on New Year's Eve

1576
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
What time

1577
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:47,487
Or there's George husky of York South Carolina who is dude turn self into begin serving a 90-day sentence

1578
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,279
Receive for domestic violence charge

1579
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,839
As well as a charge for illegally carrying a pistol

1580
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:57,727
We went to turn himself in he decided to enjoy his freedom One Last Time by burning down someone's house with diamonds

1581
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,495
They survived

1582
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,383
After that list

1583
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,175
The point is

1584
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:12,063
The arson related incidents that have happened to the United States in the last few days

1585
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:16,415
A whole lot of domestic violence which as you are estranged

1586
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,695
Real strain

1587
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,719
Kind of a

1588
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,999
Pattern

1589
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:24,863
A further point is that yes there were fire in France

1590
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,935
But the way out is reporting the story is intentionally racist

1591
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:33,055
His headline on Infowars is Eagle set on fire in migrant heavy Paris suburb

1592
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,335
Which is meant to imply that

1593
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,895
Migrants are committed this mask

1594
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,431
Some sort of a terrorist

1595
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:42,783
Because the wires would you say migrant heavy suburb

1596
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,319
Unless you were trying to make

1597
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,087
Someone

1598
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:49,695
Afraid that they're going to come burn your car

1599
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,535
You look at yourself to figure out whether it's

1600
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,303
Relevant

1601
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,583
Information is out there

1602
01:17:55,839 --> 01:18:01,983
The Story Goes even further to make things explicit this quote is a perfect illustration of how

1603
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:06,847
Integration has completely failed that's a f*****-up sentence

1604
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:10,431
There's no primary sourcing in this article

1605
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,711
An account called

1606
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,247
The intelligence Fusion

1607
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,807
Which states cars were set on fire

1608
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,903
Editorial

1609
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,719
And connect the stories he's just decided or connected

1610
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:26,303
So this entire article the only primary source about the 99

1611
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,095
Is the street from the intelligence

1612
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,887
3 million illegal immigrants

1613
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:36,799
I don't know who I glanced over their Twitter feed

1614
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,567
Maybe

1615
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:41,407
People who are doing work like it

1616
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,711
Yeah I don't know enough about them to

1617
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:50,367
Give any kind of decision on them

1618
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,671
Pjw certainly are getting beer

1619
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,487
From January 3rd 2019

1620
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,559
Flowers are placed on vehicles in central Ferndale Michigan

1621
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,095
White supremacist groups

1622
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,887
Flyers at messages regarding

1623
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,423
Take back America

1624
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,239
Or there was a tweet from January 2nd 2019

1625
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:10,591
Quote in 2018 Chicago stardrop inverters for the second year in a row

1626
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,127
With 100 fewer murders

1627
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,151
The 2017

1628
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,455
Police Credit Investments a data-driven

1629
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,271
SportsCenter

1630
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:24,671
For the drop getting better in Chicago

1631
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,719
Chiraq

1632
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:33,119
Write the intelligence editorial position

1633
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:37,471
No idea

1634
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,263
I don't know it would take way too long

1635
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:42,079
Figure that out and there's such a tertiary piece of the story that I'm going to

1636
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:47,199
Actual primary information story

1637
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:52,831
Cover the Story 2 end credits

1638
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,903
An actual French source

1639
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,439
Which includes the line

1640
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:02,303
Quote in the lot some Vehicles were most likely burn for insurance

1641
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,631
This is something that comes up over and over again

1642
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
From expert

1643
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:09,471
When we look into the issue of vehicle Burns of Europe in particular

1644
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:13,055
The vast majority of them are the result of insurance

1645
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,360
Alex is every reason to know this

1646
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:18,688
But still perpetuates the idea that this is the work of some sort of

1647
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,480
Group of Muslim immigrants trying to

1648
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,504
Terrorize the public

1649
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,552
Which there's no evidence to support

1650
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,344
Even on Alex's own website

1651
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,416
This is a pure expression of Infowars editorial position

1652
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,976
Demonizing immigrants Muslim

1653
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,512
And of supporting White

1654
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,816
This is a 0

1655
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:35,584
You know

1656
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,120
You know what I just

1657
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,680
I just thought

1658
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,216
The way Alex

1659
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,496
Earlier

1660
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,056
These immigrants coming

1661
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,872
They lower property value so they

1662
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:48,896
Take over

1663
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:51,712
What are you actually just said

1664
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,808
I know the races of a property values in that just

1665
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:58,112
Anyone there

1666
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,648
Lowers property value

1667
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:04,000
Doesn't matter if their houses the same or different it's just

1668
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:07,328
Virtual white it lowers property

1669
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,352
Valleys

1670
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,656
You understand how racism

1671
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:17,056
You have that you have what it takes to be woke

1672
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:28,576
What is indicating

1673
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:31,392
Jump on that

1674
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,440
Wait didn't you just

1675
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:42,912
The problem doesn't seem to think that that's a function of systemic racism and a

1676
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,680
Corrupt

1677
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:47,520
Industry

1678
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:52,896
Yeah he's doing but he even more at like this

1679
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:57,248
I bet there was more before the feeds cut in because it starts very

1680
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,016
Seriously

1681
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,296
Is you coming back

1682
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:06,464
Mommy's going to help out your testicles

1683
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:12,864
Liberal

1684
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:19,264
Hoverboard

1685
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,360
Holy s*** I don't know understand

1686
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:29,248
I want to be clear before this he wasn't talkin about like transition

1687
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,040
He doesn't ask for this

1688
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
He's just

1689
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:36,672
The spirits

1690
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,952
I don't know why you

1691
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,256
It must have been a conversation

1692
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:43,584
Or something like that blood into the show

1693
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,864
It's so weird

1694
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,424
Buckley we want to break right Buckley

1695
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:54,592
It's such an interesting stray bigot

1696
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,944
Connect to anything covers in the end the episode

1697
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,528
You should know there's that big news

1698
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,344
These 911 hacks.

1699
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,368
It's coming

1700
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,648
Yeah for it comes

1701
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,720
Alex's got to throw one of his longtime associate

1702
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,744
Radon

1703
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:27,360
Going on for me to do it

1704
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:32,480
Alex's with Rodger in the Rodger Stone vs Jerome corsi battle

1705
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:37,344
Doesn't know if we covered it on the shower or anything like that but

1706
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,880
Jerome corsi has

1707
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,952
Talking to Mueller

1708
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,816
He's decided he's going to sue

1709
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,608
Mahler

1710
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,400
Can't tell probably not great

1711
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,728
Initially

1712
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,264
Jerome corsi

1713
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:57,568
But now backstage

1714
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:02,688
Rodger cuz he has no other social media put up on Instagram

1715
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,992
Really ugly picture of Jerome corsi

1716
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:18,560
He's there wasn't it was just a picture of course again his makeshift

1717
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,120
I don't care I really don't care

1718
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:21,888
I don't think it

1719
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,936
I honestly don't even know if it's

1720
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:24,960
Like

1721
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,544
I don't think they might be doing a professional wrestling

1722
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,432
Possible in order to both distance each other from each other's whenever they're being investigated

1723
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:38,016
They look at how Rodger left the Trump campaign

1724
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:43,648
Trump fired

1725
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,792
Yeah that's another thing I think if you look at Rogers career there's a lot of fake

1726
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,560
Publicity

1727
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,608
Or whatever

1728
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,424
I don't really care all this is is a zero

1729
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,728
Jerome corsi still Jerome corsi

1730
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,520
Rodger Stone still Rodger Stone

1731
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:04,640
Still Alex Jones I don't give a fuk they don't like each other

1732
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,408
Neither

1733
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:09,248
I'd come on you got to pee vages this is Twilight all over again

1734
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:15,392
We have a strange I'm rooting for them both to go to prison have a strange romantic

1735
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,440
Triangle

1736
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:21,280
I assume that Alex is Rodger

1737
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:26,656
Rodger 100%

1738
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,448
Him the f*** out

1739
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:34,336
In this situation Jerome corsi is the werewolf kid

1740
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:41,248
References for the rest of the night I'm holding myself to everybody

1741
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:44,832
The werewolf was more nurturing

1742
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:51,232
Or like was a better guy I think that was the story

1743
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:55,328
Houston assholes

1744
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,912
It's my understanding that the werewolf

1745
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,704
What's her age

1746
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,240
And a decent guy

1747
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:08,128
Empire was a decreased

1748
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:14,528
Statutory rape

1749
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,552
Being Bella

1750
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:23,232
The werewolf and Rodger bigger vampire is possibly accurate

1751
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:28,096
Never seen Twilight that is a completely accurate metaphor don't

1752
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:33,216
Don't come at me I just I just don't care it could be a fake beef

1753
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,240
It could be real

1754
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:40,640
I really I don't I'm not Charmed by this I'm not interested slightly interested in the ideas

1755
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,712
The situation is Alex

1756
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,736
Is decided to be like

1757
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,504
I'm doubling

1758
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,296
Triple and quadruple

1759
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,160
Between tarsier

1760
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,464
Stone

1761
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,768
You think so

1762
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:03,680
Man man

1763
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,728
Birthstone

1764
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,264
Bisquick he's quick on his feet

1765
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:10,592
Deseret Book

1766
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,664
Jerome corsi is one of those guys that if he hit

1767
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,432
You're up

1768
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:20,832
George Foreman still got you never lose the you never lose the right

1769
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:24,672
He's a guy also has a lot of endurance in the ring

1770
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:27,232
30 * in Casper 10 whatever

1771
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,792
But I think Rodger is the stick and move

1772
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:32,864
I think quick enough

1773
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:39,008
Rope-a-dope

1774
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:41,568
Accorsi Toulouse everytime

1775
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,104
I just don't care

1776
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:51,552
We started talking about how the Vegas attack

1777
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,856
Yeah Alex threw him under the bus

1778
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,624
And was like

1779
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,440
I think he's still doing CIA operation

1780
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,608
What are the other things that

1781
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,376
China King

1782
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,400
Told me in the past

1783
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:12,800
That's not going to work with him in the future

1784
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:19,200
Time literally everything is part of my world

1785
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:21,504
Alex is now throwing corsi out

1786
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,784
And being like horse easily

1787
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,112
Weasel he's trying to get Rodger thrown in prison all this stuff

1788
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,184
No point going to do the work of being like

1789
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,232
I've used him

1790
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:33,280
Course he used to work for world

1791
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:38,400
Storyworks for me yeah yeah yeah

1792
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:44,800
He's a huge part of lot of lot of my fears about it's crazy that he doesn't

1793
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:47,872
Bitter like

1794
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:51,712
Friends thrown in prison Maybe

1795
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,760
He doesn't care at all about that

1796
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,784
Because he doesn't

1797
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,576
Yeah I've never considered this

1798
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:02,976
Like whenever they all know there

1799
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:09,120
Playing a if they thought any of this was real

1800
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,144
It would be like

1801
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,704
We need to start analyzing what

1802
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:19,104
Toxic information visit now toxic person brought into my world never does that

1803
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:23,200
Just like with a cop

1804
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:26,272
Every investigation has ever done

1805
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:29,856
Then comes into question you got it you got to review

1806
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,696
Is

1807
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:34,720
Like

1808
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,000
Wichita Rejects

1809
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,560
Quit right

1810
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,584
Because

1811
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,400
I don't want to be the token

1812
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,984
Nothing I can tell yet

1813
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
The problem with the

1814
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,520
Vittoriale shift

1815
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,056
That was happening

1816
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:51,616
And if it were it would be

1817
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:52,896
But

1818
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,480
How it must

1819
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,248
Fields

1820
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,016
Fired for

1821
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Infowars

1822
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,856
Like pechenik

1823
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,160
Is literally no longer ago

1824
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,440
He's fire

1825
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:06,720
Because

1826
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,256
Infowars

1827
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,048
Your nuts

1828
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:18,496
Even after he after Alex stop talking to show up on David Knight show

1829
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:23,360
The junior varsity roster I didn't know that you don't get Alex's publicity promotion

1830
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,640
You don't get that

1831
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,944
But you can still have access to David Knight

1832
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:32,832
Or maybe you'll show up on the War Room everybody has access to David Knight

1833
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:39,232
Leo zagami

1834
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,536
You keep them in the likes of the baby

1835
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,328
Right

1836
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,632
Have access to the

1837
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:51,008
The show that people actually listen

1838
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,336
This is an occasion to visit

1839
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,152
Smells like pay-for-play

1840
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,712
Because otherwise I don't talk to them

1841
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:03,296
Don't trust them don't let them on any of your shows

1842
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:09,696
Write a little bit of money for them to appear on this show or what

1843
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:10,464
He's like that

1844
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,256
I bet we could get on Owen Shroyer

1845
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,304
Combative

1846
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,376
Probably

1847
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,704
Gmail

1848
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,472
Could probably get us

1849
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:24,032
Are free

1850
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:30,176
Globalist Alex

1851
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,992
Jerome corsi

1852
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,808
Alright

1853
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:41,440
S h of the first live show I've done in 2019

1854
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,744
That's news to me

1855
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:46,048
I actually didn't realize he said that

1856
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,328
What you mean

1857
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,864
That the episode that I've started

1858
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,680
Listen to on the 1st

1859
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,704
Where the clip show

1860
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:59,104
And that makes me makes me feel confused

1861
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,128
Here's two things

1862
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:03,968
I'm glad we didn't go over it

1863
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,504
DLS possible

1864
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,320
Whatever the case it's weird I couldn't

1865
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:12,416
It doesn't speak highly of his contact

1866
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:15,488
January 2nd 2019 Emmy host

1867
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,512
Alex Jones

1868
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:19,072
Are you

1869
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:25,472
Guess you don't talk show host Michael Savage

1870
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:30,080
Everyone try to hurt them

1871
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,736
I would like to have Job Corps sheet for

1872
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,368
1617 years and he's a smart guy

1873
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:46,720
What time he's had the number one New York Times best sellers

1874
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,256
About Obama's birth certificate

1875
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,048
Swiftboating

1876
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:55,936
Fart by the Koch brothers

1877
01:32:56,192 --> 01:33:00,800
Yeah you do we have to pause there because Jerome corsi

1878
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:07,200
The show is specifically talks about how he was trained by Edward Bernays

1879
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:11,296
Propaganda

1880
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,088
Describe the process

1881
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:19,488
We went over there

1882
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:23,072
I don't I don't have people on misinformation

1883
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:29,472
Steve pieczenik before you throughout the show you always talk about how he's asiop a guy he's in information Warfare

1884
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:44,832
That was your lawyer

1885
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:52,256
Sleep well.

1886
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:56,096
Probably more often

1887
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:58,144
Really funny to hear that halfway through

1888
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:04,032
This episode when he said the trumps was quarantined for three months on record

1889
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:10,176
Idalis

1890
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,200
100 cars

1891
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:13,248
First city in France Got burn

1892
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,784
In the password

1893
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:15,808
Per City

1894
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,184
100 cars burn

1895
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:24,512
Alsace-lorraine region

1896
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,280
Who gives a s***

1897
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,304
Altitude

1898
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,096
He's thrown cursing under the bus

1899
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:30,144
It's going to be it's a non-binding so

1900
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,192
Much like Agenda 21

1901
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,472
Non-binding

1902
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:38,080
Yeah this is nonsense I don't care

1903
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,872
We got into this and we're like

1904
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:40,640
Look at this

1905
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,408
Rodger

1906
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,432
Course you're fighting

1907
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,456
Bean something

1908
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:47,040
That would be kind of the equivalent of Alex getting into palace intrigue

1909
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:50,112
Of the Trump Administration

1910
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:56,512
We got to get Kushner out of there you were still in there fighting with each other

1911
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,280
Working together

1912
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:59,072
Doesn't matter who gives a s***

1913
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,864
The only possibility

1914
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:03,168
But I see as being interesting

1915
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,472
And I see no indication

1916
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,008
Of this being forthcoming

1917
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:09,312
Is there as they start to fight

1918
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,336
Each other

1919
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:13,408
One of them could reveal something accident

1920
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,968
Yeah like the idea of what they were doing

1921
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,248
Lead up to the 20

1922
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,040
Like that idea

1923
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,576
These people who work

1924
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:21,600
Coordinate

1925
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,928
With each other in some way

1926
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,720
That's

1927
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,000
And as of yet I have

1928
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:34,912
But if it was talking about the prisoner's dilemma as being a possibility

1929
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:37,984
Interest

1930
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:46,688
Right because Rodger Stone and Jerome corsi are both well familiar with

1931
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,456
Game theory in a

1932
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,992
Decided that the best way for both

1933
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:53,600
With a public appearances

1934
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,648
Yeah I think that's entirely

1935
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:57,184
It may not be I don't know

1936
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,232
But

1937
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,536
The biggest thing I can say is

1938
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:02,560
Is GHIN I don't

1939
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:03,840
Well I don't

1940
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:07,680
What are they is it like you're lying

1941
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,776
No I don't think so it's more of a

1942
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:15,360
Rogers allegation is Jerome corsi

1943
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:18,944
Was willing to lie about Rodger but not about himself

1944
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,736
With the special counsel

1945
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:27,904
How he knows that now or what he's basing that on I have no idea

1946
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,208
Documents

1947
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
Text Sid

1948
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
Come out

1949
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,024
Between Rodger and

1950
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
Emails

1951
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,840
Rodger and Coursey about

1952
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,632
Like we need to get Ted

1953
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:41,984
Mileage to go talk to our friend at the Ecuadorian Embassy and stuff like that

1954
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,520
Coordination

1955
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:46,336
Between the two of them in the relevant time frame the WikiLeaks

1956
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,456
Because we don't have all the information

1957
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,248
We don't know what it is right

1958
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,784
For us to speculate but like

1959
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,880
They were I could have been anybody in the Ecuadorian Embassy dance

1960
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:00,416
They were up to something

1961
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,768
It doesn't really matter we know that Alex is taking response

1962
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:10,400
Telling Rodger to coordinate

1963
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:21,664
Is also a unit Floyd

1964
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,968
Hayman actual employee

1965
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:24,736
The Washington

1966
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,504
Bureau

1967
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:29,088
Without starter Washington branch

1968
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,368
Infowars

1969
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:33,184
There is there is a lot of stuff

1970
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,464
Disconnect

1971
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,328
A harmonious whole

1972
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,608
Would require us

1973
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,632
Jenny Lee

1974
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,448
There's something going on

1975
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,472
But who knows

1976
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:47,776
Beat

1977
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,800
Could be

1978
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,104
That Rodger

1979
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,384
Were conspiring

1980
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
To f*** with that

1981
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:56,736
Entirely possible

1982
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,504
Call Larry

1983
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,576
God that would be the greatest possible that the two of them were

1984
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,112
Incapable of getting in touch

1985
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,392
Or something like that

1986
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,440
Look who knows like I said

1987
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,720
Avenue DoubleDown

1988
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:09,536
Irresponsible to speculate too much

1989
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:12,608
With what we know we know that Alex has a lot of

1990
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:15,168
Trip big news

1991
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,192
Always

1992
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:16,960
Correct

1993
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:17,728
Or at least

1994
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,776
Way more than everybody else

1995
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:21,568
A big news story

1996
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,336
Is about to break

1997
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,360
Right now

1998
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,920
Story

1999
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:31,296
That I have to be careful about what I say

2000
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:32,832
Fisher

2001
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,904
Which you're not going to be

2002
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,976
This is incredible

2003
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,816
Super incredible

2004
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,912
World we live in where things are so volatile

2005
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,472
Sommer Ray

2006
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,336
Heart attack

2007
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,456
Hello

2008
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:01,760
Go to the next break and come back

2009
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:03,296
You son-of-a-b**** teasing

2010
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,648
He talked about the idea

2011
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,416
These hackers have these

2012
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,184
Documents

2013
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,256
So you think

2014
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:14,304
He's doing the same game that he always plays with

2015
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,632
Just tell what the story is but what

2016
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,680
Yes he said that he's going to be

2017
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:21,216
Judicious about it

2018
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:23,008
Yes be careful

2019
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:26,848
Keep that in which place do what you said

2020
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:27,872
Suggest

2021
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,408
He was not very good

2022
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:32,736
If he's Napolitano

2023
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:33,760
If he's

2024
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:39,648
Being careful I can't imagine what willy-nilly Alex would be like

2025
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:42,720
I'm just going to talk about the story already

2026
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,488
Because

2027
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,024
This is the best way to

2028
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,608
Leave a hacker group of hack

2029
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:49,632
Calling themselves

2030
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:51,680
The dark Overlord announce

2031
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,472
18000 pages of emails

2032
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:56,800
And disclosure agreements from hiscock which is an insurer

2033
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:57,824
Lloyd's of London

2034
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,848
Another insurance

2035
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,128
And Hooch Blackwell

2036
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
A law firm

2037
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:01,920
Regarding

2038
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:08,832
They dropped the encrypted files for download

2039
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:09,856
Aren't really all that damn

2040
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,440
Did this group is

2041
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:16,256
Bitcoin

2042
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,304
They will slowly release more description

2043
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:20,608
Information

2044
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,656
They've even invited China

2045
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,448
Russia

2046
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,728
Renovations like Isis

2047
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,008
To bid to receive

2048
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:27,776
Documents

2049
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,568
What you tell you that they're definitely

2050
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,592
Really cool

2051
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:34,176
And clearly have America's best interest at heart

2052
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:36,736
It's a classic cyber blackmail operate

2053
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,552
Then there's no evidence as of right now that anything

2054
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:42,112
Singing those supposed 18,000 documents actually

2055
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:42,880
Prove anything

2056
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:45,952
In fact Lloyd's of London and husch Blackwell both

2057
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:48,000
Confirmed they review their cybersecurity

2058
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,792
And there was no evidence that they've

2059
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:56,960
The other one

2060
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,752
They had been

2061
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,312
April

2062
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,104
But it's unclear if

2063
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:05,920
To do with that

2064
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:08,736
Whatever the reality that story is remains

2065
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:12,320
But as of right now there is no reason to report it

2066
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,112
It's coming through sit 911 is a

2067
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:18,208
The dark Overlord has a history of cyber extortion

2068
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,488
What they do

2069
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:23,072
And the representative representative of the

2070
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:26,144
UK National cyber security Centre points out

2071
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:30,752
Quote

2072
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:35,104
The volume and sensitivity of the data Maybe exaggerated to maximize

2073
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,920
This is what extortionists do

2074
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:41,248
They make perceived damage to make the idea of

2075
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,016
The perceived

2076
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,344
Devastating

2077
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,160
Whether or not what they have lives up to that expectation

2078
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,464
From an article in Forbes

2079
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:56,096
Experts agree the material the dark Overlord claims to have is not as game-changing as its theme

2080
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:59,680
Ian Thornton dropped the head of cybersecurity at AmTrust in

2081
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,704
International says

2082
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,496
This latest incident sounds like

2083
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:04,288
Cybercriminal bravado

2084
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,872
The fact that the firms are named

2085
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,920
You know what terms like hiscox

2086
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:14,528
You did refuse to pay the rent

2087
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,856
So this is kind of just a pressure tactic from the dark Overlord

2088
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,624
Force the ransom

2089
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,160
Okay so you think

2090
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,952
Herbs

2091
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,232
This guy would seem.

2092
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:25,024
It suggests that these companies

2093
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:25,792
I've already been

2094
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:29,888
Contacted by the dark Overlord

2095
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:30,912
Okay

2096
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:33,472
Scott is what cybersecurity

2097
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:35,776
Studied

2098
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:39,360
The tactics of extortionists

2099
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,640
I'm so everybody

2100
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:42,432
Who's actually

2101
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,712
Official

2102
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:49,856
Yeah this just seems like a patterned of the dark Overlord has

2103
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,904
Because

2104
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,184
Or a person

2105
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:55,488
For a long time

2106
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:58,048
They'll eat the season of Orange

2107
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:58,816
Is the New Black

2108
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,120
Before they held it

2109
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,008
It's not like they don't have a can

2110
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,080
There are other instances

2111
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,104
Them not having

2112
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,128
Good of stuff

2113
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:16,480
Extortion demands

2114
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,504
BART map

2115
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,784
That they're still around

2116
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,576
After being an operation for

2117
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:21,344
For so long

2118
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:24,416
And Betsy bomber Wild

2119
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,744
Good enough to escape

2120
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,768
So far

2121
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,584
We don't know how long that will last

2122
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:34,912
Because they have so many publicized

2123
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,192
Failures

2124
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,728
Suggestive

2125
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:38,752
Probably have

2126
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:47,200
I don't know it's possible it indicates to me that it is obvious

2127
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:47,968
Play more than one

2128
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:48,992
Because I

2129
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:52,064
The character of the different things that they've done over

2130
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:54,112
Have been so different

2131
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,648
It's all extortion

2132
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,464
But

2133
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,768
Having the doors are not having the good

2134
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,816
Gyro

2135
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:03,840
Different

2136
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:08,192
Probably some people who

2137
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:11,264
Operate under that moniker Who You Are

2138
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,288
You got it

2139
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,848
YouTube is the New Black

2140
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:16,384
And then their people were like

2141
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:18,176
They don't have all the

2142
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,968
Who have

2143
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:20,736
Like things

2144
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,528
They hacked from like a

2145
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:24,320
Hospital

2146
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,416
It's not as damning as

2147
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,720
Covid-19

2148
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,256
9/11

2149
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,024
They have

2150
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,072
They're presenting

2151
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:37,888
Bring up bring down this corrupt system

2152
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:41,216
Prove that 9/11 the false flag and all this

2153
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:43,520
But it could just be that they have the

2154
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,544
These

2155
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,336
Like these insurance

2156
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:51,456
Like they could very well Insurance memos and stuff like that

2157
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,224
Trump

2158
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:55,040
Long protracted court case

2159
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:58,368
Don't demonstrate that 9/11 was fake

2160
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,904
But might be embarrassing to

2161
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,720
People are by Peter private business in the streets

2162
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:04,256
No one wants that but

2163
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:06,304
It's the over-promising

2164
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,352
You hope will get you

2165
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,120
You your extortion

2166
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,448
To consider about this

2167
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,264
Which is a red flag

2168
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:17,312
Because right now Bitcoins going through

2169
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,592
Aren't you know that

2170
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:22,688
I have not heard anything about Bitcoin for the last year

2171
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:26,272
I assume

2172
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:29,088
Most people who work in like cyber FB

2173
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,672
Understand that world

2174
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:34,976
Would probably want their money

2175
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,536
They probably want it

2176
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,304
Through

2177
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:42,144
Another unmarked bills much less traceable

2178
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,728
Yeah

2179
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,496
Through PayPal

2180
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:49,312
And there's no specified amount which implies that

2181
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:51,104
Amount

2182
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:53,408
People

2183
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:57,760
Previous contacts

2184
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:59,808
There's alot going on here

2185
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,136
It has the look of

2186
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:03,904
Someone who

2187
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:06,208
The dark Overlord

2188
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,744
Extortion Opera

2189
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,024
So you have that

2190
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:13,376
I-95 on top of that a history of often over-promising and

2191
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,960
Then you have asking for the money

2192
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:20,800
Bitcoin which makes if the dark Overlord is a

2193
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:21,568
Group

2194
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:24,640
Then what you have is probably the Lesser part of that group

2195
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:27,456
Or maybe the week or part of that group because they're asking

2196
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,480
Bitcoin

2197
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,504
As opposed to one

2198
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,272
Other

2199
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,296
More space

2200
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,320
More protected

2201
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,088
Less price of

2202
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,416
August

2203
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:42,816
Protected there Saturday

2204
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:43,584
There's so many

2205
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,864
Yeah there's still money

2206
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:48,192
Not as like Bitcoins the one that took off because of

2207
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:51,264
Became like out of school and came

2208
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:56,640
Well because there's a lot of fraudsters outbound pump-and-dump stamps

2209
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:59,456
There is that which led to bitcoin

2210
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:00,736
Prominent

2211
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,272
But there's so many other

2212
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,320
Use there also

2213
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:06,368
But I was reading about that like

2214
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,928
We are now at a place where Bitcoin

2215
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,952
Can possibly

2216
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,768
People in intelligence

2217
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:13,792
Could trace

2218
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,072
If

2219
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,608
Really wanted their money

2220
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:22,240
If they were they part of this Elite hacker

2221
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,544
Yeah they would know that

2222
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,336
For sure I would never want

2223
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:29,920
So there are red flags and questions about

2224
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:33,248
If I had to guess I would say yeah they probably

2225
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:37,600
I got ahold of some documents there over-inflating what they have

2226
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:39,904
Because they want to make a

2227
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,440
Bunch of money

2228
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:44,512
But also our

2229
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:45,792
Not

2230
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,328
The best cyber-terrorist

2231
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,608
In the world

2232
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:52,960
I don't know

2233
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:53,984
But

2234
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,824
If they have

2235
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,104
If they have AIDS

2236
01:47:59,360 --> 01:47:59,872
18000

2237
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,408
Prove 911

2238
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,456
I really

2239
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:13,696
F****** public service

2240
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,720
You could possibly

2241
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:17,280
I strongly disagree only be

2242
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,560
Because of the mean

2243
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:23,936
Because of the extortion part I agree with that

2244
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,032
The other governments in the terrorist

2245
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:31,104
Their Public Service is

2246
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,128
BMI

2247
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,408
I'm calling your bluff

2248
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,712
Are public

2249
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,760
Holyshit 9/11 with a

2250
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:44,416
Were someone to be a benevolent hacker in Seattle and come up with that information

2251
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:47,232
Through channels that could

2252
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:49,280
Be like an actual

2253
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:51,328
I don't know what would it be like

2254
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,120
It would be unprecedented

2255
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:56,192
That sort of operation

2256
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,728
That involves like

2257
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,264
Really committed

2258
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,056
Principal journalist

2259
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,688
Be interested in that somewhat

2260
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,736
Unnamed

2261
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,016
Hacker or Collective

2262
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:14,368
That is looking to enrich themselves in offering to sell the

2263
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,904
It makes me think like

2264
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:17,696
You probably it's

2265
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:18,464
Probably a scam

2266
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,280
Probably a lot of

2267
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:22,816
It's trading on

2268
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:23,840
Conspiracy

2269
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:24,864
Theory

2270
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:26,912
I just

2271
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:28,960
What what are your hand on the other hand

2272
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:33,312
I like the other hand the biggest problem Woodward and Bernstein

2273
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:37,152
Really encountered with deep throat is not f******

2274
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:39,200
Selling the information in the first place

2275
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:41,248
Rich's fuc

2276
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:47,648
Good okay I mean they did okay

2277
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,416
They could have been

2278
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:53,792
9/11 was fake

2279
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,888
Cabal

2280
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:59,680
No One Ever Knows

2281
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:10,688
They've like 911

2282
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:14,016
What in those.

2283
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:16,064
Tricked by this again

2284
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,856
You get struck by this a lot

2285
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:19,136
The

2286
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:20,672
So did the Schrodinger's cat

2287
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:25,280
And

2288
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:29,632
I'm thinking I can take I can take a loss on this

2289
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:30,400
Right

2290
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:33,472
Like how much could they possibly be asked

2291
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,240
How much does a

2292
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,776
Possibly be

2293
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:38,080
And even if it's not true

2294
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:42,944
We spent 10 million we look we look foolish but it's like you have like

2295
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,480
I don't know I'll tear

2296
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:46,272
Yeah is too big

2297
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,552
The Pod is too big

2298
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,832
This guy bets

2299
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,112
Like 50

2300
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:51,136
The Grand at you

2301
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,160
You got

2302
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,440
I don't know

2303
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:58,816
$1000000 in chips like I shouldn't pay 50 Grand I know I've lost

2304
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
But whatever

2305
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:06,496
Exactly it's no matter what they're asking for

2306
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:07,520
If it is

2307
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,848
Then yes China or Russia was made for it

2308
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:14,176
Destroy America

2309
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,504
Trillian

2310
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:21,600
Of the United States

2311
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,208
American

2312
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:26,976
Influence

2313
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:31,072
In places where they speak influenced

2314
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:32,608
Greyhound

2315
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:33,632
Yeah

2316
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,472
Hannah vishu

2317
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:40,288
But like all of them are important in their own way

2318
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,568
Because they're all.

2319
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,592
How like

2320
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,384
If you just critically

2321
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,664
Think about this for a second

2322
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:47,712
There's no way this is real

2323
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:50,784
Yeah there's no reason to suspect it's real because

2324
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,064
It's been put out by

2325
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:54,624
Cyber extortion racket

2326
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:58,208
Who are known for

2327
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,744
I'm still like it's

2328
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,304
Just it's interesting that this is Alex

2329
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,072
Is big news

2330
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:05,888
I thought whenever you started talking about it

2331
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:07,168
It was going to be some sort

2332
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:07,936
Like

2333
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,472
Hooray for the

2334
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,008
Yeah

2335
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,592
I was never

2336
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:15,616
Prepare for this

2337
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,408
This is

2338
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,176
The most

2339
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:20,736
I hate how I always say every

2340
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:22,016
Everything is like a superlative

2341
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:24,320
You got a lot of superlatives over there

2342
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:27,392
2 years ago doing this Alex keeps blowing my mind

2343
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:30,208
Like when I was listening to this there's no way I could have

2344
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:34,560
All right so crazy

2345
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:39,424
Zerohedge article zerohedge.com up on newswars.com

2346
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,776
Rochester story but how

2347
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,592
Systems

2348
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:55,040
I'll release the 911 info on the clintons and the bushes

2349
01:52:56,832 --> 01:53:00,416
And has come out and said there's more than one way to declassify

2350
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:04,512
Illegal spying on me and how you find the Taliban and Al-Qaeda

2351
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:06,048
And now Isis

2352
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:08,352
Goodyear

2353
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:15,520
Cropped just us intelligence agencies

2354
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:21,920
And then have the cover story that they're putting a ransom out of this company

2355
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:24,992
Situated bring attention to it and then releasing

2356
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,784
Cuz they released

2357
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:31,648
What happened

2358
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:34,976
They'll get payoffs

2359
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:37,280
Because you cannot relations to dammit

2360
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:42,400
Are you interested

2361
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:43,424
Because

2362
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,984
Okay YouTube the most f*****-up thing

2363
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:49,568
Worst way

2364
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,872
To cover this story would be to say

2365
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,408
This is Trump

2366
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,736
So what are you saying is this

2367
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:57,760
Trump won

2368
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:58,528
To release

2369
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:00,576
The 9/11 is an inside job.

2370
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:05,184
You bet and one Law Firm

2371
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,232
Because the lawyers would get in the way

2372
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:09,536
So instead

2373
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:13,632
He is worth Congress leaders of Congress

2374
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:20,032
Why do lawyers in Congress Hotel

2375
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:23,616
Right right

2376
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,528
EBay

2377
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:34,880
What does if JFK was an inside job tomorrow Trump

2378
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:38,208
Simply Be

2379
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:44,608
It is because and pony show like 6 months ago

2380
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:48,704
He's about to be classified

2381
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:54,336
You can't do that with the stroke of a pen

2382
01:54:54,592 --> 01:55:00,224
Political politically

2383
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:04,320
That might be the best move

2384
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:09,440
He just revealed the JFK was an inside job

2385
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:11,232
I think even I would be like

2386
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:15,072
Hey Google

2387
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,864
I mean I'd still

2388
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:18,400
Think he was a

2389
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,168
The bigot

2390
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:25,824
Dick cuz he is

2391
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:31,968
Is for him to declassify JFK documents that proved that the government was behind it and

2392
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:34,784
Prove it 911 the government was behind it

2393
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:41,184
Advent him die stroke of the pen

2394
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,976
Without publicly globalist kill him

2395
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:44,512
Because then we are

2396
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:50,400
Everybody have to go like

2397
01:55:54,496 --> 01:56:00,640
I don't like on his life it so if he loses in 2020 it would his last day should be that

2398
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:12,160
Trump should release the America has done all the inside job

2399
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:21,888
Instead he is hired a group or perhaps create how to create

2400
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:28,288
PetSmart

2401
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:34,944
Story so he convened release the 9/11 was an inside job

2402
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:41,344
There's a lot of problems because of real-world problems with this narrative.

2403
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:46,464
Alex's embarking on this I would say

2404
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:48,000
Because he is very

2405
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:49,280
Siri sings it like

2406
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,048
This is

2407
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,072
Not

2408
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,376
This is

2409
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:59,008
Clear Advanced knowledge

2410
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:08,736
Your Bitcoin Ransom not met

2411
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:15,904
Will be providing conspiracies through r18000 secret documents

2412
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:17,440
From fat

2413
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:20,512
Kids Cox Toms and others

2414
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,096
Overlord

2415
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:31,264
Wonder who that is New Year's Eve

2416
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:36,896
That would have broken into the computer systems

2417
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,432
Construction

2418
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:49,184
Ugly

2419
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:54,560
She says that I would only marry one person yet but

2420
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:56,608
The parallel Construction

2421
01:57:57,632 --> 01:58:01,984
All of these Becky hacker

2422
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:05,824
In order to parallel Forest

2423
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,104
Release of the document

2424
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:10,432
Okay because he already had

2425
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:15,296
You can spell it out in the next clip

2426
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:18,880
But they can't do it themselves

2427
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:19,648
With doctor

2428
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,184
Turlock

2429
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:21,952
Construction

2430
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:23,744
Of this hacking narrative

2431
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:26,816
These hackers have done this in order for it to be

2432
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:27,840
Deflected onto that

2433
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:28,864
For their actions

2434
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:30,400
Which they need to do

2435
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:32,192
Because they're good people within the intelligence

2436
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,752
His knowing laugh is in

2437
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:36,032
The qanon

2438
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:37,568
His knowing laugh is

2439
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:39,616
I wonder who these people are obvious

2440
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:41,152
Government

2441
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:47,808
Right now

2442
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:48,576
Actually knows

2443
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:49,600
Who these guys

2444
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,440
Buddies

2445
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:54,208
Thinking it's

2446
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:54,976
The government

2447
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:55,744
Right

2448
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,072
Good people within the intelligence

2449
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,352
The

2450
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:04,448
What is a narrative

2451
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:08,032
Absolutely

2452
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:10,592
Dumb

2453
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:13,408
So let's

2454
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:16,480
Listen to this next trip real quick where Alex is spelled it out a little more

2455
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:20,576
Collective

2456
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:26,976
Overlords

2457
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:31,840
To the computer

2458
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:34,656
Of the law firm files

2459
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:45,664
He always said that though it doesn't matter

2460
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:50,016
I know never forgot but of course the president's not involved

2461
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,576
Hahaha

2462
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:58,208
Omnipresent everybody else release everything now just

2463
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:01,792
Take me to crush them.

2464
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:14,848
But like

2465
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:18,944
Extortion group

2466
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:19,712
On the internet

2467
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:22,016
And they're probably

2468
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:32,256
Spectacular

2469
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,048
You know like it's generally

2470
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:37,632
You have a lot of ways

2471
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:38,656
It's

2472
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:46,848
Pretty early on by turning one of those

2473
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:49,664
Right but you had to find that dude first

2474
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:51,968
If you if you if you are

2475
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:52,736
Make steps

2476
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:58,368
If you do that like it's in the same way

2477
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:00,416
Lloyd's of London

2478
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:04,256
Good security

2479
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,024
Infrastructure and we can

2480
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:11,424
Either that or

2481
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,192
Yeah

2482
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:15,264
The problem is to

2483
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,824
Switching

2484
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,360
Like it's far easier to

2485
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,152
You're playing often

2486
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,944
You get the first move

2487
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,480
Bright

2488
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,272
Then you switched

2489
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:27,040
2 defense

2490
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,064
And you don't

2491
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:30,880
It's far easier to hack

2492
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:31,648
Is to avoid

2493
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:36,000
Right but if you are a collective of hackers or even just one

2494
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:37,792
Talented

2495
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:40,096
You don't

2496
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:41,120
Doing the offense

2497
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:42,144
To stop without

2498
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:47,264
A good defensive position

2499
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:53,664
Magnus Samuelsson

2500
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,480
Listen

2501
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:57,760
It's irrelevant

2502
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:58,528
It really is

2503
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,296
Because

2504
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:00,576
Viktos my position

2505
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:04,416
Situation

2506
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:05,440
Who I

2507
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:07,488
I've read talked about this

2508
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,864
Exposition

2509
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:14,400
That's what I

2510
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:15,424
It's probably the

2511
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:21,824
And the fact that no one seems to be

2512
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:25,664
It would have been paid for immediately

2513
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,736
Or you would have possibly

2514
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:35,136
Although at the same time only leads to worth extortion

2515
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:41,536
Blackmail

2516
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:42,816
Cuz generally when someone

2517
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:43,584
Blackmail

2518
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:44,608
If you give in

2519
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:49,728
The first stage of the blackmail the second

2520
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:50,752
So you just take me

2521
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:58,688
Serve the real information is far less damaging than the ongoing

2522
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:03,296
This is

2523
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:04,576
Nonsense

2524
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:05,600
Absolute

2525
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:07,136
But

2526
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:08,672
Problem

2527
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,768
Alex's narrative about it is that it's good guys

2528
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:13,792
Intelligence

2529
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:17,120
I don't know

2530
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:19,168
Possible

2531
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:21,728
Nope

2532
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:25,312
In a hypothetical world is possible

2533
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:30,176
We're living in Alex's face

2534
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:33,760
So if that is

2535
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,552
That is

2536
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:37,088
Phraseology

2537
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:41,184
Insanely illegal

2538
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:41,952
Alex

2539
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:44,768
Is implying that he knows about this

2540
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:46,304
Is thrilled about it

2541
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,072
And

2542
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:48,096
Trump is in on it

2543
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:50,656
If it's not true

2544
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:55,264
His Radio Show right now is

2545
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,288
Implicating Trump

2546
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:57,056
Innate

2547
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:01,408
F****** national security issue

2548
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:04,224
These people are offering to sell this information to

2549
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,016
To f****** Isis

2550
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:07,040
Trump is behind

2551
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:08,320
Trump

2552
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,648
Isis

2553
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:15,744
I mean

2554
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,768
I think

2555
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:19,328
Really what was going on here is Alex doesn't

2556
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:20,096
Liverpool grass

2557
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:23,168
He heard that someone is offering

2558
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:29,568
911 factual information he got a hard-on and then he's giving it a scam

2559
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:30,592
He's starting to

2560
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:32,128
I think probably

2561
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,664
You might still be in touch

2562
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:35,456
Rodger

2563
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:36,224
Just doing this

2564
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,016
One of his dumb ass holes

2565
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:38,784
Who talks to Bhai

2566
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:43,136
Has created this narrative for the good guys

2567
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:44,416
We're doing this because

2568
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:45,184
It fits so much

2569
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:49,024
He's by movie reality

2570
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,328
I just everything that he lives about

2571
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:57,472
Let me just say here's my other

2572
02:04:58,496 --> 02:04:59,008
Kind of

2573
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:00,288
Thought about that

2574
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:01,824
Is that

2575
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:04,384
As much and as often as he

2576
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:06,432
Tried to jump on the qanon

2577
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:07,712
And like

2578
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:13,856
Use that to bolster his credibility wants to own it

2579
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:16,928
What is qanon other than

2580
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:23,328
Q is Trump he's releasing all that

2581
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:29,472
What is my

2582
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:31,776
Most of the

2583
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:35,104
Flexeril

2584
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,384
It's always been in them

2585
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:38,432
Embracing of how popular

2586
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:39,456
Qanon news on the

2587
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:42,016
Internet but never wanting to get in

2588
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:46,368
Position towards

2589
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:47,136
Quite Frank

2590
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:53,792
Is the idea of like I don't want to get involved with that involved

2591
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:57,888
Makes you afraid

2592
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,680
And get you into

2593
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:06,336
Lower myself to run

2594
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:07,616
Exactly I'm the ring

2595
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:11,712
Towards the next clip

2596
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:12,480
Because I think

2597
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:15,296
Doesn't know what he's talking

2598
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:16,832
I think it's

2599
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:18,880
He's talkingshit

2600
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:21,184
He's found these stray variables that

2601
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,000
And some wormtongue

2602
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:24,768
Is Whispering

2603
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:32,704
Yeah I'm sorry I interrupted you I just wanted to make sure I wasn't clear on that because

2604
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,752
I wasn't yet

2605
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:40,640
Jordan

2606
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:43,456
No I'm

2607
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:44,480
Less than rare

2608
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:46,784
It's medium frequency

2609
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:53,184
When you interrupt me there's a good point

2610
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,720
Other episode

2611
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,072
I just think this is the Mazda that Alex doesn't know the situation

2612
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:00,864
She just has a narrative

2613
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:02,144
Because he's

2614
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:06,496
Overlord memes

2615
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:10,592
Asian

2616
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:14,432
Overlord

2617
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:23,904
But he doesn't seem to recognize and anyways it's dark Overlord is a organization that has exist

2618
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:26,976
Like

2619
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:29,536
Snot

2620
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:33,632
He's acting like it's somebody that popped up now with something

2621
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:36,192
Referenced earlier

2622
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:36,960
The ideas

2623
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:37,728
Like Trump

2624
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,776
Created this

2625
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:41,312
Extortion out

2626
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,336
Fit as a

2627
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:46,944
Cover or whatever years ago right might be

2628
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,736
To go to as his defense

2629
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:52,064
But that's for anybody

2630
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,600
This is an entity that Isaac

2631
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,720
And he's trained

2632
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:02,304
Yeah

2633
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,072
It's a dark but

2634
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:04,608
You flip the dark and I

2635
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:06,400
Which is the qanon

2636
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:11,264
Justification 100%

2637
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:13,312
She wants that world so bad

2638
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:15,104
Not being

2639
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:17,920
Like yells all the time

2640
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:23,040
Original qanon

2641
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:24,064
Yeah yeah

2642
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:25,600
For sure

2643
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,648
It's the

2644
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:28,672
Tried

2645
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:29,952
For the fall

2646
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:31,232
Rafter Oregon

2647
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,256
In the middle of the Fall

2648
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:34,304
Pride comes a lot of places

2649
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,072
Threat

2650
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:38,400
It is it is the full contact

2651
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:42,496
Because where you do not have the full context of his

2652
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:44,032
Timothy pettiness

2653
02:08:44,288 --> 02:08:46,592
Is need to get a tent

2654
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:48,128
Combined with the fact that

2655
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:53,504
Qanon is far more popular

2656
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:56,064
If you didn't realize that you think

2657
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:56,832
He was coming up

2658
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:58,880
With a completely normal

2659
02:08:59,136 --> 02:08:59,648
Conspiracy

2660
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:03,488
Where is within the full context we realize how pathetic

2661
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:05,024
Bulshit

2662
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:12,448
You could very easily see how we

2663
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:17,312
Is just a few understand dark Overlord is

2664
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:19,360
I think you could

2665
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:27,808
Well they can't find it with quick trudel search but I think what you add to it from our show

2666
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:30,624
Xqc

2667
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:33,184
Even if you take

2668
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,488
The reality

2669
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:36,768
Qanon out of the

2670
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:37,792
You do have

2671
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:38,560
Consistent

2672
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:42,400
Friends of Alex internetworld

2673
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:45,216
He doesn't have sort of ownership of

2674
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:48,544
Fortune places

2675
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:49,568
Reddit

2676
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:50,592
These communities

2677
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:53,408
He's not like able to dictate the

2678
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:54,176
This

2679
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:54,944
You know what you're saying

2680
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:59,552
Used to feel about the mainstream media

2681
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:00,320
Resentment

2682
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:03,136
He doesn't control the narrative we don't control this

2683
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:04,928
And even As Trump was coming in

2684
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:06,976
2015

2685
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,256
There was so many times

2686
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:09,280
Jim and Owens

2687
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:10,304
Troyer do you like

2688
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:11,840
You now the mainstream

2689
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:12,864
You don't control what

2690
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:15,424
We're talking about

2691
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:17,216
There's a snake eating a

2692
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,752
In some ways

2693
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:19,776
In terms of the Ulta

2694
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:20,544
Alternative meat

2695
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:22,848
Did Alex not recognizing

2696
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:24,640
Ternative stuff

2697
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:25,920
Is also out of

2698
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:29,248
He also doesn't care

2699
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:30,016
Control that

2700
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:32,576
6-9 months ago

2701
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:33,344
So whenever he's

2702
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:34,880
Qanon

2703
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:35,648
First point

2704
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:38,720
Is that right

2705
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:41,280
Mission he's never stopped

2706
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,048
Trying to

2707
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:46,400
To take exactly what qanon is talking about and make it his

2708
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,424
Of course

2709
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:49,728
She knows better than them

2710
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:51,520
The thing that bus

2711
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:53,312
Most infuriate him

2712
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:55,872
Is the actual Anan part of

2713
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:59,968
Because if it was if there was a head

2714
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:01,760
Like

2715
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:03,040
Glenn Beck

2716
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:09,440
He would not be trying to co-opt second.

2717
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:10,976
You'd be like

2718
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:11,744
Bulshit

2719
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,048
This guy is not the guy

2720
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:20,448
Stick with me the fact that it's an honest person

2721
02:11:20,704 --> 02:11:21,728
The mystery

2722
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:24,288
Allows the space we're in

2723
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,056
Kitano

2724
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:27,616
Because he can't own going back

2725
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:34,784
A little bit

2726
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:35,552
He insults

2727
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:37,088
Institution

2728
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,880
Necessarily

2729
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:40,672
Idea behind

2730
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:42,208
You just try to

2731
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:43,232
The coop

2732
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:44,512
You behind it right

2733
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:46,048
And appearance of elevation

2734
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:47,328
No no no

2735
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:48,096
You guys

2736
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:49,888
Qanon

2737
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:50,656
It is

2738
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:56,032
You know what's strange to me

2739
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:58,080
Is

2740
02:11:58,592 --> 02:12:01,152
Well actually

2741
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:03,200
Because the best move to fight against

2742
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:04,736
Qanon is to actually go into the

2743
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:06,528
And how it's

2744
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:07,296
Facebook from

2745
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:12,928
These things trials are weird character on Star Trek

2746
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:15,744
Long history of being full of b*******

2747
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:16,768
Of course

2748
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:19,072
Do that I guess if

2749
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,120
Discredit

2750
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:24,448
It's a trump positive

2751
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:29,568
Trump

2752
02:12:29,824 --> 02:12:31,872
We're here to attack that

2753
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:32,896
Recalling to a question

2754
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,432
The others

2755
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:38,272
And furthermore if he starts

2756
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,040
Debunking

2757
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:40,064
Conspiracy theories

2758
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,088
Instead of joining them

2759
02:12:42,368 --> 02:12:43,392
But right

2760
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:45,440
Story

2761
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:46,464
Like

2762
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,232
Big fish

2763
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:49,536
I think we already know what we

2764
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,304
We think

2765
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,584
You're welcome

2766
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,352
Disagree with

2767
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:53,376
If you want but

2768
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:54,912
Extortion

2769
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:56,448
Disagree

2770
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:59,776
Okay we kind of Welcome to

2771
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:02,848
Oh well we kind of see what Alex is take on it is

2772
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:06,944
Only if

2773
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:09,248
If like

2774
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:10,272
When guccifer

2775
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:11,808
Started

2776
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:12,576
Come around

2777
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:14,880
No one really understood

2778
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:15,904
What it was

2779
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:17,952
Yeah but

2780
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:18,720
Navigation start

2781
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:20,768
To happen they started to trace the

2782
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:21,792
Vpns

2783
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:23,840
The logins of

2784
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:31,264
They found that it were didn't like the jet Gru offices right

2785
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,080
That's when it became like

2786
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,360
Okay

2787
02:13:35,872 --> 02:13:36,640
This is a

2788
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:38,176
Cut out

2789
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:40,480
I'm not saying that

2790
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:42,528
This hacking operation

2791
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:44,320
I have no idea

2792
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:47,136
But I think Alex is

2793
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:47,904
Playing with

2794
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,184
Fire unnecessary

2795
02:13:49,952 --> 02:13:50,464
Because

2796
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:53,792
There's a chance that it is a cyber extortion racket

2797
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:55,072
You just lying about it

2798
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:56,096
Gooddata

2799
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:58,144
No consequence for that

2800
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:02,496
In the world we live in now

2801
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:04,032
Especially its

2802
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:10,432
Really risky to associate yourself or stories like this

2803
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:11,200
Turn out

2804
02:14:11,712 --> 02:14:12,480
People are able to

2805
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:14,272
Frosty's

2806
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:15,552
Keebler able to trace

2807
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:17,344
Find it someone Acts

2808
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:18,880
Accidentally didn't sign into there

2809
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:23,232
You got the laptop where the hacking

2810
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:26,304
There is a decent

2811
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,584
Chance that it could

2812
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,120
You are now associated

2813
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:31,168
Sing yourself and telling a story

2814
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:31,936
About something

2815
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:33,984
F******

2816
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:36,800
Is it possible

2817
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:37,568
Like I don't know

2818
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:42,176
I want even overwhelming

2819
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:48,576
Because if there was not over 16 that information will come out

2820
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:55,744
Because if there were not suggesting that there isn't some

2821
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,792
Hacker the best

2822
02:14:58,048 --> 02:15:00,096
There's ever been who at Seibert

2823
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:04,704
If you're talking about

2824
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:07,008
Actual 9/11

2825
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:07,776
Approve

2826
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:09,824
Every

2827
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:11,872
F****** hacker

2828
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:17,248
Within the Chinese government

2829
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:20,064
You break at every hacker in Russia is going to be

2830
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,344
Trying to break

2831
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:26,720
Every hacker in the United States

2832
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:29,280
Everybody's

2833
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,560
Ever had

2834
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:34,144
Would be

2835
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:38,240
One guy it would also or a.m.

2836
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,824
It would become a

2837
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:44,640
Bidding war between plant

2838
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:46,176
Cut out of

2839
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:47,200
All of these

2840
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:53,088
Like everybody would want it no one would want a bid on it has various

2841
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:54,368
Lakefront

2842
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:57,952
Where you at like launder weird cryptocurrencies

2843
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:04,352
Through and it would turn into a trillion f****** dollars for it we never hear about it

2844
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:06,400
They were the single greatest hacker in history

2845
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:09,728
There's a 10% chance

2846
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:11,008
Pull this off

2847
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:14,080
Is there anything less

2848
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:18,432
All the world

2849
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:23,296
Because we're recording this on Thursday night

2850
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:29,184
Another bird

2851
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:33,536
The end of American civilization

2852
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:35,584
We don't know how the story is going to

2853
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:37,120
Play out and it'll be interesting

2854
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:38,144
To see how it does

2855
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:39,936
Because they're real decent

2856
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:45,312
And it'll be a nothing much like the antifa Soros document

2857
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:49,152
Which hours will just later bring up as proof of

2858
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:53,248
Writings without ever having

2859
02:16:53,504 --> 02:16:55,040
But I don't know I don't know

2860
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:56,576
As a human being as

2861
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,112
Go on

2862
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:02,464
But this proves 911

2863
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:04,512
Very small

2864
02:17:05,024 --> 02:17:06,048
And if it is

2865
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:07,840
If it is

2866
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,680
Well we got a f*****-up Time ahead of

2867
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:13,216
Greatest whistleblowers

2868
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:14,240
Of all we

2869
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:15,008
We have

2870
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:16,288
Snowden we have mayonnaise

2871
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:17,568
Reality

2872
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:19,104
Have these people

2873
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:21,152
Their move was

2874
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:22,176
Secret

2875
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:26,016
They're moved within the

2876
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,064
End

2877
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:30,112
That way

2878
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:36,512
Heroically

2879
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:37,280
Attention

2880
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:38,048
I'm from the

2881
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:42,400
That's why Seth rich is such a

2882
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:48,288
You would fit that mold

2883
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:50,592
Who was The Whistleblower

2884
02:17:54,432 --> 02:17:54,944
I'm at front

2885
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:56,224
But

2886
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:58,528
Again it's alright

2887
02:17:58,784 --> 02:18:03,136
As it relates to 9/11 we have next clip where Alex talks

2888
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:04,928
Visa vie

2889
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:18,240
Trump was not involved in all this he went on television

2890
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:20,032
There were bombs in the building

2891
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:22,848
He probably should

2892
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:24,896
Real quick

2893
02:18:25,408 --> 02:18:28,224
Did Justin interview on 9/11

2894
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,784
But he thought they were

2895
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:32,064
Well

2896
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:32,832
What do you mean

2897
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:39,488
Isn't 9/11

2898
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:42,304
She wasn't back then

2899
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:51,264
Terrorist had bombs on the plane

2900
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:53,056
Because he was

2901
02:18:55,104 --> 02:19:00,992
The Iron and Steel girders

2902
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:02,272
If you live in

2903
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:05,344
It's about the penetration to the building

2904
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:08,416
Who's talking about how the windows were so narrow

2905
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:09,952
In that World Trade Center

2906
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:10,720
Building

2907
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:12,256
It was because of all of the

2908
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:13,024
The iron

2909
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:15,840
He's talking about how the building was built from the outside

2910
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:20,448
The structure of it

2911
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:22,240
They couldn't have wide windows

2912
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:25,312
Do you talk about the idea

2913
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:30,176
Is that a plane was able to fly into it and penetrate

2914
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:31,968
Those steel beams

2915
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:34,528
He suggested that there were bombs

2916
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:35,552
Not

2917
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:41,440
That there were bombs at the bottom of whatever to breathe

2918
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:44,256
Increase the impact in order to allow them to

2919
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:45,792
Penetrate those steel beams

2920
02:19:48,096 --> 02:19:50,912
Whatever they were representing at 30,000 miles an hour

2921
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:55,008
Oh you bet that's a possibility buttstocks

2922
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:55,776
People

2923
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:58,080
You can't it seems like if you're flying

2924
02:19:58,336 --> 02:19:59,360
Really really fast

2925
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:00,896
A lot about

2926
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:02,688
You know what

2927
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:03,712
Maybe

2928
02:20:03,968 --> 02:20:04,480
One time

2929
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:07,296
Because Trump is a real estate

2930
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:08,832
Even though he's a

2931
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:10,368
Complete failure in a pile of

2932
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:11,648
And he doesn't pay his

2933
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:13,952
He has some

2934
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:15,232
Engineering

2935
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,536
Are some engineering knowledge

2936
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:19,072
Just know more than you

2937
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:21,376
But not more than Xbox.

2938
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:23,936
Expect

2939
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:25,728
Flying 30,000

2940
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:28,288
Mph is a pretty good penny

2941
02:20:29,568 --> 02:20:34,176
I'm not sure that the speed they're flying put yes absolutely it is it it does seem like it

2942
02:20:34,688 --> 02:20:36,992
Equivalent to a box

2943
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:39,296
We made it

2944
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:40,064
Indicative

2945
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:41,600
Thought that there was some sort of

2946
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:48,768
Yeah

2947
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:55,680
Also invited

2948
02:20:57,984 --> 02:21:02,336
Interview hours after the attacks

2949
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:06,432
40 Wall Street actually was the second tallest building in downtown Manhattan

2950
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:13,088
Replied and it was actually before the World Trade Center

2951
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:14,368
Has the second tallest

2952
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:15,904
But now it's the tallest

2953
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:19,488
Also for fun just to be Petty even after 9/11

2954
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:21,024
40 Wall Street West butala

2955
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:22,816
Manhattan

2956
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,864
70 Prime

2957
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:29,472
So Trump's building he was bragging about what even before 9/11

2958
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:30,240
Hours app

2959
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:34,080
The tallest

2960
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:35,360
And also also

2961
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:36,384
Definitely not because he

2962
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,664
He's a f****** psychopath

2963
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:39,712
Also fun fact about 40 Wall Street

2964
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:41,248
He only bought that

2965
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:43,296
Because of Ferdinand Marcos

2966
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:44,576
IHOP Philippines

2967
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:45,600
Yeah

2968
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:46,624
Kia

2969
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:47,648
Embezzled

2970
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:52,256
Millions and millions of dollars from

2971
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:58,656
New York and 40 Wall Street

2972
02:21:58,912 --> 02:22:01,728
Another building

2973
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:02,496
Disrepair

2974
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:09,920
Rehabilitated as the Trump building

2975
02:22:10,176 --> 02:22:11,456
Event for years

2976
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:12,992
Hanzo

2977
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:14,528
Tons

2978
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:15,296
Criminals

2979
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:16,832
So many people

2980
02:22:17,088 --> 02:22:18,368
Not people necessarily

2981
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:19,392
The business is that

2982
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:20,160
Have been house

2983
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:21,184
1040 Wall Street

2984
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:22,208
Have been

2985
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:23,232
Indicted

2986
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:24,768
It's crazy

2987
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:27,328
I don't know if every building in New York has that

2988
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:29,120
Kind of batting average I don't know

2989
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:30,400
But their batting average

2990
02:22:30,656 --> 02:22:31,168
Looks

2991
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:35,008
Bad also Trump University their address is 40 law Street

2992
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:41,664
That's so much like a haunted house where is likes

2993
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:47,296
Fashion

2994
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:50,880
Have existed and the f****** infiltrated everyone who

2995
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:58,048
It's hard not to look at it that way

2996
02:22:59,328 --> 02:22:59,840
I think this means I

2997
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:01,632
Superfudge

2998
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:04,192
Weird is that Rodger Stone

2999
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:05,728
Through black manafort

3000
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:06,496
Brookstone

3001
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,776
His old Lobby

3002
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:09,568
Group

3003
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:12,128
They used to do a ton of horror musical called black man

3004
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:19,296
Before that they like before Ferdinand Marcos

3005
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:25,696
Avoided lobbyist for Marcos

3006
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:28,256
For this brutal f****** dictator

3007
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:30,560
Who embezzled

3008
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:32,096
The habit I don't know if you know this

3009
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:33,888
Of like taking political

3010
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:34,912
The middle of the night

3011
02:23:35,424 --> 02:23:38,496
Dismembering their body

3012
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:42,080
Disfiguring them and s*** and then leaving them out in public

3013
02:23:42,592 --> 02:23:45,664
For other people to find as a message about what happened

3014
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:49,504
Kind of like that as a message what happened

3015
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:51,552
If you watch who's called Salvage

3016
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:57,696
He was doing that while Rodger Stone was a lobbyist

3017
02:23:57,952 --> 02:23:58,976
And it's interesting that

3018
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:00,000
He took this

3019
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:02,560
Panin bought 40 Wall Street

3020
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:04,864
Didn't work out and then Trump ended up buying it

3021
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,400
I honestly don't

3022
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,472
Like 121 connection

3023
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:12,544
Rodger Stone

3024
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:13,312
Definitely

3025
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:16,640
I'm not trying to prevent it

3026
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:23,040
Conspiracy were like Rodger Stone was absolutely

3027
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:25,344
Interesting

3028
02:24:25,856 --> 02:24:27,648
It's so interesting if that history is

3029
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:33,792
Coincidence

3030
02:24:34,048 --> 02:24:34,560
Is

3031
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:36,608
Just at least knows each other

3032
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,008
Just shy

3033
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:43,776
2 hours

3034
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:46,592
Listen to this episode before like eclipse

3035
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:48,128
Like if I keep going

3036
02:24:48,384 --> 02:24:48,896
Through this episode

3037
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:49,664
We're just going to

3038
02:24:51,456 --> 02:24:51,968
Kudos

3039
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,504
Whatever

3040
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:55,296
Worse than what you saying already

3041
02:24:55,552 --> 02:24:57,088
Implying

3042
02:24:59,136 --> 02:25:04,256
More complicated this narrative

3043
02:25:04,512 --> 02:25:07,328
And so we end

3044
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:14,496
Alex celebrating

3045
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:19,872
Some sort like he's he's delivered this narrative

3046
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:21,152
Perfectly

3047
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:29,088
Businesses this is McStuffin victories made of the president has nothing

3048
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:34,976
Things you do why does release the documents

3049
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:39,072
Through Congress themselves

3050
02:25:39,328 --> 02:25:45,472
Packers are going to release it now

3051
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:50,080
I'm vibing on the song

3052
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:53,664
That's good vibe vibing on that song

3053
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:55,968
I just

3054
02:25:58,016 --> 02:26:00,576
His bums me out not not like cuz it's a bummer

3055
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:01,600
Because like

3056
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:03,904
I don't like just I don't like to see

3057
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:04,928
See the celebration

3058
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:08,512
It's Transit

3059
02:26:08,768 --> 02:26:09,792
Like I I know

3060
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:12,352
I've listened to so much of Alex's show that like

3061
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:13,632
I can't even be happy

3062
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:14,656
For him like

3063
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:17,728
I knows it within a week

3064
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:19,008
I know it was in a week

3065
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:20,288
Because just going to become a

3066
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:23,360
Another like little

3067
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:24,640
Narratives that didn't

3068
02:26:24,896 --> 02:26:27,456
Workout that he will go back about whenever

3069
02:26:27,712 --> 02:26:30,016
To reinforce another Point user

3070
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:31,040
I jumped

3071
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:31,808
I just

3072
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:33,856
Bummer

3073
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:34,624
I think

3074
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:36,160
It's something we don't talk about it

3075
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:37,440
Generally

3076
02:26:37,952 --> 02:26:38,976
Never as explicit

3077
02:26:39,232 --> 02:26:39,744
It felt like

3078
02:26:40,768 --> 02:26:41,792
What we talked about

3079
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:43,328
A little bit already is

3080
02:26:44,608 --> 02:26:45,120
This is such a

3081
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:45,888
Pathetic attempt

3082
02:26:50,496 --> 02:26:52,032
Through

3083
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:52,800
Yeah

3084
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:54,592
How to put it it's just

3085
02:26:55,104 --> 02:26:57,152
I leave this called

3086
02:26:57,664 --> 02:26:58,432
Because I

3087
02:26:58,688 --> 02:27:02,784
I own one level I'm super happy about the idea that like in the same way that

3088
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:03,808
On Christmas Eve

3089
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:04,576
Alex

3090
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:06,368
He told Rodger

3091
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:07,392
Go to talk to song

3092
02:27:07,904 --> 02:27:08,672
Yeah like that

3093
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:11,744
Par with that

3094
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,072
Like he's revealing that someone told him some

3095
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:17,632
We correct

3096
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:20,448
This is the biggest crime he could

3097
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:25,824
Someone absolutely

3098
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:27,872
This isn't his own analysis

3099
02:27:31,456 --> 02:27:32,224
That summer

3100
02:27:33,504 --> 02:27:34,272
In this life

3101
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:36,064
Though which is

3102
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:38,880
Which begs the question of who's telling him this b*******

3103
02:27:40,928 --> 02:27:41,440
Behind

3104
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:42,464
That there's someone

3105
02:27:45,024 --> 02:27:45,792
And I'm not sure who it is

3106
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:51,168
Absolutely

3107
02:27:56,032 --> 02:27:56,544
Like

3108
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:57,824
There's two ways this

3109
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:58,848
Is possibly cancer

3110
02:27:59,360 --> 02:27:59,872
Yeah

3111
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:01,408
Actually probably

3112
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:03,456
Three or four

3113
02:28:03,968 --> 02:28:05,760
Play out

3114
02:28:06,272 --> 02:28:07,296
These people who

3115
02:28:07,552 --> 02:28:08,576
Titan Collective

3116
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:09,344
Get arrested

3117
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:11,136
That's one

3118
02:28:11,392 --> 02:28:11,904
Possibly

3119
02:28:12,672 --> 02:28:13,440
I most likely

3120
02:28:13,696 --> 02:28:14,976
I see that is kind of unlikely

3121
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:17,536
Maybe someone get arrested

3122
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:19,840
If someone gets arrested everyone

3123
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:22,400
Sure that's the way I can collect

3124
02:28:23,168 --> 02:28:23,680
Possibly

3125
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:25,472
I think you're I think you're right General

3126
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:30,080
2

3127
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:32,128
No one pays the the f******

3128
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:32,896
Ransom

3129
02:28:33,152 --> 02:28:33,664
Just fizzled out

3130
02:28:34,176 --> 02:28:35,200
A couple of more

3131
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:35,968
Decryption key

3132
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:39,040
Show other documents

3133
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:40,832
Anything about 9

3134
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:44,928
Right or

3135
02:28:45,184 --> 02:28:45,696
3

3136
02:28:46,976 --> 02:28:47,488
China Wok

3137
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:49,024
Which

3138
02:28:49,536 --> 02:28:50,048
Wow

3139
02:28:50,304 --> 02:28:52,608
Which I think is more like

3140
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:53,888
4

3141
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:55,680
They approved it Hillary Clinton

3142
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:58,240
Was in the World Trade Center in

3143
02:28:58,496 --> 02:28:59,264
The only reason that

3144
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:00,544
She lost the presidency

3145
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:04,384
Was because she died in 2001

3146
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,176
9/11 Hillary Clinton

3147
02:29:07,456 --> 02:29:09,248
Number for Silver Fox

3148
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:10,272
Drake quotes

3149
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:13,344
40K

3150
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:14,368
Precipitated

3151
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:16,672
Attacks because she needed

3152
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:19,488
Which could

3153
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,024
The exact

3154
02:29:21,536 --> 02:29:22,304
Necessary

3155
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:23,584
Ritual in the

3156
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:30,752
Linda bloodworth-thomason they did a witch ceremonies

3157
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:37,152
Alright

3158
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:39,712
Provide

3159
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:44,576
Required to have in order to lose the 2016 election

3160
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:45,856
I don't know

3161
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:48,160
The elevator was slow

3162
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:52,256
She could get to the base

3163
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:55,840
Number 7

3164
02:29:56,096 --> 02:29:57,632
Something else

3165
02:29:57,888 --> 02:29:58,656
I don't know

3166
02:29:58,912 --> 02:29:59,424
I don't think

3167
02:29:59,936 --> 02:30:00,704
Any lakes

3168
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:02,496
Other than propaganda

3169
02:30:02,752 --> 02:30:04,288
Like that's the only thing

3170
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:08,384
I think we can clown on stuff and we can we can have fun

3171
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:10,432
But like I really don't think

3172
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:13,248
I see a lot

3173
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:14,528
Of the world in

3174
02:30:16,064 --> 02:30:16,576
Failed attempt

3175
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:22,464
Like narrative

3176
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:23,232
Who gives a s***

3177
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:26,304
Yeah but this to me it just thinks of

3178
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:28,608
It's yes

3179
02:30:29,376 --> 02:30:30,656
Something's it only

3180
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:31,424
Exist

3181
02:30:31,936 --> 02:30:32,960
Provide fodder

3182
02:30:33,216 --> 02:30:38,080
For people like Alex 100

3183
02:30:40,128 --> 02:30:41,920
These people do

3184
02:30:42,688 --> 02:30:44,224
They're not doing it I don't think

3185
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:44,992
In order

3186
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:47,040
To be of service to Alex

3187
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:49,600
They're doing it cuz they want that extortion money

3188
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:54,208
You have two teams working sort of out of

3189
02:30:55,232 --> 02:30:55,744
Like

3190
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:56,512
They are

3191
02:30:56,768 --> 02:30:57,280
Creating

3192

They don't give a s*** about that

3194
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:04,192
And they'll disappear as soon as

I bet he's big story

3281
02:34:12,608 --> 02:34:13,120
Is this

3282
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:14,912
Cyber-espionage

3283
02:34:15,424 --> 02:34:16,704
Asif razzaq

3284
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:18,240

Yeah

3287
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:23,616
Kidnappers

3288
02:34:26,176 --> 02:34:32,320
Extortion blackmailers on the net right now they would have been kidnappers in the 90s

3289
02:34:32,576 --> 02:34:33,344
Windmill gifts

3290
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:36,672
Austin was making movies of Eric released

3291
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:39,232
Yeah

3292
02:34:46,912 --> 02:34:47,936
Whether you be a man

3293
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:49,216
A woman

3294
02:34:49,984 --> 02:34:50,496
A collective

3295
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:52,544
Or your pronoun

3296
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,312
Is different

3297
02:34:54,592 --> 02:34:55,616
This was a bad idea

3298
02:34:55,872 --> 02:35:01,248
Because once you start a fire around and

3299
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:02,016
Proving that is

3300
02:35:02,272 --> 02:35:03,040
Inside Job

3301
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:04,320
Even if you're lying

3302
02:35:05,088 --> 02:35:06,624
Lot more people are paying attention

3303
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:12,256
You if you're going to cyber store

3304
02:35:12,768 --> 02:35:14,560
Keep it on the low level

3305
02:35:16,352 --> 02:35:16,864
The car

3306
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:19,936
The consequences for playing this game or a little bit

3307
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:20,704
More than

3308
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:21,728
Probably

3309
02:35:21,984 --> 02:35:23,776
To reference

3310
02:35:25,312 --> 02:35:27,104
Stick with the mid-level terrorist

3311

90 grand how about that

3314
02:35:33,504 --> 02:35:34,528
What do I do

3315
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:36,832
To get you out of here with a hostage

3316
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:43,488
Like going to a car dealership

3317
02:35:45,792 --> 02:35:50,400
Conspiracy a superpower

3318
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,264
What gives

3319
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,544
As a power chip

3320
02:35:56,800 --> 02:35:59,104
Is unbelievable

3321
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:01,920
As of how that gives you

3322
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:05,504
The world's you don't get to choose the next superpower

3323
02:36:08,576 --> 02:36:11,392
There's no there's no ways

You get there's no way if you can

3328
02:36:18,816 --> 02:36:19,328
Improve

3329
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:21,376
That 9/11 was an inside job

3330
02:36:21,632 --> 02:36:27,776

Instantaneous

3336
02:36:40,832 --> 02:36:41,856
Destroyed

3337
02:36:42,112 --> 02:36:43,392

02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:49,856
When we launched this

3385
02:38:50,112 --> 02:38:50,880
Are the things

3386
02:38:51,392 --> 02:38:51,904
We've know about

3387
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:57,024
Auto Show we haven't covered a great deal of Alex Jones

3388
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:58,304
So what

3389
02:38:58,816 --> 02:39:00,864
He is a full compendium

3390
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:01,632
Everything Alex Jones

3391
02:39:02,400 --> 02:39:03,424
We haven't covered

3392
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:04,448
He's in tire

3393
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:05,728
We're so

3394
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:07,264
Did you just Robert

3395
02:39:08,288 --> 02:39:12,896
There are no known Known Unknown unknown

3396
02:39:13,664 --> 02:39:15,456
Robert Gates

3397
02:39:15,712 --> 02:39:21,856
Rumsfeld murdered by

3398
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:26,464
Roving band of people

3399
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:30,560
Whether known or unknown

3400
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:32,352
Launch into

3401
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:34,144
The website

3402
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:36,192
The wiki and all that stuff will cover the

3403
02:39:36,704 --> 02:39:37,472
Formation that we are

3404
02:39:37,728 --> 02:39:38,496
Are able to cover

3405
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:41,056
For what

3406
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:42,336
I do

3407
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:44,384
And I think it's comprehensive

3408
02:39:46,176 --> 02:39:47,712
But I don't want to oversell it

3409
02:39:47,968 --> 02:39:48,480
And say like

3410
02:39:48,736 --> 02:39:53,856
Cuz I know you discovered the Boston Bomber

3411
02:39:54,112 --> 02:39:58,720
In that we will that will be there once we cover it I know that I don't know

3412
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,024
It's frustrating to me

3413
02:40:04,352 --> 02:40:06,912
Look at houses behind a paywall

3414
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:08,448
You can go faster

3415
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:13,056
The information there will be great

3416
02:40:14,336 --> 02:40:15,360
The only reason that I push

3417
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:18,944
Next

3418
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:20,224

02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:22,272

3420
02:40:31,232 --> 02:40:37,376
Oh man as you know what is already on that show said let the never do it with her

3421
02:40:37,632 --> 02:40:38,400
Like we would do a

3422
02:40:38,656 --> 02:40:39,936
F****** sound

3423
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:45,824
Quit

3424
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:48,128
I'll save the dark Overlord is a hack

3425
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:51,456
Collective or individual who knows

3426
02:40:54,016 --> 02:40:54,528
Extort

3427
02:40:54,784 --> 02:40:57,344
Right I don't know if that is everlight anyone to

3428
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:58,368
To commit suicide

3429
02:40:58,624 --> 02:41:03,488
For fear of the extortion writing like that committed

3430
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:08,096
Probably not ever actually physically killed

3431
02:41:09,376 --> 02:41:10,144
One guy

3432
02:41:12,192 --> 02:41:12,704
And that guy

3433
02:41:13,728 --> 02:41:14,240
Alex Jones

3434
02:41:15,264 --> 02:41:17,312
Holding

3435
