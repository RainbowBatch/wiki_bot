1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by now it's like I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
About Alex

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,376
Damn Jordan quick question

8
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,216
What's up everybody is now course

9
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,800
Working from home we you and I both working from home for a long time

10
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
Tips for I do it for

11
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808
Because I really can't be all that helpful

12
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,112
I don't do work-from-home well I am

13
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
I'm very consumed with

14
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,184
You literally work-from-home fifth

15
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
The show

16
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
Any tips other than like

17
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
I think you should listen to someone else

18
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,216
I think other people have better.

19
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,544
What's that my question

20
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,640
Yes sir is Jordan what in this time

21
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
Newsome brights

22
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,272
What's up what up what's up

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,832
No solid ray of sunshine

24
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
I'd like to every episode

25
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
You and I try this one again

26
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,096
Smile let's see I mean

27
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
It's hard I can go first

28
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,824
Thinking about this. Not a ton

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Popcorn

30
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
It's a popcorn

31
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,320
And therefore perhaps one of the best things I've ever had

32
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,672
Okay

33
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,072
Maybe the jalapeno cheddar PopCorners

34
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
To be fair even in a non crisis

35
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,656
I probably would be hoarding

36
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,496
If we're in the end times popcorn

37
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,640
Store running out of popcorn

38
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
And they will

39
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
StayWell

40
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,248
You know that feeling

41
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,808
Right now I usually don't like

42
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,160
These ones

43
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
Alright

44
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
Let's see mine

45
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Steven Universe

46
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,632
Future this is the last last 10 episodes of Steven Universe

47
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
Which is

48
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Shredabull show

49
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,520
About a young boy who is also a

50
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
So on and so forth

51
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,640
It's a really heartfelt and right now it is

52
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
Is dealing with a

53
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,224
Narrative that is purely based on

54
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
Recovery from PTSD

55
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
Finding yourself and doing all of these diff

56
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Different things in

57
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,160
How he's dealing with it

58
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,048
Right now especially really comforting

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
That's what I was right

60
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
Great

61
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:53,216
Grapes bag of PopCorners

62
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Absolutely

63
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,808
March

64
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
19th and 20th 2020

65
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
You know hey

66
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,559
Some of it's going to be

67
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,423
Even the point of doing our show as normal for a large stretch

68
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
Shove that since our last episode

69
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,591
Circumstances who would want to be listening to Alex

70
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,151
Not me not

71
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,479
And I can't imagine most of the audience wanting to listen to

72
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
Disaster

73
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
I've gotten messages

74
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
A bunch

75
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
From people

76
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Who said things like

77
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,975
I don't know how you do it I don't know how you listen to him also

78
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,303
That

79
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,143
It's not that difficult to listen to it but I'm finding these circumstances

80
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679
It's not ideal

81
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
I will take all those

82
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:05,407
Old sympathies the people sent me

83
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,991
Shift

84
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
Well we all think

85
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
Congregate

86
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,047
Turn around

87
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
The first Elliott

88
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
I'm a policy wonk

89
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Next

90
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,639
Sweetie honey thank you so much you are now policy wonk

91
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
I'm a policy wonk

92
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:46,623
James

93
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,951
I'm sure now but was wrong

94
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
Got you an alibi was wrong

95
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,095
I'm a policy wonk

96
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
DM Thompson 360

97
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Anderson Cooper

98
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
36 Riverside

99
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,591
Journal policy wonk

100
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,783
Who donated

101
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
Technocrat

102
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
We got to go Full Tilt Boogie on this watch

103
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
Heroin

104
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
Freakishly large

105
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Puppy love

106
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
Jordan

107
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,295
Little bit of

108
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Preamble

109
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Episode

110
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
I believe that

111
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
As its Public Health crisis continues and things

112
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
Get worse than a little bit more

113
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
Brightening and uncertain

114
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,095
I want to take a moment to address something that I've been wrestling with a little bit

115
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,679
It's a thought that's kind of natural to come up in these sorts of Circa

116
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
Stances that is was Alex

117
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
Jones Wright

118
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
It can be difficult because I think

119
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,967
Very important to recognize in situations like this even when some of Alex's vague prediction

120
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Come true

121
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
He's still wrong

122
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,879
There's an important Dynamic to consider and that is the Alex's an alarmist by name

123
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,695
He has to elicit very intense emotions

124
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:32,095
The fear and anxiety from his audience in order to keep them in the full so every world event is presented with an amplifier

125
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Fight level

126
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,191
Usually painting everything is a globalist plot

127
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Hamburgers

128
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,287
In this case is alarmism feels warrant

129
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,615
Aw

130
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Autumn alarm

131
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
Obviously his show win

132
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,991
Way past the line terms of being healthy alarm is

133
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,831
The drifted deeply into Chicken Little the sky is falling territory

134
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,391
Which is the first major strike that would have against him

135
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,511
Altitude alarm isn't was never also also never pointed in any productive Direction

136
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,351
Princeton you talk about the low number of tests being done

137
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
The United States

138
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
Disillusion wasn't to push for

139
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
Testing

140
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,287
He instead decided to yell about how he imagined the lack of testing was a globalist

141
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Plot embarrassed

142
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,103
Trump and it's actually good

143
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,943
Because Trump needs keep the infection numbers artificially low to avoid

144
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Panic

145
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
Glad it worked out perfect rake

146
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599
The point that the government

147
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Point they're making a

148
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
No feeling in terms of

149
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
Testing is a fair one

150
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,487
But the conclusion that

151
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Cause of that

152
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Is Luda

153
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
There were various things that you said

154
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
But you can't really do

155
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Dispute have come

156
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,983
Past but it's important to recognize what sorts of things those are

157
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
There two major categories of let's call them

158
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
Predictions that appear to have come true

159
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
The first

160
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,431
Is completely obvious byproduct of

161
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Things getting worse

162
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
The virus

163
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
In this category give predictions

164
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
Seems like the stock market is going to go

165
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:02,207
By the point this was a main talking point for Alex the city of Wuhan was already under a lockdown

166
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
So even

167
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
Anything's didn't spread much

168
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Past that point

169
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,327
It's a pretty safe bet that there would be some

170
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
Economic implications

171
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,959
This is not the sort of prediction that you could really give someone a ton of credit for

172
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
It's also important

173
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Recognize how this predict

174
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Was used

175
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
This was never presented as Alex giving

176
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Street Financial mark

177
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Prediction

178
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
It was always delivered in the

179
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
Context of saying that

180
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
Rooting the market to embarrass

181
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
Where is Trump was the

182
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
Ultimate goal

183
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
Which is why the globalist

184
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
Release the virus to begin

185
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,695
This is important to remember that the stock market steak

186
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
It was not

187
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
Consequence of events happening in the real world

188
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
It was the

189
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
Secret motivation

190
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Find it all

191
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
Alex has in no way proved

192
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,287
Further the idea that the global is to release the virus to try to attack the stock market

193
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
Trump is used

194
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
To justify Trump

195
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,663
Involvement in the delayed and bad response to the outbreak

196
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,247
Trump didn't put out adequate numbers of test because he

197
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
The globalist

198
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
Tank the economy

199
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
Already knew that if the real numbers were out there the public

200
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
Panic in the market would fall

201
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Let's remember this

202
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
The good guy

203
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
Analysis definition

204
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:16,447
Not all that impressive prediction that the market would be affected by an outbreak is ultimately repackaged into

205
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
The imaginary motivation for the outbreak

206
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,103
Itself and then used to justify Trump's negligence in his response to it

207
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
The other type of prediction

208
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Kind of right about is

209
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
Things that he predicted with

210
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
Actually the result of a negligent response

211
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,671
What are the big early ones of those categories how Alex that there be an outbreak around Seattle

212
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
Turn out to be correct

213
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
This was a pessimistic prediction

214
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,327
But it wasn't an outlandish there's already a

215
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
Confirmed case in the area

216
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,191
If you're an alarmist you will take that case and you will build on

217
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Which is what Alec

218
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,591
It's important to recognize that Alex's behavior in this crisis isn't really all that out of the norm

219
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
For him

220
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,687
Back in 2014 he was saying that Obama was trying to bring Ebola

221
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:03,551
Into the country but you forget about that his stereo because the situation was handled with appropriate

222
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,135
Intensity there's International cooperation in Obama took care of that s***

223
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
Everybody else Roosevelt

224
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
There are hundreds of examples like

225
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Even outside the medical

226
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,167
Every time Alex yells at his audience after the shooting about all the guns being take

227
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
All the times you would prophesy a total

228
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
To the economy and its number of Rage

229
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
Back when he was primarily a gold picture

230
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:31,455
Or the many many times Alex said that the globalists are going to try to kill Trump within the next week

231
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,295
Alex's business model largely relies on being wrong all the time

232
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
But insisting the audience

233
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
Forget about all those incorrect predictions

234
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
Can only focus on the stuff he was

235
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Call Stu Wright

236
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
About

237
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
As a coronavirus situation

238
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,351
Gets worse he's able to play the game where you can say that he was right and everyone called him wrong

239
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,631
But it's important

240
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
Recognize

241
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
They even if he hits some of the

242
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
You still a liar and a fraud

243
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,847
It's also crucial not to lose sight of the main elements of his

244
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Conspiracy

245
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,967
He believes that the Gates Foundation already has a treatment or vaccine for

246
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Which is incorrect

247
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,343
He's just lying about a group that the gates have given some money too

248
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
The pure Brighton's

249
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,183
What is a patent for completely unrelated Coronavirus

250
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
Related to a vaccine

251
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Meaning for chickens

252
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,071
He's asserted as fact of the viruses man-made is tons

253
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
Different viruses all lumped together

254
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Aunt has Quotev

255
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
The Hy-Vee deliver

256
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,287
All this is from a non. Study that was self retracted by its authors

257
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
After the methodology

258
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Conclusions began

259
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
Getting some review from their scientific peers

260
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
Who's on the work to be deeply flawed

261
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,271
Alex still believes every exaggeration he's made about that studytube

262
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
Profound

263
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
He believes without any evidence

264
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
The study was retracted

265
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
Because the authors were pressured by the global

266
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,303
Alex's claimed Atlantic said the virus had a 15% mortality rate

267
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Not true

268
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
The study only looked at a handful of Asians

269
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Developed

270
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
Severe symptoms like pneumonia

271
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
And it's not

272
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
Something you can extrapolate to the

273
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
General population

274
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Even Alex

275
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
Understand

276
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
The study was about

277
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
But he's not

278
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
Stopped from making the claim Atlanta

279
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
10% mortality rate

280
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
That is implying

281
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
He believed in deserted as fact

282
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
The virus was stolen

283
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
China

284
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
This is not true

285
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
So not true in

286
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Information

287
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,095
Sentence dum dum expert Francis Boyle came up with a better day

288
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
That Meredith was at the virus

289
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
Who created

290
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
C Chapel Hill

291
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
This is not

292
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
True

293
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
This narrative

294
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,615
On the term gay to function appearing in to study for UNC

295
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
2015

296
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,455
As well as a recent study about the novel Coronavirus

297
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,551
The 2015 study has given a Coronavirus

298
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
Gain-of-function related

299
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Ace2 cleavage

300
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,719
Where's the recent study was about the coronavirus it was noting that the virus

301
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,535
Naturally occurring K2 function related to

302
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
These are not the same thing at all

303
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Button

304
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
The word gain-of-function in both studies

305
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,983
And that constitutes a closed case on Alec

306
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
What's a show

307
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,543
Alex's asserted as fact

308
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
Based on net study from 2015

309
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
So the virus

310
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
The China

311
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
This is just a lie based on the fact

312
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
There was some Chinese funding that went to the state

313
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
And it could also be explained

314
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Very easily

315
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,951
Alex is assertiveness fact based on the headline

316
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
Profound about that 2015

317
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
C study

318
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
That there was a big public

319
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,423
This is an article on website the scientist

320
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,751
With the headline lab-made Coronavirus

321
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
I was just

322
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,383
Choose whether or not

323
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
Which is a complete fabrication

324
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,711
Just making it up it's a lie

325
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,015
Is a very short article and if you read it

326
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,831
Debate about whether gain-of-function studies

327
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
Themselves are ethical

328
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Asserted as fact

329
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
And then walked back

330
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,975
Embrace the idea that

331
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
Coronavirus specific

332
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Targeting Asian

333
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
Military age Spanish

334
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Possibly

335
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
The Deep state

336
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
Attacking China for Fenton

337
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,471
He has no reason to believe it's at all it's

338
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Completely made up

339
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,543
Yes it 110 bloated is that

340
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Trump

341
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
Is the reason this has happened

342
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
Hope is that was a short-lived

343
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
But that was there

344
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
There are plenty more examples

345
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
But these are the very Foundation of Lies

346
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,903
Misinterpretations Alex's used to build up his Central conspiracy

347
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
This isn't saying anything

348
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
About the cities allowed is gay

349
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,327
He let Steve pieczenik claimed that he was the first person the United States

350
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,631
Get the virus itself with antibiotics

351
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,935
Even though antibiotics don't treat viruses

352
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,239
You let Mike Adams lie about Havasu

353
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
Tito's transmitted disease

354
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
Yes he's

355
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
Supporting colors making claims ranging from

356
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
The virus

357
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
Security to

358
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
Bubbles because

359
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
China could be infected

360
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
It high anxiety times

361
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
The work of alarmist

362
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Some propaganda

363
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Becomes more

364
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
Because we're all can

365
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
And probably

366
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Scared

367
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,839
If you aren't paying close attention to the finer details of what Alex is doing Fade Into the background

368
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,911
And you just kind of remember him saying that the market was going to go down

369
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
And that martial law was going to come in

370
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,103
There isn't really martial law at this point there are cities and states

371
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
It's hard not to

372
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
I feel like that's the same

373
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
Will martial law

374
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,503
It it martial law

375
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
It's in the neighborhood

376
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
The issue though is it be

377
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,231
Things that Alex is right about where relatively

378
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
The quinces

379
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Decisions.

380
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
He supports made

381
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Spell tomato

382
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,167
If Obama had a handle the Ebola outbreak in 2014 the white

383
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Trump has handled

384
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
This outbreak

385
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,543
Alex probably would have looked a lot closer to right back then too

386
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Anyway my point is

387
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Whatever soup

388
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,479
Superficial things Alex's vagina correct about our way way overshadowed by the

389
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,527
Completely and glaringly wrong about

390
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Which happened

391
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
BV cornerstones of his

392
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Conspiracy

393
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
Anyway I'm sorry about this big rant

394
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,463
To begin the episode but I really

395
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,511
Have this feeling of

396
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,607
Being a question in my head

397
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
To stop that question about

398
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Well I mean

399
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,287
No no absolute and this is not like

400
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
Even if he's

401
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
Climbing onto some s*** this is something that the people is

402
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,711
Epidemiologist have been predicting an outbreak

403
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Like this for 20 years

404
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,319
Of course

405
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,135
Of course but the point is not that he was right by it

406
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,463
As long as you're paying attention to what professional

407
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Experts are saying

408
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
And then using that is kind of a basis

409
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
For prediction

410
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,119
You'll probably be right often enough

411
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
And then if you're

412
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
Conspiracy theorist you just say

413
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
It's part of the conspiracy

414
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Predicting

415
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,079
Outbreak natural consequences

416
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,407
Such as the stock market going down

417
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,991
As the reason viruses

418
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,343
It's easy to

419
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
I want to call it missing

420
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
The forest for the trees

421
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Tannerite

422
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
It's not

423
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
And it's also a little bit like

424
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
There's an arsonist in

425
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Chicago and he's

426
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:17,727
Don't worry about the arsonist if it starts burning down buildings like okay well eventually it's going to burn down buildings

427
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,543
You don't need to worry about it and then the Great Chicago Fire happen

428
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
Sounds like there's going to be economic consequences

429
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
For this and you're like yeah.

430
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
You helped

431
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
So

432
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,783
Episode 1 start on the 19th

433
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Is narcotics drop from

434
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Today Show

435
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,671
I'll let you go to Cuba today and the most beautiful women you can imagine

436
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,767
Could you for a $2 little tube of wormer

437
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,095
How do you know that

438
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Message board

439
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:53,823
So are we start on the 19th and it's actually kind of fitting because Alex is going

440
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Feels like he's

441
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
Proven

442
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
That

443
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
The Democrats and the left

444
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,807
Call cheering for the economy to collapse

445
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
Because they want to her Trump we got to sort of the justification for why he believes that the virus was released

446
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,143
It's so obvious and is it going to be running

447
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
Brothers episode it's all just Bill Maher

448
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,543
Where to get into the public land by the globalist to you

449
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,479
Celebrated say

450
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,295
We want a recession or depression

451
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
To punish Trump voters

452
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
Economy so we submit

453
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
And it's worth it to take the hit

454
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
Said that 2 weeks ago again

455
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
And now you say

456
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
Economy targeted

457
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:55,007
It's all bilmar pretending that everybody saying

458
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
Exactly the same things as well

459
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
It's ludicrous

460
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
That's not fair

461
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
No that's not

462
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,663
When you recognize

463
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
Kind of the foundation

464
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
For his belief or is just

465
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Application for

466
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,855
Claiming that the Democrats wanted to destroy the economy to attack Trump

467
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
Which is why they released the virus

468
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,719
Stop watching Bill Maher

469
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:22,143
Podcast about Gilmore what about you

470
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,543
Stop pretending in something bigger than this

471
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
That's such

472
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Like

473
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:36,991
A perfect encapsulation of everybody's arguing like people are ready to vote for a socialist

474
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
Does not matter

475
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Does not matter

476
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
Biden will be called a socialist

477
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,951
Ad nauseam in the same world that we are called

478
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,279
People who want the economy to collapse because Bill Maher's

479
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,607
But it's also because there's a little bit of

480
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:57,727
With socialist for people like Alex's social welfare programs

481
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,775
Anybody who has any kind of idea that the

482
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
The state should do things

483
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Basically

484
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:11,295
You know you have them calling like Obama social as they other call John Kerry socialist

485
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
That it's like that doesn't make sense

486
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
What's butt in there

487
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,928
Very anti-communist

488
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,768
Cold War holdover mentality

489
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
It's okay

490
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
I guess

491
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,936
But up it doesn't matter

492
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
Is going to come

493
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,032
So Alex has figured out that

494
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
Today's going to be a

495
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,336
Not

496
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
A short-lived

497
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
Situation in America

498
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
Things out here first

499
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Oops

500
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,208
The government looking at 18 months

501
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
18 months a lot

502
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Nice

503
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:11,456
She only indictment

504
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,040
I noticed every couple days and restrictions

505
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
Or control

506
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,928
Until they get the depression they're looking for

507
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,744
Hold on to that thought that Alex doesn't like

508
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,072
Qanon

509
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,912
Admittedly I have no idea how long anything is going to actually last

510
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Have no predictor

511
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,472
Disabilities on that front

512
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
You're next

513
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,776
Trying to predict that has

514
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,824
Difficulty because the whole lot outcome

515
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,616
Is based on individual action

516
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,432
Are people don't take this seriously the timeframe for things

517
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,224
Get back to what you might call normal

518
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Nextstep

519
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,808
There's just almost know what you could

520
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
You'll see

521
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
The difference

522
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,440
Yeah outcomes

523
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Depending on

524
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Different

525
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,256
Considerate

526
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
Even those are

527
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
You know who.

528
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,424
The 18-month number that Alex is talking about his specifically related to the UK

529
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,032
Boris Johnson previously announced that their strategy was going to be

530
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,336
The virus is going on

531
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,408
Richie epidemiologists roundly said was he

532
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,944
Very bad idea

533
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,504
I really think that we shouldn't

534
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Alexa

535
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,112
Lunatic reality TV show Stars

536
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,440
Magazine commentators do our highest

537
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,232
I think it's a bad idea

538
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
It's not

539
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,048
It's not productive only gets a good idea

540
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,680
According to an article in time

541
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
Healthcare System

542
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,264
Maximum capacity of many times over

543
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:45,664
Cuz there was an article about Boris Johnson

544
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
To Take Along

545
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
Still not 18 months

546
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
This

547
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Wave

548
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
May laugh

549
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,368
Yeah that accept

550
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
So I thought that's what it was

551
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
Amber comes from

552
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,328
That's the estimated time it will take to develop and get approval for a vaccine

553
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
At which point

554
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Social distancing

555
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Similar measures

556
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,544
This is not a statement that anyone is going to be a lockdown for 18 months

557
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,128
It's merely a reflection that we have some sort of containment

558
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,688
Considerations probably until there's a vaccine

559
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
And that's the estimated time frame for that 12

560
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,832
It's also inaccurate to save these things will only last few weeks

561
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
That's a slight misunderstanding of statement

562
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
From Health officials about the lengths

563
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
Things likes

564
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
Stay-at-home rules

565
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
Spike we have here in Illinois

566
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Which lasts until April 7th

567
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,632
There's a possibility that it'll extend after that

568
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,936
Maybe probably but that's

569
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,728
Superior things can be reassessed

570
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
Some experts will know a little bit more at that point

571
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,592
People singing the last 2 weeks or not

572
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,664
Right right

573
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,968
That's the. And then we'll reassess it no more

574
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
From that point

575
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,528
It's them all trying to be like

576
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,576
Can we please hit pause on this

577
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:01,696
We're going to try and test everybody and get a full idea of where exactly we are

578
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
And then we can move forward

579
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
Instead of being like

580
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
I guess we're just going to go for it

581
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,120
Let's see what happens

582
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,192
Beauty why not I wrote in the newspaper for a bit

583
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,008
It's probably pessimistic to assume that social dis

584
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,872
The measures will last 18 months

585
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,528
It's probably good idea to expect worse than the best-case scenario but if people take this seriously and we get lucky on the medical

586
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,600
The worst-case scenario doesn't have to come to pass

587
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
The other thing

588
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,976
This is based on is a post on Michael Snyder's economic collapse

589
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,304
Blog which Alex's reposted

590
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
The US government is preparing a

591
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,888
For an 18-month

592
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
Critical shortages

593
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,728
Sub headline is are you prepared for the

594
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,544
Nationwide shutdown to last 18

595
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
2 months

596
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
No

597
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:58,016
This blog post is based on a 100-page

598
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,808
U.s. government covid-19 response

599
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,416
The only place in this document that 18 months comes up is in the section that list

600
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
The assumption

601
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
His plan was based

602
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:12,608
The number to is 18 months or longer and could include multiple waves

603
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,704
Who be important to also point out that assumption number three is quote

604
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,032
The spread and severity of covid-19 will be difficult to forecast

605
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
And character

606
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
This is a document that

607
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:29,760
It's primarily about government responsibility

608
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Consideration

609
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,832
It's an organizational document more than a

610
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
Anything else

611
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
And I think a real stretch

612
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
Document

613
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,952
To prove it even the government

614
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
Planning

615
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
42 month lockdown

616
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,912
I think it's important to remember is that this 18-month number is an assumption of how long the pandemic may have an effect on the country that work

617
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Meijer's Appliance

618
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,264
But that doesn't mean the same thing as there's going to be a year-and-a-half lockdown

619
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,848
Key point is

620
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,176
The active

621
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
Phoenix time

622
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,760
The phase where would be returning to what they call a quote

623
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,296
Preamble epidemic posture

624
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,112
That's part of the 18-month lifespan

625
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,160
Of whatever there

626
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
Assuming

627
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,560
This doesn't say a team of lockdown

628
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
Considerations of the doctor

629
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,912
Revisions in the scenarios modeling in projection

630
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,752
Used to inform planning and consequent changes in planning should be made

631
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Affecting the parameters

632
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
Used for this modeling

633
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
So even this

634
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,224
Appliances

635
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,552
Scenarios

636
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
As more information

637
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
No the future

638
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
Vyond

639
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,976
Yeah so using that to be like how you're going to be locked in your home for 8

640
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
So

641
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Knox

642
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,776
Mithril

643
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,592
Okay

644
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,384
Alex is feeling a little bit

645
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Sensitive

646
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
About

647
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
His behavior

648
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,808
Gets into that a little bit

649
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
What their tail between their legs and run home

650
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:18,816
Understanding you're going to get a big giant Great Depression now

651
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Take that

652
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,704
Collapses Millions will starve to death

653
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,032
Star the deaths during the Great Depression United States

654
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
I'll definitely pressure

655
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,176
This is the middle of a discussion about Alex's

656
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,480
Kind of feels like a sales pitch

657
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,064
But he's also saying that my Patriot Supply is stopped taking New Order

658
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,904
I'm not sure if that's true because according to their website

659
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
I just checked it

660
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
In an update from March

661
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
20th

662
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
They're still taking orders

663
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,304
There's a 12-week

664
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,632
I'm not sure what the situation is here like maybe they said Alex

665
00:28:53,888 --> 00:29:00,032
Yeah we don't want to be. I don't think that maybe it's like we can't

666
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,872
Handle the load from all of us

667
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
Salford tons

668
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,712
Right-wing media figures

669
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,016
Might just be a thing where it's like we're not taking

670
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,552
Discounted orders

671
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:16,160
From our Affiliates anymore

672
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,464
Yeah yeah going to do our own thing

673
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,536
We have a demand of Italian us that we don't need

674
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,096
A bit right now

675
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
Again that's just

676
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,960
I don't know that but I do know that their website

677
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
You still taking orders

678
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
This really just feels like

679
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Because

680
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,872
He's saying that they're not taking orders anymore it doesn't feel like I say

681
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,480
Self-defense

682
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:47,392
That's why he's talking about the

683
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,720
I'm not a bad person for obviously exploiting this crisis that I didn't know

684
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
This bad until

685
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,304
Pretty much right f****** now and now I feel bad about it

686
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
We've heard Alex talk about that in the past

687
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,168
Tell million starve to death during the Great Depression

688
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,472
Discuss how it's absolutely not true

689
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,288
He keeps bringing it up though and in this case

690
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,336
It's in the context of talking about his food buckets

691
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,896
So curious about this claim comes from

692
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,992
One thing you can be certain of is anytime Alex says something come

693
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,040
Songs from major universities

694
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,088
It does not come from major university

695
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:23,744
It turns out the pissed at traces back to research done in 2008 by a Russian gentleman named Boris Boris

696
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,328
I know

697
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,376
Boris Boris

698
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
That is the guy's name

699
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,984
Okay

700
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
Providence

701
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
Nrt

702
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,824
Attraction outside of those places

703
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,384
Most likely because his work was very flawed

704
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,224
I've looked at his assumptions and found that the research is just

705
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
Not good

706
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:51,392
His basic point is that if you refuse Census Data there about 7 billion people unaccounted for during the Great Depression and their

707
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
For they must have all started

708
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
That doesn't sound right

709
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,352
Leaving aside how that's a gigantic leap to make and it's unclear and 7 billion are even unaccounted for during a.

710
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,912
There's a ton of other explanations for the Democrats

711
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:09,312
Numbers like people not filling out sensitive during the Great Depression or mass relocation caused by things like the Dust Bowl

712
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Exactly

713
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,432
Without minimizing the hardships of people living in the depression-era there's just no good evidence

714
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,480
It's 7 million people died of starvation

715
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,528
That raises a question

716
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
What's behind this claim the Boris autism

717
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
Pretty explicit

718
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,232
And that Pravda article that the intention here was to frame the Great Depression

719
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,536
Is America's holy

720
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:36,448
Okay alright so the goal is whitewashing the ussr's band

721
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:42,848
Man-made famine in Ukraine billions of people starve to death but it was America

722
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,384
I didn't see

723
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,480
Where it's not we're not bad guys everybody was starving people for fun

724
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,296
That was adorable that he was doing it everybody

725
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:56,160
Way too complicated for us to get into on this episode

726
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
This is super

727
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,792
He is a huge anti-communist Auntie USSR guy

728
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:06,912
His entire world has grown out of the red-baiting hardliners

729
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
How to sync for him to be citing a statistic about us death during the Great Depression that was more or less produced

730
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,848
Used as a propaganda narrative

731
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
To minimize the case of

732
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
USSR causing

733
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
This is an imp

734
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
The message of the erroneous

735
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,088
Stat that 7 billion US citizen star vinaigrette

736
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
Is more important than the context

737
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
Where that's at

738
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
Because Alex's 70s

739
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
The erroneous that helps him

740
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
Further and justify that goal

741
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,656
So who cares if it comes from a pro USSR anti USA

742
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
Are you as a piece of propaganda

743
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:45,312
This is not it is really like we're in

744
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
Like

745
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
The abyss looking back

746
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
Kind of. Of

747
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,760
History all of these guys are born from a bleach

748
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
Anti-communist

749
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Lunatic

750
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
Mill

751
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,928
But because the only people now who agree with them in terms of profit

752
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
Genda outfit are those

753
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,584
Former communist people that you've they have to become stories but it's just like

754
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
Radical Christian

755
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:16,288
It like radical Christians agree with radical Islam then they do with

756
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,312
Anything else you know

757
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,384
Like the these strange times makes strange bedfellows

758
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,408
Those kind of situations

759
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
Or you become what you hate the most

760
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
Like

761
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,296
It's just it's just weird

762
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:33,696
What's wants to sell more than he cares about these principles of hated usmri guess

763
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:39,072
You would think a guy you would think if you would like signed his article about 7 million Americans dying

764
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
Starvation during the Great Depression

765
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,752
Why is this person making this claim alright like I did

766
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
Alex's

767
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,800
It's not that easy

768
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:54,688
Boris Boris all sounds great I'm going to pretend I saw that from a major university

769
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
So

770
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,832
There's a thing is really good

771
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Inappropriate

772
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,160
And that is

773
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
To release

774
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
People from

775
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,048
During this Coronavirus

776
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
Outbreak because

777
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Over

778
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
Very detrimental to People's Health

779
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,008
Because I end up in a very bad situation

780
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
We should remove that we should really

781
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:27,712
Eastham Prison I mean we should do even if even if you don't

782
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,040
Want to this is even if you have no

783
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
Christened

784
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
Good part of it

785
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
Just a tap yourself in

786
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
If you do not release

787
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,232
People from prison then you keep them in the

788
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
Overcrowded

789
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
It's spaced the virus is going

790
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
Get in there and go

791
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,960
And then

792
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,128
More possible than absolutely

793
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,712
Jla's not release thousands

794
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:06,368
Since 2 days ago

795
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
View

796
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Thought

797
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,864
To go out to walk your dog you're going to jail

798
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:21,216
They want you the producer to know we own your ass

799
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Hey White

800
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,288
Hey

801
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Get in there

802
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
So

803
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,664
The government website literally list

804
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
The acceptable reasons

805
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,480
To leave your home and one of them is quotes

806
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:36,064
For short trips close to your home link to physical individual activity

807
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
Before the needs of Doom

808
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:44,256
System where you need to fill out a form to have in your possession in case you're out your stop by patrolling office

809
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
You know

810
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,144
Super thrilled with

811
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,448
I don't know this for certain

812
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,008
But I have to think that if you're out walking your dog

813
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,544
Even if you don't have one of those forms

814
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,080
You're probably just going to get a warrant

815
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,432
Either way Frances is a 40 people in jail for violating the quarantine

816
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,248
Guidelines

817
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:10,112
You know what we have all of these people that we

818
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Keep separate

819
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
So if one of them gets out we need to put them

820
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,280
With a whole bunch of other people

821
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
Perfect sense

822
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
That's a problem of the thinking

823
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:26,752
Anthony issue California releasing prisoners I can't find any evidence that the prisoners being released of the ones who were convicted of violent

824
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,568
Crimes until it's mostly people

825
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
Pretty short time left on their sentences to

826
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
To begin with

827
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,224
Prison overcrowding is a serious issue particularly in a Public Health crisis

828
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:41,088
Anything that can be done to minimize the risk that incarcerated persons face is something that should be

829
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Considered

830
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,648
Does that mean releasing all murders

831
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,000
Not necessarily but it does mean possibly releasing non-violent drug of

832
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
Appropriate

833
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,328
The house the violent offenders in the

834
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Responsibly

835
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,680
From everything I can tell from the Articles I've read that

836
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
Basically what time

837
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,520
For someone like Alex who allegedly has opposed

838
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:03,104
People being in jail for drugs and likes to pretend he's a f****** libertarian

839
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
Should be a good

840
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
But it's not

841
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:14,112
Weather.in the islamists The Immigrant

842
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,928
Producer producer they're going to jam you up

843
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
Do you have one like

844
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,304
In his mind physical characteristics

845
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
Sure I would say

846
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:30,496
Talk about that

847
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,336
Hilarious

848
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,408
All the compliant good slave

849
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,688
Starving nailed

850
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,392
A big supply of a lot of our supplements motherfuker

851
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:53,024
Wow Behavior

Parker

Types of about food sales

854
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,168
And then all the sudden be like well yeah

855
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:04,032
Obviously we need to get rid of all illegal immigrants in Muslims

856
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
And you should buy

857
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
Just so you know

858
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,944
We need to get rid of all of them about immigrants but you should

859
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
It's a bit it's a bit much

860
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:21,696
Position anybody who has any concerns about Alex being on the up-and-up and being

861
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
The bad stuff

862
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:27,072
Go check light on

863
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
Alex

864
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
And this episode is

865
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,168
Is mostly on vlive

866
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,216
The martial law is coming

867
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
It's here

868
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
Tip

869
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
It's not a whole lot of evolution in

870
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
In terms of

871
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,872
Narratives about the virus cause a lot of that's pretty solidify

872
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Like the

873
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,480
It was made in that lab UNC Chapel Hill

874
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
Bio weapon

875
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,320
The whole thing but now he needs to build from

876
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
Do you know this is

877
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
Very obvious develop

878
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
That is the Bill Gates is

879
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,232
Is the big bad guy who is the villain behind.

880
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,816
Alex gets into that a little bit here

881
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,632
Here is just a short sampling

882
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
Bill Gates

883
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,568
Headed up the UN disease X operation cygnus mystery things coming in a few years ready World Government will save you

884
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,664
Tabletop exercise in November with 65 million die

885
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
Coronavirus

886
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
How They Roll the 20

887
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,040
He's got the patented vaccine ingredients

888
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Then

889
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,976
Family TV shows that he finances

890
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
About how he's a hero

891
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,072
Vaccine stopping World pandemic

892
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,376
Get the bird flu

893
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
The swine flu

894
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
The wine flu

895
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,640
Of the big panda China

896
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:48,480
All that stuff about Bill Gates is nonsense and stuff we've gone over the past

897
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
But I wanted to check

898
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,296
In real quick

899
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
Who claimed that the ended all of these diseases

900
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,952
Bird flu is not one specific disease

901
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,000
Is there a lot of Avian Influenza

902
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,072
But obviously the one hour to talk about is H 5 n 1

903
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:08,960
Interesting Lee the first case of human h5n was found in Hong Kong which according to Alex's stated policy set

904
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
He doesn't believe that's part of China

905
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,592
That's but that's on the cost

906
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,176
He cute he would call that China for the purposes of this article

907
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,832
B2009 H1 N1 swine flu

908
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
Capri openly debated origin

909
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,672
My people weren't entirely clear

910
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,720
In 2016 researchers at the

911
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,048
The Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai

912
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
Genetic analysis

913
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,888
Trace back to Central Mexico

914
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:44,544
Sores in the current outbreak or fair to say that they started in China

915
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,824
Epidemiology

916
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
Kind of pointless

917
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:52,480
I was just really know anything about this topic as evidenced by his claim that all these outbreaks originated

918
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,320
Play the game of assigning blame to his chosen Target

919
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
In this case

920
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,112
China go go

921
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
Also if you saying that these are the

922
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,232
The four big pandemics then

923
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Ebola

924
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
Coverage

925
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,632
Didn't see that left off his list

926
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
It doesn't comport with

927
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
What's today's narrative

928
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
So it doesn't

929
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
Yeah I can't

930
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
I cannot

931
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,568
It just it's so stupid

932
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,128
Like unless China literally made it

933
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
Which they did

934
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,176
Ben

935
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,736
You can't and it doesn't matter where it originated

936
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,528
Viruses can exist

937
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,064
And explode from literally a

938
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,112
Yes

939
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
They're older than

940
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:37,280
There's an element of Randomness Earth or not

941
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Space

942
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
Viruses are

943
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,936
Just part of the game I'm done with that yeah I think it's space is full

944
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
It's entirely possible viruses

945
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,056
Seated all life on this planet that Trump is trying to create space force

946
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:52,384
In order to

947
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,199
Okay alright

948
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,247
Got to find that dark matter

949
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
Smoking

950
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
Is this Thursday

951
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,439
Coming up on Friday

952
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
Guess who you think

953
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:16,447
Big and usually promote the next day's interview in advance

954
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
Full-time

955
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
So

956
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Disappointing

957
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,431
A big boys TV

958
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:33,343
Nope Nugent very smart lady, know her intended pretty good

959
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:45,887
Until all this is interview want to meet tomorrow at Thai Noon going to talk

960
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:51,263
Far is Depew moment Ted Nugent

961
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:57,919
He's going to have Ted Nugent's wife on to talk Coronavirus

962
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
She right

963
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Books

964
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,391
Some of them about being married

965
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:13,023
Okay so that makes her well situated to talk about the Coronavirus

966
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:19,423
Instructor who get into her when she shows up

967
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:27,359
Today whatever she shows up on the show

968
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,919
Covid-19

969
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,223
So like I said

970
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
Certainly there is a

971
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:39,647
The theme that runs through this like I said when Alex talks about the Bringing Down the economy

972
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
It's just Bill Maher

973
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,719
Sickening people

974
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:47,327
You're not just trying to blame Trump with this until the economy as they said they would do to bring down Trump

975
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,239
Rollover bowel just it's it's such a Thor attarian

976
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,799
I don't like Bill Maher

977
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,079
Shorting the market

978
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,639
So you can see in that clip again

979
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,431
The only reference Alex can ever make

980
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,991
When he talks about the plants bring down the economy to get rid of trump

981
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,039
Look Bill Maher said on HBO

982
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,879
I don't want to believe that there's no globalist conspiracy afoot

983
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
But weirdly

984
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,463
The only proof is something that Bill Maher say

985
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Great

986
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:22,143
So last week or a lot of stories that came out about people in Congress selling off stock weirdly right after they got a briefing

987
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
I'm about to Coronavirus

988
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Situation

989
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,983
That was such a really

990
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,591
Interesting coincidence really like

991
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
This looks so bad

992
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,455
They need to prove their good name

993
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,295
According to the hill Republicans Kelly Loft loffler

994
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,391
James inhofe and Richard as well as Democrat Dianne Feinstein

995
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,183
Each sold 100,000

996
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,719
The dollars in stock

997
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:51,071
Classified briefing on January 24th

998
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,119
On the threat of the coronavirus outbreak

999
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,191
Newsflash four of the worst people in the world

1000
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:00,031
Do the worst thing in the world everyone's got an excuse

1001
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
But I'm not sure anyone cares

1002
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,663
I don't know what the government should do about these individual cases but it's

1003
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,455
Probably time to ban elected officials

1004
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
We're having stocks

1005
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:14,367
A conflict of interest is just something we apparently can't trust people to handle responsibly when they're supposed to be acting the public

1006
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,999
I thought that's what Alex was talking about when he said people are shorting absolutely no

1007
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:25,375
Of course not there's no way that he would criticize noted monsters senator inhofe

1008
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,679
Exel stock

1009
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,215
Presumably based on non-public in

1010
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,031
Nation which might be accurately called insider trading

1011
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
But that's not the same thing as short sell

1012
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:38,431
Short-selling is a super risky Market play that goes like this

1013
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,479
You have a hunch that a business

1014
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,271
The stock is going to drop in price

1015
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,807
So you borrow stocks

1016
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,343
From someone willing to lend them to

1017
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
Then you immediately selves

1018
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,927
With the expectation that you can buy them

1019
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,951
Them back later

1020
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,999
40 substantially lower price

1021
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
At that point you could have

1022
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
Return to stock

1023
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
Double ender in pocket

1024
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
The prophets

1025
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,911
You theoretically make a lot of money without any

1026
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
Initial investment

1027
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,495
Side is that if your hunch is wrong

1028
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:07,615
And the stocks increase in value

1029
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,639
So you can return them

1030
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,663
The lender

1031
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,455
It's literally gambling

1032
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:16,063
Economy is built almost entirely upon Shameless

1033
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,647
The bulk of markets

1034
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,183
Know that there is a housing bubble

1035
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:24,767
Very very very

1036
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,559
Yeah

1037
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,887
Potential gigantic downside most people don't advise anyone to

1038
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,679
The f*** around with stuff like short selling

1039
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,471
As MarketWatch explains

1040
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,031
If you buy stocks

1041
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,311
Is a hundred percent of your money

1042
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,383
Conversely with short-selling the amount you lose is

1043
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,407
Literally live at

1044
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,687
You could lose

1045
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Any amount of money

1046
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:50,879
Alex is not talking about these Congress people when you talk about short-selling but because there is a story that's going to be coming up about it

1047
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,927
Explain what short-selling

1048
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
Before

1049
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
It's real f*****-up

1050
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,327
But also

1051
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
I don't know I read

1052
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,167
I don't know my entire feeling on

1053
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,263
I read some articles that say it's good idea read some articles it said

1054
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,079
Stupid there's no need to ban it

1055
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,527
Here's where Alex gets more into this

1056
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,599
He's talking about this short selling conspiracy that he

1057
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,415
But what they don't tell you when they're all up

1058
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,207
Turn on television

1059
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
Is it they're shorting it

1060
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,095
10 weeks ago

1061
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,519
Stop Trump

1062
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:45,919
Bill Maher and CNN MSNBC

1063
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:49,247
Economy to get Trump

1064
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:55,391
So I know that he says that he has all these clips and they can't play them cuz it'll take the rest of the hour but

1065
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:59,231
I never heard of compelling clip but he's played

1066
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,047
Indicates that anyone is saying that we would like the mark

1067
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,327
Get to go down to the drop

1068
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
The only f******

1069
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,935
Please talk about

1070
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:13,055
Absolutely

1071
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
So

1072
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,455
He was talking about someone being on TV and trying

1073
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,479
To cause the mark

1074
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,295
To go down because they have been short selling

1075
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,111
He's talking about until this

1076
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:31,231
But I'll tell you the good news when I saw this video yesterday up on Imports.

1077
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,767
Hi, Paul Joseph Watson article

1078
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,703
YouTube

1079
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,751
YouTube

1080
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,799
National Television

1081
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:52,991
Almost every, nor was this is the guy that bought up that drug company increased prices 5000% this is the guy that

1082
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:59,135
Constantly doing Insider stuff

1083
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:07,583
Is go after nationalistic conservative operations he's a Harvard alum

1084
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,167
Mafia

1085
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,983
So apparently starting with this guy Bill Act

1086
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,263
Who it just Donna

1087
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,311
Strange and possibly

1088
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:22,431
Segment on CNBC shutdown

1089
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,991
I think it's quote was something along the lines of

1090
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,807
Can't work with an 18-month shutdown

1091
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,367
But it can survive a 30-day

1092
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
Complete lock

1093
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,439
Whatever

1094
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
His position

1095
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,511
Blame prediction

1096
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,303
But he also said that he was buying stock

1097
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,119
Which led to

1098
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,703
As Business Insider put it there were accusations

1099
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:49,567
But he was trying to scare investors into selling so he could buy at a discount or profit from short

1100
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:55,711
Beyond those accusations I don't see any proof being provided that he actually did have those short positions

1101
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,991
It's just something people were saying

1102
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:03,135
Also Ackman is not involved with Soros in any meaningful

1103
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:08,767
Most of the Articles you can find about the two of them but are they have opposite positions on some kompa

1104
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
Overtime

1105
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
Also doesn't hate Trump

1106
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
Vanity Fair article from November

1107
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,935
2016

1108
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:19,007
X-Men looks at President Trump and likes what he sees

1109
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,567
A fortune article from the same time

1110
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,967
Any comments about how the economy should shut down for a month to save itself

1111
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:31,551
He was even complimentary toward Trump saying that he could have it if you could navigate

1112
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
Disgrace

1113
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,599
He could be re-elected in November

1114
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,647
Is not an anti Trump guy

1115
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
I don't know what Alex is doing

1116
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,071
You can pick any billionaires

1117
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,119
Right now

1118
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,143
Also he isn't

1119
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,983
The guy who bought the drug company increased prices of 5000 percent that was

1120
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
Shkreli who's currently

1121
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,663
A company called Valiant

1122
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,247
I'm having

1123
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,039
Control of 10% of the shares

1124
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
And that company

1125
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
Has had some dark

1126
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,623
Drug price

1127
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,463
2017 Acura

1128
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,743
The process lost

1129
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,279
4 billion dollars

1130
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,119
You don't want to apologize for the investment in the company but mostly for losing it

1131
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,143
His investors money

1132
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,423
Not for the price gouging

1133
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,447
Because he wasn't

1134
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,727
The person who made that decision

1135
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,263
Silver City

1136
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,991
So anyway

1137
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
I guess

1138
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
Savella now

1139
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,111
So Alex claims without providing any

1140
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,135
Evidence

1141
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,671
Any proof that

1142
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,207
Bill Ackman is

1143
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,511
You shorting key Industries

1144
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,791
In the United States

1145
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,351
You find out he's shorting

1146
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,887
Aldi's

1147
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:56,287
They will then go down to close to zero and then he will buy them

1148
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,359
Turn the lights back on just like Rothschild did

1149
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:05,247
When they beat the polygons hey

1150
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,063
Lord Wellington defeated Napoleon in

1151
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,671
Fast Corvette on a car

1152
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
Until the stock market

1153
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,095
Destroy the British Army's down

1154
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:24,191
Dunno Vanquish by Napoleon stock market went to 1%

1155
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:28,799
Lord Rothschild the richest man on earth and control the British Empire

1156
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,591
That's on record

1157
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,063
So this story about Nathan Rothschild is not true

1158
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,623
It's not in my history

1159
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,671
When using the key element of anti-Semitic

1160
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,207
Gandapur decade

1161
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
We covered this

1162
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:51,839
Extended detail in our endgame coverage but the basic element

1163
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
B Story game

1164
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
Popularity first

1165
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,423
In 1846

1166
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,495
I was told in a pamphlet signed by a person calling themselves

1167
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,263
Satan

1168
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,847
Who's actually written by a very public

1169
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,639
I thought is Boris Boris

1170
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:12,319
The story is directly contradicted by historical evidence

1171
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,599
DayZ settings

1172
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,391
Like the 1940 Nazi

1173
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,415
Propaganda film

1174
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,719
The Rothschilds shares at Waterloo

1175
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:23,583
This is pure and simple no two ways about it

1176
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,655
Any pizzas line is either someone pushing

1177
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,519
The sort of person who would uncritically accept narrative

1178
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
Did find a good

1179
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
Propaganda

1180
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,407
I have no idea if Ackman is short selling any

1181
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,455
Mysteries and Alex's provided

1182
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
Proof of it on the show

1183
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
I would suspect

1184
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,551
Probably not seeing as

1185
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,319
On April

1186
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:47,135
16th 2019 he announced that he and his hedge fund

1187
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,671
Pershing Square

1188
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,463
Forsworn short-selling

1189
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Baby was lying

1190
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,791
I don't know

1191
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,839
So Alex

1192
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,935
That they're kind of breakdown the economy that's what they said

1193
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,703
Barbell bar set

1194
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,519
The economy by Design and if you remember

1195
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,871
Democrats MSNBC CNN HBO host

1196
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:14,271
Bill Maher Bill Maher over and over and over again

1197
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:18,623
Today we're going to plunge the economy that was worth it to stop

1198
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,647
Donald Trump

1199
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,767
I thought that went longer

1200
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,583
That's

1201
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
Buy likes

1202
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,215
It is a it is

1203
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,007
It's always got

1204
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:40,383
Scream about a CNA

1205
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,175
I would like to be fair to all

1206
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:45,247
So I am going to play the Full Compilation of

1207
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,831
But he plays on his show of proving this claim

1208
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:52,671
Okay how much f****** Bill Maher is in this calculation

1209
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,951
Here's a short

1210
00:54:54,207 --> 00:55:00,095
Compilation

1211
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
Another

1212
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
A woman asked me to you

1213
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
Tonight

1214
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
Get rid of Donald

1215
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,575
I think that's most

1216
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:24,671
When you see what's happened with the media coverage

1217
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,487
13 days

1218
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:32,863
The bottom half

1219
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,935
And by the way I'm hoping for it

1220
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
I think one way to get rid of trump

1221
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,031
Crashing economy

1222
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:46,431
Winning economy that the president

1223
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:53,087
Nobody thought we would have a global financial crisis

1224
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:01,535
Cannes 2018

1225
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,351
20%

1226
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:09,215
The house that then that.

1227
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:16,383
3% GDP growth at this Administration been talking about that for years he's are all things that damage can run

1228
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:18,943
Isn't that

1229
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,223
Cutting rates

1230
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,247
Going to make the next

1231
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
Economic down

1232
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,063
What's your prediction

1233
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:29,951
Show me people hate me for it but it would get rid of me for it

1234
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:36,607
We would see the global economy recession in 3/4

1235
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:43,007
For that and I'm bring it on Sean if you're watching me I can't make it happen

1236
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:48,895
Wishing it if it happened it'll be because of your lord and savior Donald J Trump

1237
00:56:55,807 --> 00:57:00,671
Policy with kind of frisky

1238
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,487
So almost entire compilation is close to Belmar

1239
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,047
One of them is just a pundit saying that the

1240
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,399
Can run on economic issues at the stock market

1241
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,215
Which is a little shy of rooting for the market

1242
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,239
Circle App Store

1243
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,519
Kind of like

1244
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,567
Like political

1245
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,103
Factso

1246
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,639
But that also mean

1247
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,919
Means that if the economy does

1248
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
As well then Trump

1249
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:29,343
Can run on that I'm sure they would say that as well so that kind of a part of the

1250
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
Conversation

1251
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:33,695
Very important part of any statement

1252
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,487
The only clip in there other than

1253
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,047
Bill Maher that's questionable at all is the first

1254
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,655
That was took place in August 2019 on

1255
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
Fox News

1256
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:47,007
The person speaking to Stephen was an economic advisor to Trump

1257
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:51,871
A writer for the Heritage Foundation and author of a book called trumponomics

1258
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:56,479
Hardly a source I would consider unbiased

1259
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:02,879
Trump actually nominated

1260
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,975
That interview begins with a clip of Bill Maher

1261
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,279
The whole premise of the interview is at

1262
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,839
Stephen Morris recently run into a woman

1263
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,679
Same thing as Bill Maher that's great

1264
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:19,775
Just go back to right-wing assholes not being able to just admit that they're mad at Bill Barr

1265
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,079
We want to talk about their anger but they also wanted

1266
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:25,663
Dressing up as something more important than being mad at Bill Maher

1267
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,967
This was one of the series of interview

1268
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,367
About Democrats

1269
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,415
It was posted on the heritage

1270
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,439
Foundation's website

1271
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,255
Interesting Lee that article begins quote

1272
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,535
Last week I gave a talk

1273
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,583
Too high with investors in San Francisco

1274
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,887
Not exactly an audience of left-wing Act

1275
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
Tourist

1276
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,983
That's where he runs into this woman who wanted a recession to get rid of trump

1277
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
I don't know

1278
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:56,383
I'm not sure if I buy this apocryphal story from one of Trump's advisers about have

1279
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,711
Opposition wants to destroy the economy

1280
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,015
Seems like bulshit

1281
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
That's all this is

1282
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,087
Alice's mad at Bill Barr

1283
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,159
Position

1284
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,183
He's sober

1285
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,719
Pathetic

1286
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
These people

1287
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
Now

1288
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,095
Atlas have a little fun

1289
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,887
Alex goes out to

1290
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,679
Hey comes back from break

1291
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,703
Yo

1292
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:23,007
It's fun when he sings over country music

1293
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:26,847
It's fun when he goes over the facts and You Belong To The City

1294
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
This is so weird

1295
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,687
He tries to hit the talk

1296
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,759
Like that

1297
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:40,159
Jelly roll

1298
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:46,559
Bill Gates on that

1299
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:52,959
Exercise for my co-workers Coronavirus

1300
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,775
Protesting

1301
00:59:56,031 --> 01:00:02,175
9/11 laugh

1302
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,623
Right about now

1303
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:14,207
Brother God

1304
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:18,047
The funk soul brother

1305
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:25,215
That's so bad got to be just like I am

1306
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,775
F****** the coolest

1307
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:33,151
I can adapt to any musical genre

1308
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,175
Crushed

1309
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,735
Alex

1310
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,503
I like

1311
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,575
Scare you in the Coronavirus

1312
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,767
Reveals a shocking lack of

1313
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,791
Knowledge

1314
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,327
About basic information

1315
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,863
About the situation

1316
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,911
All of that craziness

1317
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:02,335
About 150 people of day if you average it out over a year in the United States alone

1318
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,407
Sex

1319
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,735
100

1320
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
Put that up

1321
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,367
You sort of known that

1322
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,671
So on the 19th

1323
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,231
Episode

1324
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,535
So the United States related to Coronavirus

1325
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:27,679
To be behaving the way he is on air it's deeply disgraceful for him to not be aware of basic information about

1326
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,447
About the topic

1327
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:34,079
For some context on March 7th there were 233 total deaths related to coronavirus in Italy

1328
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,895
By March 20th they're going over 4000

1329
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,431
That's a two-week

1330
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,479
Progression and that's what we don't want to

1331
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
What is the anti martial law guy

1332
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,831
Except for the money time

1333
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,879
Martial law

1334
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,671
PCS severe measures

1335
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,207
Being taken to stop a pandemic

1336
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:54,303
It's kind of on praying for him to be against those measures measures and minimize I think

1337
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:58,143
And that mentality is pervasive enough with impede our country's ability

1338
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,167
Need to deal with this outbreak

1339
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,215
Simply put if you listen to Alex

1340
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,263
Got a lot of food and silver in your home

1341
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,567
Situation like Italy

1342
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,359
In the near future most likely

1343
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,383
If you don't

1344
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:12,223
Yeah they're saying the UK showing that's a group

1345
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:13,759
Same two weeks

1346
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,551
Double after Double after dub

1347
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,135
The goal is

1348
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,927
Do know what they keep saying

1349
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,951
Flatten the Curve

1350
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,487
Yeah make things

1351
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,535
Manageable in a way that it doesn't

1352
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
Become

1353
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
Complete disaster

1354
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,143
Alex is not in favor

1355
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
Of that

1356
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,727
The bell curve

1357
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:37,567
Play answers not the Belton

1358
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,615
The answer is never the Bella

1359
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,295
When is facing out over

1360
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:53,695
You know once you live without have your papers who outside your house and drones

1361
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,999
You're never going back

1362
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,863
Never going back

1363
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,399
Never coming back

1364
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,007
World government

1365
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:12,383
Needs a bio weapon or a new plague

1366
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:21,343
Get the public to accept surveillance and control station

1367
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:27,487
Having a discussion about that but I know that's

1368
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:32,095
So I think is a good time to plant a real problem with what I'm feeling right now which is

1369
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,375
Pretty well suggest

1370
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
Stood by that clip

1371
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:38,239
I want to sing I want to go into lockdown type situations you never go by

1372
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:43,615
This is an Essence the beginning of the Tyranny that he's long foretold if you believe what he say

1373
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,895
And that's a problem

1374
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:47,967
Because if I know anything at all it said Alex recommend

1375
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,759
Fighting against that tyranny

1376
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,807
So what form would that take

1377
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,111
What it involves people not

1378
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:58,463
Self-isolating and its expression of this mentality

1379
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:04,095
Could get a lot of people hurt but what's for more scary is if you believe without you saying

1380
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,887
It's time to kill people

1381
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,447
What possible scenario is there that

1382
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,471
Time to act

1383
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:13,055
If you believe that this is a globalist plot to bring it martial law

1384
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,103
They will never go away and kill freedom

1385
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:18,175
This is a gigantic problem for Alex's rhetoric

1386
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,223
His rhetoric relies on escalation

1387
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,247
And what's wrong

1388
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,807
Place of almost impossibly high tension

1389
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,599
He can really only get people

1390
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,903
As the virus situation gets worse

1391
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,951
Need to scale is rhetoric to match

1392
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,535
If things go as badly as they bite things could get really dark

1393
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,607
Established a narrative blame for this

1394
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,655
Can't really take that back now

1395
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,775
Alex is already said many times that if anyone in his family get the virus is going to kill some globalist

1396
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,799
Maybe Obama

1397
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:48,383
If that isn't giving tacit permission to your audience to do the same

1398
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,663
I don't know what is

1399
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,199
It's really f***** up

1400
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,223
He's trapped

1401
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,295
Yeah they extremists bubble right now

1402
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,831
That I don't know I don't know how you

1403
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,647
You keep deescalate this while the crisis is still going

1404
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:04,511
He's already shot his wad yeah I know it it does seem like you

1405
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,303
You really should have called for armed

1406
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,095
Insurrection like later on

1407
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,887
You know like he's he's our

1408
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,679
He's already

1409
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,471
Took us to taking us to that place

1410
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,007
I don't know if he has

1411
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
Explicit

1412
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,567
Implicitly

1413
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,919
Play 887 bbnc agency

1414
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,967
It's a very simple equation of the things

1415
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:28,319
He's literally given a

1416
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,367
Okay if these two things start

1417
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,135
To happen

1418
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
Then we have

1419
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,671
To start

1420
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,695
The hot War

1421
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,999
And those things have started to

1422
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,047
So

1423
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,071
What's it going to say

1424
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:45,471
Whoops my bad I had my pills

1425
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,751
This one out

1426
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,543
You're going to say

1427
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,639
You need some DNA 42 sales

1428
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,663
How they doing

1429
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:58,271
Well you know we got that letter from the New York attorney general telling him that

1430
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,575
He did read it correctly

1431
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,623
G1 battle

1432
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:08,511
Headlines last week about Alex Jones

1433
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,095
Prevention

1434
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,399
Laboratories

1435
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,703
Stanford Hospital

1436
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,799
Somebody found out

1437
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:25,407
Regulators that Walmart sells this under another name

1438
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,759
Maybe I'll has they certified

1439
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,063
It all went away.

1440
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,391
Other articles

1441
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,671
Y'all just stop

1442
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,695
Sunday dinner

1443
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:41,279
Pointed out that Walmart sell silver products

1444
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,327
Just like that everything went away

1445
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
Is b*******

1446
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,911
There weren't any other stories after March 14th

1447
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,191
Because there wasn't a story

1448
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:52,543
Story was at the New York attorney general's office

1449
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,079
The whole story

1450
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:54,847
Follow up

1451
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
Letter

1452
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,175
Still sent a couple of days ago

1453
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,991
I mean that's that's okay

1454
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,831
More stories unless the New York attorney general

1455
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Further action

1456
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,391
That happened so quickly

1457
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,927
It's perfect for Alex

1458
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,951
So he gets to pretend that

1459
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,487
The fact that there's no more story

1460
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,511
Vindicate

1461
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,303
Reality doesn't really mean

1462
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,119
And I notice on this show is being

1463
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:17,887
Farm

1464
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:24,543
Yeah I don't know I think someone might sad about cuz he's certainly not saying the same things

1465
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:28,127
For the most part about his silver

1466
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,455
He's constantly saying like this

1467
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,271
All right out you got your a b****

1468
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,831
Someone somebody lawyer check

1469
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,183
So it's there's a story going around

1470
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:45,023
And apparently it's the mega banks that are doing it

1471
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,327
I'm not entirely sure how that works

1472
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
Here's Alex

1473
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:51,935
Powerful Fortune 500

1474
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,727
Exerting their will

1475
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,567
Start a Stampede in nonessential areas they were running

1476
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:07,551
Cancel some big public events and Annie will have have government declare martial law

1477
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,367
China

1478
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:16,255
Set the precedent and the fear to have that done here in front

1479
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,791
Monkey see monkey do

1480
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:18,815
Sure

1481
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:25,983
Creating is unrest in the end

1482
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,055
Place a drink Emily put a moron everyday

1483
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:40,319
Following a balancing act that we really advise him to cover

1484
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,391
Exact same pragmatic

1485
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
System

1486
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
Because

1487
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,535
Regardless if they're going to hide every event like it's the end of the world

1488
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,351
If I understand that clip I was just saying that the mega Bank

1489
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:55,679
Asteria which involved

1490
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,239
I'm going over to force Trump to do the same

1491
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:04,127
So Trump is fighting against the plan by pretending

1492
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:07,967
Because he's a political coward and it doesn't want people to play

1493
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:11,039
And Alex thinks it's good leadership

1494
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,343
This really feels like

1495
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,391
Wheel spinning

1496
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,927
Really decided

1497
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,463
I was listening to that

1498
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,999
I can't even really

1499
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:23,839
Muster the energy to care

1500
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,375
Such a week

1501
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,655
Defender 90

1502
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,447
I'm just amazed that even in his

1503
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,215
Defenses

1504
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,239
Trump is a

1505
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:35,615
Like Trump is a giant baby and that's why Alex likes

1506
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,919
He's smart enough to take

1507
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:44,319
No blame for the things that he is responsible for is not an endorsement of a candidate

1508
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:47,391
Pixel remember him like Patton

1509
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,183
When he needed courage

1510
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,951
He summoned

1511
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:53,279
The will to live

1512
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,607
So RoboCop's coming

1513
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
Oh okay

1514
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,167
DJ corporate strike

1515
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,471
Gangsta people

1516
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,007
Rising there

1517
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
Our

1518
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,311
Over you

1519
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,151
The shutdown the economy to shutdown the infrastructure

1520
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,943
And to drive you into total

1521
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,503
Hysterical fear and submission

1522
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:19,391
And if you pass the test and submit properly then you are never going to get out of the handcuffs

1523
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:27,583
This is the new world order this is the technocracy this is robot drones everywhere

1524
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:32,447
Now becoming autonomous with wannabe police controlling them Italy the ruling technocrat

1525
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:38,591
Weather robot armies surveilling and controlling I remember the non-lethal weapons

1526
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:44,991
Honestly that sounds like a libertarian

1527
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,319
Tattoos on the scan microchip total tracking

1528
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,879
Domination

1529
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,927
Absolute Total Control

1530
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,207
Because after all

1531
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,511
Anydesk

1532
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,583
Get rid of the swimming pool that are more than

1533
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,863
We have to get rid of

1534
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,143
Diving boards

1535
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:06,239
We have to get rid of dodgeball and Chase at the school someone might hit their knees

1536
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:15,967
Albany

1537
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:21,343
The robots will bring us the food and the robots will enforce it like thx-1138

1538
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,879
Plan

1539
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,183
So that George Lucas movie

1540
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,975
Real globalist

1541
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,767
So

1542
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,559
Alex's Basinger's just on movies

1543
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,119
It does seem like he's basing it just on movie

1544
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,935
Turns out also British Royals

1545
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:39,007
Maybe even other European

1546
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,799
Country

1547
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,335
Princess

1548
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:48,735
I've run the miles Elizabeth husband

1549
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:55,135
Farmer

1550
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:07,935
The planet with a bio-weapon

1551
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,751
They're in a good place to do it

1552
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,823
Albert of Monaco

1553
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,383
Thank you

1554
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:22,015
Probably of Monaco

1555
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,551
Grace Kelly son

1556
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:29,951
A few weeks ago when they said Tom Hanks had it on that weekend I went live on Sunday and I said I didn't either made up

1557
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,279
Orange pr200 from Smyrna

1558
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,583
Yes you did say that

1559
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,655
Job

1560
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:50,175
Okay

1561
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:53,503
Is discharged from the hospital and went to self isolation back on the 7th

1562
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:59,903
It's funded Alex's digging his heels in on this one doesn't like you test positive or Faking It

1563
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,951
Is it is Aegis Elba Faking It

1564
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:08,351
I only got some comments about KY want to know also what good is having the Prince of Monaco fake a Coronavirus

1565
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:12,447
Percent of Alex's audience can't find Monaco on a map

1566
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,263
It probably didn't even know it existed 5 minutes ago

1567
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:18,335
Seems like it would be a weird play on the globalist

1568
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,639
Spark

1569
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:27,551
This one Bob sure

1570
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:32,159
So Queen Elizabeth's husband is Prince Philip

1571
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:37,023
Philip Was Eighteen and nineteen thirty-nine When The War Began so I have no idea how he could have

1572
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:37,791
Open an SS officer

1573
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,607
The prior to World War II

1574
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,655
Make some he was the first SSI

1575
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:46,239
Prince Bernhard on the other hand may have been a member of

1576
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,007
The group in college

1577
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:51,103
That was claimed in a book but I have a hard time finding concrete confirmation of it

1578
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
Best possible

1579
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,663
I don't need a reason to hate Royal

1580
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:57,759
Prince Philip didn't run his mouth. Wanted to populate the world with iOS

1581
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,551
I was just lying about it

1582
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,879
The forward to 1987 book called if I were an animal

1583
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:09,279
This was a book where a hundred or so celebrities answer the question of what animals they would like to be

1584
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,839
Prince Philip said

1585
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,375
I just wonder what it would like

1586
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:16,703
Species

1587
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:19,519
The numbers that it was at the danger of extinction

1588
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,055
What would be its feeling

1589
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,079
Destroyed the human species

1590
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,103
Population

1591
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,383
Explode explode

1592
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
Denied it

1593
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:25,919
Somewhere to exist

1594
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:29,503
I must confess that I'm tempted to ask for reincarnation is a

1595
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,039
Particularly deadly virus

1596
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,367
That's a little different

1597
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,439
Depopulate the world

1598
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,975
Not a big fan of details

1599
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,023
I would also like a horse

1600
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,559
Thank you very much

1601
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,119
And I want ice cream

1602
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:50,495
I don't know what quotes Oz talking about with Prince Bernhard but I'm just guessing it's a reference to him funding

1603
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,031
The creation of the World Wildlife

1604
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:56,383
Also I don't think Bernhard and Philip are cousins and Bernard's been dead for

1605
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:57,919
So

1606
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
Slutever

1607
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,039
The world

1608
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:09,695
Martial law most people even Alex fans like listen to this

1609
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,463
Just go

1610
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:14,047
Man shut up will it will get back to you in better time

1611
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,071
This is dumb

1612
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,607
No because they don't think

1613
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,703
It's very nice

1614
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,983
And if you listen like

1615
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,263
Why

1616
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,799
Why doesn't anyone

1617
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:25,823
Inconsiderate

1618
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,639
Everything he talks about is a movie

1619
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:34,015
Yeah the globalist plan is actually thx-1138 have this next clip

1620
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,551
Two movies

French face fines and they leave home I'm in coronavirus lockdown as you're prepared to close

1623
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:53,215

Add to pay for this week or bodies

1627

Scarface you want to spy on every corner

1631
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:24,191
Alex can't deal with reality that through fiction

1632
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,239
This fictional worldview in imaginary

1633
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,007
I was expect

1634
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:27,775
Clockwork Orange

1635
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:32,383
Instapop in I was I was thinking we would get some drugs going on but

Got got out of left field there

1638
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,807
Got out of left field

01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,879
Yeah these all these movies that are real

Andy talked a little bit here by THX

1641
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,975
113 being reality

1642
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:51,327
Eddie veers into how basically science is demon

1643
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,375
He's telling people things

1644
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,191
Around

1645
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:00,031
Coronavirus can't get you

1646
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,591
1138 George

1647
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,663
Mukesh made his first come about

1648
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,455
Robert Duvall

1649
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,039
Amazing actors

1650
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,343
World

1651
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:17,695
Talk about the time what they wanted to build

1652
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,327
Text Humanity underground to protect them from a bio

1653
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,631
And generations later

1654
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:28,703
Your world over by robots in a technotronic Ali

1655
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:35,103
Andaman technotronic plan it's always been at the pointer

1656
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,407
Since 1856

1657
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,503
Dalton

1658
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:42,783
Course

1659
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:46,111
I had a hallucination going golfing free books

1660
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:53,535
Are the secret government readings

1661
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:57,375
Batesville police

1662
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,167
Family

1663
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:02,495
The Blair's revolver little bit that's George Orwell later

1664
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,223
Started having hallucinations

1665
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,271
And they were told by

1666
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,623
How to build all this wow

1667
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:26,047
Scientific

1668
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:30,655
100 years later

1669
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
100

1670
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,983
Five years later 106 years later

1671
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
Officially

1672
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:39,103
Tronic scientifically

1673
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,759
I do see

1674
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,783
Perfect

1675
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:52,415
Did see you again Spire daily indeed yes I am

1676
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:57,023
That I did not know that was Mainline history did they shall train line history when I was going to bust

1677
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,327
Mandela effects

1678
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:04,703
Darwin's

1679
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:09,311
They bred humans and aliens and

1680
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,335
Stuff we covered in the end

1681
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,639
Some of those claims

1682
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,663
You can go back in

1683
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,711
Hear that stuff you want to there but

1684
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:18,015
This is the sort of stuff that I'm just not even going

1685
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,551
Really engage with all too much

1686
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,855
Enjoy

1687
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:26,463
If you think that all science came about because

1688
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,231
Demons

1689
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:30,815
Contacted hallucinating writers

1690
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,839
19th century

1691
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,399
And that all makes perfect sense

1692
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,447
You and I are just going to be

1693
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,799
Charles Darwin do share a grandfather

1694
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:43,871
Eugenicist

1695
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,711
So I mean there's some kernels of reality behind so you saying

1696
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,991
You know it 2015

1697
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:52,063
Ben Carson told a crowd at a creationist conference

1698
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,623
The Darwin's ideas

1699
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,183
You know

1700
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:01,535
Give me the real Isis I guess is all like laughable and stuff but this is pretty standard like

1701
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,839
Extreme Christian

1702
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:09,727
That's all

1703
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
So

1704
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,055
Alex talks a little bit more about the

1705
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,848
These demons that are inspiring scientist

1706
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:19,200
Listen to emails when you're 67 years old

1707
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:26,368
Project

1708
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
Okay

1709
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,632
Yo

1710
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,192
You want to tell me

1711
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,728
Alex Jones Is Right

1712
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,264
About things

1713
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,544
You now must

1714
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,104
Explain to me that he is right about aliens working

1715
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,128
With the globalist

1716
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:48,896
2 Cal

1717
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,200
Okay

1718
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:57,856
Alright here we go here we go New York Times just recently published that story saying that the

1719
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:01,440
Maybe in the Pentagon all know about aliens going on right

1720
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,744
So that's proof that aliens are real

1721
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,512
Step one

1722
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:05,536
Aliens are real

1723
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:11,424
Step2 aliens are communicating with the globalist the globalists are also

1724
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
Woohoo I have

1725
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,264
To prove they are real before we can even go anywhere

1726
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,944
So I made

1727
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,712
Stock today

1728
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,760
Obviously they take

1729
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:30,624
Yeah

1730
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,904
Alex

1731
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
Clairol buddy

1732
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:35,744
He says the Rogan's

1733
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:38,816
Ducted into something

1734
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,352
Any ytmp

1735
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,120
Don't

1736
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,400
Take it I want you to

1737
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,680
I'll take the DMT

1738
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,960
Believe me

1739
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:51,104
Because if you're not deceive elavegan rough-hewn they're going to try to absolutely

1740
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:57,248
When the guy goes in the other dimension for a second and then they get him for a minute and comes back crazy

1741
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:03,136
They'll just put that Hollywood movies

1742
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:03,904
Yes I do

1743
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,208
That's how imaginations work

1744
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:14,144
What's on Netflix

1745
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,216
Actually I do that that's great movie dimension

1746
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,520
It's like a hundred years at Orchard Road

1747
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,848
That's what it's like

1748
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,384
It is

1749
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,408
You're going somewhere

1750
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:33,088
Berry plays a long clip of Buckaroo Banzai

1751
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:40,768
What's the name of the what's the name of

1752
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:44,352
He was the Starbucks Robocop and in Buckaroo Banzai

1753
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:46,912
Yeah Peter Weller

1754
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:49,984
Yeah I think I'm going to have to watch Peter Weller movies

1755
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,520
Also

1756
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,544
Remember

1757
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,848
That's a backup Matt ask-me-anything

1758
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,176
Episode that me and Robert Evans recorded

1759
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:03,296
Alex got one of his question was are you a fan of Buckaroo Banzai

1760
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:09,952
No bulshit and I wanted to play that clip but he's so f***** up and it's really depressing to listen to

1761
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,256
Yeah but

1762
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,816
Motherfuker

1763
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,352
Disgrace

1764
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,376
Huge Peter Weller

1765
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,080
This is martial law

1766
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:30,176
There will be over

1767
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:38,112
And then you're going to get it big fat depression but don't worry

1768
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,904
You going to learn how to make the government

1769
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,720
All big box stores stay open you can

1770
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,352
In drones flying around already tell you what to do

1771
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,192
We tried to stop it

1772
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,752
He has no real suggestions for what

1773
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:58,848
Should be done to the measures that

1774
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616
Goodbye States

1775
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,408
Even if like

1776
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,688
You know California it's

1777
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,736
It's an extreme measure

1778
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,112
No it's a governor

1779
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,648
Martial law

1780
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,952
There's no way

1781
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,720
No

1782
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:19,072
He gets wants to promote and game

1783
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,656
I'm heavy quotes documentary

1784
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:26,752
What is the end game.com what is the end game.com

1785
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,296
Dot-com

1786
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,648
Amazon ban the sale of it

1787
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:52,096
Amazon banned the sale a few months ago they said it was a racist movie

1788
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,984
Amazon just took a game off

1789
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:04,384
Prime presumably because no one was there to begin with

1790
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,408
Watch out

1791
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:11,296
I just went over to amazon.com you can buy yourself a nice DVD copy of endgame for six bucks

1792
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,576
So it's clearly not

1793
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,880
Everybody

1794
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,160
He's taking it down

1795
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:22,048
And ourselves

1796
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:27,680
Everywhere they don't want you to any of you seen endgame

1797
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:35,872
You search for endgame Alex Jones on YouTube you'll find multiple channels that have the film poster

1798
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,920
What was it 10 years ago

1799
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:38,944
Another 6 years ago

1800
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:43,808
There isn't a big rash people taking endgame.

1801
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:48,928
Bulshit

1802
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,256
Rhodes

1803
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:56,096
Roads are coming to kill us all roads I did

1804
01:25:56,352 --> 01:26:00,448
Z1 Amazon comment that was like

1805
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,264
How do people like

1806
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,824
Having that happened by the possible problems like

1807
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,128
That's weird

1808
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:14,272
Call are going to call Amazon if you like what the f*** is this

1809
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:17,344
That would be hilarious

1810
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:20,160
Have been red pilled man wasn't

1811
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,744
He's going to show up I heard you died

1812
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:29,376
I think that Hulk is going to show up

1813
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,448
Kind of looks like Hulk

1814
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,752
Got a thick neck

1815
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,568
Great

1816
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,640
Business

1817
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:44,992
Next caller says something is probably

1818
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:45,760
To the goals

1819
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,784
Of Public Health

1820
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,600
And Alex does not push back on him at all

1821
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,880
Another point

1822
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,416
Cole Sprouse

1823
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,976
Corona has really blast

1824
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,912
Might actually have

1825
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,776
I'm sort of Iris in there or

1826
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,080
Thanks buddy

1827
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:14,432
You should really share that information with people

1828
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,200
Piano

1829
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:17,504
A lot of people are getting hit harder than

1830
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,064
And

1831
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,856
Because they are

1832
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,392
That could be nanotech

1833
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,440
Batman

1834
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,488
Everything is lining up right now

1835
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:36,960
Those are just a few theories

1836
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,544
Can't let people say s*** like that with

1837
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,336
No evidence no back

1838
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,384
You know what I think

1839
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,432
Take the test actually is giving people the virus

1840
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,224
Sat is great

1841
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,528
You know because what this is going

1842
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:54,368
Me too because he

1843
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,392
He just moves on to the

1844
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,672
Stop

1845
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,208
So that's an irresponsible thing

1846
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:03,840
Listen to this one Turtle as a message of I better not go get tested yet

1847
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,376
Some sort of

1848
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,400
Symptom

1849
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,680
Like this is f******

1850
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,448
Crazy

1851
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,240
The test will kill you

1852
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,264
Test itself

1853
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,360
Will give you the virus is maybe the most damaging

1854
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,640
Anything that anybody could

1855
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,688
Possibly say it's super irresponsible

1856
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:20,992
That is

1857
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:24,064
Then it's just like everybody's trying to kill you dude

1858
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,832
Stay inside

1859
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:27,904
Course

1860
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:34,304
You can see it right there it's a total economic takeover us corporations are really globalist allied with China

1861
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,376
Using this

1862
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:40,448
Show The Thousands to die every year a week or so

1863
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:52,992
The lovings to get into a pity party the wanting to be a victim of wanting to get a welfare check that wanting to win the

1864
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:56,320
Lottery not all Americans but it's the overall weakness

1865
01:28:57,088 --> 01:29:03,232
This situation is talking about weak America

1866
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:05,536
Ken's wanting a pity party and playing the victim

1867
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,840
He got a DUI a couple weeks back

1868
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,608
I can claim that it

1869
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:12,704
Mockingbird CIA that there articles about it go f*** you

1870
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,240
Yourself

1871
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,800
Goddamn

1872
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:20,128
Embarrassing embarrassing levels of

1873
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,432
Of lack of awareness

1874
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,992
The cast comes up now it's

1875
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,272
Tim Reames

1876
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:30,624
This guy I guess he's ex-military was formerly employed by Blackwater

1877
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:37,280
Probably as good a time as any to remember that Alex in 2009

1878
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:39,072
They were this is what

1879
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,864
Turn around

1880
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,704
His career do you hate to Employment Security in heaven

1881
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,984
Informer

1882
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:52,128
Kimberly was also a contestant on a reality show called American Tarzan

1883
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,944
Anyway this guy use along with Rob do

1884
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,992
They recently went down to the border to see if it

1885
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:57,760
It's really close

1886
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,808
I have no interest in that segment assault

1887
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,088
Just pure xenophobia

1888
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,904
Alex tries to prove

1889
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,952
To Tim the this virus is man-made

1890
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,232
Not the timid disagree

1891
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:10,048
But you just uses in his Elixir to sounding board

1892
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,072
J'approve

1893
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:13,632
So here's a just uses two pieces of information

1894
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:15,168
Really nail down

1895
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:21,312
Indian scientist discovered coronavirus engineer with hiv-like insurgent

1896
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,664
True genes and proteins signatures

1897
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,992
They know it was

1898
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,880
It's like ridiculous if you could ask

1899
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:37,952
Self retracted Indians

1900
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,792
Where's the next

1901
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:45,632
Lab-made rotavirus triggers debate this is a scientific journal

1902
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:52,544
5 years ago was Obama giving a weaponized virus beside cam

1903
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,104
That they cut into it

1904
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,432
If you was forced to actually read that article

1905
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:02,016
Do I have to admit that has nothing to do

1906
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,576
The debate has nothing to do with Obama selling

1907
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,368
Virus de China

1908
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:09,184
Those are the pieces of information that he's able to

1909
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,976
He's trying to demonstrate that

1910
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:15,072
The viruses man-made which tells me he has no evidence of that at all

1911
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,096
He's full of s***

1912
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,376
Yeah this is really

1913
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,656
Disheartening

1914
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:19,680
30 tickets

1915
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,960
More disheartening

1916
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:21,984
In this last clip

1917
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:22,752
From March 9th

1918
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,032
That is Alex

1919
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,824

Exact words with za

1923
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:41,696
Big Bowl

1924
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,232
Alright

1925
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:49,632
Ted Nugent's wife is finally going to break

1926
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,656
The world is with

1927
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,936
Clavering today

1928
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,216
Ted Nugent's wife

1929
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:57,824
Thinks about all this every morning I walk outside and into the sky ice cream

1930
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:58,848
Lorde

1931
01:31:59,104 --> 01:31:59,616

Ted Nugent

1934
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,688
White Fang

1935
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,480
And we will learn

1936
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:11,392
Once we get to the 20th and potential consequences

1937
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,416
Of this fire

1938
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:18,048
Puppies stuck in his office

1939
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:23,680
He knows that they are hyping this up bigger than it is people

1940
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,288
So

1941
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,640
Terrible

1942
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,688
You f***** up

1943
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,480
Especially considering

1944
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,760
Remember

1945
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,296
The last time they a

1946
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,576
Set up a story like that

1947
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,136
Alex

1948
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:45,440
I just keep thinking about the migrants

1949
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:47,488
Caravan over and over and over again

1950
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,400
Saying how dare that they would never

1951
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,168
This kind of

1952
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,448
It's like you guys win

1953
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,264
What's people who did mean

1954
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,592
Jade helm

1955
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:08,992
Danger talking about other people engineering

1956
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:11,552
Answer to the fact that he seems think of tens of thousands of deaths

1957
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,576
Seems like nobody

1958
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:25,120
That is a good point

1959
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:25,888
Work from home

1960
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:26,656
Sure

1961
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,960
This is a globalist

1962
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:32,544
This is teaching you to work from home teaching everybody try

1963
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,336
My cell phone to go outside

1964
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:39,200
We talked about China a month ago trying to hold their cell phones where they can leave their houses

1965
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:41,504
Megan Donnelly

1966
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,064
Well now

1967
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,880
He broke on

1968
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,184
Monday

1969
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:56,096
Drudgereport.com pick it up that MIT and villamonte agates have a plan to make you wear a bracelet that changes colors

1970
01:33:56,352 --> 01:34:00,704
And a digital tattoo skin the shows you been oculate it

1971
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,752
Cell phone

1972
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:05,312
So there's really no resource

1973
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,080
On this bill

1974
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:09,152
Gate stuff other than Antarctica

1975
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,176
Anonymous quotes

1976
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,224
Cybersecurity

1977
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:12,992
Contractor

1978
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,528
Suffice it to say that

1979
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,808
Literally

1980
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,576
And I rejected

1981
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,880
Security

1982
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:22,464
That means he knows what Bill and Melinda Gates

1983
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,256
Okay well there's a lieutenant colonel

1984
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:29,120
Stuff about the invisible ink tattoo for vaccination records isn't related to

1985
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,144
To the Coronavirus

1986
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:36,544
That was a research project that was taking place at MIT previous to all this

1987
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:38,848
Conclusions

1988
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,616
Jumping to

1989
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:42,432
This isn't something that's even ready for you

1990
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:46,016
An article in futurism from December 2019 describes it as cool

1991
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,040
Proof-of-concept

1992
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:50,112
Human cadaver skin models

1993
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,928
The patterns outlasted five years of simulated

1994
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,952
Sun exposure

1995
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:59,072
I would assume that it's a goal is maintaining some kind of vaccination record that that's not nearly good enough

1996
01:34:59,328 --> 01:34:59,840
To achieve that at

1997
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:04,704
It just may be a ways off from being viable and it's not approved for you

1998
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,008
Also it's not Bill Gates

1999
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,032
Still wants to use cell phones

2000
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:08,800
The track people

2001
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,848

The public that sounds like something that you would want to keep from the

2008
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,584
The public you know that

2009
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,936
Mass scale surveillance program that you definitely haven't already run

2010
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,264
That's something trumpet

2011
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:45,152
Play all these games he wants we're Trump's employees and administration officials to do things

2012

Secret deep state music

2027
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,064
The medical term

2028
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,136
The article is about an

2029
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,696
An app that people can download on their smartphone which is

2030
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,720
Connected to a bracelet

2031
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:37,632
This is pretty extreme stuff but from the article that only references those bracelets being used it in the case of people who are subject

2032
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:38,912
Compulsory quarantine

2033
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,960
Because they had returned from overseas

2034
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:43,008
That's not to say it

2035
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,824
But it's not quite as horrendous Alex

2036
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,360
They're not kicking down doors

2037
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,384
Slamming bracelets

2038
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
Read this article

2039
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:52,480
That's not something that we can prove using this

2040
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,064
Make sure people are

2041
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,112
Breaching the quarantine the bear

2042
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:00,928
It's a it's a

2043
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:01,696
LoJack

2044
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:02,976
It again

2045
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,792
Turtle tattoos that's not in this article

2046
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,328
They just love the market

2047
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,424
So Alex gets

2048
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,960
Really into Gavin Newsom

2049
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,496
California governor

2050
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,520
In this side

2051
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:16,800
This episode on the 20th

2052
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,336
AMC

2053
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,104
He's talking

2054
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,128
About how

2055
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:26,016
Press conference where he said that there's martial arts in place right

2056
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:29,600
He's trying to be smooth about it so you go along with it and then

2057
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,368
Your dad

2058
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,512
Gross kidnapping

2059
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,384
Martial law

2060
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,480
Socializing

2061
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,016
You too hasty

2062
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,040
So evil

2063
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:01,344
Very soon

2064
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,648
Because it is martial law

2065
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:11,072
You're a kidnapper let's use the microcosm example in a sixteen-year-old girl

2066
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,608
Like your Ted Bundy

2067
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:19,008
Volkswagen

2068
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:31,552
It's not the music I want for this

2069
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:37,952
A lot of this patient feels that Dorothy goes I'm going to Portugal in 3 days

2070
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:42,560
I'll get ready to get the hell out of you

2071
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:46,400
So the first point and that should be probably obvious Alex

2072
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,680
Governor Newsom setting

2073
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,448
Press conference

2074
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,288
He was saying the Barcelona is not necessary at this point

2075
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,592
Actor people are stepping up

2076
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,384
We'll play the clip that Alex plays

2077
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,920
Text Colette

2078
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,712
So that's all bulshit

2079
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:00,992
But

2080
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,272
I wanted to talk about Alex

2081
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,296
Is kidnapping metaphor

2082
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,600
He loves telling that little story

2083
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,160
Like a legitimately does that bit all the time

2084
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,696
Duxbury kidnapper threatening

2085
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,464
Kill you

2086
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,488
You put on handcuffs

2087
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,768
If you put on handcuffs

2088
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,560
8 Define metaphor in all

2089
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,864
But I have a different one that might be more appropriate

2090
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:17,888
Alex

2091
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,472
I would suggest that this is more like taking your dog to the vet

2092
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,544
Your dog is a stupid a******* that doesn't understand better soon

2093
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:30,944
But it still suffers for medical issues and you know what that dogs medical issues are going to affect other people other than

2094
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,968
And other dogs

2095
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:37,600
You know whatever because you ignore dogs health and then problem

2096
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,160
Expensive surgery

2097
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,440
Or because the dog has it

2098
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:43,488
A condition that can transmit to another dog

2099
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,792
Dog has to be taken care of

2100
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,840
And it's too f****** stupid to do it on its own

2101
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,632
In case you don't get it so mean

2102
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,912
Alex

2103
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:52,704
You'll fight

2104
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,496
Barking

2105
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,776
Maybe even try to bite

2106
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,056
But it's for his own good

2107
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:01,408
And everyone else is on my dogs

2108
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,688
Are not stupid

2109
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:03,968
How dare you

2110
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:11,392
Call me and say we got to go to the vet I seen your dog s*** on the wood floor

2111
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:16,512
That is true forced into a FEMA camp Arizona

2112
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:21,888
When the state isn't acting certain measures that are necessary to stop the spread

2113
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:24,192
He's the dog in the backseat on the way to work

2114
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:27,264
You just need to ignore his stupid meaning was barking

2115
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,056
Then that's all the

2116
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,616
Better metaphors

2117
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:36,736
That's a pretty good

2118
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,112
So here is that clip of

2119
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:48,768
The owners of Illinois in Ohio

2120
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:53,632
Exercise because we get caught up in

2121
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:54,400
Because

2122
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,448
Date we haven't needed to do that

2123
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:58,496
We said our guidance those guidance

2124
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,800
I just been mad and every circumstance

2125
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,872
In the past if you want to establish

2126
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:05,152
Martial law

2127
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,200
Is Ultimate of

2128
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,480
Portsmouth

2129
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:11,040
Have the capacity to do that

2130
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,064
We are not at this moment

2131
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,648
Billy Madison cesta and assess Adidas

2132
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,696
That people do not socialize

2133
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,464
And support

2134
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,000
It's very directed guidance

2135
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,536
I would be surprised

2136
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,328
And we have all the confidence it will be

2137
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:26,912
That's not insane

2138
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:31,008
At this point people are going along with the recommendations there is no need for us

2139
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,800
Force things gas

2140
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:33,568
So

2141
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,872
That's pretty much the

2142
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,920
Complete opposite of what Alex is trying to

2143
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,480
That's it

2144
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:43,296
If you are the globalist

2145
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:49,184
Why wouldn't you take this opportunity to declare martial law win even the reporters like

2146
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,208
Do you think you should

2147
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,232
Declare martial law

2148
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:54,304
Suggesting that it is on the table other states

2149
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,072
Start taking

2150
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:57,120
Slightly more drastic and Emporium

2151
01:41:57,376 --> 01:42:03,008
It measures not declaring martial law

2152
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:09,408
Something is the exact

2153
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,456
So Alex

2154
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:14,016
March 20th episode

2155
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,552
I think I've used

2156
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,576
Discovered the Cure

2157
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,856
4

2158
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,880
Okay

2159
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:23,232
A

2160
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:25,536
Inexpensive malaria drug

2161
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:29,120
Is having incredible effects on people

2162
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,680
Debit card

2163
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,728
Forwarded to like roll

2164
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:36,288
I got a bunch of Articles and studies in

2165
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:38,848
Porch

2166
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,688
NCH Lora

2167
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,968
Quien

2168
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:47,808
Didn't even spell it right

2169
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:55,232
Maybe highly effective against coronavirus that was

2170
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:59,072
Days ago they're going to pay my waist again I will guess

2171
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,096
What

2172
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:03,168
When does according to the literature

2173
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,704
Bushes

2174
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,264
Do not

2175
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:08,544
2

2176
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,336
LaSalle's

2177
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:13,408
Can there

2178
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,528
The viruses replicate

2179
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:19,808
Michelle's is it

2180
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,576
Interesting

2181
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:25,440
Just like nano silver

2182
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:29,792
You insane persons security

2183
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:31,840
Shell

2184
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,632
Viruses can't get in

2185
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,424
Also fries

2186
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:38,752
Paige angry do York attorney general

2187
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:40,032
Stupid to live

2188
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:43,872
To eat can't control himself

2189
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:44,896
Nuts app

2190
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:50,272
Around over the weekend this episode

2191
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,320
On September

2192
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:58,720
On Saturday retweeted tweet that cited a French study claiming to show that hydroxychloroquine

2193
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,256
Is it

2194
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,792
Effective in treating

2195
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,072
Covid-19

2196
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:06,144
This led to some scientists driving in avoiding out that the

2197
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:06,912
The study itself is

2198
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:07,936
Very poorly

2199
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,704
Constructed

2200
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,776
Super very small to the point of being ink

2201
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:12,544
You can close it

2202
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:13,824
America works

2203
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:18,176
Jared Holt pointed out that the account that Trump retweeted was actually a guy

2204
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,968
Used to go by the name Mike toks

2205
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,552
Baked Alaska

2206
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:29,440
He was even covered in an article in the guardian about the Figures were putting together that alt right rally in Portland back

2207
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,464
In 2017

2208
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,256
Can't imagine why he would be in

2209
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,560
In Trump's orbit

2210
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:37,632
A number of doctors pointed out that advising people to take hydroxy

2211
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,472
Could actually result in heart

2212
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:45,824
Greg Connecticut worse why do we have this

2213
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:48,896
Oh my God world

2214
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:55,552
After Trump's tweet Bloomberg reported on how is Nigeria there were two cases of corquin poisoning

2215
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,600
After United States

2216
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:02,464
President Donald Trump Coronavirus

2217
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,232
God

2218
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:07,840
I was worried that Alex's talked about the drug predated trumps

2219
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:08,864
S*** about chloroquine

2220
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:10,912
On Thursday

2221
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:13,728
When he lied about it being FDA-approved 23 Coronavirus

2222
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:15,520
That's probably what Alex was gone

2223
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,056
Anyway

2224
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:19,616
It's all the way Reckless now

2225
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,664
Amarillo

2226
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:27,296
Describe the level of Despair I feel seeing this particular little chapter play out in

2227
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:29,600
On the larger radar

2228
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,928
The FDA approved in the medication for a panther

2229
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:36,000
Twitter the guy who hangs out with Nazis

2230
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:37,024
Turning an ink

2231
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,816
Some study that led to spike

2232
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,096
Medication

2233
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:42,656
At least two overdoses in Nigeria

2234
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,448
And it's not that big a story

2235
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,752
I just

2236
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,360
I just can't

2237
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,272
Imagine if Obama

2238
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,040
Did any

2239
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:05,952
Did we would be arrested Federal Building can you blowing up

2240
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,720
For murder

2241
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,512
Wow

2242
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:14,656
Order to sell his own s***

2243
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:20,288
Listen to that further appointment

2244
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:22,592
The alcohol

2245
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:27,968
They are using a nano silver

2246
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,576
Biotech Labs on the Wii U

2247
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:35,648
Not advertising it

2248
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:40,768
Something that is a treatment or defense it's it's sold as a tooth whitening toothpaste

2249
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:44,352
You're doing it again

2250
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:47,168
What are you doing

2251
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:47,936
Stop

2252
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:50,496
I'm saying I'm not silly

2253
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,568
Cures Coronavirus

2254
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,896
But it's just toothpaste that I'm selling for

2255
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,688
Purpose

2256
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,736
The ingredients

2257
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:09,440
Defensive about people calling about for that and so like you can't show

2258
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:17,120
The New York attorney general's office will take notice

2259
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:19,680
It's Not Over

2260
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,448
Silver

2261
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,496
Alex now has the cork

2262
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:23,776
Angle

2263
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:25,824
How can I make money off of

2264
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:28,896
Guess what has a whole bunch of zinc

2265
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,944
The real red pill

2266
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,040
Belviq stimulant in it

2267
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:38,880
So Alex only brought up a cork one thing because you read the word zinc

2268
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,440
Find about it

2269
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:48,096
To pretend that the real red pill that has zinc in it

2270
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,120
What foods have zinc

2271
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,912
Go eat some beef or baked beans

2272
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:53,472
No but the red pill will actually push

2273
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,752
The zinc inside

2274
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,312
Okay well it's eyrise

2275
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:01,664
This opinion taxes as an ionosphere

2276
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,200
Which allows extra zinc

2277
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:03,968
To enter the cell

2278
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:10,112
It doesn't have zinc itself so 4 oz promotion here to make sense you would really be needing to try to sell as audiences

2279
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,904
The real red pill and also say

2280
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:12,672
Chloroquine

2281
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:14,464
That's really irresponsible stuff

2282
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,000
And you can just see the levels

2283
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,536
Layers of profiteering

2284
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,352
That's that's

2285
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,168
It's as soon as something becomes relevant

2286
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,192
He tries to sell it

2287
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:28,032
If you go to the website there's a big banner that says

2288
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,056
Your daily routine

2289
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,848
Advertising the real red pill

2290
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:32,896
He knows no bottom to the scam

2291
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:35,712
You will make whatever money can buy jeopardizing his audience

2292
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,480
As well being

2293
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,016
Because he doesn't give a single s***

2294
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,040
Elizabeth

2295
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,576
This is just stop

2296
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:41,344

Right now I said I wouldn't ever send off in the new year I haven't done it yet

01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,072
I'm doing it now 50% off on Railroad bill

2307
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:23,840
You can find

2308
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:24,864
NSYNC on Amazon

2309
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:25,888
Pretty

2310
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:31,008
Disgusting is that

2311
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:33,312
Feather

2312
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:37,408
I don't know I like

2313
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:40,480
Group social shaving for this Behavior cuz

2314
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:46,368
Maybe just everyone

2315
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,440
One tomato that they have to throw it out

2316
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,000
So I look as bad as that is

2317
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,792
That's terrible and I believe that

2318
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:56,352
Cuz

2319
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,912
Right well I need to know somebody

2320
01:49:59,424 --> 01:49:59,936
Is breaking their

2321
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,240
That's not yet

2322
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,544
Because I don't actually has a

2323
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:05,312
Pretty good position

2324
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:07,104
RV insider trading

2325
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,128
It's happening

2326
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,408
It's bad yes

2327
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,176
Good

2328
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:12,480
Republican and Democrat

2329
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,088
Office

2330
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:17,856
What

2331
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:20,672
Classified briefing on Coronavirus

2332

Add

2333
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:23,744
It was

2334
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:28,096
Russian agent

2335
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,824
Add

2336
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:45,248
Every

2337
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:47,040
Damn one of them

2338
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:52,160
Yes I agree Republican or Democrat

2339
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:56,512
You go dump your stock it's called in cider trade

2340
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:58,048
Stick a fork in them

2341
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,960
Don't you know those three Republicans vote for impeachment

2342
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:08,800
Don't you know now there's going to be a new impeachment, that's all you know it's coming

2343
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,128
4 months

2344
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,920
That speaking

2345
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:14,944
1000

2346
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,248
Ian

2347
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,784
1011

2348
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,816
The top

2349
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,584
Sure

2350
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,472
Against President Trump

2351
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:41,056
You can see how old is she

2352
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,592
Alex lost me in the middle

2353
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:48,992
Caught for insider trading will not be asked

2354
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:52,064
Blackmailed into

2355
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:58,976
Yes got you and it only takes three Republicans to successfully remove

2356
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:05,632
Alex's Affion number

2357
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:08,704
We're all these people in Congress to be treated equally resign

2358
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,264
It's this is actually a case of insider trading

2359
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,288
Appears to be

2360
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:14,592
I don't think you'd have that position if one of them was

2361
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:20,992
Jim Jordan that's that's of counterfactual I can't really prove that that's true but

2362
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,296
However

2363
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:26,112
Alex doesn't seem to know who the Republican ones are

2364
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:28,672
And Dianne Feinstein's only name even brings up

2365
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:30,464
You also doesn't even seem to know that it's

2366
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,488
Old Republic

2367
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,768
And then Diane

2368
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,304
The only Democrat

2369
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,376
He's trying to make it seem like it's equal it's all

2370
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:41,984
Three Republicans also also Republicans

2371
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,032
Look they're cheaters and Traders in their awful

2372
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:49,152
Also has a Chinese

2373
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:52,224
Also I know.

2374
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:58,624
Trump narrative is so goddamn boring now because she has to leave

2375
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,160
Do the endpoint of taking out Trump

2376
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:01,952
It feels like a sitcom that's like an

2377
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:05,280
Season 10 where the writing is just lazy

2378
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:06,816
Come on can you just be

2379
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:07,584
Interesting

2380
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,608
Weird

2381
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:10,912
Tennessee

2382
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:13,728
Everything is just like yes secretly trying to

2383
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:16,800
Trump is doing a bad job

2384
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,568
Ross

2385
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,104
Raw is terrible

2386
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:22,944
He's the worst he's actually literally killing people

2387
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,248
Great job

2388
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,296
And your show is boring

2389
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:33,696
Great job just not do this

2390
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:36,256
Yeah it sucks but in this next book so I know it's

2391
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,048
Anthony

2392
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:41,120
Same ones that run the show

2393
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:45,984
We're getting good guide

2394
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:46,752
Fauci

2395
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:49,056
Saddles up sidles up

2396
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:50,592
And says

2397
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:53,664
You're all dead you say that

2398
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,736
Sterling today

2399
01:53:56,992 --> 01:54:03,136
This is so f****** funny

2400
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,416
Stay focused on responding

2401
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:08,768
In front of them and it's going great he's behaving like a responsible grown-up

2402
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:10,304
That's really pissing off Alex

2403
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,096
Because he wants to have fun y'all conspiracy

2404
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:18,752
But because I listen to Alex's show I remember that Alex fauci was back on February

2405
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,848
What Alex misread headline and decided to report to Anthony fauci

2406
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:26,944
I'm coming out at Trump's fast and saying that they believe the virus was man made

2407
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:31,552
Yes of course with a load of bulshit but it led to Alex saying which is really funny

2408
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:32,832
Now it's

2409
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,648
The president for his

2410
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,512
Mulatto calls

2411
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:43,584
I know he was

2412
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,632
Legend

2413
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:51,520
Looked into falchi made some calls

2414
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:56,896
Nothing is real

2415
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,664
Nothing is

2416
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:00,992
Nothing is real

2417
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:03,040
It makes you more able to accept

2418
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:06,368
They were about to listen to Ted Nugent's wife

2419
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,392
Why not

2420
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:12,512
I couldn't get anywhere but wouldn't I have to listen to Ted Nugent's wife

2421
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:14,304
Why not

2422
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:16,096
The coronavirus and what's going on

2423
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,888
And I started

2424
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:20,960
To do some research on the password

2425
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:21,984
And I started

2426
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:22,752
To find out what

2427
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:25,312
What's really going on

2428
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,080
Crap out of me

2429
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,104
So

2430
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:28,128
Miss Nugent

2431
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:29,152
I've done some research

2432
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:34,528
She has a Chrome browser than I assumed

2433
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,296
You know

2434
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:39,392
You would maybe assume that his wife isn't maybe the best

2435
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,928
Source of research about

2436
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:44,256
The Coronavirus

2437
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:46,048
Has some.

2438
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:51,424
From you on the medical field

2439
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:59,616
What do you think it's coming from what do you think's going to happen

2440
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:05,760
I don't know is shemane Nugent is a respected name of the field of research or anything like that

2441
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:07,552
She's mostly relevant cuz she's Ted's

2442
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:12,672
Your website into Zumba and some years back she got sick because

2443
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:16,256
Encourage her to get into alternative medicine

2444
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:22,912
Anthony fauci basically at the same resumes

2445
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:27,520
Zumba instructor big red flag on her website for me was her educational record

2446
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:32,896
She has a bachelor's in radio TV and film because she met Ted when she was working

2447
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:33,920
Detroit radio

2448
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:36,736
She also claims to have a masters in betta fish

2449
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,808
Switch izibor problems metaphysics

2450
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:43,648
Yeah okay I noticed that you didn't say where either of these degrees are from

2451
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:45,696
Because probably you know

2452
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:46,464
Metaphysics

2453
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,512
Degrees from scammy diploma Bell

2454
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:52,096
Real accredited universities do not offer degrees in Menifee

2455
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:55,168
When someone has a degree in metaphysics on the resume

2456
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,472
Other educational background

2457
01:56:57,728 --> 01:57:01,568
And isn't in some other solid form of philosophy or maybe theology

2458
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:03,360
It's a major sign

2459
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:04,640
Butterface

2460
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:06,688
What is a real branch of philosophy but it's

2461
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:08,224
Something universities give degrees

2462
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:11,296
It's the same thing with most branches

2463
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:12,320
Philosophy

2464
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:15,392
If I pursued a philosophy major instead of a minor in college

2465
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,416
I would have

2466
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,952
A bachelor's degree in philosophy

2467
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:19,232
Not in the lodge

2468
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:24,864
Emphasis in logic

2469
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,144
Degree in logic

2470
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:27,168
She's written

2471
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:27,936
Free books

2472
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:29,472
What is gold

2473
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:31,776
Which of the wild game cookbook she wrote with Ted

2474
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:32,800
Very rich

2475
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,384
Researcher Dan others called married to

2476
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:42,272
What better research is there for a book like that then actually marrying a rockstar

2477
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,600
Rock and roll your way to Happy

2478
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:50,208
Being married to a famous rock and roll

2479
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,256
4 minutes is all you need to do good research

2480
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:55,072
She's also currently making a documentary called killer house

2481
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,608
Switch about toxic mold

2482
01:57:56,864 --> 01:58:03,008
Also in 2013 she was arrested for having a 38 caliber handgun in a carry-on bag when she tried to board a plane and

2483
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:08,896
Was loaded but shamaine claimed that you had no idea I was in her bag

2484
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:14,272
Nothing says responsible gun ownership than not knowing where your loaded gun

2485
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:18,112
That's the games that remain like to play with each other you know like

2486
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:24,000
Oru leaving the country perhaps international travel allowed just going to speak a little loaded weapon in your luggage

2487
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:31,936
I can find no evidence that you should be treated as an expert in anything nor should her Research into the Coronavirus

2488
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:37,568
Alex's weird pervert hero Ted Nugent

2489
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:39,360
Great

2490
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,688
We live in strange times

2491
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:45,504
So you know this

2492
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:49,088
Theories going around

2493
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,112
Cover

2494
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:51,392
For Trump to

2495
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:52,416
Mop up the

2496
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:55,488
Why would those theories

2497
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:56,512
Suggest

2498
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:04,960
Use the virus against Trump

2499
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:09,056
Deep State both sides

2500
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:17,248
This is

2501
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,296
Preordained

2502
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:22,368
Evolution this is unlike

2503
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,440
2 biblical

2504
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:26,976
Proportion

2505
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:30,304
Had to unravel the way

2506
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:36,192
What's really weird is there's a lot of talk invagen simulations of this being sort of biblical and

2507
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:38,240
WYD

2508
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,776
Don't they bring up the local

2509
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,616
Play clean never bring up the local seleucus Arturo

2510
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:50,016
Victor trying to pitch this like this is revelation

2511
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:51,040
Why not bring up

2512
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,832
There's also Locust

2513
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:54,112
Too real

2514
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:58,208
Everytime I read that news I swear to God I've read

2515
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:03,328
That same news like 30 times and every time I immediately forget it because of likes

2516
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,888
No I just refuse to believe that there's

2517
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:08,192
Locus I refuse to believe there's a plague of locusts

2518
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,752
How old is a plague of locusts

2519
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:11,520
Right now

2520
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:12,288
You think

2521
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:14,848
It fits right in with their rhetoric

2522
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:15,872
Willits

2523
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:16,896
Conspicuous

2524
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:20,480
Too on the nose

2525
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:22,528
Alex

2526
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:25,600
Talking about the mopping up the Deep State thing that's a cute

2527
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:26,624
Yeah yeah

2528
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:30,464
Narratives it's put out by qanon

2529
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:35,072
Guess what shamaine likes qanon

2530
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:42,752
I do believe that there is an orchestrated group of individuals

2531
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,800
Some people have called

2532
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:48,640
Choo-Choo have been dropping breadcrumbs so to speak

2533
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:52,224
For Those About to

2534
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,272
My people to do the research

2535
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,040
Themselves

2536
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:57,344
Sequoia research qanon

2537
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,392
You're Googling weird article

2538
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,416
Due diligence

2539
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:06,560
For themselves

2540
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:11,424
No

2541
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:13,984
Does try to get

2542
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,264
Alex to do

2543
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,824
Exercise

2544
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:27,552
Never done before on your show

2545
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:28,320
Voicemail

2546
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:34,208
I want to take a deep breath

2547
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,688
Okay

2548
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:58,016
You know what you know what Alex Pearson

2549
02:01:58,272 --> 02:02:00,064
We don't really know for sure what

2550
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:05,952
Piece of information

2551
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,488
More qanon language

2552
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,792
Yep she's super into qanon

2553
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:11,072
Interviewee

2554
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:14,912
And Alex until kind of like is it

2555
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:23,872
Yes too many questions it's going to get into her promoting q and she hasn't stated position of hating Q earlier they had

2556
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:25,664
The day before

2557
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:29,504
Consistently so he doesn't want to yell and make

2558
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:33,600
Fun of Ted Nugent's wife keep Ted Nugent his friend

2559
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:40,000
So you keep surviving

2560
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:40,768
To live in the woods

2561
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:45,120
Okay anyway Alex Lorenz interview

2562
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,144
It's like an hour

2563
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:49,216
That can't be real

2564
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:53,312
Say on Fox News

2565
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:57,408
I want to I want to I want the world to know what the nuge thinks they might

2566
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:04,832
So anyway Alex gets into weird head space after the interview

2567
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:08,928
He starts talking about the movie Rollerball

2568
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,512
Rollerball is real

2569
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:17,632
Globalism was about being able to show countries off because everybody was interdependent

2570
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:22,496
Tell they made an incredible movie back in the 70s with James Caan rollerblade

2571
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,032
Rollerblade

2572
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:28,384
Watch Amazon TV

2573
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,688
Like the early 80s

2574
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:37,856
My dad going to bring me brazinski but when you get on up son some movies about what they plan to shut

2575
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:41,184
So

2576
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,488

Trying to find files about other corporations over and there's this one big Mainframe liquid computer

2586
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:31,360
He goes to the computer

2587
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:39,040
They got rid of all the books that got

2588
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:43,904
While everything was available on this worldwide computer system call the internet

2589
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:48,768
AI computer

2590
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:55,680
That sounds like a good plot of a boot

2591
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:59,776
You guys yes he categorizes things and then he loses them

2592
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:04,896
Cloud lost now

2593
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:06,688
Volume

2594
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:11,040

Rollerball

2599
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:19,232
And he's asking them to back it up with audio

2600
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,256
Just in case

2601
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:23,072
The cloud loses it

2602
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:32,544
We need a physical copy of this

2603
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:35,104
Text Woody saying

2604
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:35,872

Is it Logan's Run I can't remember I think Blade Runner Blade Runner okay

2608
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,888
Probably is going to be real

2609
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:01,984
I wrote down running man but I don't think he would reference that one

2610
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,776
I thought he would just hate

2611
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:07,872
Arnold Schwarzenegger Total Recall

2612
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:14,016

Him to run out of Philip K Dick's related movies

2618
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,864
You're right

2619
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:32,448
How far how far is Augusta

2620
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:34,752
You see someone with a hat

2621
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:37,056
Now

2622
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:41,152
Give me a people have to go through doors in like the movie bright

2623
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,432
Starring Will Smith butt

2624
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:43,200
Hear me up

2625
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:47,040
No but you were at the game

2626
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:49,088
Supposed to be Filipino

2627
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:52,416
So Alex wants to take some calls

2628
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:54,720
Towards the end of the 20th episode

2629
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,512
Call

2630
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:57,792
Specific sort of caught

2631
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:00,864
I know you're busy.

2632
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,656
You have specific

2633
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:08,288
Voicecomm

2634
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:10,080
Space command

2635
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:11,616
Central Command

2636
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:13,920
Army Special Operations

2637
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:17,504
State Police

2638
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:20,320
What you been prepped and ready for

2639
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:21,856
Also Ted Nugent's wife

2640
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:25,184
I want you to call him we'll talk about it

2641
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:28,512
Alex Trebek call for collars from height until areas

2642
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:29,536
Because he wants

2643
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:30,816
What they're hearing

2644
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:31,840
That's great

2645
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:35,680
But I highly doubt any one of those areas is likely to call even less likely

2646
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:38,240
Somebody private information on Alex's dump show

2647
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,776
This is

2648
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:42,848
It's not actually a plea for intelligence people in the audience

2649
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:43,616
Call Lynn

2650
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:46,176
In function this is Alex signaling to the audience

2651
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:48,480
If they call in and claim to be until the

2652
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:49,760
You going to let them

2653
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:53,856
He won't question them and is willing to take at face value all the information the audience

2654
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:55,392
It's my present as appearing a fish

2655
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:58,464
Basically what he's doing is establishing an improv

2656
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,256
He's inviting people to Lark with

2657
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:01,792
That is it

2658
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,888
The first line in proxy

2659
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:07,424
Anyway

2660
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,448
It calls for a while

2661
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:10,240
Not getting any calls

2662
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:13,312
Or maybe he's just

2663
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,384
Plenty of evidence

2664
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,432
Sorry starts rambling

2665
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:30,720
One is super deadly compared to the other Buddies

2666
02:08:30,976 --> 02:08:32,512
The other is not

2667
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:41,984
The medical workers the police the military rest of the last episode

2668
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:47,360
Strains of the virus start

2669
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:48,128
Something you made up

2670
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,664
Is rambling talkingshit

2671
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:52,992
Bring talkingshit this stuff you saying about two strains

2672
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:55,040
Is not something that is a scientific

2673
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:57,344
There is preliminary research

2674
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,624
It suggested there's what

2675
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,904
Call the Estrella

2676
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:01,440
What is the ancestral strain

2677
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:02,720
The original one that jump

2678
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:04,512
A human from animal to Human

2679
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:06,304
What are some point mutated into

2680
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,072
BL strain

2681
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:08,608
Which appears to be better adapted

2682
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:09,376
Jump from humor

2683
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:10,144
Cuba

2684
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:12,448
When's coldy more aggressive strain

2685
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:13,984
This is a reference to its ability to

2686
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,008
The transmitted from person

2687
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:17,568
Person not because it causes a more severe

2688
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:22,176
The guardian reported on March 11th that it is not yet clear whether the

2689
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:24,480
The two strains cause different severity of

2690
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:28,064
I was just heard a few words like more aggressive

2691
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,088
Listen to strains

2692
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:32,160
And he's just a story about his needs

2693
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:35,744
Whether or not studies do eventually show that there are in fact 22

2694
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,024
Distinct strains of the virus

2695
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,328
And that one causes more severe illness

2696
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,096
It doesn't matter

2697
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:42,144
Right now Alex is just making sure.

2698
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:44,448
It feels a little bit like

2699
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:47,264
Our language

2700
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,288
Itself is

2701
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,568
At fault for so much

2702
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,360
This information just like

2703
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:52,896
When you say oh it's

2704
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:53,664
Progressive

2705
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:56,224
Epidemiologist that means one

2706
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:58,784
And for people who are deaf

2707
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,832
That seems to mean a completely

2708
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:01,856
Different things

2709
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:08,000
A perfect example is every single time out use that line

2710
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:11,072
About the gain a function study on the Coronavirus

2711
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:11,840
Causing

2712
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:12,864
Right

2713
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:14,656
Is perfect

2714
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:16,960
We accurate also when I

2715
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:22,336
Perfectly fits his propaganda Barrett it's almost like they should have

2716
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,104
2 makeup

2717
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:25,152
Sleep random nonsense

2718
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:26,688
Since words in order to describe

2719
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:29,760
Likes instead of calling it a gain of function it's a

2720
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:30,528
Flip flop

2721
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:35,904
Like that's the only way that people won't confuse it for both I don't feel like it's the X

2722
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:37,440
Experts responsibility to

2723
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:39,744
Adapt their behavior to propagandist

2724
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:42,048
Wow theranos

2725
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,328
So Alex

2726
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:46,400
Tim selling his zinc

2727
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:48,448
She's pushing a bit now

2728
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:52,032
Alex is kind of bad

2729
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:53,568
The media

2730
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,872
It's saying there's going to be a lot of deaths

2731
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:59,712
You just said there was going to be a lot of death you might believe that yes

2732
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,784
Lost in the cloud

2733
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:05,600
Play I didn't feel that clip

2734
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:12,000
Rollerball

2735
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:14,560
Everyone runs in fear

2736
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:20,960
No evidence of

2737
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:26,592
So the media isn't saying there's going to be three million deaths in the United States from Coronavirus

2738
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:28,384
You're covering the March 16th

2739
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:32,480
Report from Imperial College the estimated that is literally nothing was done

2740
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:34,784
It could result in 2.2 million

2741
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:37,088
In 510,000

2742
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:37,856
And the United Kingdom

2743
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:40,928
Practice is this prediction by saying

2744
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:42,208
In the unlikely apps

2745
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:44,768
Any control measures or spontaneous

2746
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:45,792
Individual Behavior

2747
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:49,632
So that's kind of a setup it's Bianna likely nothing is done

2748
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:51,424
Alex and Mike Adams

2749
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:53,728
Misused Imperial College estimates

2750
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:54,752
The past

2751
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:57,824
About 50,000 new cases a day and sign up

2752
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:59,616
Felicia be totally on board for

2753
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:01,152
Except now

2754
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:03,712
Play the virus or something

2755
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:06,016
Just the media's being hysterical

2756
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:09,600
Fortunately I listen to Alex's show

2757
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:10,624
Pentagon

2758
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:14,208
With the numbers they have

2759
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:17,792
That they could out of 23 million dead people

2760

2763
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:29,056

Other business

2768
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:41,344
Tried to leave the work

2769
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,880
My wife

They're going to kill you and your family

2773
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:52,352
Most of us are already dead

Will be getting cancer said we'll all be sterile soon it's over

2775
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:04,384
Survivors

CPAs man

2777

Hysterical fruit bread and butter

02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:31,776
This is abuse

2783
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:32,800
Yeah I feel

2784
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:35,616
This show is f****** nuts

2785
02:13:35,872 --> 02:13:36,896
Nothing is real

2786
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:39,712
Not even from day-to-day from

2787
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:40,992
H h

2788
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:42,272
Important to know Jordan

2789
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:51,488
Lost a million

2790
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:54,560
And don't worry about it it's sad and it was not good but

2791
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:57,632
The Great Depression

2792
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:01,984
7 million + 7 million

2793
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:05,312
Death from malnutrition Great Depression

2794
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:07,104
7 million people

2795
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:09,408
In the 10-year Great Depression

2796
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:12,992
11 year Great Depression ended up

2797
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:13,760
So

2798
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:21,184
That is not good and the food can run outside

2799
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,536
And then fall down the stairs break your neck

2800
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:36,544
What we're getting into it

2801
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,568
And the fear

2802
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:39,104
This is so wild

2803
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:44,224
Starving

2804
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:49,088
He has the operators try to find a citation for

2805
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:50,112
It look what happened

2806
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:53,952
There is famine field 7 million people in USA

2807
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:55,744
That's

2808
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,280
Pravda. Russia

2809
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:05,472
Chicago

2810
02:15:05,984 --> 02:15:06,752
But

2811
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:12,384
Chicago study

2812
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:16,992
Maybe not but just some other sources

2813
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:18,016
Sabores for assault

2814
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:22,112
You know you know how people know

2815
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:24,928
About how many people who starve to death

2816
02:15:25,952 --> 02:15:26,720
Russia

2817
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:33,120
You know how late we know about it like a famous thing that we know right cuz it's historically

2818
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:40,544
Now don't you think that is a similar number number of people had started out here we wouldn't

2819
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:43,104
Just finding out about it from Alex Jones

2820
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:45,664
Pretty sure that would be a

2821
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:48,480
Thing that we are taught not cuz the globalist

2822
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:49,504
Oh okay

2823
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,040
Rollerball

2824
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:54,112
Let's go to Segal's

2825
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:56,416
And

2826
02:15:56,672 --> 02:15:57,696
He get the caller

2827
02:15:57,952 --> 02:16:02,560
That wants to give him a sizing strategy and how to how to

2828
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:06,144
Alex I'd like to help you commit a crime

2829
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:08,960
I'd like to help you Market your brand

2830
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:15,872
So much for taking my call real quick I want to tell all your viewers to do what I've done and that's

2831
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:16,896
$10

2832
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:17,920
I got a yard sale

2833
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:19,712
Spray paint

2834
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:21,760
Covid-19

2835
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:24,064
13841 sign

2836
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:28,160
Infowars.com on the other

2837
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:35,584
Hold you already have more time but I've been thinking about having callers

2838
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:40,960
I don't have it

2839
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:46,080
Covid-19 just nailed it

2840
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:51,456
Another caller calls in later is IQ close on that one but it should be covid-19

2841
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:56,320
1984 good punch at buddy good punch up

2842
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:59,648
The answer to 1984 is

2843
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:01,440
Covid-19 84

2844
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:05,536
I hate to call pawn shop

2845
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:09,888
A little less cuz at least that was a good suggestion

2846
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:14,240
In the realm we were talking about that sign that is

2847
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:15,264
That is a better say

2848
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:18,080
So this collar because he's giving Alex a market

2849
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:20,384
Opera opportunities

2850
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:22,944
Please get to say something stupid

2851
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:25,760
Hang on line until he gets

2852
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:27,808
Give a completely baseless.

2853
02:17:28,064 --> 02:17:28,576
Makes no sense

2854
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:30,368
One more major point

2855
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:33,696
Do you remember the Las Vegas shooting

2856
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:34,976
Back in October

2857
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:37,280
Yes I do

2858
02:17:38,048 --> 02:17:39,584
Okay if you remember Trump

2859
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:43,936
Expected March of 19

2860
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:46,752
Me and we started learning

2861
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:55,712
So it's all connected hours cuz they didn't want you to be able to get

2862
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:57,760
Chip repair

2863
02:17:58,272 --> 02:17:59,040
The martial law

2864
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:03,136
Why do this

2865
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:06,720
Prince very future

2866
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:07,488
Oh yes

2867
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:08,768
Bump stocks

2868
02:18:09,024 --> 02:18:11,584
Crucial element of surviving

2869
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:13,120
Going to urinate

2870
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:18,496
Alex

2871
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:20,544
I would love

2872
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:21,312
For there just

2873
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:22,080
Come like

2874
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:25,408
A moment where Alex has a break and you just like

2875
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:27,712
Stupid

2876
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:30,272
We're trying to create panic and we're trying to

2877
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:32,576
I love all this

2878
02:18:32,832 --> 02:18:33,600
Spear Gray

2879
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:35,136
I love conspiracies

2880
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:37,184
I would love anything

2881
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:39,744
It gives a different narrative about the Las Vegas shooting

2882
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:42,816
You are.

2883
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:46,912
Yeah you wanted to have that happy Billy Madison MoMA

2884
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:50,240
Wasted everybody's

2885
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:52,800
Retirement may God have mercy on your soul

2886
02:18:53,056 --> 02:18:53,568
That kind of

2887
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:58,176
Or even like I've listened to a number of episodes of Bill Cooper show where he talks to collars and he's like

2888
02:18:58,688 --> 02:18:59,200
Do you have no

2889
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:02,272
Like if you will just push back on people I want Alex

2890
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:04,064
I know that you never do it because

2891
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:05,600
It would hurt his ability

2892
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:07,648
Key people in the fold and tell them stupid

2893
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:09,952
But like I would love it if you did

2894
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:11,744
Tee-off on somebody's a******

2895
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:17,376
I don't hate them cuz they're.

2896
02:19:17,632 --> 02:19:19,168
These things that they're saying

2897
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:23,776
Some of them are like legitimately publicly dangerous

2898
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:26,080
To be so good

2899
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:32,224
That's what the government's after

2900
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:34,016
So this guy obviously

2901
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:35,552
Not a high-level intelligence

2902
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:36,576
It doesn't seem

2903
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:41,696
Have one on the phone

2904
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:42,976
We had

2905
02:19:43,232 --> 02:19:45,536
Robert Cerrone

2906
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:47,584
You're not giving out the secret information

2907
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:49,632
We've already in a form of martial law

2908
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:52,192
The corporation's by the Democrats Terraria

2909
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:54,752
Took the driving point of Alex's coverage in

2910
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:57,824
These couple of days is definitely that Barcelona is already

2911
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:59,104
Globalist

2912
02:19:59,360 --> 02:19:59,872
Doing it

2913
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:01,920
On the one hand this is a message for Alex

2914
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:02,688
Because he's always been

2915
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:04,480
I'm pretty clear than martial law is happening

2916
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:06,272
Time start a Revolutionary War

2917
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:09,600
But leaving that aside there's another really serious problem look what Alex

2918
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:12,672
Beyblade suggest

2919
02:20:12,928 --> 02:20:15,232
Left is responsible for making these martial law

2920
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:18,816
Explains new reporting

2921
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:21,120
Politico reported on Saturday that Trump

2922
02:20:21,376 --> 02:20:24,448
Department of Justice run by his good buddy Bill Barr

2923
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:27,520
We asked Congress for the ability to ask chief judge

2924
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:28,288
Judges

2925
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:31,616
Do detain people indefinitely without trial during a bird

2926
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:33,664
It's really stag

2927
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:35,456
Global control the.

2928
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:38,528
Political politically

2929
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:41,088
In what are the documents the department

2930
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:43,648
Proposed the Congress Grant the attorney general power to

2931
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:44,672
The chief

2932
02:20:44,928 --> 02:20:45,696
District Court

2933
02:20:45,952 --> 02:20:46,464
Pause Corp

2934
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,768
Proceedings whenever the district court is full

2935
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:52,864
We are partially closed by virtue of any natural disasters civil disobedience

2936
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:54,144
Or other

2937
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:55,168
Situation

2938
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:56,960
Also from that article

2939
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:59,008
Violation

2940
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,104
Pre-arrest said Norman

2941
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:06,944
The executive director of the National Association of criminal defense lawyers

2942
02:21:07,712 --> 02:21:10,528
So that means you'd be arrested and never brought before a judge

2943
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:11,808
Until they decide that the emerging

2944
02:21:12,064 --> 02:21:13,600
You're the civil disobedience is over

2945
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:15,136
I find it absolutely.

2946
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:17,440
Especially in a time of emergency

2947
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:20,256
We should be very careful about granting new powers to the government

2948
02:21:22,048 --> 02:21:22,560
Jones

2949
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:24,352
The champion of civil liberties

2950
02:21:24,864 --> 02:21:25,632
Not likely

2951
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:26,400
The story

2952
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:27,936
He wants Trump to become a dictator

2953
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:29,216
He's been very clear about

2954
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:31,520
Alex's care about civil liberties for their own say

2955
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:33,312
Means to an end

2956
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:37,152
It was an issue that was Central to the popularity of people like Ron Paul

2957
02:21:37,408 --> 02:21:38,688
So we had to push it really hard

2958
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:40,480
It's always been a trojan horse

2959
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:42,272
In circumstances like these are really big

2960
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:43,040
Just dropping the mass

2961
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:46,368
If Alex doesn't come out in immediately

2962
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:47,904
Wheatley reverse course

2963
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:48,672
On Trump

2964
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:49,952
Africa's Department of just

2965
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:51,232
This is asking for the power to

2966
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:52,000
Team people

2967
02:21:52,256 --> 02:21:53,792
Indefinitely without trial

2968
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:56,096
He should f****** throw in the towel on everything

2969
02:21:56,352 --> 02:21:56,864
He's overprotective

2970
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:57,632
The stand for

2971
02:21:57,888 --> 02:21:58,912
Because that s*** is

2972
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:02,496
We'll see I'm in that happened on Saturday

2973
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:04,032
Friday's episodes

2974
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:05,312
But it's it's it's

2975
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:09,920
Comical the idea that he's trying to say that the globalist in the left is doing all this stuff

2976
02:22:10,176 --> 02:22:10,944
Trump is a heretic

2977
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:14,272
There's all of these instance

2978
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:16,320
Exact thing

2979
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:19,136
Normally would be scream

2980
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:20,160
Yep

2981
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:22,720
You haven't used the villain of Alex's story

2982
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:23,488
Absolutely

2983
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:24,768
It is

2984
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:28,608
It is amazing to me exactly how much Trump is doing what

2985
02:22:28,864 --> 02:22:30,144
They said Obama was doing

2986
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:31,168
And loss

2987
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:31,936
Masterminds

2988
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:33,728
I still don't think

2989
02:22:33,984 --> 02:22:35,264
That even if Trump does

2990
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:37,568
All the negative things he may do

2991
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:40,896
He automatically becomes king and all the Senators become Duke

2992
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:46,528
That might be true that might beat Rodin you don't know you have a replica

2993
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:47,808
Constitution it's too big

2994
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:49,856
I do believe it's impossible to read the whole thing

2995
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:50,624
What science

2996
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:54,208
So Alex talks about Hobbies play backflip

2997
02:22:54,464 --> 02:22:55,232
Tanaka show

2998
02:22:56,768 --> 02:23:00,608
Eye clinics in California during lockdown the governor is basically under martial law

2999
02:23:04,704 --> 02:23:07,520
Annabelle

3000
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:08,800
Honey

3001
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:12,640
Yonder martial law honey time.

3002
02:23:12,896 --> 02:23:15,456
Yeah I mean he's played the clip but it doesn't say what

3003
02:23:15,712 --> 02:23:16,224
You say

3004
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:17,504
He's misrepresenting

3005
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:21,600
Newsom into a misogynist

3006
02:23:21,856 --> 02:23:22,880
Somehow as well

3007
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:23,648
Yeah

3008
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:26,720
So Mike Adams comes on

3009
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:29,536
Mike Adams I think actually has a pretty interesting

3010
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:30,304
Position at this

3011
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:32,608
Almost anything

3012
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:35,424
Thank you saying but he does believe that these quarantine things

3013
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:36,448
Are necessary

3014
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:39,008
So he is at least at

3015
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:39,776
The point of

3016
02:23:40,032 --> 02:23:40,544
Like

3017
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:42,336
He seems to have

3018
02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:43,872
A pushing

3019
02:23:44,128 --> 02:23:44,640
Pulga

3020
02:23:46,432 --> 02:23:47,456
I'm fine with

3021
02:23:47,968 --> 02:23:48,480
But I don't want to

3022
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:50,272
The thing is

3023
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:51,808
Prepare to fight

3024
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:53,088
Civil liberties

3025
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:57,440
The lockdown and isolation that is medically

3026
02:23:58,208 --> 02:24:02,560
Eeyore epidemiological

3027
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:08,192
That is not what that is

3028
02:24:08,448 --> 02:24:09,984
Necessary

3029
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:14,848
BNA really really bad situation about the virus which I appreciate

3030
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:16,896
Now he's also saying that we need

3031
02:24:17,152 --> 02:24:18,432
To protect our civil liberties

3032
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:19,456
Course of that

3033
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:20,736
Response to that would be

3034
02:24:20,992 --> 02:24:21,760
Go talk to Trump

3035
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:22,784
No stick

3036
02:24:24,064 --> 02:24:24,832
At the same time

3037
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:25,600
That is a

3038
02:24:25,856 --> 02:24:26,880
Relevant conversation

3039
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:28,416
The tension

3040
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:29,440
And the

3041
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:32,512
Maintaining civil liberties while at the

3042
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:33,536
Same time

3043
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:34,560
This necessary

3044
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:36,352
Right right I will open

3045
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:38,144
Except that conversation

3046
02:24:39,424 --> 02:24:42,752
The difficulties in finding a solution or conclusion

3047
02:24:43,008 --> 02:24:44,544
Maybe we can all feel comfortable with

3048
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:45,568
From anybody

3049
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:47,616
But anyone who's ever been on it for

3050
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:51,712
Exactly do not have the credibility from the conversation

3051
02:24:51,968 --> 02:24:52,736
1

3052
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,808
From the

3053
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:57,856
Pulsed absolute

3054
02:24:58,880 --> 02:24:59,392
I do appreciate

3055
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:00,928
Micah saying if this is necessary

3056
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:01,952
Because

3057
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:04,768
In the world of Infowars assholes

3058
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,840
That is monumental

3059
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:11,936
So I was going to say the one person that I really don't want to hear from

3060
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:12,960
That's right now

3061
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:14,496
More so than Alex

3062
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,776
Is Mike Adams

3063
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:17,568
And somehow he's the one who has

3064
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:20,640
I mean I mean

3065
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:22,432
This particular thing he says

3066
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:23,200
Yeah

3067
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:25,760
Eclipse today

3068
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:27,808
From March 20th episode

3069
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,088
Equally wrong

3070
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:31,904
Ocala My Confession in my my

3071
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:33,696
All of this

3072
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:36,512
Is I have vastly understated the

3073
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:39,072
The criticality

3074
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:41,376
It's over for Humanity

3075
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:43,168
Only be Lone Survivor

3076
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:45,984
That's understated I'd say that's a shot

3077
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:49,056
No Chaser understand

3078
02:25:49,568 --> 02:25:50,336
Alright okay

3079
02:25:50,848 --> 02:25:53,920
So we come to the end of this and I think that Alex is

3080
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:55,712
I think the theme

3081
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:58,528
You know it's not as painful as I expect

3082
02:25:59,552 --> 02:26:01,088
Subway

3083
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:04,416
There's a lot of this stuff that is like

3084
02:26:04,672 --> 02:26:05,184
Sniff people

3085
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:10,048
If you can listen to this as opposed to experts their run the risk of stymieing the efforts of

3086
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,584
The country

3087
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:13,376
Getting through this successfully

3088
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:15,424
But

3089
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,728
There's also a lot of stupid s*** along the way

3090
02:26:17,984 --> 02:26:18,752
Do you know I can always

3091
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:24,896
Enjoy finding that Alex said that this 7 billion people start comes from

3092
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:26,688
A Pravda trying to just

3093
02:26:26,944 --> 02:26:30,272
Notify Sylvia

3094
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:36,672
I read about it from the University of

3095
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:43,072
Appreciate little things like that

3096
02:26:43,328 --> 02:26:44,864
Overwhelming

3097
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:48,192
Bottom line is the reason you think

3098
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:49,216
The globalist

3099
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:50,496
Just released this virus

3100
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:54,336
Is too because they wanted to destroy the economy to Bears Trump

3101
02:26:54,592 --> 02:26:56,896
Only defense you can ever get for that

3102
02:26:57,408 --> 02:26:58,176
F****** Bill Maher

3103
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:59,968
That's fun to think about

3104
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:05,088
Alex thinks that every single goddamn movie is real

3105
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:07,136
Especially

3106
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:08,416
Rollerball

3107
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:09,440
Death Race 2

3108
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:15,072
Desperate

3109
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:16,608
With adjacent

3110
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,656
We got to do there are hard

3111
02:27:18,912 --> 02:27:21,216
Hitting questions that we need

3112
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:26,080
Tweet about Jason Statham's entire career

3113
02:27:27,104 --> 02:27:28,128
But

3114
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:34,528
I hope everyone out there is doing alright

3115
02:27:34,784 --> 02:27:37,856
Circumstances

3116
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:41,696
I don't know

3117
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:42,976
Style 2

3118
02:27:43,232 --> 02:27:45,792
Or anything but hope you take care of yourselves and each other

3119
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:50,144
Appreciate all the messages that we received

3120
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:55,776
Okay here in Chicago for the time being

3121
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:06,016
Girls on Twitter

3122
02:28:06,272 --> 02:28:12,416
We are on Facebook

3123
02:28:12,672 --> 02:28:13,696
The whole thing

3124
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:19,072
Leo

3125
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:20,352
Dzx Clark

3126
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:21,888
The juiciest Ice Cube

3127
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:24,448
Holding
