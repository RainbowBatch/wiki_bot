1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge b b

2
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guys

3
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Acknowledge

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Alex

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,864
IMDb

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
What are you up to today

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
I went through after our last episode of went through and I numbered all of our episode

8
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
Official episode numbers

9
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
For all of our back catalogue

10
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,112
I'll just something that I have not said I never thought it would I need to do the episodes

11
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,952
Named after the date of the episode isn't that good enough

12
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Turns out

13
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,304
We jump around a bit so that I

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584
It gets very confusing

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,960
Answer now it's the time has come and I feel really good about it I feel really good that we have a number

16
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
System

17
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
Although it's

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,896
Kind of sour grapes because I got to the end of it was an hours-long process of renaming episode

19
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
Mike wonder how many episodes we have

20
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
Take it to the end

21
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
The last episode we put out Wednesday's episode was episode 4

22
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:09,280
It was too late now we can't make that joke absolutely not

23
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,376
Episode were really mad about it

24
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Episode of

25
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
Past 420 shows on Alex's show

26
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Because I'm usually minutes

27
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
So it's all good

28
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
Also trying to figure out if any of our Milestone episodes episode 100

29
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
200

30
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,560
Any of those were like any Brett like major episode

31
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
Oh that's perfect

32
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,632
Let me know a ring

33
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
We didn't start

34
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
I didn't know how many we didn't

35
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Until you just

36
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Just told me that's

37
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,824
So I think in the future I might try like 4450

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,456
I might try to do something special for actually have numbers

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
Start to turn into an actual show

40
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
We're getting close

41
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,416
My bright spot is taking long walks

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Taking long

43
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
Long walks just to keep my sanity

44
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,608
Love walking to like a Walgreens and not going

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
Just walking back

46
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
Just walking around to Walgreens

47
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
Hey man you got a cat.

48
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
Yeah it feels good

49
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,384
Good feels good I mean it's one of those things that I think that like

50
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,760
I remember playing football junior high

51
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,672
Worn out and I remember this very visceral Aba

52
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,768
Water tastes so good

53
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
I had that thought of going to look no it's not the water taste good in the state I'm in

54
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
That's how you are with walks right now

55
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,776
Exactly. The walk is that good

56
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,616
It's a huge ibidun today's metaphorically

57
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,968
Well that's good that is a bright spot and I'll I'd like to take a little bit more of

58
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
Walk myself but it's tough

59
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:12,672
That one nice thing is I walked a mile or so to get here everyday

60
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Everyday that's fair

61
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,863
Coal mine that weird episodes episodes that are never worked

62
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,007
Just come over lyrics

63
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
Transporting show do first

64
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,783
Was poor for a while now I got those

65
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,343
Trump bucks thanks about your now policy walk

66
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,695
I'm a policy wonk for a while now I got those

67
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,535
Sonic Zachary think is about you and I'll probably walk

68
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,375
Exaggerating

69
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,983
Thank you so much

70
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
I'm a policy wonk

71
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
Thank you so much you are now probably walk

72
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Transformation

73
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
Thank you next

74
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,159
You nzar thank you so much you and I'll probably walk

75
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
How much

76
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
You are now a technocrat

77
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
And I thank you Dominic

78
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
You are now it's like a crack

79
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943
Heroin

80
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Why you pimps

81
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Barge

82
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Spirit

83
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Go find

84
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:07,103
A local charity in your area that you can go help people in need we would appreciate that as well we would loved either

85
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
Spiritually the same to us

86
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
So if you're out there listen

87
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
You're probably thinking at this point

88
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:19,391
These dudes haven't talked about Alex Jones in a while

89
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,463
We had to do that with Alex cuz you

90
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,071
Getting out of pocket box reveal

91
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:32,959
That was the final straw for me really infuriating have much of a dumb dumbass holy is

92
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,031
But you are very bizarre twist

93
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:42,687
He ended up being out of Studio during the time that we were deplatforming him

94
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Almost

95
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
The entire time

96
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,063
So I wanted to bring back Alex on when

97
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,879
Wednesday I didn't work out because Owen Shroyer was house

98
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,951
This episode this Friday episode

99
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:58,815
I was like what we got to get back to the business of looking at Alex he's had his time out

100
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
We got to do it

101
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,423
So I was going to go over Wednesday's episode of his show

102
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
Owen Shroyer hosting

103
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Again

104
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,055
Now we record these the day before they come out

105
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
So Thursday

106
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,175
I texted you last night I told you

107
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Word

108
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
Call Uncharted Territory ye might have to do something else

109
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,231
We're scrambling yes we don't know what is going to happen

110
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
And so I woke up this morning

111
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
Dappled around for a little bit

112
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
11:00 rolls around

113
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,983
Alex is back in studio he hates the returns

114
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
3 days later

115
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
Right around Easter

116
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Not a coincidence

117
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,015
What's the opposite of thrilled

118
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,343
Anxiously regret to reply form Alex

119
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
Outdoor podcast

120
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
So we're going over April 6

121
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
16th 2020 abandoned

122
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
I'm and Hitman

123
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
Shows about what you'd expect

124
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,911
I've tried to eliminate as much of the just

125
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:13,311
Additive nonsense as I can

126
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
Deteriorating like even more so in front of our eyes and normal

127
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
We're be bad to talk about him

128
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
I think it's business is falling apart

129
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
And I think we'll see some quotes about that

130
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
As we go along

131
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
Let's start off here with Alex coverings

132
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,999
Some big news out of the Associated Press

133
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
You notice the big news

134
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,399
Receive documents confirms Wuhan was where the

135
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,335
Run

136
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
Early March

137
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
Has all been confirmed now

138
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
So there's a

139
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,231
25 second Clipper so interesting how many different

140
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,303
Things he's asserting in that tiny spam

141
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
What the first thing is that this AP story confirms that the coronavirus came out of you

142
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
Institute of virology lab

143
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,151
That is not spelled out at all story that Alex is referring to

144
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,319
On April 15th the AP released piece titled quote China didn't warn public of likely pandemic for 6 key

145
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
EBay's

146
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
It's mostly about how the Chinese government is likely aware of the situation be very severe but acting to downplay it public

147
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
In order to avoid panic

148
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,607
Until there was a clear case outside of China that is in Thailand

149
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
And then the situation

150
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
Drastically change that's wild to see a government actively downplay it and act like it's not that big a deal

151
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,103
It is so crazy that one government out there is doing

152
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,663
That singular one single government

153
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:00,063
Obviously I'm not going to defend any countries attempt to minimize Public Health crisis

154
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,391
See where further reporting investigation

155
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,463
On this delay in China brings up

156
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
Did see further reporting on that

157
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
Open

158
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
To learning more

159
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:16,447
However I think it's important to recognize that Alex can not use that article to bash China

160
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,591
Because all it's saying is that g did you know what he did is exactly what Alex is praising Trump for doing

161
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Rumba

162
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,735
Other experts noted that the Chinese government may have

163
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
To Stave off Hysteria

164
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
And then it did

165
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,111
Quickly in private during that time

166
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,975
This is literally what Alex has said Trump did because he's an expert president or something

167
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:45,631
Alex has the Trump declared a secret emergency way back in the early days but downplayed the virus publicly because he didn't want to risk her

168
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
Stock market and he said that was

169
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
Great great idea

170
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,287
Love's about I guess article is no good for Alex

171
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
It does not work

172
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:59,455
The article about the virus originating in the Wuhan Institute of virology is not from the Associated Press

173
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,575
Who's put out as an exclusive by Fox News and was based entirely on Anonymous sources and

174
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,135
I have no ability to determine the veracity of the claim

175
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
However even take this article

176
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Face value

177
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,327
It's important to recognize what the story on Fox News actually says

178
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
Here are a few Choice lines

179
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
From the article

180
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
Here's the opening paragraph

181
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Quote

182
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
There's an increasing confidence

183
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,335
Flappy covid-19 outbreak likely originated in the Wuhan Laboratory

184
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,407
Do not as a bioweapon but is a part of China's attempt

185
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,807
To demonstrate that its efforts to identify a combat viruses are equal to or greater than the capabilities of the United States

186
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:42,463
Multiple sources who have been briefed on the details of early actions by China's government and seem relevant materials tail fox

187
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
News

188
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Right out of the gate we have toothache

189
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,351
One is it this is not factual reporting

190
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
It's reporting a ink

191
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Priest confer

192
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
That's not saying this is

193
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,263
The case figure is an increase confidence

194
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
We could mean any

195
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,615
Fox news reporting people feel a little bit better about this

196
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,943
Specific

197
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
The second thing is that even if

198
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
All of this is true

199
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,343
Definitely not a biome

200
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Which runs counter to

201
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
All of Alex's narratives about the virus

202
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
A little later the article you get this line

203
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,887
Sources emphasized as is often the case with intelligent that it's not definitive and should not be care

204
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,239
Nice caveat then there's this line

205
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,591
Sources point to the structure of the virus and saying the genome mapping

206
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,663
Specifically shows it was not genetically alter

207
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
Most of this article it's actually read run

208
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,063
Counter to most of Alex's beliefs and rhetoric surrounding the Coronavirus

209
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,135
All that matches the perception that the headline promotes

210
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
Which is really all Alex trades in anyway

211
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,047
All the stuff you saying In that clip is based on his Fox news story but he's pretending

212
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,655
It's an AP article about them getting documents proven the virus came out of the Wuhan lab

213
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
Who is covering it up

214
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
Simply put that's a lie

215
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,847
Exact reality of Genesis the viruses that's a big will learn in the future

216
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,919
And the evidence that Alex has currently doesn't prove anything

217
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
He's with a rambling a-rollin

218
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
He's full of s***

219
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,599
We get to get to move along here and

220
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
You know

221
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,207
We got a I was just going to make sure that no one blames

222
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:23,583
That's right you really think a lot of people infected everybody should blame the guy who's at fault

223
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
Well you got it

224
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,703
So here's the thing if you're not going to blame Trump

225
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,103
So Alex is insisting that in order to

226
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Must make sure

227
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
That we blame the UN

228
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
Predicted about a month ago

229
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,527
Hearing White House come out and say

230
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Okay

231
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
Come out of the lab

232
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Is going to come out and said yeah

233
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
You gave it to us

234
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Really

235
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
By saying what you saying

236
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
But you and Kyra.

237
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
They're the ones that are guilty

238
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
But you must blame them

239
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Warwick China

240
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
Wow

241
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
What

242
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
That sucks

243
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Alright

244
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
Okay

245
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:27,583
You're all right I'm going to I'm going to say that I'm I'm altering our shelter in place order to

246
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
If you want to shelter in place

247
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,215
Annovera right-wing conservative

248
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,615
I don't know no no no no.

249
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
I don't know if I've ever heard someone say we need to take care of X for once and for all

250
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
Not men

251
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
Kill these do you need to take care of it once and for all means

252
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
Bringing up the

253
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,631
Rich the little bit higher that that's taken care of it

254
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:06,495
You have like a pretty consistent going on this

255
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,543
That is like we're already at War

256
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Regina

257
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
I don't think there is a

258
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Good outcome

259
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
To that sort of

260
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
It's

261
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
Seems like

262
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
Should

263
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
The people in charge

264
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,415
Country start picking up on this thread

265
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,535
We find ourselves in a not good geopolitical situation

266
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,863
Yeah and I can't help this is what Alex

267
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,167
Like it it seems like

268
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
He's the only person who's

269
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
Not only saying

270
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,615
We got to say we are already at War

271
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,735
Seems like he's pretty into it I mean can you imagine

272
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
If

273
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Came out and

274
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
And said that this was a Chinese biome

275
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
And it was released in the United

276
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:03,327
I can't believe he would do that I could believe that he would be like and I guess

277
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,679
Like this is insane I can sadly

278
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
See

279
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:13,567
Something in one of his like weird briefing

280
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,871
But what I can't see is like what happens after

281
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
I have no idea what would happen

282
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
Now it's Kushner is Stephen Miller just send him like an Infowars article and he's like well obviously this is true

283
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,903
We are already at war with China and I didn't know about it

284
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,487
Obviously I need to tell the American people that we are at War

285
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,559
And I'm sure that everybody would take that fine

286
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,751
So if we get to Alex talking about How likely am for this

287
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
Coronavirus covid-19

288
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,663
And it's really just because they want to give you a vaccine for the common cold

289
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
Or something

290
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
It again is

291
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
This is weird

292
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
But what's really funny about this

293
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Is that Alex Goes

294
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
He talks to people at the grocery store about

295
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,743
The vaccine for the common cold right like him

296
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
Newsreel bio-weapon

297
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,351
It is a real novel manufactured virus

298
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,167
Shows that the multinationals can

299
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
Vaccine for the common cold

300
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,663
Cold

301
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
Comical

302
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
Just stores

303
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,511
Well because there's so many thousands of mutations.

304
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,447
Well then how do they have one for this

305
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,007
This is ridiculous

306
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
I love it when

307
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,967
Like you just has all these random NPCs and is that they talk back to him in his own dialogue

308
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:01,087
Crazy checking me out obviously we were all still sitting in a hot tub

309
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
The same three globalist from several years ago he was even at the store could buy any other

310
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
Multiple stores

311
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:19,007
Have a cold

312
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
Not one of them said

313
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
I don't

314
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
Caravan go away

315
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Yep

316
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
So

317
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,991
You know it in terms of

318
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
This whole thing

319
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,855
He's just saying that you know if you have the cold

320
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
You have any coal

321
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:39,487
And you die then your counted as a covid-19 death

322
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,559
And you relates this to other

323
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,655
Revisionist medical history let's say

324
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,775
Use what I would describe as maybe the worst citation I've ever heard

325
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,079
For medical information okay

326
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,407
A heart attack diabetes

327
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
Dying

328
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Covid-19

329
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
They have

330
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
Cold virus in them

331
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
People

332
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,399
Getaround have any one time

333
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,943
Claim you had the HIV virus that's what did it

334
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
A little kid

335
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Stop knowing

336
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:44,767
You're an adult now but in the medical community and you should be able to work for the government

337
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Really

338
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
CIA

339
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,295
My dad did dental work

340
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
But

341
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,279
You're still a little kid saying that like it's ridiculous

342
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
So here's the situation I say

343
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,751
I see him working on a CIA guys.

344
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,591
Hey so I heard something about HIV that it was

345
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
Collection of Iris and then he's

346
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,223
Play confirmed it

347
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:42,623
Okay I guess that's true then I think I'm going to share that with my son who is 9

348
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
Make sure he knows the

349
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
So here it this is

350
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,511
Really important

351
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,119
This is such a good example of why Alex Jones is a pile of s*** and no one to take

352
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
Seriously

353
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,447
With or without looking into anything he says

354
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
Here he's making the claim that runs counter to pretty much

355
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,079
All well-accepted documented history

356
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:06,687
That HIV is actually a group of diseases that the man just cooked up

357
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
To cause a public health

358
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,271
It's pretty stupid for a number of reasons

359
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,647
41 beeves HIV epidemic was basically ignored for years by the government health age

360
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:22,048
If you did something at all the effect of gay people so they didn't really care this is not the response you expect from

361
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,144
Federal government if they had cooked up the disease to cause a public panic

362
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Make sense

363
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
Even beyond that they never did rollout in HIV vaccine so that's supposed goal that I

364
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,640
I was imagining they had for this plan was never achieved

365
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
Which seems weird

366
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,760
If the problem reaction solution thing is true

367
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:48,160
The globalist cause problems in order to be able to provide a solution to the reaction the problem causes in the

368
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Public

369
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,024
When you think they wouldn't introduce a problem they didn't have a solution to

370
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:58,912
This is kind of a big question mark and Alex is dumb Theory which he's too stupid even realizes there

371
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
Now passed all that stuff

372
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
This is the point that I want to make

373
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
How to make a claim that requires Evan

374
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,664
It's not something that you call Common Sense or widely accepted reality

375
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
Normally when a competent person would want to make a

376
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,296
The claim like that their evidence would be a study or body of literature

377
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,392
Possibly even just some highly credible person in the field whose work you could

378
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
Alex don't do that

379
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:27,072
What do you make this claim he tosses it off as definitive because his dad told him so as a child

380
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
That's a load of s***

381
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,960
And no one was trying to do a good job would ever think that was good enough

382
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:40,128
It also tells me that Alex has never looked into this issue at all because if he had he would have a better Citation for his conspiracy then

383
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:45,248
My super-cool CIA dentist father said so when I was a kid so it must be true

384
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,808
Even if that's where this information came from

385
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
If it were real

386
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,184
He could make this story sound like something an adult might say

387
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,744
Appealing to other actual sources

388
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:00,864
But he doesn't do that because he's bad at this

389
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
My dad says so

390
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,312
Yeah let's see I'm trying to think of all the things my dad said that didn't turn out to be true

391
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
That I that I don't

392
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,176
Still believe just because my dad said maybe you should you never as much fun

393
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,224
Credibility is this ding dong

394
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,624
He did say that jerking off will send you to hell and right now that is inconclusive for me so it's possible that would make

395
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,024
Maybe where is still out sometime before

396
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,400
Yeah I just stuff like that

397
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
Sucking dick

398
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,776
Supportive really like I really get frustrated by is

399
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,104
I don't give a s*** if his dad told him this when he was a kid like I don't think

400
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,408
Good or bad things about that

401
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
But the fact

402
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,016
That's his reference means he has nothing else

403
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
It's not because

404
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,832
That's the worst

405
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:59,232
Dad was a CIA dentist you don't need to look into things your dad says it's obviously I'll turn these in the jumper

406
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,816
Maybe flight beat that lease purchase Jason

407
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
So anyway

408
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
No

409
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Globalist

410
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:12,544
Need to be taken care of once in awhile you need to wear a mask

411
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
And you should be wearing a mask

412
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
Not doing that because of any kind of

413
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,176
Concerns Republic

414
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
They're doing that

415
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
Because

416
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,248
They want to fight

417
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Trump

418
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,576
Was trying to open the economy or something

419
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:29,440
So again still fairly repetitive but there's new little wrinkles like

420
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,024
Anger at masks that are popping up so there's that

421
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,376
Rollout and all of it is a scary and I hope so notice right

422
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
Economy

423
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Democrats

424
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,128
Leave your house

425
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
2

426
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Michigan

427
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
California

428
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,768
We have that from State Police in California

429
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,752
These State Police people in California actually went to Alex's dad for some dental work

430
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,800
That's how we learn we learn this stuff

431
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
CI

432
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,128
I don't

433
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
I don't know I don't have much of a thought about

434
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,200
Any of this other than just like

435
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,480
Alex

436
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,528
Enjoy

437
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
It's silly

438
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
It's silly that it's

439
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
Reactionary stupidity

440
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
Just on it like

441
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:39,072
I'm so sick of the Liberals being correct about the coronavirus killing people that I'm willing

442
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
To get people killed

443
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:47,520
That's it cuz they were on board with everybody like 2 or 3 weeks ago and it's like

444
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,360
But it feels like it was itching In Their Skin just

445
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Like I don't like a

446
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:58,528
Green with the left I just don't wear jewelry with the left we got to do something there's some of that and then there's also some

447
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,832
It runs through it that's like

448
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:07,232
Everybody was saying these really high numbers and then now it's only in

449
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:13,632
And like the United States

450
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
Hey like you just playing this counterfactual game it's like

451
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:21,824
Yes those estimates were if we didn't do the things we're doing now

452
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,664
Announce refuses to accept any of that stuff and it's all the

453
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,712
Baba baba

454
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,760
Talked about this a million times like if

455
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,296
The actions you take work

456
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,344
People are going to pretend that there was

457
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,744
There's no problem in the first place exactly to keep from learning a lesson and the fascinating thing is I

458
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,840
I do recall a number of times people in public health position

459
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,144
Coming out and saying things like

460
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,752
The ultimate goal is to look like we overreacted like crazy at the end

461
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,568
The goal is to make it look like we didn't

462
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,360
Need to do all that stuff

463
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
Because that will mean

464
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,432
That we have made

465
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,760
This display out as smoothly as possible

466
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:05,344
And unfortunately even if you prepare people with that

467
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,904
Expectation like the goal is to look like we

468
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
F****** overreacting

469
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
It's still dumb

470
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,768
It doesn't matter it's be able to be used

471
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,096
There wasn't a problem to begin with Ryan

472
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,424
But the thing about overreacting like that and the thing that makes

473
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
Makes me so Furious

474
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
When people make that

475
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Dumb argument

476
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Like the numbers are

477
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,104
Is by overreacting as hard as we possibly can

478
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,664
We are going to save lives

479
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
That's

480
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:37,088
And if we overact solahart that would maybe that's two or three extra people who

481
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,136
Didn't need to die don't die

482
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Like it's that

483
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,744
That kind of situation in because so many people have died there willing

484
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
To just take it as like

485
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
A good s***

486
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
I feel like I might of

487
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,664
Anon Twitter

488
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
What an idiot

489
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Well

490
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,552
Bruno's right the right will believe it

491
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,624
TV personality over an expert no matter what

492
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
Yep

493
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
That's why we have our president

494
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:19,328
So Alex sediment last club that the virus is a hoax please play A Real Fine Line on it

495
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,120
Because he's not saying that it's all fake

496
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,448
But you know everything surrounding it is ratified

497
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,032
He has to make it very crystal clear

498
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
But this is real

499
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,152
People dying from this virus

500
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
Cold every year it is

501
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,272
If you look at the grass compared to other viruses

502
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
Very weak

503
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
Communicable

504
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,976
Think we're all bad we're all involved in the Hysteria

505
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,024
The new way of life

506
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
Which is a technocracy

507
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
So it's all souped up

508
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,912
Today at meeting with Sterling

509
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:01,568
It's souped-up located they gave it some Noss

510
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:08,992
Hold on to that idea compared to other viruses it's not really that bad because later the epi

511
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
Episode he's going

512
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,552
To follow this thread

513
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:18,208
And he's comparing it to the bubonic plague

514
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,792
Damn that was an issue for that

515
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
Plague outbreak

516
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,656
History

517
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,264
Not that bad I mean it turns out when you're only medicine is

518
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,664
Sense of smell and being like this doesn't this smells like plague

519
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,968
I'ma put on this mask with oils

520
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Dislike

521
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:47,136
When you want to play a game where you compare this situation to smallpox

522
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:52,256
The plague

523
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
I don't know what point you're trying to

524
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,632
It's not as bad as malaria

525
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,448
That killed everybody right

526
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,032
You will try a little bit later

527
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
He's got to get mad

528
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,104
Bill Gates

529
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,896
This weekend instead

530
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,016
Yeah 700,000 people that bad side effects

531
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,952
You divide that into 7:07

532
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:32,960
So this is something that I was just taken from a highly and absurdly edited video of an interview Bill Gates

533
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,752
CNBC back on April 9th

534
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,312
This is crucially important to understand

535
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,200
I want to sing a Bill Gates came out that 700,000 people would get bad side effects

536
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,528
Strawberry covid-19 vaccine

537
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
A cover-up in text

538
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Tens of Millions

539
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,672
Here's the actual clip from that interview that Alex is talking about

540
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,952
The Epic

541
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Huge challenge

542
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
Isn't that it

543
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
Most benefit

544
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
Younger people not

545
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,752
Spreading

546
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
The racks

547
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
Community-based

548
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Asus the elderly

549
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
Here

550
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,944
We clearly need it backs

551
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
That works

552
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Rage rain

553
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
Because there

554
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
Most

555
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
At risk.

556
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
And

557
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Doing that

558
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
A Apso

559
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,696
Older people and yet

560
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
You don't have

561
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
We have

562
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
1 + 10

563
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
10000

564
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,352
Side effects

565
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
Way more

566
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
Thousand

567
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,008
People who will suffer

568
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
So

569
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
Really understanding the

570
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
Sapien

571
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
Chantix

572
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,896
Scale across all Lanes

573
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Pregnant male female

574
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
Undernourished

575
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,808
IJustine comorbidities

576
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,112
It's very very hard and that

577
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,904
I'm okay let's go and

578
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Give this back

579
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
To the entire world

580
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
Government

581
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Be involved

582
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
There will be

583
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
Some

584
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
Riskin and demna

585
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,632
Needed

586
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
Before that can

587
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
Be decided on

588
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,544
Contacts it's very clear that Bill Gates has talked about the challenges

589
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,872
The cam was trying to produce an effective vaccine

590
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:20,736
The numbers that you chose was just arbitrary to describe the situation

591
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
Is not good

592
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,344
So what you have there is describing like this is

593
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,672
In terms of a large-scale rollout or something like that

594
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,744
Typically when people discuss challenges in the process

595
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,584
They are so just secretly indicate that they want to fail

596
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,448
Generally adults discussing difficulties in a process are doing so in order to

597
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,264
To give people a better understanding of what goes on in the work

598
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,824
And what considerations experts are trying to balance

599
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,176
Alex's either unable or unwilling to recognize surrounding context

600
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,224
Because that's surrounded context

601
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,784
Hertz the false narratives that he's trying to push

602
00:32:55,552 --> 00:33:01,440
That's the entire game that's being played here and that's why if you go and find the video of this that he uses

603
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
It's like

604
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,280
Little tiny Cuts with Bill Gates

605
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
Same like

606
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,144
Vex the flu vaccine is not effective in elderly people

607
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Okay hold on

608
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:17,568
To kill the elderly

609
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,616
Really it's really gross yeah

610
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,920
So anyways

611
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,944
It switches

612
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Florida

613
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
Always

614
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Why not

615
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
This is great

616
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
Is one of my favorites

617
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
So last week

618
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Alex Warren

619
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,744
He was going to reveal qanon

620
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
He did not

621
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,816
No and it made me very mad

622
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,168
In the meantime he started

623
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,984
Talking to some qanon people and maybe

624
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,568
Sounding a lot like you and on the way

625
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,152
In the sex club Alex might as well be doing qanon

626
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Cosplay

627
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,248
Waiting for an Awakening

628
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,344
But they need to have courage

629
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,464
Okay traitors in our government

630
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
They had us wear them

631
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,608
But we're resting all these people

632
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
They're going to get tried

633
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
Okay we're open for business again

634
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,800
Another war with China going to shut off economic operations with him

635
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,384
They want to watch other pilot Akron have to have a war with him

636
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,944
Because we're already there

637
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,760
Moving into invade Taiwan right now they've announced it

638
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,320
They're already wanted by would tackle the Deep state

639
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,648
The lab

640
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
I told you

641
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,256
Lacitycollege

642
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,048
I Know The Enemy folks

643
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Another operation

644
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
Okay

645
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:49,216
The entire conception of the qanon world isn't there Patriots fighting the Deep state

646
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
Inside secretly

647
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:55,104
Msq fellow information

648
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
College degree

649
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
Great Awakening

650
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:01,760
So that the masses of enlightened people wouldn't be freaked out when the storm came

651
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,344
And Trump arrests all his deep State enemies

652
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
Stan Wright

653
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
Secret indictments

654
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,928
Alex and saying

655
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
Patriots

656
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,768
Who are fighting the Deep State need people like Alex

657
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
To disseminate this information

658
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,912
So the public won't freak out when Trump comes out and says I've arrested all the

659
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
Chinese secret agent

660
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,592
Flavor of the same cake

661
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:31,200
This is so laughable that Alex is so mad at you and all but seems to be

662
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,016
Completely playing the same game

663
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,552
What you're right

664
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,344
Also make no mistake about that

665
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,672
The only function of rhetoric like this

666
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,488
Sister preparing audience to accept an authoritarian ruler

667
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,144
All it does is recontextualizing power grabs Empower consolidation as the dear leader striking back against the evil

668
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
Who work in the shadows

669
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,216
So you come to love

670
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Your new Ken

671
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:01,408
You know we're being trained to Not freak out when the executive of the federal government does things look a whole lot like the things

672
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,200
The Dictator

673
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
It's not something you would have expected Alex

674
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,552
Did you get to Butler

675
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,600
You know what I want

676
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Is I want to

677
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Demonizes

678
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
Certain section of the Publix

679
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,464
Specifically based on

680
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
Geography or race

681
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
In order to

682
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
Consolidate power and

683
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,840
That's never gone bad

684
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
I can't think of any situation

685
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,520
Qanon cosplay

686
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
Pure and simple

687
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,152
Only keeps it up because another big thing about the qanon mythology

688
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,176
Is Secret

689
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,480
All these secrets

690
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,784
A lie I'll explain that game 2

691
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
Quietly resting

692
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,864
Hundred hundreds of secret arrest

693
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,936
The Trump is doing against these Chinese communist

694
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
Whatever

695
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,776
That could not be more I'm not bragging

696
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
And then he brag

697
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,848
Yeah I'm not an authoritarian

698
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:14,112
So Alex is thrilled the Trump is secretly resting all these people and he's wearing his little cute hat and that's fun

699
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,928
Is not saying

700
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,208
To kill people

701
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
He needs to be very clear about this cuz it sounds like

702
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,560
The Logical extension of

703
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
Lot of things that he says

704
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Should be like a go kill something

705
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
But he is not

706
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
Saying that

707
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,984
You think Trump should go kill people

708
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Good

709
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
Kill anybody

710
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
Trump and the Pentagon

711
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
You know that

712
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,368
China's going to move into Taiwan before

713
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,440
The end-of-the-year probably sooner

714
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,144
I thought you said that they already

715
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,216
Moving into Taiwan

716
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,568
Yeah so Trump got to kill all the Chinese sub and whatever

717
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,408
Yeah I can't think of any situation where a leader of a cup

718
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,688
Of a country

719
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
Creating

720
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,760
What are essentially going to be death-squad

721
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,576
Preferably with black water is involved

722
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,976
Sure I can't say a surgery is already volunteered

723
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,864
In the past the globalist have done

724
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
Things

725
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,984
They're 10 years behind

726
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,800
They've done things

727
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,080
It gets worse

728
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,640
Sure whatever they do gets worse

729
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:46,528
Everything just keeps escalating to the point we're at now where they've released a bioweapon dates to get all over the world

730
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
To secretly murder people

731
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Problem

732
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
What's after this

733
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
That is

734
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,744
This is worse than anything before

735
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
Right

736
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
Got to get worse

737
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
Walgreens McGee larger

738
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
You can say it's over for Humanity

739
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,176
Congress shouldn't be in session in the buildings

740
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,480
Should never be in d.c.

741
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,064
You're in a total war

742
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,976
The President should be moving around moving around

743
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:33,376
Permanent Air Force One Flight they can always be refueled in the in air and he just flies around the

744
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
Baby I do everything

745
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:45,152
Alex love so much

746
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,552
See this being like a situation that I like what Alex would like is like Trump is just a dictator from a bunker so much

747
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,624
Highly-technical safe bunker

748
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
Bouncy that's the best thing to do but

749
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:03,328
Cuz even if Trump dies you can just say that he's images of a hologram of a something

750
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:09,728
Start the unlock Dell Technologies

751
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,312
Tend to see leaves on forever it is secret immortality

752
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,128
Bunker

753
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,408
Steele's detect

754
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,200
Technology from the technocrats

755
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:23,808
That they already has her upload your brain into a computer

756
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:30,208
And that way he will always control thing but we know for him to use it and bad for them but we know that they do

757
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,512
Don't actually have that technology it's a trick

758
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,840
Right just want to kill you and tell you that

759
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
But secretly they

760
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
Do you have that

761
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,704
Technology they only say they don't have that

762
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,264
Technology in order to do what they want to do witches killed

763
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,664
Navigate to combine all of our world our world

764
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Spaghetti

765
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,248
Tell me the Getty Museum

766
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,296
Now everything

767
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,600
Everything comes full circle

768
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
Alright whatever

769
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,464
So anyway we moving around the country

770
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,048
Just got a lot of things he's got to do them right

771
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
Sharax.

772
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
Alex

773
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,960
Thanks but there's some certain thing if he doesn't do right

774
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
She's going to hit the fan

775
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:21,408
You better be ready with guns and ammo if the president doesn't make the Right Moves and we go into a Civil War the globalist one

776
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,016
You got to be ready with the Patriot Governors and others

777
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:36,768
There's a war going on

778
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:41,632
Collaborator moron sabotage

779
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,056
You're stupid right now

780
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,783
F*****

781
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,463
Good China

782
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:12,607
Mattress your guns absolutely and let me tell you something funny

783
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Jesus

784
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:20,543
That wasn't even like a Segway into an l

785
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
Thought of this

786
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,199
There's no other explanation for that is embedded

787
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,247
What is so deeply

788
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,063
Inexorable from his is content

789
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
Bucked up

790
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:37,695
Also I love the idea of original styles pavor

791
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,535
Like Coke Classic

792
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,095
Charles Manson just decided to sell food

793
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:51,007
I feel like we're being the very similar position

794
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,335
You claim to his payment processors

795
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,919
Do not allow him to accept credit cards anymore

796
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,223
Percent of checks or something

797
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,527
Wonderful I hope it's

798
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:08,927
I requested that we do an episode about that but I went to his archives and I don't know what episode

799
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,743
The most recent episode of David Horowitz

800
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:19,167
Sorry I will check in on him eventually but I'm not sitting through multiple episodes

801
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,983
Although is how much was bacon Studio might have had to

802
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,311
Well there's a lot of episode there's almost

803
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,175
So Alex gets back

804
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,991
Into yeah I was just some ads to go out

805
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,527
Who comes back

806
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,575
Gets down to business on some

807
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,599
Virus news

808
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
This is dumb

809
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,415
We told you that

810
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,511
P2015

811
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,815
Transferred the weapons to them

812
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
Mira

813
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,935
Hold

814
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Virus

815
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,727
Kylie

816
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Edible

817
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,799
With a nanotech game

818
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
Function

819
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,127
Viral miniaturization technology

820
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,991
Words words words words words

821
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
Somebody could be

822
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,807
Mutated rapidly

823
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
By the Tricom

824
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
Sure

825
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
Died

826
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Navarro bloom

827
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Would that be fed to

828
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Fed the dog

829
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
The Creator

830
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,055
Zoological transfer

831
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,127
Hard-to-get species

832
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,407
With the new virus

833
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:42,879
I need a citation off because that doesn't

834
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:47,487
I think Alex just read a headline about a recent preliminary study the theorized

835
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:51,071
The dogs might have been an intermediary species between humans and bats

836
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,631
In the chain of the virus but honestly that study

837
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,959
Has been roundly rejected by scientist to have looked at it and said the

838
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
The data editor

839
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,263
Does not support the king

840
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
Conclusion

841
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
Is being offered

842
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,871
You know I looked into it too and

843
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,175
The virus did look exactly like

844
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,711
A lion with

845
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,759
Dragon wings and a tail of a score

846
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,063
So I think he might be right on the

847
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,879
Possible I'm just saying that there's a possibility

848
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:21,535
So the thing that he's talking about about the bats being fed to pigs showing

849
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:25,119
That's from a Daily Mail article about some research

850
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:34,079
So like there is then fed the dogs

851
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,151
This is the Genesis of the coronavirus is not

852
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,967
You can't available information doesn't

853
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
Sport that but

854
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
It the way you present to get makes

855
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
It sound like a child

856
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,903
He's doing is taking little disparate pieces of things

857
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,439
That aren't connected and then connect

858
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
Yeah

859
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
If we had

860
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,047
If we had a spider that

861
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,839
Write some pig

862
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,911
Are they wouldn't feed it to a piglet

863
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,959
That's just they would they would we would never have the

864
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,495
Probably

865
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,079
Is trying to really really stab Lachey

866
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,639
His credibility he's trying to go over like

867
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:13,247
We've been right about all this stuff over old headlines

868
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,551
Like really demonstrate

869
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:20,159
January 31st coronavirus contained Hy-Vee inserts and stuffing fears

870
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,999
Artificially created by 11 infowars.com zerohedge

871
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791
University

872
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,423
University Gold

873
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,703
Boldy

874
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,847
China watch it on purpose

875
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,175
I was just making that stuff about the Indian University having

876
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:47,295
Funding threatened if they didn't retract a preliminary unpure reviewed study about the Coronavirus

877
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:53,695
This is just what he needs to believe because he can't possibly build the narratives that he's building if he has to concede that the research behind that

878
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,279
I didn't stand up to the scrutiny of other researchers

879
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:03,935
He can't deal with reality and keep his narrative so we have to make up his own story to explain why the study was retracted

880
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
But doesn't threaten the fiction

881
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,519
But he needs to use to sell this s***

882
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:12,895
Recently though is this claim that India is now saying the China release the virus on purpose

883
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,431
That's not true

884
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,247
However there is something real Alex is lying

885
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:24,415
Embarked remember the Indian Parliament named Manish tewari was posting around on social media

886
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,951
Release the virus asthma attack

887
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,791
This is disgusting an article in the South China Morning Post

888
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,583
About how India was seeing an uptick in

889
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,655
Conspiracy theory around the virus with bunch of a drifting into some

890
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
Fairly racist territory

891
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,775
If that was the case with tiwari's comments I'm not sure

892
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,567
But the larger picture of the missing

893
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,919
Information landscape in India was one of direct xenophobia and bigotry

894
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,223
I'm going to need a better reference

895
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,295
Send that but is out doesn't provide any so as a stand

896
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,111
Seems like as just another thing of Alex's fabricating

897
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
Because he's a liar

898
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,695
Yeah that does seem like a thing that Modi

899
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
Might think

900
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,815
Like in the same way that I'm sure buzza.

901
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
Who is

902
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
Actively trying to

903
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,679
To kill people

904
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
It's totally on

905
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
On that tip Maybe

906
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
But I don't see any

907
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,127
Announcements from the Indian government

908
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,431
Seems like it might be a little bit of a misrepresentation

909
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,711
Can or exaggeration

910
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,247
Norlyda

911
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,319
Like being so accurate

912
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,343
Even though he's

913
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,135
Not really but

914
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,463
I like being actually like this I don't like this

915
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
Me neither man

916
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
Yes

917
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,591
Have to go up against these people have the Democrat Party

918
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Yes early

919
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,015
Trying to put me in prison by the scenes

920
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
They're not

921
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:01,183
And yeah I do think you'd want that everything about every everything I know about Alex

922
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,719
Believe

923
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,535
A war with something

924
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
Inconstant

925
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:12,703
Play like whether it's our own government or China you'll take whatever it is whatever manifestation of

926
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,543
Apple communist

927
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:20,127
Around in the Cold War make it hot

928
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,663
It's just Who You Are

929
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
This is the world you exist in

930
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:26,015
Well you would have said Megan hot if there was a Republican

931
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,319
He wants a big war

932
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,367
Trumpkin just essentially

933
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,159
What better way than War

934
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
With China to be like

935
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:39,839
I'm president for a while we're doing this thing and then we'll see what was in office

936
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,887
Cold War

937
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,679
Decided to attack Soviet Union

938
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,959
Directly

939
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,775
Yeah I think you would make peace with the

940
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,823
Paradise

941
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Yeah

942
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
Anyway

943
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,711
There's some Misfortune in the Infowars world

944
00:49:56,223 --> 00:50:00,319
And that is that one of the staff members Davis sister right

945
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,879
And her sister won't talk to them anymore

946
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:11,839
Good everybody works at Fox News shut up I assumed I assume there's more to the story

947
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,423
And I think he's making stuff up about this

948
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,703
This

949
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:23,359
Oh to be a family member who is exiled

950
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,895
Communicated a family member

951
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,479
Senior

952
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:32,063
This is Rob do

953
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,087
Walnut

954
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
Talk to him

955
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,647
Because he works here now

956
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,999
She hope she she paying

957
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:44,095
Worship CD

958
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,423
That sounds right

959
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
I remember

960
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:55,615
I think the beginning of this falling out because of the Boston Bomber

961
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
Because

962
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,271
Rob you lying about her brother or her husband

963
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,855
I don't know if it was just like from then on they hasn't talked

964
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,391
But I remember

965
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,439
It being a single they want

966
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,255
Turn Rob's phone call

967
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,351
Maybe they patch that relationship up. She was like

968
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:22,751
Hey now you work for a guy who's actively murdering people in Rob do is like

969
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:27,359
I know you want to

970
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:32,991
I would assume that Alex getting on air and saying that she worshipped

971
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,087
Probably not going to help the relationship to help him patch

972
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:43,743
Probably not I wonder if I'm being too hasty in my assumption that it's Rob do but I don't

973
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:47,327
18 years under the counter around a long time

974
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
Maybe there's a

975
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
Cameraman

976
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,191
I can't imagine

977
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,727
The turnover is hi there

978
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:58,847
Has probably been there that long I feel like he's been around for as long as

979
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:03,199
He's been our long-time user news director Alex have a sister

980
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,783
Yeah well

981
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:13,695
Is an adopted sister who I know he refers to Asbury and adoptive

982
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,255
She should not talk to him

983
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,399
Alex has

984
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,775
Felix about the director-general of the World Health Organization

985
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,823
And they're not good feeling

986
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
Is bad feeling

987
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
Weird that smart

988
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,687
The truth

989
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:39,807
AP report

990
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,975
New

991
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,863
The World Health Organization

992
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,887
Admitted

993
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,543
Bombings on Christian churches

994
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
Blow your charges up

995
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,527
The World Health Organization has plenty of room for criticism

996
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:15,903
And I think when we have the gift of hindsight it would be processed things were done

997
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:21,023
Find places where there's room for improvement on how International response in regards

998
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,303
Do International crises

999
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:27,679
The documents Alex's referring to have nothing to do with the World Health Organization

1000
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,959
Cover-up of the virus

1001
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:34,847
And this is honestly just the latest in the Trump quotes desperate attempt to divert attention from their dear leaders failing

1002
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,175
To handle the situation responsibly back when I could have made a huge difference

1003
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:45,343
I'm not particularly interested in this at this point however when there's more information in a clear picture I'm open to revisiting

1004
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,159
The World Health Organization response

1005
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
Stick fashion

1006
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,975
For now all the stuff I can find it

1007
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Like this

1008
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
Goes this direction

1009
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,327
Is this clearly partisan attacks being used

1010
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Defend Trump

1011
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,631
From well-deserved criticize

1012
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,423
The thing I think about what

1013
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,471
Anytime I

1014
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,335
Is this was such an opportunity

1015
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
4p

1016
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:12,479
Like this was such an opportunity if I president had come out and been like

1017
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,063
We know everybody's f***** up so here's what we're going to do we're going

1018
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:22,463
Suspend all of this s*** and we're giving AIDS Iran giving a to all these people

1019
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:27,071
Finally think we're not the shitbag that have blown them up for the past

1020
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:33,471
20 years or whatever he's the sanction making it harder for them to

1021
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:40,895
And then just be like hey will go bullfight Wars later there'll be a time for bickering and not mad

1022
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,943
It would have been

1023
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,783
Incredible how much events better than Al ship

1024
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,063
That's too bad

1025
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:52,159
So the leader or the head of the World Health Organization

1026
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,207
It was a part of the cabinet

1027
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:54,975
In Ethiopia

1028
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,511
Is the Minister of Foreign Affairs

1029
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,071
Previous to his position of the World Health Organization

1030
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:02,655
He was in an Administration run by the eprdf

1031
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:07,263
Or the Ethiopians people Ethiopian people's revolutionary Democratic front

1032
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,359
This is a coalition of four different parties and is actually dissolved in

1033
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,127
In 2019

1034
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:19,039
Regardless it should be noted that the eprdf rose to power in Ethiopia in the early 90s and you know house

1035
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
They Rose to power

1036
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:26,975
The people's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia which was the communist-run state as it existed at the time was over

1037
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,743
Throne

1038
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:34,655
Because there were a coalition of four different parties it's kind of challenging to nail down the exact character of the eprdf

1039
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,935
But it's a little reductive

1040
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
Just call them

1041
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,287
I know that's how Alex would see them so whatever

1042
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:45,407
It's not really worth arguing but it doesn't deserve pointing out that this is an elementary level understanding

1043
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,711
The politics is it go on in other countries

1044
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:53,599
Whatever atrocities might have taken place during the Ethiopian Civil War the Eritrean War of Independence

1045
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,903
It's pretty well accepted that I large

1046
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,951
Number of them were carried out by the existing

1047
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,975
Ethiopian government

1048
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,535
The eprdf were against

1049
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:05,375
It's not to minimize any of the things to do happen during Wars

1050
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,399
But I don't

1051
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,191
The tewodros was involved in in

1052
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,727
Bobbing any churches

1053
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:13,823
You know the the old quote is the tree of Liberty needs to be watered with Anna

1054
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,871
Authoritarian military coup every

1055
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:24,063
I need Alex to demonstrate his clients anyway seeing is in the late 80s and early 90s Tedros wasn't

1056
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,831
College

1057
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
Insurgent

1058
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,231
He's never going to have any consequence

1059
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
For them

1060
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
Whatever

1061
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:34,815
Nope

1062
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:40,191
I think we'll be bad if he follows through with it

1063
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:46,335
I don't know I don't know how anyone is going to stop

1064
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,639
I wish that would be so great

1065
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,991
Playing along with this

1066
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,231
For the people to be ready

1067
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,607
Amazing Drone footage

1068
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,655
Dot-com

1069
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
Lockdown

1070
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263
Projazz

1071
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,847
So I mean I feel like this is just sort of a logical conclusion of

1072
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,919
The anti-vax mindset

1073
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:26,015
We're going to have mass demonstrations

1074
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,855
It's unsafe to do so

1075
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:33,951
I am your personifying fret in a way that's like

1076
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,791
Really just a danger to everybody

1077
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:41,119
Stupid

1078
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
From Bill Gates

1079
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
This is like

1080
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:46,239
Young people getting the vaccine is going to help

1081
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,007
Keep old

1082
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,383
From getting it is less effective in the same way we're right here where it's like

1083
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:59,039
If you guys just stop doing dumb s*** you're going to be better for the world and now you're doing this dumb s*** then you're going

1084
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:04,159
Also like because of the reality of how dangerous

1085
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,999
Mass Gatherings can be during this time

1086
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,815
Like what you doing things like this

1087
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:14,143
Only makes it more likely that you will see

1088
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,703
The authoritarian Crackdown

1089
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,263
The Optics of it that you are

1090
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,055
Prophesying and so afraid of

1091
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,127
It's just it's a self-perpetuating

1092
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,687
Problem reaction

1093
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:31,295
Solutions

1094
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,831

Particularly Ted Roos at the World Health Organization

Mid-level or whatever the world director-general nevermind

1099
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,703

Globalist openly trying to block now we are

Direction

1104
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,783
Will not open until the UN says so

1105
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
Bio weapon released

Trying to get the Chinese into the country

1107
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,711
Bio weapon

1108
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,095
Alex

1109
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
Is for regime-change

1110
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:54,751
Get that man a plane right now get that man a plane so he can take care of this problem for

1111
00:59:55,007 --> 01:00:01,151
Thank you if we got a one-man Army really disappoint

1112
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
Cleaning 80s action movie

1113
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:11,135
Alex Jones First Blood Alex's sickness goes over to China tries to overthrow the

1114
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,183
Communist Party

1115
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,255
Is -2 thick

1116
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,607
Lodges in that neck

1117
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,887
Juggernaut there's nothing

1118
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,263
Respect

1119
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,799
A guy who has the balls

1120
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,359
Come on air and be like

1121
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:35,967
Golden saber shows

1122
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,551
Alex

1123
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,343
He comes back and realizes like

1124
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,135
Really into

1125
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,671
Discovering the news this episode

1126
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,487
I've been so into covering a news

1127
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,535
That there's news I haven't gotten to

1128
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,351
And this is frustrating for him

1129
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,423
Play Spit

1130
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,239
Get into something that he's not been able to get into

1131
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,287
Because it's been so busy with the

1132
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:07,199
Ladies and gentlemen we are back live and I have been so hot and heavy on the news the news which I'll cover my comeback

1133
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:19,743
Reviewers and severi semiotic messenger

1134
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:24,095
Live right here off

1135
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,567
It was important

1136
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:38,431
Either that really offensive

1137
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:42,271
Thought you so off guard plenty of plugin

1138
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,831
I was at this place the moment

1139
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
Said that I was like

1140
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,391
Either this entire segment

1141
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,695
Is going to be him rambling or this is an

1142
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:54,047
There's no other he says I need to get to the news

1143
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,071
That's the only

1144
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:55,839
Situation where

1145
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,959
They're back on sale

1146
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,751
There's a reason for this

1147
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,823
There's actually a revealed reason for why

1148
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,919
Shipping times were so high why they needed to stop

1149
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,455
Taking the waters

1150
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,271
And we'll get to that when we get to it but for now

1151
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,295
Alex is like

1152
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,831
Go to any this food

1153
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,111
And the reason is.

1154
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,159
It might be time to bug out

1155
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,743
We're going out I got the piece of property

1156
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,023
Forgotten already

1157
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:29,375
You know I knew was needed because I've been on so much on the offense I thought they were going to win this fight

1158
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,399
But

1159
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,799
I just can't be often during this

1160
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,175
Able to have the full shutdown economy happening Beyond

1161
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,711
Even our depression

1162
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,271
Family

1163
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
Bonkers

1164
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:02,655
So for the first time ever in the last few weeks he got got some property together I'll wait was this

1165
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,959
January 31st of this year

1166
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:05,983
Father

1167
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,055
The future

1168
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,871
Outside

1169
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,407
In 45 Acres with a

1170
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,199
Saving food

1171
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
I'm leaving empowered

1172
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,575
It's all just b*******

1173
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,879
He wants to

1174
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:23,647
Express

1175
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,671
What now

1176
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,975
Is the time that this is getting serious

1177
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:30,815
This is the time that I've had to make it

1178
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,631
Talked about all this time

1179
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:39,263
Either lying before or you're lying now in order to escalate the mood

1180
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
I'm not sure what it is

1181
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,335
But whatever it is

1182
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,359
Call Marco

1183
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,407
Some dishonest presentation

1184
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,199
Oh yeah

1185
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,991
I see an issue

1186
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,527
Right

1187
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,295
Okay

1188
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,831
If it's time to bug out

1189
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,903
Shipping times are 4 to 6

1190
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:59,231
Do you see an issue here

1191
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:06,911
Wake up wait about a month do you think he doesn't have a Dropship address

1192
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,287
That's probably for you Alex

1193
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:21,247
Total Civil War lawlessness total evil mutinous blockades of the West Indies dog run by

1194
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,863
Solar eclipse started really interesting to me because

1195
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:43,263
Middle of this plugged restorable dialysis drifting off into this whole thing about how he's gotten

1196
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,799
Going outside of town because

1197
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:48,895
That's just how serious things have gotten in the last few weeks

1198
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,199
Talk show host

1199
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,479
That's weird

1200
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,527
Constantly talks about how he's a general

1201
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:58,367
He's the first to hit the barbwire and they destroy him they destroy him

1202
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,439
Doesn't seem like it is in his nature to

1203
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:07,327
Be like hey you know sometimes it's time to evacuate I'm just a talk show host

1204
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,167
Counter to the entire ethos

1205
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,495
Valic suspect haven't you been listening

1206
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:20,895
He's it look Infowars is the butt of the spear Destiny Pub in the behind

1207
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,479
Branded the button every

1208
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,783
This is so stupid

1209
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,343
The whole like no retreat

1210
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,135
Up against the globalists

1211
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,671
Riverfront line

1212
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,207
The f*** are you doing

1213
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:38,303
It's not a retreat nothing is more Alex time to

1214
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,583
There's a real problem

1215
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:45,983
I have a doubt guys I'm at auction I mean billions of dollars off you all and I can afford

1216
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
Doubt you can

1217
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:47,775
Because

1218
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,055
I have your money

1219
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,615
Literally drink your milkshake

1220
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
As I was hearing

1221
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,687
Bulshit

1222
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,967
Another thought struck

1223
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,551
Alex hasn't been selling his ink on this episode

1224
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,599
What mention

1225
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:05,695
I wonder why you know what else not one mention of hydroxychloroquine

1226
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:08,767
Horsepaste that the health Ranger was pushing

1227
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
That's odd

1228
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,583
Probably a coincidence right

1229
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,983
I think so at the end of last week Alex got a very Stern warning letter from the FDA

1230
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,311
Telling him in no uncertain terms that the way he was marketing his product

1231
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,103
Was in a way that was close

1232
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,151
Intended to mitigate prevent

1233
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:31,551
Treat diagnose or cure covid-19 in people

1234
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
I don't lie it only took them

1235
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,111
Three weeks for them to

1236
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,647
Into one of our episodes

1237
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:41,535
This letter is very clear and it points out specific instances of Alex going past the line in a sales pitch

1238
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,583
Andy Gibson 48 hours

1239
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,887
To get in contact with him and describe quote

1240
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,679
The specific steps you've taken

1241
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,959
Correct these violation

1242
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:53,823
Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations

1243
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,383
As well as copies of related documentation

1244
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:01,503
Failure to immediately correct the violations cited in this letter may result in legal Act

1245
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,551
Including without limitation

1246
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
Seizure and injunction

1247
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,647
This letter is explicit

1248
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:11,231
Alex doesn't reach out to them and show how you correct

1249
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:14,047
The FDA my f*** around and sees his product

1250
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:19,679
Later in the letter they further say that failure to operate in line with the FTC Act

1251
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,775
May result in legal action seeking a federal district court injunction

1252
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:27,359
And an order may require that you pay back money to Costco

1253
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:33,759
The FDA can make Alex refund all of the sales of his silver product and possibly others

1254
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,807
He was found to be selling them inappropriately

1255
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,623
Wheatley destroy his business

1256
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,415
Hard now see

1257
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,975
If if they were if they were fun people

1258
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,255
Here's what would happen

1259
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,047
They would have sent this exact letter

1260
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,071
And then they were sent it

1261
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,863
Email with a r drop

1262
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,887
Saying it's time to pray

1263
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,215
Now that would have been gold that would be nice

1264
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,519
Maybe spiteful

1265
01:07:55,775 --> 01:08:01,919
So it's got to be a coincidence that he got that letter that he was gone from his show for 3 Days of the next week and then he comes back

1266
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:05,503
Mysteriously using promoting is medically dubious products

1267
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,783
Is yelling at everyone

1268
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,391
It's not yelling about the hydroxychloroquine being the greatest thing in the world anymore

1269
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,439
Weird

1270
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,719
And instead he's

1271
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:18,047
I would almost say angrily and petulant Lee threatened

1272
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,351
Going to start a war with another country

1273
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,911
Maybe because he's personally

1274
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,263
You know that's not totally out of character for him

1275
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,103
Screaming I would have Cody China and overthrow the government

1276
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,663
And hangs easy Pig might be a little bit

1277
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,455
Borax acid maybe a little

1278
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:41,855
I have no idea what's actually going on behind the scenes I just think that these coincidences seem a little sis

1279
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,391
Suspicious

1280
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,927
The timing of these things

1281
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:51,839
Right here Alex man sometimes you got to retreat just to talk show host I'm not going to be a general in this war

1282
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,119
8 / 0

1283
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,143
Against what

1284
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,167
He's been

1285
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,191
All about

1286
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,983
It really makes me think like

1287
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,263
He knows

1288
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
You've.

1289
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:04,127
I know that I've gotten that feeling on the number of times in the past

1290
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,151
It's not been

1291
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:11,551
Movie accurate or he's been able to Dukes of Hazzard his way out of there yet but like that to me seems like a guy who is

1292
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
Giving up

1293
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,855
It is hard to jump

1294
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
The General Lee over the

1295
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,927
A very big building

1296
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:19,743
Yeah and one of the things that makes me think

1297
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:22,815
They're like this is a little bit more sincere

1298
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,095
Then other time

1299
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
Is

1300
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
He comes back

1301
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
NFL

1302
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,191
You're talking about this stuff

1303
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,983
You seem to be like

1304
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,007
Completely

1305
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
Be freaking out

1306
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:37,919
Broadcasting world

1307
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:45,855
Country

1308
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,903
Rope watch adults

1309
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:02,495
South America

1310
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,223
Ashley more positive

1311
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,695
Nothing I'm doing

1312
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:28,095
People don't know the times they're living you better hope this is some new drama thing you're doing

1313
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,167
This is a dewdrop

1314
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,215
Look I'm going to leave

1315
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,007
And maybe I'll come back

1316
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:43,711
Because I'm a professional talk show there is no there's no fighting spirit in the country

1317
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,271
Translates to sales

1318
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:50,879
Pissed off about it so I could go away maybe I'll come back if you buy thing

1319
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,791
To exemplify the lack of fighting Spirit while you're

1320
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:04,191
There's no fighting spirit in America anymore so I am going to leave

1321
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:09,055
Concern

1322
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,847
About this like a fighting spirit

1323
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,639
He starts fake crying

1324
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,687
About how I stupid people aren't

1325
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
Now

1326
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,999
You look how childlike and stupid people are everywhere

1327
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,631
TV all day and they live in a fantasy land

1328
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,935
And ensure people are in a sleep study

1329
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:40,543
Not as over of a fake crying

1330
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,335
Cracking his voice there for sure

1331
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:49,759
Stupid people watching TV or stupid

1332
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:53,087
They have reflected light from the TV in their eyes

1333
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,111
I would suggest

1334
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:54,879
That

1335
01:11:55,135 --> 01:12:01,279
95% of the things Alex references are TV shows and movies

1336
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,327
I don't know

1337
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,119
So Alex

1338
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,423
Is that he's got a Play Special Report

1339
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,703
You might come back

1340
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
Might not

1341
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:14,591
Minot intros the Special Report even to go to is just so f******

1342
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:15,871
Three Little Pigs

1343
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,247
Play Guster radio

1344
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,671
Always Bagels

1345
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,231
Eschew

1346
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,255
No that's called

1347
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:41,727
Doing is marketing two different people than the ones who listen

1348
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,687
Go to watch

1349
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,991
Myvideos old boy

1350
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:57,855
Target Distortion issue it's like when you're listening to a comedy album and you can

1351
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:04,255
Can totally see that there's a visual bit because you can hear everybody start laughing and you don't know why Yahoo

1352
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,023
So you know that the

1353
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,047
The comedian did something

1354
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,839
There is an album

1355
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,399
That is entirely that that's what he's about to play

1356
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,703
More less yet but not an album

1357
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,495
It's just a dumb Special Report

1358
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:17,823
He wasn't gone for too long he does

1359
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,895
They're cool his head or whatever and then he comes back

1360
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:24,991
Of course he's coming back so he's got a kind of apologize for being a dick

1361
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:31,903
By the way our shelter back live is awesome

1362
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:40,351
Pray to God but you make me not be like this

1363
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,887
Yesterday

1364
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,167
Driving back from

1365
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:44,959
An emergency

1366
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,495
Terry Wright my family

1367
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,311
Talk to the FDA

1368
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,919
Add me on Facebook because

1369
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,599
Morning resigned ever been

1370
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,399
Wow

1371
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
Wow

1372
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:19,263
That's bad

1373
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:26,175
Does he realize or four years into getting our country back and we still haven't gotten our country back in

1374
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,991
Red Bank

1375
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:35,391
I would say that when someone's like I'm not afraid but also I'm going to go hide out on a redoubt

1376
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:41,791
It's getting conflicting messages

1377
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,351
Keyboard going to my armor

1378
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,167
Some people might do that side

1379
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,447
I would say

1380
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
Alex's

1381
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,287
Afraid

1382
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,591
Consequences

1383
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
Who's ever had to face

1384
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:58,431
Eastern

1385
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:00,991
And it does still have to go

1386
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,295
Court for various things

1387
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:07,135
He has various lawsuits that are all still pending

1388
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,183
Has the DUI situation

1389
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:11,999
As far as I know still not fully resolved

1390
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,047
What you got you got issues

1391
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,375
So I mean I will be angry about that too

1392
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,911
I don't think he wants

1393
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:19,935
Any of that too

1394
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,215
Come out on a hair

1395
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:21,983
No I doubt

1396
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:28,639
So that leaves him to have to get off here sometime come back and apologize

1397
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
Because he doesn't want

1398
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:32,223
Is essential staff to quit

1399
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:35,551
Where is where is the latter part of Scott stapp's Bhai

1400
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,111
Brim

1401
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,415
So Alex can't handle this on his own

1402
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,463
And so we get a return

1403
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,255
Very long time

1404
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,279
Is a steady hand

1405
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,607
My study of a boring as s***

1406
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
The hour

1407
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:57,055
Videos

1408
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,871
Uncle David

1409
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:04,223
Cannot serve I would like to get the word oxymoron sounds

1410
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:10,111
Only loaded with information and then

1411
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,647
Pissed

1412
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,695
That it's hard to even operate

1413
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:17,279
I love that I love that idea

1414
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,303
Alex is like

1415
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,607
Told David Knight

1416
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,655
To study less

1417
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,007
Will you study these things you're fully why do

1418
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,543
Bird

1419
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,567
I don't I don't

1420
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,103
I don't know

1421
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,383
What I would call that

1422
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,919
Call Beto y

1423
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,783
Most generous description I would save that

1424
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,111
Is a lack of focus yeah that could be a

1425
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,439
If you have prepared for hours

1426
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:48,511
Are fully ready to go make all your points

1427
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,583
And then you're unable to because you get mad

1428
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:55,167
That means your eyes are not on the prize in the game

1429
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,191
You need to get

1430
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
You need to get f***

1431
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,495
Lansing Iowa

1432
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,519
I've spent

1433
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:03,871
4 hours writing up that report for you I really thought it was a good idea

1434
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,407
And then I got so mad I lit Mike

1435
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,967
Computer on fire are you going to

1436
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,759
Do anything about that no consequences

1437
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,831
School

1438
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:16,671
He's boring as hell but

1439
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,975
Little things that he brings up a typo

1440
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,511
Strange

1441
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:26,911
And one of them is you talkin about that gentleman via professor at Harvard Charles Lieber who got arrested

1442
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:31,263
Lying about his involvement with the Chinese recruit

1443
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,287
Program

1444
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:36,895
And it's interesting I don't really care about a whole lot of the stuff the day of say

1445
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,175
But David

1446
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,223
Makes one claim and I

1447
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,247
I think it's super important

1448
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:44,831
Are they paid him a lot of money

1449
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,135
Been arrested for

1450
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,159
Espionage

1451
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:54,815
I don't care to get into the nitty-gritty details about the Charles Lieber situation since we touched on a previous episode and from everything

1452
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,095
I can tell it has nothing to do with

1453
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,375
The coronavirus situation

1454
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:02,751
I wanted to play that clip to demonstrate how everyone at Infowars plays fact games

1455
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,287
Weber was not arrested

1456
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,311
And charged with

1457
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:12,479
According to a press release from the Department of Justice he was quoted arrested this morning and charged by criminal complaint with one count of May

1458
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,783
Making a material materially false

1459
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,319
Fictitious in fraudulent

1460
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,087
Statement

1461
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,111
There's a difference

1462
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:21,951
It's an edge that dum-dums like Alex and David Knight like

1463
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,231
Play Both Sides up

1464
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:27,839
I can see this case I'm thinking the reason that Lieber made this false statement

1465
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,607
Investigators

1466
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,679
It's because he was doing something that he didn't want them to know about

1467
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,727
That's the most likely explanation

1468
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:36,031
It doesn't rise to the level of espionage

1469
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,591
And she was charged with

1470
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,127
Infowars

1471
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:43,199
Venus piano situation so they just say that it is

1472
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:46,015
Conversely consider the case of Rodger Stone

1473
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:49,343
Some of the things he was charged with were lying to investigators

1474
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:53,951
Obviously he was doing that to cover for something he didn't want them to know about but

1475
01:18:55,231 --> 01:19:01,375
That to be there situation there so in that case they pretended lying to investigators as a bulshit charge that's just how you

1476
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,911
Jam someone like Rodger up

1477
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,239
They wanted both ways because they don't operate in reality

1478
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,543
This is a purely narrative advancing

1479
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,823
Money-making operation

1480
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:15,199
And little things like that really show how it's just something that's in the DNA of houses business runs

1481
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:18,527
David Knight supposed to be too boring scholarly one around here

1482
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:23,135
And here he is lying about what Charles Lieber was arrested and charged with because

1483
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,671
It suits The Narrative better

1484
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,975
Yeah well

1485
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,279
Okay let's try this

1486
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,815
Is a bulshit charge

1487
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,351
In either Direct

1488
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:36,191
So they charged him with lying to investigators

1489
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,007
And that was because they couldn't

1490
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,055
Charging for Espionage they don't have enough

1491
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,079
It's for Espeon

1492
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,919
And they charged Rodger stone with it

1493
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,223
Because they don't have any evidence of anything

1494
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:54,623
Espionage

1495
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,903
We doing that

1496
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,951
All of this bike is just

1497
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,023
It's just trying to have cake and eat it as well

1498
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,303
As we say

1499
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:08,959
Another little tidbit of information that hasn't been brought into our sphere through Alex

1500
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,775
Yet so let's let him bring this up

1501
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,592
We just had an Israeli

1502
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,360
Former General

1503
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,640
How come out and say

1504
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
Report this today

1505
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,992
He said it doesn't matter what you do

1506
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,064
What are you go

1507
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,368
Draconian or you do nothing at all

1508
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,696
For about 4 days at 7

1509
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,464
40 days

1510
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,536
It doesn't matter

1511
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:43,776
Visible man named Isaac Ben-Israel who has recently come out

1512
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,824
And every country

1513
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,104
You can't just

1514
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,664
Define shutting down economies because it won't make a difference

1515
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:54,272
His comments and Analysis of received a whole lot of blowback ranging from

1516
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,832
You don't understand epidemiology to

1517
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:01,952
The localized data in places like New York and around Italy that seem to contradict your conclusion

1518
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:09,120
From what I can tell this perspective is not one that's widely respected by anyone in the medical community nor anyone in public health world so

1519
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,656
Perfect texture for Alex

1520
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,704
Two sites yeah my response

1521
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,544
Go fuc yourself

1522
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:17,824
Get the f*** out

1523
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,664
Him and viruses just it just for today is May what

1524
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,736
Kind of dumb s*** does that

1525
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:25,760
Viruses

1526
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,784
They know

1527
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:30,368
They've got 70 days if you need just know if you do nothing

1528
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:37,024
At 70 days that's how long virus is live for right now

1529
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,560
I don't know

1530
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:44,960
They were saying that the Democrats want you to wear masks because they want to fight back against Trump trying to open the economy

1531
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,728
Sure

1532
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:52,128
You know what masks are also another way that Alex can open up an economy

1533
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,456
We are already Rush Manufacturing

1534
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,504
Infowars.com Mass

1535
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:01,600
Also Rush manufacturing state covid-19 is

1536
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,744
Open I'm going to go to local stores

1537
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,768
Tucson time

1538
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,120
Ridiculous

1539
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,168
Subservient

1540
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:15,936
Okay bye

1541
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,216
Enjoy

1542
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,776
Enjoy those publicity stunt videos you

1543
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,824
Probably won't actually end up making

1544
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,360
I would assume

1545
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
Can I go to a store wearing

1546
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:29,504
Jaguar mask

1547
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,880
Although I will predict will follow through with covid is a hoax mask

1548
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,952
Which is kind of message

1549
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,000
Yeah he's jumping on the bag into

1550
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,792
He's jumping on the bandwagon

1551
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:43,840
Yeah

1552
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,144
We get to where Alex

1553
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,936
Brings up those other plagues

1554
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:51,008
In order to minimize the current Coronavirus

1555
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,800
The little weird

1556
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,152
35 million

1557
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,968
12 million

1558
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,552
Look up here

1559
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:07,136
5.6 million smallpox outbreak

1560
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,376
Destiny

1561
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,288
That one little area

1562
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,592
19 right here

1563
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,872
They got your whole universe

1564
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,152
Zoomed into this

1565
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,320
The whole universe

1566
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:44,000
Couple of thoughts first Alex

1567
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:48,096
I was going to say I thought that's what it was

1568
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,192
Also one reasons to focus more on the

1569
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,776
Current day situation then things that happened in the past is that

1570
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:59,360
What are the death toll is from the plague outbreak

1571
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,384
Edible

1572
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,920
Play way back when

1573
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,968
I really do anything about it

1574
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,504
This is something

1575
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,832
Minimize the amount of acid end up coming

1576
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:12,672
You can make it so it's never gets

1577
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:17,792
To the point where it's a plague of Justinian history

1578
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,584
For sure you know what I think it might be

1579
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,144
Is what if all of these plagues happen

1580
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,936
And there were millions of people.

1581
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,728
And then they were like

1582
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,776
What if we built an organization

1583
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,568
Specifically dedicated

1584
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,848
You keeping this from happening

1585
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:33,408
It's almost a really smart move

1586
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,736
To do that would be some sort of an organization for like health

1587
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:43,136
I think that would be a good place to start and then instead of millions of people.

1588
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,160
What is dumbest people in

1589
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,464
You don't have that

1590
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:49,792
Again Alex is semen to not recognize

1591
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,560
That like

1592
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,632
A lot of those things have helped create

1593
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,448
The medical state that we live in now

1594
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:59,008
Medical advances

1595
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,544
Necessity is the mother of invention

1596
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:06,176
Exact that kind of thing I ever let us to the place we are now in the Renaissance

1597
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,200
F****** do it

1598
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:11,808
Goforit Alex blinders on and all you see is this

1599
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,088
Well I mean yeah

1600
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:15,136
It is historically relevant

1601
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,416
Interesting to talk about

1602
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,464
Outbreaks of the past

1603
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,512
In terms of saying like

1604
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:24,096
That one was so big that's this one's not even that big a deal

1605
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:28,960
It's a dumb conversation I don't really even fully understand

1606
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,752
The point he's trying to make

1607
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:37,152
I have a difficult time figuring out what the next step of that is like the point is trying to make is when he's making

1608
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
By accident

1609
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,712
Which is people in the password dumb

1610
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,760
And people who are telling us not to get

1611
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,040
Another plague

1612
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:43,808
Carsmart

1613
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:44,832
And he doesn't like

1614
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:51,488
What is a conclusion you could come too

1615
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,792
So it's next clips really interesting

1616
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,328
David nights there right

1617
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,376
David Knight

1618
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,936
Brings up hydroxychloroquine

1619
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,984
Now and Alex throws a box

1620
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,288
The tissue that is bae

1621
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:09,920
This is really the only point in the episode where it comes up

1622
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688
An

1623
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:15,296
The thing I think is really interesting is I think Alex moves off the topic pretty quick

1624
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:19,392
Where is in the past I think you would have heard a bit more on the subject

1625
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,440
And then Alex start plugging

1626
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,232
Other products

1627
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,256
I just talked about

1628
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,536
Doctor

1629
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,304
Who stopped

1630
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,864
A nursing home from becoming another one of these hot

1631
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,704
Washington

1632
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,752
Hydroxychloroquine

1633
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:35,520
50 some odd

1634
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:48,832
4C

1635
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,464
We got to go to come back

1636
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,256
But I just want to chat list or something

1637
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,072
Why are you pushing supplements

1638
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:00,864
Wintersun

1639
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
Percent off

1640
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
Comedy

1641
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,448
.

1642
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,104
Closest

1643
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:11,872
Percent off

1644
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,432
He's probably sell that

1645
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,200
Good clean

1646
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,784
But usually really nice

1647
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,064
Any trouble

1648
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,368
See I feel like that

1649
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:24,160
Different there was no red

1650
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:30,816
What's the real feel like in the past when we heard

1651
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:33,888
Things like stories about hydroxychloroquine being

1652
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:37,216
Effective

1653
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:43,872
And that's just like quinine is in tonic water everybody got to drink tonic water that today

1654
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,152
Begin the military daggers

1655
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:47,456
It's like

1656
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,248
Something's changed

1657
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,832
The way that he's like let's go to plug other thing

1658
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
Yeah

1659
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,392
Different

1660
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,160
It's very obvious

1661
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,208
And Alex is back

1662
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,488
The plug

1663
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,792
And it turns out

1664
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,888
I believe it's in this clip but with the reality of what happened is

1665
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:09,472
That the people weren't able to take as many orders

1666
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,520
Because it was increased demand

1667
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:15,104
But Alex said and all these other ding-dongs at artificially created

1668
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:19,200
Increase demand in order to supply

1669
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,480
What they needed to

1670
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:24,064
My Patriot Supply open up of multiple other

1671
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,832
Package

1672
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:31,232
Who in the period when they were getting these up-and-running they weren't able to take as many orders

1673
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:34,048
Now they have these up up and operating

1674
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:37,376
So now they're back to like that for 26 weeks delivery went out

1675
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,704
All the other Distributors are lying do you have the biggest we have the bat

1676
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,240
Because the other places can't be proud

1677
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,824
Going to do

1678
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,152
Sales

1679
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,784
And they are actually ahead of schedule

1680
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,416
Admit your feelings if you orders we might be right on time

1681
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:04,256
A child

1682
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,048
46 weeks times 7

1683
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,352
People want to know this doesn't matter

1684
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:11,424
I talked to my boss he's got a really good deal for you told me

1685
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,496
I don't know about that but I talked to the boss

1686
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:17,824
I think you're going to be driving out of here in that.

1687
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,408
Is my friend this is such used car dealership shed

1688
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,200
I love it

1689
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:27,808
I love it he's talked about how they're so trustworthy and that's how Alex operates cuz

1690
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,088
The first thought I had was like

1691
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:33,184
Diamond gusset jeans that's why they always deliver

1692
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,256
Something for the home game gorilla

1693
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,792
Yeah

1694
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,096
Did the thing too is that

1695
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:44,704
I wonder if this is a good move on there but these better be temporary facilities

1696
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,568
Yeah because there will come a time when you will not need those extra Factory

1697
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,408
I don't know what their business plan is

1698
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,944
But that might be an overextend

1699
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,016
I would think that the one lesson that

1700
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,552
You should have learned by now.

1701
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,576
Is that bubble

1702
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,600
Mazar a bad

1703
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,416
I went to said that before

1704
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:07,488
Turns out this at the same time

1705
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:10,304
You should ride the bubble

1706
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:14,656
Keep these Assets in the form is like these extra Factory in when

1707
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:19,520
Supply-demand returns to

1708
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,824
So Alex

1709
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,128
Wants you to know that you got to get this food

1710
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,176
You got to get his yet

1711
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,200
I also

1712
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:27,968
They're hitting

1713
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:28,992
That are about to kill

1714
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,528
Wait what

1715
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,832
Infowars

1716
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,976
Corner very soon it's all about finances here

1717
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,792
They are going to start wiping the Patriots out

1718
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:46,144
You know I don't just say so for no reason

1719
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,704
Flights right now

1720
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,240
If you don't spread These Wings

1721
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,032
You're aiding the oven

1722
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,312
Wow

1723
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,616
Oh boy oh boy

1724
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,944
Aiding the enemy

1725
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,992
Who are these hit teams

1726
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:08,416
No they're just guys I don't have a secret agent Alex can't even remember that used to yell about antifa all the time

1727
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:14,304
If he hasn't been in the news for

1728
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,072
People are

1729
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:17,632
Forgot

1730
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:21,984
If you can't remember something that has he hasn't yelled about in a while

1731
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:28,640
Cuz if you were smart that's what he would do if he likes a Soros isn't trying

1732
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:32,992
Find a mix things up at rallies he needs or something

1733
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:39,392
Ready to take out the Patriots at a moment's notice because I want to bring it there or communism

1734
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,184
You know what you do you can't take that

1735
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:45,536
Fake contract they have to sign a bill really put a little you have to spread the virus

1736
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,864
Just edited in their fight might as well

1737
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:52,448
Exoduspoint has Francis Boyle come in

1738
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:54,240
And it's a 0

1739
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,288
It's a snooze of an interview

1740
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,568
They're quite pointless

1741
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:04,224
It's mostly just sort of treading water rehashing all the stuff that they've already talked about

1742
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:08,832
Almost the entire third hour of the show and like

1743
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:13,696
I got to buy minute 40 something as like I have not found anything interesting

1744
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,488
And anything that these dudes have been talk

1745
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:20,864
So we're not going to really play anything except for because

1746
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,656
Has been trying to downplay

1747
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,216
The severity of the virus

1748
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:28,032
Hey man it's not the

1749
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:31,104
It's cold it's still a bioweapon but it's just a cold

1750
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,176
Doubt the different Francis

1751
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,200
Is bringing to the table

1752
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,088
Republic

1753
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,648
The Last Resort

1754
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:47,744
Imperial assault or whatever they never got over here

1755
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,280
Is here

1756
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,288
Where we are right now

1757
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,360
He's being presented as like one of them

1758
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:06,688
Experts in the world on these sorts of issues

1759
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:10,528
Who presented the big expert

1760
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,344
15% of the United States population

1761
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,160
From this virus which is

1762
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:20,512
Very out of step with what Alex is

1763
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:27,424
Did he did he listen to Alex's show a month ago to prepare for this one was on it

1764
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:34,080
Yeah remember we were doing the show the Panic thing Alex come on

1765
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:38,944
I'm playing it now come on

1766
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:43,552
Canadian Winnipeg lab

1767
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,576
Remove the law

1768
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,856
So

1769
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,136
Introduces

1770
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,672
Difficult

1771
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,440
To figure out

1772
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:51,488
What the actual point is

1773
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,536
Yeah I mean

1774
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,072
These two completely

1775
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:59,168
Conflicting things being presented as coming from credible

1776
01:33:59,424 --> 01:33:59,936
That's Tuff

1777
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:01,472
But the important thing is

1778
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:02,240
Batman

1779
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,264
Well tell the truth

1780
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,568
I love you all everybody

1781
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,896
A different perspective

1782
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:13,504
Gallium

1783
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,088
You better get your firearm for self-defense of your storable food

1784
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,696
Great supplements

1785
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:29,120
The show with a little weird add pitch

1786
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:32,192
But they also did so weird

1787
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,032
I love you all girl being truthful

1788
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,848
We got different ideas but we're going the right direction

1789
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:41,664
You can't be all truthful

1790
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:44,480
That's how they that's how the right operate

1791
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,528
It doesn't matter what I say I'm

1792
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:47,296
I'm telling the truth

1793
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:50,880
Shorts in direct opposition to the guy I'm talking to

1794
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:52,416
I think he's telling the truth

1795
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:55,744
As well even though they're in direct opposition in

1796
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,816
It's very disoriented

1797
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:01,888
We reach the end of

1798
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,168
The April 16th

1799
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,192
Excursion

1800
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,264
It's interesting to have Alex back but it's also like

1801
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:11,616
I don't know how much longer this is going to go on

1802
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,152
I don't I don't

1803
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,688
C h w

1804
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,576
His Caboose is running out of steam

1805
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,880
Yeah you can only weasel your way out of Somme

1806
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:29,280
Yeah you would think if you don't want to the other things really frustrating weird out of its frustrating but like

1807
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,328
He goes away for a couple days

1808
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,352
From the show

1809
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,632
He comes back

1810
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:36,960
And he's still doing that same thing he was doing before

1811
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:39,520
Where you get so mad you can't do the shippo

1812
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,080
Like that you would think a couple days off.

1813
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:45,920
Maybe you come back at you still do

1814
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:46,944
Real bad sign

1815
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,784
And I don't know I very well could be making too much

1816
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,344
Out of that

1817
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,648
And those sorts of things but

1818
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,208
What the FDA is expecting of him

1819
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:59,488
Is not the same

1820
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:02,048
As a cease-and-desist letter from the New York

1821
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:02,816
Attorney General

1822
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,352
They're very different

1823
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:09,472
Expectations the very different things that can be done if Alex fails

1824
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,008
Comply with the process

1825
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,032
Like its

1826
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:16,128
Seizure without limitation is a very scary things

1827
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:19,712
To say refunds to all your customers

1828
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
Like it

1829
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,760
Very much

1830
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:22,528
Like

1831
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,064
It is

1832
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,112
Is existentially threatened

1833
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:28,416
If they follow through

1834
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:30,720
And if Alex doesn't comply

1835
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,024
Pink

1836
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,840
There might be more behind

1837
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,120
It this time

1838
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:39,168
In terms of my feelings that like

1839
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,448
Alex is preparing it

1840
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:46,848
I got this

1841
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,616
I'm the butt of the

1842
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:50,176
You guys go fight the war highlight lost

1843
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:56,320
Alarm for 1

1844
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,856
Just sounds like a guys like

1845
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,624
I'm done

1846
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,160
I did it I did what I could

1847
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,952
I prepared you not go

1848
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,744
I got my money now going to get out

1849
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,280
Yeah cuz if I keep going

1850
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,816
Exactly

1851
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,352
No it's the smartest

1852
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,632
This is Ben

1853
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,656
What how long

1854
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,960
Almost a year the smartest thing that he could

1855
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,728
Could do is stop

1856
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,752
Wow

1857
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,520
No

1858
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:21,152
The smartest thing you could have done is stopped a while ago

1859
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,224
Well the best thing you could have done is never started

1860
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:24,992
Right

1861
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:27,296
Tough

1862
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:31,392
I don't know I guess I maybe my new catch phrases I hate to make prediction

1863
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,928
Yeah because we're always

1864
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,744
Identify this pills

1865
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:36,768
Like

1866
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:37,536
A guy

1867
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:38,560
Start

1868
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:39,584
His way out the door

1869
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:47,264
For a bit

1870
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:50,848
How much longer can you keep going like everything keeps

1871
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,640
All this bad should keeps happening

1872
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,432
And we can't pretend that it's

1873
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,224
The globalist

1874
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,272
They're just a consequences of his actions

1875
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,320
Trump's ft I mean I guess you can call it the day

1876
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,720
Trump is definitely not very anything

1877
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:07,744
Apologies

1878
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,536
Yeah that's the other thing too

1879
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:12,608
If the FDA does follow through with this stuff

1880
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:16,192
Tough time convincing

1881
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,472
Stop.

1882
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:20,544
There is a there is a very simple text that

1883
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,592
To be sent

1884
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:26,688
Look all you had to do is whine on TV and you get your name on a check

1885
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:29,248
Man that operates he could win at the f

1886
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:31,040
Ba and they do whatever it was

1887
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:34,624
Yep so we'll see man I don't know I'm very interested

1888
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,416
See what happens

1889
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:38,208
Not from a Content perspective

1890
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:39,232
But just from a like

1891
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,256
Narrative art

1892
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:41,024
Perspective

1893
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,816
I'm going to be disappointed

1894
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:46,656
It'll probably end up being blip on the radar whatever but

1895
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,424
Who knows

1896
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,448
We'll find out

1897
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:51,264
I am a hero if we're going

1898
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,312
I think the new normal does not in

1899
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:55,104
Include Alex Jones today.

1900
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:55,872
I would help

1901
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,152
We'll see

1902
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,432
But until then

1903
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,736
Until we find out more

1904
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:07,136
We travel websites knowledge.com

1905
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:13,536
We are

1906
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:18,400
City of your choice

1907
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:21,984
The relative of Alex's employee who I'll talk to him anymore

1908
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,872
Alex

1909
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,920
I love your work
