00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

5
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge vype.com

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,888
Joan Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
Today well interesting Lee I found a copy of the

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,968
Assassin's Creed games

9
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,832
Nintendo guide pretty much most of my life

10
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
I never had the capability to play a lot of the early ones that weren't on Nintendo system

11
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,352
Like a Wii U

12
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
The Black Flag

13
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
That came out on

14
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
Nintendo systems I got recorded copy of the SEO

15
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:57,504
Assassin's Creed 2 and then to other one

16
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
Brotherhood

17
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
Stand

18
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,336
-1

19
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
I'm Blown Away

20
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
How good

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,248
Given given how old is he

22
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,392
Yeah yeah I remember watching my roommate Swearingen

23
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,208
And I'm not sure it was a do at that point

24
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,960
Really reasonably priced game in a series that I like but I wasn't sure I'm going to enjoy

25
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
And it turns out

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
It's just super fun

27
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,080
And you can run around in this Italian city

28
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
Blown away because the only reason that I played any of the other assassins

29
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,296
Creed games

30
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,648
American

31
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
All I care about

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
Credible what about you what are you with a lot of pent-up frustration

33
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
I recently because the world

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Your bright spot is

35
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
But I got to get all of it out

36
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:47,072
A very public Hobby

37
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,472
Frustration

38
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,312
Private conversation

39
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
A couple days ago Jordan literally said

40
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
Iran Twitter

41
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:10,112
Just regular

42
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
Maybe I'm over yesterday you forgot about your burning hatred for the man

43
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
Cell phone

44
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
Yeah

45
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,383
We need to get rid of Wacky Wednesday but not in the way you think

46
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
Alliteration of it and that's why we have that name

47
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,135
Focusing on the present

48
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,231
As much as we are now

49
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,559
I'm focusing on the present

50
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
Protracted situation going on

51
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
That he's lying about all sorts of stuff

52
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
That is relevant

53
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,615
Breakdown and constantly talk about

54
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
Mike.

55
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
Kind of

56
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015
I'm going to go to the Special Report I might be back

57
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:20,511
I realize that has my workflow in the way things go it doesn't make sense to have a Wednesday episode

58
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
It's dedicated to something

59
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,095
Kind of just like

60
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,495
Long stretches where we don't have anything other than Alex

61
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,543
Should be I don't think

62
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,615
I think mostly Alex Jones absolutely

63
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
Almost all Alex Jones

64
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
Sure

65
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,247
But if you go back to 3 episodes

66
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Kind of wood bees

67
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,623
In everyone's best interest to probably try to do something else

68
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
I just don't think Wednesday work

69
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
Very well for that

70
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
Monday works much better

71
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
And here's why

72
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,631
When we do our episodes

73
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,983
The come out on Friday we can have up to Thursday covered

74
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,823
From Alex to cover on Monday

75
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,175
L in Alert in a situation much better serve

76
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,503
Do something

77
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,063
Wednesday and Friday Alex

78
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,903
So I generally do that

79
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
Episode

80
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
Wake up

81
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
So

82
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,751
And this will be the beginning of something that might take a little while

83
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,383
Okay

84
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
Darnell thank you so much

85
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
I'm a policy wonk

86
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,975
Joseph

87
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
I'm a policy wonk

88
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:05,471
My Rhonda

89
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
Wendy

90
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,991
Thank you so much and I'll probably walk

91
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,599
Ewok

92
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,743
Donated on elevator

93
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Thank you so much

94
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,639
Money off that heroin

95
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
So good

96
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,247
Is freakishly large

97
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:06,143
If you would like to

98
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,191
Charity Terraria that's

99
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,543
Spoke to Ernie we would appreciate

100
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
So like I said today

101
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,199
We are going to do

102
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,831
And I almost everything blow up in my face and be able to do this

103
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:32,511
I think we've maybe given to Rosie as you of Bill Cooper

104
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,911
In the past Alex

105
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
In Jackson

106
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,263
Position with this guy who you looked up with

107
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,479
Because it's like hey Alex

108
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
Compared with material and who this guy

109
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,535
Little bit

110
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
I felt like there was stuff that was more fun

111
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,423
Hilarious

112
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
Absolutely that is a lot of fun

113
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,311
Tech support

114
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
Hilarious

115
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:24,735
Very good yes very good but ultimately that is not a fair picture of Bill Cooper

116
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
So I felt Lake

117
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,623
One of the things

118
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,695
Is get into the Oklahoma City bombing

119
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
And Bill Cooper's coverage of it

120
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
We are going to embark on a journey

121
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,167
I'm going over Bill Cooper

122
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
And how

123
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,519
Conspiracy theories about the Oklahoma City bombing developed

124
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Over the course of it

125
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
Today we're going to be listening to the hour of the time from April 19th

126
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
April 20th

127
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
First

128
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
And that we will see

129
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,671
How things went Patriot militia

130
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,055
And I wanted to you know make sure that we try

131
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,359
Respectful as possible

132
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,663
This was a gigantic tragedy

133
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Good so many people's lives

134
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
And you know

135
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,319
168 people lost their lives and

136
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
Are you just sort of

137
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,439
Umbrella that out to family and friends coworkers

138
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,255
The number of people who are traumatized

139
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
By the events of April 19th

140
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
AR

141
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
Jokes about

142
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:53,055
Disrespected people

143
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
And all that

144
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
So that's

145
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
My boilerplate

146
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Little bit

147
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:03,295
Dirigo where to start on the 19th

148
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,879
Broadcast on April 19th

149
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
His show is the evening

150
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
I'll get the night shift

151
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,535
So he's had plenty of time to gather his thoughts

152
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
About the bombing ad

153
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Here's what are you doing

154
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
You're listening to be our

155
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
William Cooper

156
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Today is the

157
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Second anniversary

158
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Call the Waco

159
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
I don't want anyone out there too

160
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Forget it

161
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Ever

162
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
A Thousand Years

163
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
For now I want to take you somewhere

164
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Patriots

165
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
Ideals of Liberty and freedom

166
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
To remember

167
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
Unfortunately

168
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Appears that someone is using

169
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Anniversary

170
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
To promote

171
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
An agenda

172
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
We will be

173
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,199
Pepper right now there's a vote coming up on the conference of states and Men

174
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Minnesota

175
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
That's the big news

176
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Important

177
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Perfect

178
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
Charcoal steak

179
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Resolution has

180
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Her

181
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Animal slaughterhouse

182
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Independence

183
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
April 9th

184
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,735
Mention the bombing

185
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:43,135
Have you completely sideline it to talk about something else entirely

186
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
With an agenda and it's

187
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,863
If my agenda it has the same agenda that I do

188
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:01,823
Here we have Bill warning in Minnesota about a conference of states

189
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,479
This is absolutely not a situation where it's a vote of the public

190
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
What essential problem is it doesn't ever give a bill number or name on this

191
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,559
When you just Google Minnesota and Conference Estates

192
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
Which basically men

193
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,727
Then I got to go to the Minnesota State Legislature

194
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
In Minnesota 1995

195
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,591
3265 total

196
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,663
And thanks to this exercise I learned some interesting things

197
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
That is an instance of me lying

198
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,039
This was not fun or interesting as passive exploration

199
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
Because you know what

200
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,671
All these legislative bodies do is allocate funds for projects

201
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Fixing roads

202
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,791
And slightly just about rules regarding things like building code

203
00:13:54,815 --> 00:14:00,959
In 1995 it seemed like it was a fair amount of bridge naming related business in the Minnesota Legislature

204
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,543
Lisa couple Bridges

205
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,591
One of them was about to have former

206
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,455
State Legislature person who the bridge is named after her

207
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
Shots, cross

208
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
12

209
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
Which is about the right

210
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
That is

211
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,423
The ditches

212
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
That part isn't interesting

213
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
But what it is

214
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
Is it had to do with a town called embarrassed

215
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,383
Alright

216
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,711
And they're proud of it God dammit

217
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,015
Consequences New Mexico

218
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
Embarrassed

219
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,463
Minnesota house or Senate in 1995

220
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
What bill is talking about is the idea of States calling for a constitutional convention

221
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Constitution

222
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:06,751
A Convention of states to ratify three-fourths of the states

223
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
This has never been done in the history of the country and no one really knows how it would play out Estates were to actually go down this road

224
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,015
Beer and rallying cry for folks on the extreme right four years depending on

225
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
You know what point they want to try and make

226
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,975
Super worried about the Liberals adding things to the Constitution

227
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,511
2000 time frame

228
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,839
How to be strongly pushing for these sorts of things as a way to

229
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
For the states to fight back against Barack Obama

230
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,775
Three-quarters of the states agreeing on f****** anything honorable man

231
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,103
They wouldn't even agree on abolishes slavery in 2020

232
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,175
It seems like it would become a political football

233
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,015
So the people can change or affect the Constitution are

234
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,111
Preoccupation of people with constitutionalist

235
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,439
Understand where this drive comes from

236
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
According to article

237
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,071
State legislators this process

238
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
Resolution

239
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,215
In 1995 only three resolutions passed the Minnesota house

240
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Or Senate

241
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,079
166 production

242
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:20,479
Another hs9 57 without the sale of the administration of power

243
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
Our services for the Western area of the state

244
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
HF 821

245
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
What about the funding for Amtrak

246
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
Interesting we've there was a big piece scaremongering

247
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
Legislators

248
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,679
In the April 1990 Schlafly report

249
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,983
Gray gray gray

250
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
What's going on

251
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,455
Alstyle Gathering of representatives from State legislatures

252
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
Call the conference of State

253
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
Which was twisted by conspiracy theorist into

254
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,879
Being a plan to Stage the Constitutional Convention

255
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:04,255
Is wasn't really strictly speaking true but folks like Schlafly and Bill Cooper were able to

256
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
The convention of people this is part of

257
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
Letter-writing campaigns are gone

258
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
Abandoned

259
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
We just wanted to get

260
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,711
Together at Schlafly Zone the f****** case that lady is crazy.

261
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,551
So the plan was absolutely right

262
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:33,439
Paradoxically was torpedoed in

263
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,047
Michael Levitt governor of Utah

264
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,607
The plan looks back on

265
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
Time

266
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:47,007
In the 1994 midterms

267
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
Control of all of Congress

268
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,639
A majority of State governorship many state legislators

269
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,527
After that

270
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:03,391
Any more government in Republican

271
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
They could try that approach

272
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Literally said himself

273
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,071
Legislative agenda unfolds

274
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
The conference of states

275
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Could see momentum had shifted

276
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
In a direction we approve.

277
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,983
Different anticipated

278
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,359
We recalibrated the conference of state's effort into a far less grandvision

279
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,943
And focus our energies on legislative proposals which returned

280
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
Control of the nation's welfare system

281
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
And Medicaid do state

282
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
Control

283
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,695
April 1995 Bill Cooper is fighting against a version of an idea

284
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
In any meaningful way

285
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:44,351
The people who are pushing for it as a last resort against Bill Clinton

286
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
So this move wasn't really important to them anymore

287
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
I can find no solid evidence that a resolution like

288
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,519
Just passed the Minnesota house in 1990s

289
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:56,383
But even if it was already

290
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:00,991
It was only really being kept Alive by conspiracy theorist

291
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,527
Of the destruction of the Constitution

292
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:08,927
Sure power in the federal government

293
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,583
110th Congress beginning 1007

294
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:20,959
Weird have a tea party popped up just a little bit

295
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:26,079
Power they try and subvert democracy and when they get power they try and

296
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
Democracy

297
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:32,479
I will likely use sweeping Groundswell Zozo

298
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:38,111
Playground

299
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
Spell

300
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,839
He's in Texas Minnesota people are doing

301
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,631
Alluka crisping

302
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,799
He spends the first like six minutes of the show

303
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:03,711
It's like hey we have big issues here man if you don't want to deal with what's going on

304
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:08,063
Want to deal with that

305
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
Which is

306
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
So weird

307
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
Forever one else

308
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Stop which course is Obama

309
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Morning

310
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Just after

311
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
Most of the

312
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Workers

313
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
Have entered the

314
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Federal office

315
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Building

316
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
Call the city

317
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
For their daily

318
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Routine

319
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
Explosion

320
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
Occur

321
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
Respectful

322
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
No one was

323
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
For this lady

324
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Gentleman

325
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
All those inside the building

326
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
Found himself presently

327
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,543
Calling tumbling

328
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
For the year

329
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
Them

330
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Or buried

331
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Tongue

332
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Debris

333
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
As usual

334
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Intelligence service

335
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
Available

336
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Time

337
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
Are you opine repack have not been read

338
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Reported in there

339
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Entirety

340
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
Anywhere else

341
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
In the world in

342
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,328
Including the major media in the United States

343
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
The meteor

344
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
In Oklahoma City

345
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,312
So you can see here this anti-media tendency

346
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,736
It doesn't know that the waybill is expressing these things

347
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:46,112
Just that he's intelligence-gathering team is far more competent story

348
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,720
Universal among people like Bill or Alex Jones

349
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,304
It's keeping them to invalidate all other sources of information on themselves

350
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,912
Particularly potentially contradict their version of reality

351
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,312
Your listeners who send you messages teligent service

352
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,640
Stranger sending unit

353
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Yesi this is

354
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
That's a little

355
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,696
Hoover's

356
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,744
And you got to separate those from the truth

357
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,072
You know we have our people on scene

358
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,376
Press passes in hand

359
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
And they have

360
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Report

361
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Email

362
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Relay

363
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:44,224
If you listen carefully ladies gentleman because rumors are always about

364
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,344
We have heard every rumor in every possible solution

365
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Come to this

366
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
What you were going to get now

367
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
So there's rumors

368
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,560
But this is not rumor

369
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
Yeah

370
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,888
Rumors lighter

371
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,936
Rumors

372
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Who knows

373
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,056
Email with something

374
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:16,736
There's one thing the bill takes particular issue actually complains about on the 20th

375
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
21st

376
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
Recording of death tools

377
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:27,488
He seems to like really be staking a claim on this here was like this is the proof

378
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,840
All the media lying or something okay

379
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,864
Very good I don't think

380
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Responsible

381
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Will news reports

382
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,728
DC

383
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
Completely

384
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Bass

385
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
And out of line

386
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Are you mad

387
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Beck the body count

388
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
Keep going up

389
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Bar

390
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,992
As actual on the scenes recording goes

391
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
4:30

392
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
P.m. this afternoon

393
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
Oklahoma time

394
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,416
Only 22

395
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
Confirmed are

396
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
17 of them children

397
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
From the daycare.

398
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,608
Washington web reporting 81g

399
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,632
But no one on the

400
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,680
Can confirm

401
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
Even approach

402
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
That number

403
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,592
I think the Bills playing understand

404
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
The point is

405
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,176
Exaggerating

406
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,784
Basically I think it might be more like

407
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,600
It's not that big a deal

408
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,952
People were maliciously lying about stuff

409
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,328
Maybe that would be bad but estimated

410
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:41,472
Possibly inaccurate in the at mediate aftermath of a giant

411
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:47,872
No he can really call someone

412
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
Call people

413
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
I'm going to call that

414
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,968
Worst

415
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
A mistake

416
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,040
Based on trying to report to

417
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:01,696
Mass casualty estimates ago roundabout

418
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:05,536
Which almost always end up being higher than the eventual concrete number

419
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,376
People throwing around numbers in the tens of thousands

420
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:15,776
About 911 on that day possible

421
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
This pollen

422
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:23,200
If you want to take preliminary estimates

423
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:30,112
The bombing of the Murrah building resulted in 168 deaths from what

424
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
ABC News

425
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
Actually High

426
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:37,024
Doesn't say we're his number of 22 dad comes from a based on how is reporting generally goes

427
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,608
Probably just something one of his listeners told in which event

428
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,400
Call intelligence service

429
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,752
An article from April 19th United Press International

430
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,312
An undetermined number of people

431
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,176
Dozens perhaps hundreds of people died in the blast

432
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
The governor's office put the

433
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,528
Confirm death toll at 26 late Wednesday

434
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,856
But the number was expected to rise as Rescuers searched the wreckage

435
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,256
It seemed article cozy then Governor Frank Keating saying that you'd heard as many as 40 people were dead

436
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Confirm

437
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,864
They also quote a doctor at one of the

438
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
The triage centers

439
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
Who told you

440
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,776
They found 80 people but only two were alive so they told us to go home

441
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
Could not be confirmed

442
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,480
Who's caviar

443
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
I don't know what precise reporting

444
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,600
It is the bill Cooper's not about in terms of death estimate

445
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:38,208
But it seems entirely likely to me that when he says Washington was reporting 81 dead

446
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,512
It has been media reports

447
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,400
Like things

448
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
Yeah

449
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:52,544
Your way this feels like a cheap way from to play games that's around the idea that he's more careful than other media

450
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
And that's more trustworthy

451
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,360
We just kind of dishonest

452
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:02,016
Anyone reporting on this story as it unfolded on April 19th but obviously know that it'll be impossible to have a concrete number fatality

453
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Quite a while

454
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:08,416
Leaving bills 22 number of confirmed deaths contradicts the upei recording of 26

455
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:15,072
When bill says 4:30 p.m. that makes me think he's talking about is a press conference that Bill Clinton

456
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
Reno held the brief reporters

457
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
On the status of

458
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,216
Because that was the time that they had that pressure

459
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:26,336
Andy's mention Washington in Washington

460
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,920
In this conference

461
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,576
Then Reno gets up and discusses the police response investigation

462
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,232
So discussion of suspects are methods of the attacker off-limits

463
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,816
Every no is taking questions this Exchange

464
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Funny statistic

465
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
We have

466
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
The casualties

467
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,496
But they are increasing every

468
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
What we are trying to

469
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Chores

470
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
If we pursue ever

471
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Elead

472
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
What we have been told is that

473
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
500

474
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,528
Assign in the building

475
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
Only 200

476
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
50 had been accounted

477
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Four before i k

478
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
There may be as many as

479
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
Is 100 to 200

480
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
More people

481
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
To account for

482
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
The casualties

483
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
He said yours are

484
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
100 victim

485
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,376
Six children

486
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,168
It works over in the daytime

487
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:23,936
Eyecare center

488
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,472
Have been confirmed as

489
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Is Dad

490
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
And

491
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
We are just

492
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
Pursuing Absol

493
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Play Every Lie

494
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:37,248
That was a statement from Washington at 4:30 p.m. on April 19th

495
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,624
Gennarino didn't say that 81 people were dead there's just an acknowledgment that the number is going up there

496
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:51,072
Image recognition

497
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,912
With the work of tracking down all the folks who could have been in the building adopting completed yet

498
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:00,288
Little credibility or Credence to our bill is reporting based on contemporary public reports

499
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
It really feels like he's creating a straw bad a bad recording

500
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
Compare himself to in order to

501
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
Self look like

502
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:13,088
Reporting reporting is willingness to say we don't know yet and that is

503
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
The right-wing propaganda

504
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,744
Whatever it is that they say is going to be

505
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,304
More than likely

506
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:28,960
Is reportaj close

507
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
Immediately

508
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
After

509
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,128
The shopping mall at Northwest

510
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
50th and

511
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
Evacuated

512
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,272
Houses a smaller office of

513
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
The Federal Bureau of Investigation

514
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
No mention was made of funeral

515
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
The areas in Moana

516
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
17 MI

517
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,952
Call Steve Oklahoma City

518
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
What

519
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
The office of the FBI which is

520
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
Located about four blocks

521
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
Door

522
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
Of one of our

523
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
Office

524
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:04,800
Information intersection of Northwest

525
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,848
Pennsylvania Avenue in Oklahoma City

526
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,688
What is the Penn Square Mall which is a mall like you might conceive of a shopping

527
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,272
It's indoors and it's home to stores like JCPenney at Dillard's

528
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,088
The other is a big office complex called

529
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,648
50 Penn place right across the street

530
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,280
In the aftermath of the bombing both because there are some FBI offices on the top

531
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
A couple floors

532
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,864
50 Penn place the office building

533
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
Shopping mall

534
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,680
This was done as a precaution

535
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:40,896
But the same person making that argument

536
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:46,016
Almost sounds like there's a shopping mall Orange Julius next

537
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
SPI substation

538
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
That's not the

539
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,464
Delicious

540
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,240
Norman

541
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,568
Terrorist attack

542
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
Be cautious

543
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:16,480
I can't find any confirmation that the FBI satellite office in Norman was

544
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
Evacuated or closed

545
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,904
I would guess that it was it was

546
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,952
Gigantic terrorist attack

547
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,512
Conspiracy Norman is like

548
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:34,400
25 minute drive away from Oklahoma City

549
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,728
Is your offer operating off an assumption that the target might

550
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,848
Someone attacking Federal authorities

551
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,664
You'd be putting lives at risk unnecessarily if you didn't

552
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
Cover your bases

553
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:51,040
I don't see anything weird about the things bill is pointing to as weird so far

554
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,856
And honestly this section of the show revealed something to me

555
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:58,720
I've already touched on a little bit

556
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:05,120
No one bill is reporting this stuff about there being a closure and Normandy said you're one of his intelligence

557
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,216
Already put

558
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,496
X

559
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,872
Or like a newspaper article

560
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,200
He's actually reading an email from one of his listeners

561
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:25,344
You speak some authoritative voice because he believes that every was in one of his listeners taoism is Intel

562
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,648
As opposed to just being possibly inaccurate gossip

563
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:32,000
Something that makes bills

564
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Harder to decipher

565
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
For me

566
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:38,656
When I'm listening to make a claim it sounds absurd should come from

567
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:44,544
Possibly

568
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,360
Operate

569
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,200
Mostly because Bill doesn't differentiate concrete reporting from listener emails

570
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
Explicitly

571
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
Which introduces confusion

572
00:32:54,016 --> 00:33:00,160
When UPI reported on the triage doctors claimed that there were 78 people

573
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
You know it's hasn't been

574
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,768
Confirm to the reader is the ability perspective

575
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
That have been interviewed

576
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,096
The same time understanding that this Pacific

577
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,376
Word verified

578
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
And should not be taken as such

579
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:16,288
Media Outlet operate in such a decision

580
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,616
Important aspects

581
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
About you know

582
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,944
Wow solid some information

583
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,736
I suspect the bill doesn't call out

584
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
Mostly listen our emails

585
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:33,440
Those are kind of exposed his journalistic Endeavor is more theater than journalism

586
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,720
It's Boris

587
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,280
To imagine that he has

588
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:43,680
Observe only four blocks away from the FBI office

589
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:49,056
Who is somebody always watching me

590
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
Now it's just some guy

591
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,920
Certainly

592
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,760
Get some more reports from Weird Al listeners

593
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,344
Tinker Air Force Base was put on emergency alert on for several hours

594
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,648
No one was admitted on her off the base

595
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,464
Later in the day make Personnel were allowed on the base

596
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
But everyone is

597
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,560
Kettering was subjected to a total identity

598
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Check in

599
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
Worker

600
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144
So what

601
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,192
I'm struggling here

602
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:22,592
Some people from Tinker Air Force Base assisted in search-and-rescue in the aftermath of the bombing

603
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
Fighter jet Pilots or Chabert

604
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,552
And one of the most important things on Fire Department

605
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,368
Security aftermath

606
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:40,768
Paris attack nothing suspicious I don't understand

607
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
Transportation is on the road

608
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,008
Complains that like females getting involved in the National Guard

609
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:57,408
The National Guard can be activated by the governor

610
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:02,528
Declaration of emergency

611
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,832
Being treated as an emergency prior to him

612
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
Articulating it

613
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:12,768
All of the agencies specifically to respond

614
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:21,728
902 ama9

615
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
Management was fully activated

616
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,408
Triggering of certain thing

617
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:34,016
You can call in FEMA and start coordinating with the federal assistance response

618
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,624
None of that stuff is suspicious at all it's exactly what you would think

619
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,024
It's very it's a job

620
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,888
Car is today Force Base

621
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,448
Substation in Norman

622
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,008
Might have been evacuated

623
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,208
Girls South and Walker from Northwest 23rd Street train

624
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Closer

625
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
But was turned

626
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
Certified by Garden Grove block

627
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
She tried

628
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
Entering the area of several

629
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,192
Possible back road

630
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Route

631
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,008
But there were simply

632
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,336
Too many police National Guard highway patrol sheriff

633
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
Japanese

634
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
To get anywhere near the

635
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
Express Pass

636
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
And credentials

637
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
And veritas

638
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
Alleyway in gravel

639
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,024
You tried to access

640
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
Was only Garden

641
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
Yield

642
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,352
The parameter

643
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
Polyp

644
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,496
Good

645
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,080
To get on the thing

646
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,944
Our people

647
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
Would have

648
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Empire

649
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,112
1

650
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Enteral

651
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
That person comes out again

652
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
We can talk

653
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
Gypsy reports

654
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,096
Or there's no coming

655
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
Taken out of the area

656
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
Let you

657
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
Access

658
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,520
To the emergency communications equipped

659
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
Pickles on

660
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:38,432
The Bell has actually possesses

661
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:45,088
I don't know what the standards are forgetting Universal press passes but it seems like

662
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
Shortwave radio

663
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,648
And the hosts zine

664
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
Might not make the cut

665
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:55,072
Seems like I don't know about that

666
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,104
Couldn't get into restricted areas

667
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,664
There's no need for bloggers assistance

668
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,480
Do we getting in the way alright I can see where you're coming

669
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:19,136
Aerial shots of the building

670
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
Continuous

671
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,488
It totally makes sense that the police and other groups are making a predator

672
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,536
Would do whatever they could to make sure there were just

673
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
Hundreds of reporters

674
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,888
Credibility wandering around

675
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:36,288
That's probably bad whenever you're investigating something

676
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:42,688
We just have to spend a minimum

677
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:53,952
Obviously cellphones were to the level that they are today back in 1995 there were cell phone

678
00:38:54,208 --> 00:39:00,352
This person who probably would be able to call Bill at any point

679
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:04,448
Are there wasn't just like normal lack of signal problem

680
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,312
People trying to make calls in the Bay Area

681
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,152
Jamming signals

682
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,808
Capabilities

683
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,624
Particularly for the area of downtown Oklahoma City

684
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:29,024
The problem of not getting a signal

685
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
And this work was completed by 2:15 p.m.

686
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:37,216
The overloading that was going on at the time between 2 and 11 a.m.

687
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,008
Southwestern Bell recorded over

688
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
12 million calls

689
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
Attempted in the city

690
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
Damn I'm sure there were some bands of frequency that were dedicated to emergency responders but that it really has no bearing

691
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,760
Turn on whether or not a guy Bill knows

692
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,832
Snuck into the Murrah building site would be able to call Bill

693
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
And then tell him what he saw

694
00:39:54,624 --> 00:40:00,768
That story does not make sense

695
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:07,168
Minecraft more conspiracy into the story than a straight-up reporter might

696
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,216
Person got in there

697
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
Sorry I would like

698
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:17,408
Cross-country trip Wuzzy was it snowing at the time was a skiing all the way over there or snows and glasses

699
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:22,528
Always about moving

700
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:27,392
Sowega

701
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
Only medical people

702
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Get through

703
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,256
The only other people being allowed through the roadblock for medical

704
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
Personnel

705
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
Quiet

706
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,376
Michael card no one else is being allowed into the area regardless of

707
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:43,008
The only other people are medical books

708
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:49,408
Are people who work for like utility companies like to shut off gas for the surrounding area in order

709
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
Explosion

710
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,368
All members of the local fans who were not on the scene within the first hour have been allowed in

711
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
The rumor spread

712
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,440
Birth of a son

713
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,232
Anthony third comfortable bra

714
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
The groomers

715
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Or not

716
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
True

717
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:13,216
How do you know everyone in the downtown area who did not have any medical fire or police

718
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,008
When was move back away

719
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
Federal Building

720
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
Area

721
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
Play Justin

722
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
Barb block

723
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:25,504
Reason for non-essential people to be allowed anywhere near that belt

724
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,600
It might be too much possibly to say absolutely no pressure

725
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:36,000
Circumstances that were going on where people were trapped in the rubble and search-and-rescue triage work was going onto the

726
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:43,168
It makes complete sense to really only letting a few members of the media

727
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
Please allow me in

728
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,984
Beat It

729
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,312
More than just medical personnel were allowed in

730
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,104
Like the letter good reasons bees hair

731
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,711
Bill's listener tried to get Emma guard wouldn't let them

732
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,295
The guard said something like the medical card you not getting

733
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,879
Richard translated to report medical cards are allowed in

734
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:12,095
Either way I really do appreciate the bills on the side of thing that's bomb scares that happened after the initial explosion were not real

735
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,911
I'm sure you can have a terrible take on this

736
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,751
But at least directly more Bob

737
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,287
Switches

738
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Oklahoma City

739
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
Conspiracy theorist

740
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:27,455
At 10:28 a.m. there's a rumor of a possible explosive in the building and everyone fell.

741
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:33,855
Obviously even if you think the odds are unlikely when there's a possibility of another bomb

742
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,207
The all-clear went out at 11:22 a.m.

743
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,047
At 1:30 p.m. Searchers found a suspicious crate

744
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,095
The building was once again evacuated

745
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,143
At 1:48 p.m.

746
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,703
The bomb squad showed up in determined

747
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:54,079
Explosives of the all-clear quicker this time in rescue efforts were back on track by 2:02 p.m.

748
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,943
It's just tragic and terrible two valuable time was lost in these rescue efforts but

749
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
Is almost unimaginable

750
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
If you have time the first

751
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,903
Responders of rescue teams of the building

752
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,207
Trying to help people then a second bomb goes off

753
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,743
The physical and psychological

754
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,535
Stagger

755
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,607
If I understand

756
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,959
Which she doesn't release Pow Wow but it definitely seems like there's a

757
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,287
Fake

758
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,919
I think they were faking the sunset there were actual bomb

759
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:35,807
The teams on the site didn't know whether they were real bombs or not operate under the assumption that they might be

760
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,599
You seem to believe

761
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:41,695
Set the bomb scares are fake in the sense that they were made up by the officials as a pretext

762
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,743
The former perimeter five blocks away from

763
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:51,423
Explicitly say that but it's a strong impression that I get when I was listening to

764
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
Yeah the weight on Uconnect

765
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:59,103
Certain ideas to each other makes you makes you look behind and you're like I don't think you are disagreeing with me the way that I

766
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,735
Remember

767
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,295
Get in ya

768
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,623
It seems to be from the tracking of thoughts

769
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,415
Baby it's related

770
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
I can't say what he says

771
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:19,583
Explicitly

772
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,631
A possible second bomb they're just like

773
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:26,751
Now my gut says this guy can only make one bomb let's just keep on going ignore that s***

774
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
Yeah

775
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,383
Show me there were some reports

776
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,223
Suspect tour of Middle Eastern heritage

777
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,015
9 a.m.

778
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,551
Kohl's credit

779
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,575
Bridge accident

780
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,855
Earlier reports

781
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,159
We're made of three possible suspects

782
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Honey Boo Boo

783
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,231
Tinted windows

784
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,047
2 of Middle Eastern appearance

785
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
25

00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Gmail

787
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,679
Noticed

788
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,007
Who supposedly was driving

789
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,871
Nothing was said about why they were tough

790
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
My question is

791
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,223
DeSoto are agents on the scene

792
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,271
For there is a large population

793
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,807
Middle Eastern Muslims

794
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
In Oklahoma City

795
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855

Community group

800
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,815
Unless the three men actually

801
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,583
Jordan something

802
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,423
I should have been nothing out of the ordinary about that present

803
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,239
Mini crotch individuals live and work in the

804
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,311
Especially in that part of downtown Oklahoma City

805
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,359
Houses so many off

806
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
Officer

807
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,663
Or Middle Eastern

808
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
Businesses

809
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,247
My name

810
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:51,231
Considering he's just throwing pictures up

811
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,767
Left and right true

812
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:58,143
Through

813
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,935
This episode you won't have a closet

814
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,215
Review of bells

815
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:06,335
Recognize

816
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,871
Explicit the fact that

817
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:23,487
Critique of why

818
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,559
First thing

819
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:32,959
But he doesn't do anything there should be no reason why they be considered halfway there

820
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,031
A someone in the world that bill is in and the Wii cover

821
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
Kind

822
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,591
Amazing

823
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,895
Play sitting in a certain way

824
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:44,735
Is it like not putting that second step together is like

825
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
But now that's stupid

826
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,463
There's a certain part of like it this is

827
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,511
This is bad investigation on your choir

828
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,071
Criticism

829
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
Maybe maybe not

830
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,239
I think you're assuming the motivation I'm not positive what it is

831
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:12,639
Oh you're saying I don't know

832
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,831
Giving me a very like

833
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,879
F*** is your deal vibe

834
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,975
We're going to find out a little bit about it

835
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,279
Builder

836
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,303
Okay good

837
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,655
He's just

838
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
Is a terrible job

839
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:40,799
This report from one of his intelligence

840
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,871
Sources to

841
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,175
Respond I got some rumors

842
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,503
Liquor going around

843
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
A rumor

844
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,087
Erroneous reports

845
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
And Jeffers

846
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,159
Speculations

847
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
They have been broadcast

848
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
Around the world

849
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
Today

850
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:04,095
These are some of the rumors

851
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
Speculations

852
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,935
I found it incredibly complex

853
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:14,335
Confusing at first because he's just done this far away is like the Base Air Force Base has heightened

854
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,127
Insecurities

855
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,991
Is he talking about those rumors

856
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,015
To say the rumors

857
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,087
I have to go back and listen to it a couple times

858
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
Are you saying

859
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,695
We reported before the Air Force Base

860
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:33,791
This is a substation is not rumor

861
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,119
To talk about it

862
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,167
Remember these are rumors

863
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
Calculator

864
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,895
A local television station in Oklahoma City received a call from

865
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
Unidentified

866
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
Mail

867
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711
Reportedly speaking

868
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
Who stated

869
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
Definition of Islam

870
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,599
Queen responsibility

871
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
For the bounty

872
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:05,279
I kind of wonder how much utility there isn't coming on a conspiracy paranoia theme broadcast industry

873
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:11,679
Heating random rumors about the Bahamas

874
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:16,799
Irresponsible

875
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:22,943
I just don't know what

876
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,735
Also housed Silly's

877
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,039
That caller

878
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,319
But he's willing to accept

879
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
His collars

880
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,879
Bulshit instantaneous

881
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,951
There's a couple of times or

882
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:48,799
Is reporting that this local station did receive this call of Islam

883
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,359
Nothing precise with his own reporting

884
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:58,271
This station in Oklahoma with KFOR and another anchor

885
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,063
It could be a prank call

886
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,671
They were not even reporting this is anything real themselves

887
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,719
For saying that on air

888
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:13,119
Even if even if he pointed out that it might be a crank call go f*** yourself bring anything to anybody

889
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:18,239
That's some pretty responsible stuff it's bills only point

890
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,263
Bring up sloppy work

891
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,359
I'll probably be on the very similar pages

892
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,919
Even this discussion of the

893
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,711
Report on KFOR

894
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:32,575
Isn't even downright crazy making the same mistake

895
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:36,927
From shortwave conspiracy theory

896
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:43,327
Hey I got to call the desire to refinance my mortgage and also

897
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,495
They're also other people repeating this

898
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,287
Another broadcast date

899
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,079
McCurdy former democratic

900
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Congressman

901
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
Promptly

902
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
Pokemon television

903
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,431
Same

Cynthia

905
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
Rumor

906
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,343
Dave McCurdy was a former Oklahoma congressman

907
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
2

908
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,719
Not to the Nation of Islam

909
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
Ubi reported on his comments

910
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:19,167
My first reaction was there could be a very real connection to some of the fundamentalist groups operate

911
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
Eating around the city

912
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,983
The former, Congressman said

913
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:28,639
He said a number of Muslim fundamentalist group some with links to Hamas it recently held a convention in the area

914
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:34,015
Begin Angie is not good at detail work

915
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:40,415
Not their Forte

916
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,719
Start to wonder if he does anything

917
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,255
You could just go get

918
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
The quote yourself

919
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,815
True know it's there

920
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,375
Yeah by the time he's doing this broadcast

921
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:55,775
He could just go look at that cut it out of the show

922
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,543
Difficult

923
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
Today

924
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,591
Yeah still do it

925
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
Well I mean

926
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,575
Here's another little bit of a rumor

927
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,599
Going around

928
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,623
Another report

929
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,671
Firefighter

930
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,719
Going through the rubble of the Federal Building

931
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
Discovered other

932
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,767
Explosive device

933
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
And plastic

934
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,607
Which have been allegedly

935
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
In the offices

936
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
Of the

938
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
Located in

939
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,471
The Federal Building

940
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,543
Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms

941
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,615
That particular

942
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,663
I like all of the others

943
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
Heard today

944
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,247
Was never

945
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
Reported

946
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:38,783
Again

947
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,855
We've also not heard it making

948
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,879
Further on the skin

949
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
True rumor

950
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
Or if it was true

951
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
Was quickly

952
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:56,447
The context of his list of rumors

953
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:06,175
And the last year explicitly debunking them and you make that very clear

954
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:11,295
It's unhealthy to shrugging Lee report rumors that entertain the possibility that maybe they're true

955
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:17,951
What do you operate like this the only real outcome that comes of it is the Dumber elements of an audience ignore the part where you say

956
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,255
The rumor is true

957
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:26,911
Anyone listening is probably already heard these rumors somewhere already so what's the value and repeating them

958
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:34,591
Just lazy as hell and it doesn't bring anything to the table

959
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
Can just be like

960
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:42,015
I'm pretty sure I remembered something about the 80s Haydn's

961
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:46,367
The rumor

962
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:54,047
Datapoint now or whatever they call it to find an explosive Parts in the rubble did not disappear

963
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,071
Where is Bella's

964
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
For quite a while

965
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:04,543
In September 1995 they released a statement saying that they were quote absolutely no explosives in their office

966
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,615
Could be mistaken

967
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
Explode

968
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,711
According to a 1996 article in the Washington

969
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,015
Supposed sighting

970
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,319
These items were not explosive

971
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:20,159
Design for training purposes but never complained

972
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,207
Explosive material

973
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:26,047
He said these types of items are used as exploitative prop

974
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,071
In court

975
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:36,543
And then you rip both sleeves off and he's like

976
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:43,455
In Timothy mcveigh's trial

977
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,271
Chief of the Oklahoma City Fire Department

978
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,367
A desk ornament from an ATF agent that was knocked into the stairwell

979
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,391
The Death Clock

980
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:56,767
Typical type of a bomb

981
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:03,167
Eddie was in the stairwell and people were really nervous at the time

982
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:09,567
That were mistaken for possible bombs and then reported by media Outlets that were

983
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,103
Get out any possible news

984
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:17,759
When you hear things like in the police scanner the report of a possible second device found

985
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,343
Know what all the details are and get the wrong impression

986
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
Here's the thing

987
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:29,791
Bill Cooper repeating a rumor about the ATF is not just a guy repeating a rumor for the sake of bringing erroneous

988
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:36,191
The audience's awareness history with the ATF

989
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:41,055
Set a repeating of a rumor about them having bombs in their office

990
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,895
I refuse to believe that bill wouldn't be aware of that

991
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,455
But he can pretend he's just discussing rumors but that's

992
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,759
Bulshit yeah

993
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:56,415
There's a rumor going around the entire world

994
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,439
Pizzas around

995
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,487
Saying that they're doing it

996
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,791
But if you don't hear about again this cuz they f***

997
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:08,191
So why one more little piece of rubber here before I start

998
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:12,287
Pay bill

999
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
They later

1000
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
Where you at

1001
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,407
Report

1002
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
Mission of Iraq

1003
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,991
Launcher being found in the debris

1004
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,527
Which was supposed to have

1005
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Also been

1006
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,623
And the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms office

1007
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,415
Report also

1008
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
Has never been

1009
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
Repeat it

1010
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,999
Substantiated

1011
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Or

1012
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:33,791
Gemini

1013
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:42,495
Bentonite

1014
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,031
Actually true

1015
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:50,431
Actually find a rocket launcher in the wreckage of the

1016
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:54,271
The building there's even a picture of it in the final action report about the bombing

1017
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:01,183
It sounds completely outlandish Serbia rocket launcher in the debris of a building but it's important to remember there are multiple different law enforcement

1018
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:06,815
Secret Service

1019
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:12,703
Some of the stuff that would end up being normal pile of debris

1020
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:17,823
Explain be normal reaction of birth

1021
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:24,991
He doesn't offer any explanation for why this find might not be as weird as it sounds

1022
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:29,087
You just repeated as gossip that may be true and is being covered up maybe

1023
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,879
Or maybe it's just that Intel

1024
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
It was true

1025
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,951
Weird

1026
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,511
It was reported in the AP the next day April 20th

1027
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
Yeah

1028
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,447
Care

1029
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:50,847
So this is where it

1030
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,735
The day of

1031
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,759
What do you expect

1032
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:01,087
This is where I was

1033
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
Yelp

1034
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,159

1036

If you want

1037
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
Your ass up

1038
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887

1045
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,039

Because God talks

1049

Oh my God

1050
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,207
Because I look into a crib

1051

Football

1052
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,279
Not because I'm in contact

1053
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,071
Retractable being

1054
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,607
Archana leaf

1055

Ascended masters

1056
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
Because I

1057
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
Study

1058
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,543
The last 25 years

1059
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,895
Listening to act like you can almost see Alex the Bill Cooper impression

1060
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:02,015
Know what the globalist magic powers because

1061
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,551
This is Alex's

1062
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,623
Down to the paranoia field sales paper

1063
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391

1064
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,463
He brings up his gold sponsor and then starts

1065
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,023
Already paranoid

1066
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:17,631
It doesn't even further into a deep paranoia about how it's going down

1067
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
Incidents of terrorism

1068
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,727
The power of

1069
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,751
The police state

1070
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
Will

Liberty

1074
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,503
Will disappear

1075
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,343
All Nations and all people will be different

1076
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,903
There are Russian

Supervising sure

1080
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
States of America

1081
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
And we have

1082
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,839
People in Russia

1083
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,863
Supervising

1084
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,143
Supposedly

1085
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:58,335
So Russian agents are disarming us and we're determined Russia or whatever there's you know terrorism going to ask

1086
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,615
Exponentially

1087
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,895
It's bad news

1088
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:07,551
Yeah but it gets worse this is going to affect you on the local level 2

1089
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:09,855
A moment

1090
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Chaos

1091
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047

1095
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,751
It will disappear

1096
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
From the supermarket

1097
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,335
The economy

1098
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127

1099
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,431
Those who have not

1100
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,455
Prepared

1101
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,271
Are going to find themselves

1102
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
Whoa

1103
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,135
Minnesota as well by Barris

1104
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,559
But they are real

1105
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,119
Screw warnings Macomb from my heart

1106
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,447
From a position

1107
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,751
Not racist

1108
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,311
Wiring for America

1109
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,151
So you're going to be

1110
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:10,015
Those who will not take charge either with the New World Order

1111
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
Country

1112
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,111
Will be the place over and

1113
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,159
The tides of War

1114
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,207
Will be at the mercy

1115
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,231
Observative

1116
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,047
I got to pause right there has really quick

1117
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,327
I would assume

1118
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,143
Should the Patriots win

1119
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:32,799
You shouldn't say that we're going to enslave

1120
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,879
That might be a little bit

1121
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,159
Can we picnic

1122
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,439
Well you're going to be

1123
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,559
One-goal

1124
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,583
Are silver coin

1125
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
Really

1126
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,959
No one during that. Of time was

1127
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,751
Paper money

1128
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
Why

1129
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,151
You are have something useful

1130
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,967
Are real money

1131
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,015
I need on a black market

1132
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,831
You will be home

1133
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,903
You will be hungry

1134
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,951
And you will be without shelter

1135
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,047
Bastille your house

1136
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:29,631
I suggest you call 1 800 tricks

1137
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,871
Gould's

1138
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:44,223
Masquerading as coverage of Oklahoma City bombing

1139
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,759
Make no mistake

1140
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,319
This is from the night of the bombing

1141
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:53,951
He's on here saying they'll be escalating terrorism local Anarchy shortages in a financial collapse

1142
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,535
If you and your family don't have gold or silver to barter with your f***

1143
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:03,167
This is as manipulative as pretty much anything I've ever heard from Alex and the sales pitches

1144
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:09,567
Different category

1145
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:12,639
That's something like that

1146
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,175
Clearly

1147
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,759
He's willing to let it sensationalism run wild in a time when his audiences

1148
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,551
Particularly confused and scared

1149
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,343
Trying to sell them gold

1150
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,671
We're just going to save them

1151
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:31,327
Gold sales operations

1152
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,351
Disclosure

1153
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,423
In a context like this

1154
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,727
What are you doing is abusive sale practice

1155
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,311
Every other movie you have

1156
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,103
Becomes very suspicious

1157
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,175
Sing Sing is as Alex BMX

1158
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:51,295
Will save your like this he's literally saying that gold will save your life

1159
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:54,111
Could save your life

1160
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:58,207
Unless you have at least one piece of gold

1161
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:58,975
And

1162
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,023
So kidnap a leprechaun

1163
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,375
I'm not I'm not like fully convinced

1164
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,935
That he doesn't also really loved gold

1165
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,703
Right

1166
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,471
But

1167
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,871
When you're in the middle of a plug for your gold sponsors

1168
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,343
Clearly Financial

1169
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,183
And I

1170
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,231
I just can't I can't allow it

1171
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:37,631
Yeah that's almost the FDA should send a letter gold can save your life

1172
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,191
Full on doctor's note

1173
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:40,959
Yeah

1174
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:47,103
Talking about how about every prediction event

1175
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:52,223
The trial is Manuel Noriega

1176
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,015
Every other one

1177
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:58,879
You can't because

1178
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:02,975
He thought that Manuel Noriega would have sovereign immunity and so the us could

1179
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,999
Contrived

1180
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:07,839
Or something doesn't usually go into other countries and talk about that be

1181
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,607
Crazy

1182
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,399
For under international law

1183
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,423
Community

1184
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,983
Sotalol

1185
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,775
You're going to see that

1186
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:16,799
If you're also

1187
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:20,383
Sovereignty of Nations is no more including the proper

1188
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,175
States of America

1189
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
Sure

1190
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,759
Military forces

1191
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
The Army-Navy

1192
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,575
Dark Horse

1193
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
And Marine

1194
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,255
Functioning as the police force

1195
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,535
Of the United Nations

1196
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,167
Publication

1197
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,447
7277

1198
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:49,823
The bill was in the middle of prediction

1199
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
The norriego on

1200
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:57,247
Which is better give credibility prediction of stuff that's coming which was only in order to

1201
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:02,623
He starts they're saying the people who other than

1202
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
Yeah maybe

1203
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,607
Shepherd

1204
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,375
It was wrong

1205
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:19,775
Also that's a document 7277 as a favorite of Alex's claims

1206
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,079
United States

1207
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,359
We talked about

1208
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,407
Bedtime the past purchases a reminder

1209
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
It was a plan that was per

1210
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,479
Proposed but never enacted in any way

1211
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:35,135
It was released in 1960 wondering. Of severe tension between the United States and the Soviet Union

1212
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,927
Nuclear war any day

1213
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,951
Announce plans for

1214
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:41,279
Peaceful the escalation were sometimes

1215
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,047
Can conception

1216
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,863
Mikaso 7277

1217
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:48,447
The first stage of a proposed plan involves Limited

1218
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:52,031
States and Soviet Armed Forces to 2.1 million persons

1219
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,567
Which definitely

1220
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:58,943
We're a little bit over there Benchmark but Russia's Army is currently in about 3.5 million

1221
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,247
So clearly that stage has not been met

1222
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:05,343
It's a plan that the Opium but it was proposed by us

1223
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,391
I've never been enacted and was product

1224
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,927
Cold War desperation

1225
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:15,071
It's basically just lived on as a boogeyman of the hard-right folks of the Minuteman and the John Birch Society

1226
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:19,423
The globalist want to take their guns when it wasn't even about you

1227
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,495
Yeah that's great

1228
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
That's great

1229
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
Network guys

1230
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,639
That's another little direct parallel of a document

1231
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,175
The bill and Alex both use

1232
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,967
Beginning of the show

1233
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,503
You know within a minute

1234
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,271
It's starting

1235
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,575
False flag

1236
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,391
Becomes Morris

1237
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,671
With it as we go along

1238
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,975
Holiday Inn Oklahoma City

1239
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,511
The part of the agenda

1240
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,535
Bring about

1241
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,559
The New World Order

1242
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:48,863
You watching

1243
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,887
Story

1244
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
Continue to

1245
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,007
It is no accident

1246
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,055
Record on the 2nd anniversary

1247
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,335
The Waco Massacre

1248
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,103
Correct

1249
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:04,479
Completely falls apart or at least it should for anyone is paying attention

1250
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:11,391
Early are you complaining

1251
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:16,511
But now before is over

1252
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,303
Which is in no way proven

1253
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:23,423
It was comfortable deciding on the entire Narrative of the overarching Troost of the event

1254
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,703
With no proof at all

1255
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:30,591
Someone prove exactly how many people responsible

1256
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,663
Very serious disconnect here and it's a problem

1257
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:38,783
Already decided

1258
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,367
You know that's going to affect information about it

1259
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:47,487
Is a predetermined conclusion already and he's publicly declared where he's planting his flag

1260
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,791
Do you think he's going to go out of his way to debunk

1261
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:54,143
He's already committed to based on years of supposed research

1262
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,935
This is a massive problem for me

1263
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,263
Will present himself as a guy who insist you do your research

1264
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:03,359
Music I was cool just collars for repeating things they just heard somewhere

1265
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:06,431
He's the guy who complains about rumors

1266
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,735
And yet here he is decided with zero proof

1267
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,295
Bombing was done to advance the New World Order

1268
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,623
Just a really sad betrayal of what's supposed to be his brand

1269
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:18,719
Gold sales thing you really start to see a different picture of Bill

1270
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:24,351
He's kind of the same piece of s*** that all these guys are he's just a little bit more serious about himself

1271
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,679
You know it is what it is

1272
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,007
Is clearly about Waco

1273
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,287
Like it

1274
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,359
It's very clear anybody else

1275
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:38,687
I don't know what you're talkin about

1276
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
That is true

1277
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:53,279
About that

1278
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:56,351
Investigating the Murrah building bombing

1279
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,631
Iznogoud

1280
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,167
5:30

1281
01:09:59,423 --> 01:09:59,935
P.m.

1282
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
Power washing

1283
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,007
Begin our meeting with

1284
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,543
The governor in the governor's mansion

1285
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,335
Supposedly to get coordinated

1286
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,639
Investigators

1287
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,175
Barney

1288
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,711
Winco Reno

1289
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,759
And the governor has a mouth

1290
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,551
The entire investigation

1291
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,087
Is now in the hands of

1292
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,367
The Federal Bureau of

1293
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,391
Investigation

1294
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:22,463
Could we hear on anyone

1295
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,511
Live rumahan

1296
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,071
Federal Bureau of Investigation

1297
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,607
Four burner

1298
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,263
But a few more since then

1299
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
Texas BBQ

1300
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,127
That's the selection problem

1301
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,111
Definitely

1302
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,927
A big part of how he's interpreting

1303
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,999
Events before he has any reason to think those

1304
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,815
And that's pretty essential to understand

1305
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,351
Really

1306
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,399
Sloppy as hell

1307
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,191
It's really embarrassing

1308
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,495
When you start to look at some of the things

1309
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:09,055
But he's taking the time to make a point of like this

1310
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,383
Oklahoma crime in Carlisle

1311
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,407
Scanner report

1312
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,199
Discovered at 3

1313
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,735
Medallion Hotel

1314
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,551
Request was made for a bomb dog

1315
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,087
Chicken to the hotel

1316
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,879
Perks of a phone directory

1317
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,415
Shows that there is

1318
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,439
No.

1319
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,975
Hotel listed

1320
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,767
Any Oklahoma City phone book

1321
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
We will

1322
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
Of course not

1323
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:42,847
Whether or not bill or his listeners were able to find The Medallion hotel in the phone book

1324
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:46,431
There is a medallion hotel in Oklahoma City

1325
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:51,807
An article in the Oklahoma from October 29th 1996

1326
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
For real

1327
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,623
Shutdown

1328
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:57,951
Because they were in the middle of an 8 million-dollar renovation project

1329
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:02,559
I was even able to find a February 1995 article about the beginning of the renovation

1330
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,607
Project like a hotel exist

1331
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,679
There's a New York daily news story from May 7th

1332
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:12,543
1995

1333
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:16,895
Because they lost his reservations but he was there covering the bombing

1334
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:22,015
The petty image of that aside this article also a major way

1335
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
An offer room

1336
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:26,367
2 people were injured in the bombing as well as rescue workers who really needed a place

1337
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,159
Good for you medallion

1338
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,975
In 1998 The Medallion was bought by

1339
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:36,607
Star in Oklahoma City

1340
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:40,703
Anyway the point here is Villas reporting the news if it's a

1341
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:45,567
They heard on the scanner that a bomb-sniffing dog was sent to The Medallion but they can't find it

1342
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,127
In this is worth bringing up the show

1343
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,175
All this proves is that his investigative team

1344
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
Find a hotel

1345
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,991
The phone book

1346
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:57,087
A second step to figure out of the hotel was real

1347
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:00,159
Flip through a few pages and decide Bill needed to know of

1348
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:05,791
Did you guys check the Yellow Pages as well

1349
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,863
It's only four blocks away from the Murrah building

1350
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,935
This doesn't seem like something maybe a hardest thing to get to the bottom of

1351
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:15,519
Literally not asked anyone

1352
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,079
What do they think this wall so what do you think is bruised

1353
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:34,463
I don't know what that is I guess is that they're speaking in code like a medallion Hotel mean something else

1354
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:41,375
What else are you bringing this up

1355
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,335
Red Roof Inn

1356
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,151
No such company exist

1357
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,943
Ridiculous nonsense

1358
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,759
It's a little harder to swallow

1359
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,319
Are you a hard tonight this is the only

1360
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:01,855
Complete

1361
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,159
Actual report

1362
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,695
Has occurred

1363
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,231
Any meteor

1364
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255
All day long

1365
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,631
Zoo

1366
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,215
People who have dedicated their resources

1367
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Their lives

1368
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,639
Officer

1369
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,431
Admitting women

1370
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,223
I'll be intelligence service

1371
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,527
Of the Second Continental Army

1372
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:31,807
Of the Republic

1373
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,343
Uline

1374
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,975
It's not

1375
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:40,767
Yep

1376
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:46,143
I'm not playing that are just like

1377
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:49,215
You know the Red Cross set up a blood drive Center

1378
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,007
Saying stuff like that

1379
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,311
Uncontroversial in like

1380
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,383
Actual pieces of it

1381
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:59,199
I am in the overall picture that you did for listen

1382
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,479
Make the faces not

1383
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:07,135
Actual recording

1384
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:07,903
Sing with little bit

1385
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,303
But I really want to put in there just so you know what I mean

1386
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
Prediction

1387
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,751
What's playing the audio of the bomb

1388
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:23,775
Repeatedly

1389
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,311
Almost like it's

1390
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,079
The Tramp

1391
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:32,735
You know like hell play it and then he'll say something and then play it again and then say something if it's very weird

1392
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:42,719
A tiny bit of the end of the sound Eminem saying something

1393
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,023
I just wanted to give you a sense of like what

1394
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,071
The structure

1395
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,351
Couple minutes okay

1396
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,567
Memorize that sound like

1397
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,359
More

1398
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,383
And more

1399
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
In America

1400
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
Not because I want it

1401
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,271
And believe me

1402
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
Sing whatsoever

1403
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,879
I didn't think you didn't

1404
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,903
Just now

1405
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,183
Emerging

1406
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,975
Oneworld

1407
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:15,999
Paleteria

1408
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,143
It is partnering the agenda of the department

1409
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:22,911
The American

1410
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,567
It is

1411
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,847
ATC

1412
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,151
It is a lie

1413
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,199
It is all manipulation

1414
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
So

1415
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,807
Please repeat

1416
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:42,623
There's going to be more bombings

1417
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,647
The New World Order

1418
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,927
Migos

1419
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
Spring bomb sounds

1420
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,351
Has no problem

1421
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,143
With egg roll

1422
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
Gunite

1423
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,495
No Patriots

1424
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,311
In this country whatever

1425
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,103
Our government

1426
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:07,199
Without being attacked government

1427
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:07,967
Parks

1428
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:16,159
No fundamentalist religious organization

1429
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,207
Has any

1430
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:18,975
Resume

1431
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,279
To bomb any building

1432
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,327
In Oklahoma City

1433
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,751
We all know in our hearts

1434
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,567
Why this was done

1435
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,639
Andrew's agenda

1436
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,407
Kroger's

1437
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:43,039
So we all know that this also I'm sorry the repeated playing of the bomb

1438
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,391
Is a little bit after this because

1439
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:50,975
First one

1440
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:57,631
First time in this stretch plays a little bit more

1441
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,167
Before he gets into the

1442
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:02,751
Over and over

1443
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,519
Stop

1444
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,055
Think we do

1445
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,079
I think Ivan

1446
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:13,759
I don't think I don't think he and I agreed on the radio and your home

1447
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,527
Saying is like

1448
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,295
Prove it

1449
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:21,695
You don't get to say we know in our hearts YouTube

1450
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,719
Do that and

1451
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,535
It's keep the facade up your some kind of alike

1452
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,631
A researcher

1453
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:34,495
100 or 22

1454
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:38,847
Obviously this is a false flag attack

1455
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,615
Watch

1456
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:46,015
So he's already predicted there's going to be more bombs

1457
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,551
Diction again really

1458
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:53,951
Really quickly after

1459
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,583
Remember that crown

1460
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,375
You will hear it again

1461
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,655
In America

1462
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,727
Again

1463
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:09,055
Until they realize their goal

1464
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,871
Their utopian

1465
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,151
Totalitarian

1466
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,175
Cocosworld

1467
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943
Government

1468
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,271
What's happening

1469
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,295
Krogers in agenda

1470
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,111
It's really hard to capture something like this

1471
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,647
If I just playing clips

1472
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:29,279
But I want to stress to you that at the end of this episode bill is making a very serious 22 predicting there'll be more bombing

1473
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:32,607
Is the New World Order brings in their utopian socialist tyranny

1474
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,143
This is an important point

1475
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:37,983
False flag

1476
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,775
This prediction essentially sets

1477
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:42,335
The condition where if you see more bombings

1478
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,871
Bill's credibility goes off

1479
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,455
There's a pretty common trait that's Campo to propagandist

1480
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:51,551
Going to be more mass shootings and some other prediction

1481
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,111
His assertion that the current mass shooting is a false flag

1482
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,183
Okay

1483
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,303
Is there a bit last time.

1484
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,119
I don't understand

1485
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,935
Did he believe that

1486
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,495
Because he's in those circles

1487
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,775
He knows people

1488
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,567
He knows the hard ripe

1489
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,408
I'm not saying nude

1490
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,760
You know like he knows people like Timothy McVeigh

1491
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,832
You know the lot of people in the militia Patriot world

1492
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:31,232
I'm self to be a leader of the Patriots on the militia

1493
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:33,024
Said because he says

1494
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,072
We would never do this

1495
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:38,144
Unless it was quote-unquote self-defense

1496
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,544
That means all of the militia people believe that same thing

1497
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,808
Some of that

1498
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,392
You know bill has some idealistic ideas about the group

1499
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:04,768
People that actually people eat

1500
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:08,864
Sincere or performance

1501
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,032
Chomping at the bit right

1502
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:25,760
We are surrounded by

1503
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:35,488
Constitution protect against

1504
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,536
A bunch of my friends are f****** scary

1505
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:48,288
Did you guys know cops are crazy baby doesn't work for you

1506
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:55,456
So this is where he's just like coming in and out of the bomb sound effect

1507
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,528
This is ridiculous this is unacceptable

1508
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,232
It is not our

1509
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
Agenda

1510
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:13,632
Yeah it's

1511
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,680
It's a presentation that is

1512
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:21,568
Deeply f*****-up Snapchat

1513
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:27,712
Skip the big one drop there

1514
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:34,368
So it was a false flag

1515
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,000
Gilman of world

1516
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:41,792
Call Asurion

1517
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:42,816
Call Joya

1518
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:44,864
Don't you

1519
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,632
Ever

1520
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,656
You're welcome

1521
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
Forgiveness

1522
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,520
It will come again

1523
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:52,800
Goodnites

1524
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,104
And God bless you all

1525
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:44,000
Everybody

1526
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:50,400
That song is a song that has all the time in version of a dove

1527
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,960
All the time

1528
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:57,568
It's very interesting that I've never heard that on any other radio show

1529
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:00,896
The song Bill ends

1530
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:01,920
Oklahoma City

1531
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:08,320
Show with is a common Bumper Music

1532
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,136
Interesting

1533
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:17,536
I was listening to that

1534
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,472
That's

1535
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,752
Weird

1536
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:34,176
Probably still literally everything for built

1537
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,016
Paranoid sensationalism in service

1538
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,368
Do so much here that is just

1539
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:45,952
Very Alex

1540
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:51,584
Continuing

1541
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,864
In a weird way

1542
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,168
What is the most important

1543
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:59,264
Is you see the way this bill is kind of playing volleyball by amsel

1544
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,568
Except himself up and then he spikes a ball

1545
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,664
Restart the show with

1546
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:08,224
And I hate to tell you this ladies and gentlemen

1547
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:09,760
Because I just can't

1548
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:12,832
Being right

1549
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,600
What I'm right about these

1550
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:18,720
A pipe bomb located under a wheelchair access ramp

1551
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,256
215

1552
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,304
P.m. eastern Daylight Time

1553
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:23,840
Sacramento

1554
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,120
Legislature building

1555
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,144
Charlestown

1556
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,680
Edward Island

1557
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,704
Amazon

1558
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,264
The legislature was in session

1559
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:34,080
The bomb blew out the windows on three floors

1560
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,872
The glass cleaner on the lake

1561
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:36,640
Calculator

1562
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
One person

1563
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,456
I'm sitting on the bench outside the building was

1564
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,224
Injured

1565
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
No suspects

1566
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,296
Have been found

1567
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:44,832
Security

1568
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,112
Husband

1569
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,464
I told you this will escalate

1570
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,768
Joke

1571
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:55,840
Stop running

1572
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,632
They will do anything

1573
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,192
Is there philosophy

1574
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,264
Read my book you know what I'm talk

1575
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,288
Talking about you know what

1576
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,360
Anything

1577
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,408
Anything and everything

1578
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,224
You get there

1579
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:14,272
Utopia World governor

1580
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:21,184
Good example of how conspiracy theory works

1581
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,464
Operating is critical

1582
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:26,816
What is April 19th prediction that there be more bombing

1583
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:30,144
Does the utopian socialists try to bring in their authoritarian state

1584
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,728
And then the next day another bombing

1585
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:38,848
This is enough.

1586
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:41,920
They believe that the bombing was not

1587
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:46,784
Possibly be a solitary terrorist attack if there was another bombing the next day

1588
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:51,648
You can easily see how if you didn't take a step back this pattern

1589
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,440
But ultimately

1590
01:26:54,464 --> 01:27:00,608
The bombing in Prince Edward's Island Rhode Island

1591
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,888
December 1996

1592
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:06,240
Has no idea who he was at this point at all in when he's on air

1593
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:11,872
Was a disgruntled former teacher who decided to lash out by carrying out bombing

1594
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,944
You struck first in 1988 when he set up

1595
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,992
Bomb in front of the provincial Law Courts

1596
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:22,880
You lay low for 6 years then bombed again leaving the pipe bomb in a trash can in the Halifax Park

1597
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:28,256
From this point he seemed to escalate his pattern with this legislature bombing in April 1995

1598
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:31,584
And then an attempted attack on a propane plant in Charlottetown

1599
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,912
In June 1996

1600
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:40,288
Play that one did not work out

1601
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,432
1995 bombing sending messages to the police using the Alias Loki seven

1602
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:52,320
One of these messages

1603
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,344
And the title

1604
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,880
Torta final solution

1605
01:27:55,648 --> 01:28:01,792
The body of his message said quote the latest attack by

1606
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:06,400
Of the thieving Scoundrels in Canada's bought-and-paid-for of legislature in quarts

1607
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:11,520
The Troika greedy businessmen even politicians and Justice officials

1608
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,056
Mehron but they cannot hide

1609
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:17,920
Operations against dies and other enemies of the people we be continued by Loki seven

1610
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,200
Thor

1611
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:25,856
Oh wow is Manifesto

1612
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,624
Cousin

1613
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,416
Threatening letters in the like his

1614
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:33,536
Adjectives if I was I would just say cut a little bit of it out

1615
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:40,704
Troika is a little bit showy

1616
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:46,336
96 propane tank

1617
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:47,872
Down to basically cut down

1618
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,176
And had him under surveillance around the clock

1619
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:54,528
But would plead guilty to the sense to 10 years in prison

1620
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:57,088
I don't think you killed anybody

1621
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,392
I'm not advocating for more

1622
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,232
The US

1623
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,000
Fair

1624
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,144
On April 20th 1995

1625
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,936
When Bill Cooper's on are baking

1626
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:15,520
Connections between the Oklahoma City bombing

1627
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:18,848
Yeah that's really no reason to do so

1628
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:25,504
If your process largely consists of drawing connections between things that you decide must be related sure they're both bomb

1629
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,576
So I can see how you connect

1630
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,368
Undisciplined set of standards

1631
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,648
For reaching a conclusion

1632
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:34,720
Alex Jones doing whatever he's

1633
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:38,560
In the middle of trying to craft a narrative when something happen right

1634
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,584
Uconnect

1635
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,144
All kinds of unrelated things

1636
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:46,496
What was the Boston bombing

1637
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:52,896
The the ricin letters and it was actually the Elvis impersonator

1638
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:56,736
Reconnecting

1639
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:03,904
It's now because Bill on the 19th predicted more going whole-hog into this and it

1640
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,976
And as we find out

1641
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:11,840
Only after all the details are in the only connection to them is that Nazis like bombings

1642
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,752
It's f***** up kind of

1643
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:19,776
You know

1644
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,800
I don't know

1645
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,360
Feel like you get a swastika

1646
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:26,688
I'm just going to go

1647
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,480
You're right

1648
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,320
I don't know

1649
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,624
You can weasel your way out of this wasp

1650
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:41,280
I just you know how it's like an old Hindu symbol I was thinking like

1651
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:54,336
Yeah I know

1652
01:30:54,848 --> 01:31:00,992
Maybe it is much more certain that I do.

1653
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,272
Chewbacca

1654
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:06,624
A lot of that part of the case

1655
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,208
Does swastika Nazi comfortable with

1656
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:14,304
So in the next Club Bill gets to like speculating about

1657
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,608
The motives might be

1658
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,656
Forthemommas

1659
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,128
Remember every time a piece of gun Legend

1660
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,408
Clayton was coming up

1661
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,968
Can Congress somebody would walk into a McDonald's

1662
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,504
Somewhere blow away a whole bunch

1663
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,296
Yeah

1664
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,112
Connect those dots

1665
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,904
I told you it was going

1666
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,208
I told you who these people would be

1667
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,816
I told you this was going to happen to

1668
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,168
Unfortunately

1669
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,032
Single

1670
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,312
Omnibus

1671
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:59,104
Counter-terrorism drill

1672
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,384
Work reading in Congress

1673
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,968
It has all kinds of opposition

1674
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:04,736
Control now

1675
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:13,440
Train and passed through Congress and the president will sign it before you can blink your eye

1676
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,512
Omnibus

1677
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:18,048
Counterterrorism Bureau

1678
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,656
Another similar bills

1679
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,704
Which will implement

1680
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,824
Tighter

1681
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:34,944
Thanks CeCe almost identical

1682
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,712
Thinking patterns

1683
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:42,112
Alex the shootings in the McDonald's are in order to facilitate

1684
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:47,232
Which must mean that there are castrated somehow by the globalist new world order whatever

1685
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:50,816
In the same way this Omnibus Omnibus terrorism bill

1686
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,584
Is it

1687
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,424
In order to get this through

1688
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:59,776
Bill about predictions of future things

1689
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,824
Says that there's nothing that can be done

1690
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,848
Time to stop this bill

1691
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:08,992
You better not let a parent but I'm telling you right now after that bombing yesterday there's nothing you can do to stop but it will pass

1692
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,064
I don't care if the whole country

1693
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,624
Stop it will pass I'm telling you now

1694
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,392
It will pass

1695
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,512
I got some

1696
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,816
Stop it but I'm telling you you won't be able to

1697
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,984
S-390 and s761 and neither of them passed

1698
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:36,640
A watered-down compromise Bill the antiterrorism and effective death penalty Act of 1996

1699
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,432
Richmond

1700
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:41,248
Omnibus Bill was FasTrak

1701
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,808
Surrounding the Oklahoma City bombing

1702
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:46,368
This is how conspiracy thinking works

1703
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:52,256
There was a big

1704
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:56,864
The bombing was done in order to guarantee the passage of the bill which will give

1705
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,888
More controlling

1706
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,936
Ability to crush the militia Patriots

1707
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,264
The bill doesn't pass

1708
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:10,688
The part that seems to never really be considered when cracker G Series

1709
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:15,808
Federal Building

1710
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:19,136
If not thousands of people lying many of them under oath

1711
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:24,000
Pressure who congresspeople

1712
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:37,824
Like terrorists in other countries claim s*** that they didn't do but all the right-wing terrorism in America are bunch of f******

1713
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,104
Craven coward

1714
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,640
How do you willing to accept

1715
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,664
Responsibility

1716
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:48,064
Terrorism

1717
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:55,744
Information will never take responsibility for something

1718
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,096
Committing terrorist Acts

1719
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:06,496
In our community could possibly have done this

1720
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,800
Of the first instead of being like

1721
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:17,504
The community of acceptable

1722
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,624
Elements attracted to the same thing

1723
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:29,024
Do really unacceptable we should take an audit of that

1724
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:34,400
Be allowed to

1725
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:37,984
To talk about whether or not terrorism is real

1726
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:38,752
Yeah

1727
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,568
They have

1728
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:44,128
Capable of pulling off

1729
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:44,896
A gigantic

1730
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:49,504
Bombing power bill

1731
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:56,160
The insistence of creating an anime to be against to simultaneously all-powerful and

1732
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:00,768
What your narrative requires

1733
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:08,704
By the time these two Omnibus bills that bill is using as proof that the new world order did the Oklahoma City bombing die

1734
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:12,032
They aren't essential to the narrative anymore

1735
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:14,336
Tons of other stories

1736
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,104
Tons of butter

1737
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,920
Plates that are so you don't notice 11 drops

1738
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,992
Essential pieces

1739
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,296
Why we're creating the suspicion

1740
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,088
It's it's

1741
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:25,856
Hey at work

1742
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,672
Bill what is

1743
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,280
Problem

1744
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,072
Right

1745
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:38,912
First of all bills got all these

1746
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:40,704
I don't know

1747
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,728
Listeners

1748
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,752
Share who are

1749
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,848
The writing stuff right

Internet counterterrorism Billet gives the president the United

1751
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:55,808
You got them

1752
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,880
All around them dead bodies are lying

1753
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,976
AccountNow way up and

1754
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:03,744
30

1755
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,536
Linda Thompson

1756
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,800
Been awhile since I've heard about how many people

1757
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:18,080
The clintons have just murdered

1758
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:24,480
Text Hillary

1759
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:28,320
Tons of military that are coming in to help

1760
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,600
Like whether Act

1761
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:32,160
Active-duty a reservist

1762
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,208
Baby doctors Maybe

1763
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,512
Logistics

1764
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:42,912
Only Soldiers the military only employs soldiers Bill Bill sees this as proof

1765
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,448
Something

1766
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,240
Name of that this is a drought

1767
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:47,520
But why

1768
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,104
Military personnel police officer

1769
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,128
Prison guard

1770
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,408
Reserva

1771
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,688
National Guard

1772
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,456
And Airport

1773
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,784
Empire City of Oklahoma City

1774
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,600
Cuz there was a bomb

1775
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,648
This is some kind of

1776
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:04,672
Grill

1777
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,464
No

1778
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,256
I don't know the answer to that

1779
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,048
I do I know that what is happy

1780
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,864
Is rain Dion

1781
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,168
Call Porter

1782
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,216
Can't do s*** like this

1783
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:23,360
You can't lead his audience to a conclusion then deliver the conclusion is speculation and then just pretend

1784
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:28,480
I get this kind of thing and honestly it's totally fine under normal

1785
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,248
Circumstances

1786
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,528
If you wants to use this

1787
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:34,880
Spin speculative insinuation

1788
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:35,648
But part of the

1789
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,672
Conspiracy game

1790
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:41,536
You gotta respect the hustle

1791
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:43,584
It's really delicious to do this sort of thing

1792
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,912
About the very thing

1793
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,192
People grieving

1794
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:51,520
Search and rescue operations are still going on as Bill speaks

1795
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,824
And for some reason

1796
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:59,712
The bat around idea that the whole thing is a drill

1797
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:01,248
This dude

1798
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,040
Weave

1799
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,344
Gloves are really off for me

1800
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,672
This isn't just some weird idiot who believes fake documents

1801
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:11,744
USA Today

1802
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,768
Either realshit

1803
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,840
Exploding monster

1804
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:18,656
Like Alex

1805
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,680
When you start to look at

1806
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,472
The Flash

1807
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,240
Appointment

1808
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,520
Alex is such a

1809
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,312
Piece of s*** that we can give

1810
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,360
Bill Cooper a glowing review

1811
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:30,944
Comparison you come back to Bill Cooper

1812
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:37,344
Okay well they're both kind of things that are goofy

1813
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,392
Yeah you can make a case for like

1814
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:43,744
Bill's Pawn in federal broadcasting throws music

1815
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,144
We weave

1816
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,424
Should make it clear

1817
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,472
Either J pilot

1818
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,752
So we get to smorc

1819
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,032
Conspiracies here

1820
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,616
Still March 8th

1821
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,896
Several surveillance

1822
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:01,920
Cameron Mathison

1823
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:02,688
Parking lot

1824
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,224
Apartments around

1825
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:04,992
Building

1826
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:06,528
Sounds like what I would do

1827
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:09,600
These will be checked

1828
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:12,160
See if they can spot the bomb vehicle

1829
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:12,928
Prospects

1830
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:17,792
The question is if they do I tell the public

1831
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,072
Statesville

1832
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:30,080
Wow

1833
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:36,480
The only reason to do that is doing playing to your audience the suggestion that the public will ever see.

1834
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:42,624
In 2009 the FBI release umbrella video The Day of the bombing and other surveillance come out

1835
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:46,976
Video that everyone would want however has been actually exist

1836
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:53,632
In court Richard Williams the event assistant building manager testified that the cameras outside the borough building

1837
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:57,216
Had not been operational for at least two years before the bombing

1838
01:40:57,728 --> 01:41:03,872
Experience number of security cameras

1839
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:08,480
Movie theater where I used to work was one such place and I've definitely heard stories about the

1840
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,504
This motherfolk

1841
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:14,112
Is a whole strategy a lot of businesses employee called dummy surveillance systems

1842
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:16,160
The goal is to put up expensive

1843
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:19,232
Open camera

1844
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:27,424
If you have a high-tech security system oftentimes it would be criminal justice eyes it's not worth the risk

1845
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,448
They choose not to.

1846
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,240
You get the desired result

1847
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,776
Can you save a bunch of money

1848
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,848
This is actually a really bad plan

1849
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:35,872
Because

1850
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:42,272
Criminals know the difference between

1851
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:46,624
I can tell and then second

1852
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:50,720
If you put up fake cameras you might introduce a liability

1853
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:57,120
So you could get sued for cuz you don't actually have footage of

1854
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,144
Security

1855
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:04,544
That might lead someone to take a risk that they wouldn't do otherwise I go outside a building a walking by

1856
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:09,664
But that one actually makes much sense to me

1857
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,992
There are like

1858
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,784
Just to be clear if you're out there don't put up

1859
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,832
The camera not worth it

1860
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:18,624
But there are businesses

1861
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,184
It's I mean not everybody does good

1862
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,976
Practice you know like

1863
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:25,792
Some people just want to cut Corners saves money

1864
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,096
This is

1865
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:30,912
This isn't to say that that's what the Murrah building was doing

1866
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,680
But it is

1867
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:35,008
No conceivable these camera stopped working and they were never replaced

1868
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:36,800
Because it wasn't a high priority

1869
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:39,872
Until the highest priority

1870
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:45,760
I can have this detail would seem incredibly suspicious to conspiracy theorist but it isn't a giant red like me

1871
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:46,528
The mix

1872
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,576
Makes sense no cameras

1873
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:52,416
Cameras being old and not working at a government building makes

1874
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,208
Perfect and

1875
01:42:57,024 --> 01:43:02,656
Reticence to replace the computer

1876
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,680
Punch Cards like

1877
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,960
Nobody's changing anything

1878
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:11,360
And these are these are the sorts of things that unfortunately never seem like that big a deal until we realized

1879
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:15,456
Why would you even worry about replacing a computer that

1880
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:21,600
Control the nuclear weapons no reason to do that if it works now it's going to work forever

1881
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:28,000
Who were some rumors going around trying to sell surveillance video

1882
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:30,048
TV stations for $1000000

1883
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:36,192
But retired FBI agent Steven

1884
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:38,752
In addition there was a secret service log

1885
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:39,776
From April 24th

1886
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:43,360
Dimension of a Ryder truck

1887
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,384
Before the bombing

1888
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:48,224
This is caused a widespread belief that the government is covering up the exist

1889
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:52,832
It went nowhere

1890
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,208
Stacy bauerschmidt the event assistant to the special agent in charge of the Secret Service

1891
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:58,976
Division

1892
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:03,328
Explain the question was a detailing of unconfirmed reports from the days of the

1893
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,608
Beginning of the investigation

1894
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:08,704
This is a lot less concrete that it's made out to be you know there goes a log

1895
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:15,104
Things that may be at been discussed or her

1896
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,896
Investigation

1897
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:19,200
Have testified that they have never seen such a

1898
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,224
Courthouse

1899
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,808
It's it's possible to misrepresent it

1900
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:29,696
The rumors are always so transparent whenever they give you a dollar number where it's like

1901
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:33,792
They've been trying to sell it for $1000000

1902
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:38,144
In its 1995 money so $1000000 might as well be 400

1903
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:42,240
Like it's nonsense

1904
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:45,824
If you were trying to sell it to a magazine or something

1905
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,848
200k

1906
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,896
Get out get in get out let me get out of here

1907
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:59,648
No one's going to investigate the FBI agent who suddenly a millionaire

1908
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,672
Enough

1909
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:07,072
To get out of the country and have a decent life

1910
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:13,984
The function of distrust whatever happened

1911
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,520
If no tapes reproduce

1912
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:19,872
That's not the result

1913
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:24,736
Because that you know obviously the reason to be released for a long time from here

1914
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:27,296
It's not that it's proof of there's a cover-up

1915
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,368
Part of the cow

1916
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,720
The parameters are set up

1917
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,768
It's just your your priming the audience

1918
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,912
Squidbillies decided that the

1919
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:45,984
Reports that are going around that is a fertilizer bomb

1920
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,008
Are not true

1921
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:48,544
I can tell you for looking

1922
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,336
Building of the Great

1923
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,616
Crater in front of the building

1924
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:54,944
But that was not made with a fertilizer soap

1925
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,224
Ecofuel bar

1926
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,552
Practice and Papa

1927
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,856
Whatever did that damn eat

1928
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:02,880
Was a fast

1929
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,160
Burning High

1930
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,184
Explosive

1931
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,488
Type use only

1932
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,768
In military weapon

1933
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,168
With that kind of

1934
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,472
For my kind

1935
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:18,240
Vietnam

1936
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,360
Any explosive

1937
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:25,152
Pittsburgh can tell you this lady

1938
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,688
I'll tell you that I have to

1939
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:28,224
Told you right on the truth

1940
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,760
This is meaningless

1941
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,040
Bill is just saying that he's looked

1942
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:33,344
Pictures and determined that this could be a

1943
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,392
Tomato fertilizer and fuel oil

1944
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,416
Which literally means nothing

1945
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:40,768
This is the exact same thing as Alex pictures from the Boston

1946
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:44,608
And determining that some people must be secret CIA

1947
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,936
Because he knows a lot about secret CIA agent posture

1948
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:50,752
Ibis Point bill has no information to go on

1949
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,288
To either support or reject

1950
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:54,592
Event theory that the bomb was a fertilizer bomb

1951
01:46:55,104 --> 01:47:01,248
You have no idea the actual bomb had supplementary

1952
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:06,112
This is really just a knee-jerk reaction of denialism with no proof behind it

1953
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:09,184
You can't prove that this wasn't a fertilizer bomb

1954
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,464
. making it.

1955
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:18,656
If someone else did this about a conclusion Bill didn't like probably Ranch

1956
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:23,264
Games

1957
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,032
Critiques

1958
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:30,432
Even like I'd like

1959
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,504
You can't tell

1960
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:37,088
Just by looking at a few pictures Cooper

1961
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:42,464
Fire investigators investigations of Investigations

1962
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,744
Those guys have no f******

1963
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,536
What they're talking about

1964
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:46,816
Sickly made-up nonsense

1965
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:49,376
Like there's no way

1966
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:51,680
F*** off

1967
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,984
So here's more sloppiness

1968
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,520
Station chief

1969
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,568
A little note

1970
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,360
Because I get it

1971
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,128
But I don't

1972
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:03,200
What's to the blame for all of those guys

1973
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:04,992
You get arrested nobody is really.

1974
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:07,040
Maybe they wanted to be arrested

1975
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,320
Or maybe they were somehow

1976
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:12,416
Shut up with the FBI running Michelle will probably hear the real story

1977
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:21,376
We probably should never fear the real stuff

1978
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,288
Even the local newscaster reporting

1979
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,312
Latest

1980
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:31,616
Slightly raised eyebrows

1981
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:33,664
Right here

1982
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:35,712
I'm going to take a

1983
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,736
Bill

1984
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:38,784
Temporarily run out of

1985
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:40,832
That's all

1986
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:42,624
Quality

1987
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:47,744
Air quality report

1988
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,792
No no speculation in there

1989
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:54,144
I forgot to cut out this clip

1990
01:48:54,400 --> 01:49:00,544
But there's a point where bill says that he knows what the bomb was

1991
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,592
Because there were

1992
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:06,432
Fulminate of mercury was taken out of the building cuz they're unexploded

1993
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,480
Fulminated Mercury

1994
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:17,952
Oklahoma City Police Lieutenant Bill Martin

1995
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:21,280
The embedded digital explosives native Mercury

1996
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:22,816
Were found on the scene

1997
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:26,400
Testimony

1998
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,704
What the attributed to me is it

1999
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,728
Complete falsehood

2000
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:33,312
I never heard of mercury fulminate before that article came out

2001
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:37,408
And then just generally this is a little bit hard to swallow as a theory

2002
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,968
It seems hard to believe that these explosives

2003
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,552
Fulminate of mercury would have survived a giant explosion

2004
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:46,112
I will need some pretty compelling proof of that claim

2005
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:48,160
In an absence of proof and just a present

2006
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:48,928
Speculation

2007
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:49,952
Can I get on board

2008
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:51,744
Bill Campbell

2009
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,352
To us they are irrelevant

2010
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:59,168
But apparently they have a great deal

2011
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:01,728
Strong relevance

2012
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:08,128
Another report from a cat

2013
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:10,432
Sneezing

2014
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:13,760
Newburyport

2015

David in Oklahoma

2016
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,696
Today I have none for

2017
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:23,232
Cast of visiting the most

2018
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,256
Physically

2019
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,024
Spiritually

2020
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:27,328
I have ever been in mine

2021
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,096
Car lots

2022
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,120
Disney World

2023
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,400
Downtown Oklahoma

2024
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,168
City

2025
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,728
Is now literally under martial law

2026
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:36,288
If that was a letter from a friend

2027
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,056
Fine

2028
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:39,104
If you're treating it as like a report

2029
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,384
What are you doing

2030
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,152
Jesus

2031
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:41,920
Ridiculous

2032
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:43,200
So this guy

2033
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:46,272
This guy love this guy's writing style

2034
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:54,208
Bill

2035
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:59,584
I don't know if literal definition of martial law

2036
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:04,960
Really makes me laugh

2037
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:07,520
After he found a parking place

2038
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,568
Which was a genuine miracle was

2039
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,336
Putting money in the park

2040
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,616
M & M.

2041
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:12,896
Business suit

2042
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:14,688
Said

2043
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:15,712
Quote

2044
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:17,504
You don't have to put any money in

2045
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,272
And there is

2046
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:27,488
What are the primary characteristics of martial law

2047
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:32,096
Free pocket

2048
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:35,168

Protecting the appearance of his own credibility

2168
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:45,344

Whatever a host says

2197
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:26,464
I don't know there's a mild restraint I can applaud a little bit

2198
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:30,048
Completely out the window because of everything else he does

2199
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:31,840
We have a report

2200
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,704
United States Navy

What's the day before

2205
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:43,360
It's Tuesday

2206
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:47,200
How old a bomb drill

2207
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,272
In the

2208
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,040
One of their major

Installation building

2210
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:55,136
And the

2211
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:56,672
Drill involved

2212
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,208
In the car

2213
01:59:58,464 --> 01:59:59,232
Ever heard of the building

2214
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:03,072
Exactly the day before

2215
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:08,704
Erroneous gossip or something

2216
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:18,176
What where was it

2217
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:22,016
Doesn't matter where it is

2218
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:25,344
The New World Order is everywhere Dan

2219
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:30,464
Irresponsible nonsense

2220
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:37,120
Experience when I'm listening to the shows

2221
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:40,960
Is imagining what it would be like if you were someone who lives

2222
02:00:41,216 --> 02:00:42,752
Essence 28 and believe that

2223
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:45,824

For no reason like obviously that is something you will have an effect on his listeners

2226
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:57,600
Whether or not

2227
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:59,648
Reinstated

2228
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:03,488
And the reason is because you do hear things like this sometimes

2229
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:07,328
The content like this

2230
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:08,608
Does have an affair

2231
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:09,376
Facts on people

2232
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:13,984
Like it if you're not careful with stuff like this it will change

2233
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,520
Some of your perception

2234
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:17,824
And maybe not in ways that are very positive

2235
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,600
Working out

2236
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:31,648
Looking at the world in a different way

2237
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,184
This caller is very

2238
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:39,840
But it's not

2239
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:40,608
Yeah

2240
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:43,424
Bill has changed

2241
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:45,216
Yeah just to save

2242
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:45,984
Use

2243
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:50,080
Created a context overarching narrative

2244
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:54,432
That allows you to contextualize situation

2245
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:57,760
That you wouldn't have otherwise because there isn't a connection

2246
02:01:58,272 --> 02:02:02,112
Like it that you have a guy like Bill

2247
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,648
Essentially this

2248
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:10,304
I guarantee there'll be more bombs after the bombing cuz it was a false flag and then the Prince Edward Island bombing happen

2249
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:14,656
That Way You Are

2250
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:17,472
Settings that kind of an example for your audience

2251
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:19,520
You're going to end up

2252
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:21,056
Having the effect

2253
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:22,080
That is not possible

2254
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:26,688
And that's that's bad

2255
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:28,480
That is not good

2256
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:34,624
Yeah there's nothing inherently wrong with it like a powerful piece of media

2257
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:39,232
If you use that power are responsibly and like an a******

2258
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:42,048
Then it's not going to put better

2259
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:45,376
Viewpoints in people's eyes ago

2260
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:51,776
I've been waiting for my short way for a few days and I've had to consume

2261
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:56,896
Pitstop

2262
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:58,176
Stop

2263
02:02:58,432 --> 02:03:00,992
Maybe we should get people to read the lines

2264
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:05,600
You can try reading between the lines

2265
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:07,136
Forever bothering with the LIE

2266
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:07,904
You can't do it

2267
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:10,720
Kickflip until you can always

2268
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:15,328
So this last year from the April 20th show

2269
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:17,376
Making stuff up

2270
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:20,960
There is more movement of military equipment

2271
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:24,544
Material and vehicles in this country to

2272
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:28,128
Days Inn there ever was in World War I

2273
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:30,432
Are you going to start asking yourself

2274
02:03:30,688 --> 02:03:31,200
Why

2275
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:34,784
I know the answer to that

2276
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:36,320
So do some of you

2277
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:39,904
You just making it up for him to know

2278
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,440
That

2279
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:42,464
He can't

2280
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,000
Back that up at all

2281
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:52,960
More movement has military stuff in Oklahoma City bombing

2282
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:57,568
The Vietnam War

2283
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:58,848
Could know that is if he was

2284
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:00,384
Is privy to a series of

2285
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,944
Orders and s*** like that because no matter what

2286
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:04,224
No matter what like

2287
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:13,696
Singular anecdotal evidence you can measure the

2288
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:20,096
History of military history you could probably

2289
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:24,960
Quantification for troop movement

2290
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:31,360
Now I don't believe that on April 20th bill would have any reliable way to quantify

2291
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:35,200
Regarding Oklahoma City

2292
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:38,784
Just the facts

2293
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:40,832
Miami

2294
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:43,392
You can't do stuff like makeup now

2295
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,928
Bulshit

2296
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:48,000
I don't like that I don't like it when bills mean to me like that huh

2297
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:52,096
April 21st comes around this point

2298
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:55,936
It's become clear that Timothy McVeigh is the best

2299
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:57,472
Do you mean

2300
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:58,752
The false flag Patsy

2301
02:04:59,264 --> 02:04:59,776
According to Bell

2302
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:01,312
Yes

2303
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:06,688
Discussion of Timothy McVeigh connections to militia

2304
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:07,968
Has come up

2305
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:08,736
It's clear

2306
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:12,832
21st is not nearly as interesting

2307
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,112
Kind of

2308
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:15,904
Uninspired

2309
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,184
The only reason I

2310
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:25,376
Is because there is a continuation of something from the 20th because these are part of a three-part series

2311
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:28,192
About Oklahoma City

2312
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:29,472
They're packaged

2313
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:33,568
Together on the hour of the time

2314
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:35,104
Episode title

2315
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:37,408
And so I didn't want to

2316
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:39,200
Completed

2317
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:44,320
This is not

2318
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:48,928
In terms of things that are interesting there was much more in the 19th and 20th

2319
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:52,256
Bill starts out on an alarming town

2320
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:53,792
Berkeley house

2321
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:54,560
In order

2322
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:56,352
The Commanding General on 2nd

2323
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,632
Continental Army

2324
02:05:58,656 --> 02:06:00,192
Don't like that all

2325
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,984
Archery Maine

2326
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:03,520
On Boulevard

2327
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:10,944
Are to maintain discipline of their unit

2328
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:12,992
Every unit

2329
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,272
Protective

2330
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:16,832
And under no circumstances

2331
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:19,136
Are you in a little while

2332
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:20,160
The militia

2333
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,440
Broken

2334
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:25,280
As a result

2335
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:28,096
The propaganda campaign

2336
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:29,376
Stingrays

2337
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:33,728
Against the legitimate

2338
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:35,264
Legal

2339
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,312
Melissa

2340
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:39,104
Kerrville state

2341
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:41,408
I love United States

2342
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:42,688
Of America

2343
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:45,760
That doesn't sound like

2344
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:51,648
That sounds like him coming up on the Fly

2345
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:56,000
From the Commanding General of these

2346
02:06:57,536 --> 02:07:01,888
I think that's him I'm pretty sure it is him

2347
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:07,264
Witchfinder General

2348
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:13,664
Seems to me that might be Bill's title for himself but I don't know

2349
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:16,992
I'm going to

2350
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:25,184
Suspicion

2351
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,208
His real name is Milton

2352
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:28,512
Here's my pitch

2353
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:29,280
H2u

2354
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:33,120
Xi'an It Reno s***

2355
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,168
Mind

2356
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:37,984
Everybody do it

2357
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:41,824
Melissa Elementary the story is,

2358
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:45,920
Pretty strong denial

2359
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:53,344
He's in a bad mood a lot

2360
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,368
Get some of that

2361
02:07:56,416 --> 02:08:00,768
It's unclear if it's sincere or performance-based naivete

2362
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:02,816
Pizza

2363
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:04,864
No way you can believe this is true

2364
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:08,192
The only way the national rumour-mongers are going to be able to promote

2365
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:09,216
Involved

2366
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:09,984
Rumor

2367
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,264
Is by simultaneous

2368
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:12,288
Pioneer

2369
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,568
Play racist group

2370
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:14,848
Have you heard that

2371
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:15,872
All day long

2372
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:17,920
White

2373
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:18,688
What time is it

2374
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:19,968
Religious

2375
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,248
Fundamentalist

2376
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,784
Constitutional

2377
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,064
Patriot group

2378
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,600
Government painter

2379
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:29,696
The truth is even in the Backwoods

2380
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:30,976
Country of Oklahoma

2381
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,768
Investigators are not likely

2382
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:34,048
Surprising to many groups

2383
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,328
Which are both races

2384
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:36,352
Unpatriotic

2385
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:40,192
Investigation

2386
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:41,728
Anderson Tire Macon

2387
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:43,008
There are probably

2388
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:44,800
Hundred total

2389
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:46,080
White supremacist

2390
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:50,176
.

2391
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:53,248
Keep keep looking Bell

2392
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:56,832
Keep looking

2393
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,792
Yeah man I don't know

2394
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:11,680
You can't have a group

2395
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:14,496
It's racist and patriotic because if you do then

2396
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:22,944
You're not patriotic

2397
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:26,272
The fair that you would go on

2398
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:29,600
That you would say out loud I think they're only

2399
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:31,904
Maybe 500 White

2400
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,184
Supremacist

2401
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,464
Tire country

2402
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:38,816
Stone's throw of our place in Mansfield

2403
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:45,216
Chicago

2404
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:48,544
So I would say for me you know

2405
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:50,848
Yeah I think that's really

2406
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:53,920
Absurdly denial

2407
02:09:57,248 --> 02:10:01,344
About the nature of the person that will be arrested for this crime

2408
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:02,368
You can research

2409
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,416
That whoever is arrested will be

2410
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:06,464
First proclaimed a rapist

2411
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:08,000
Raider image

2412
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:10,048
Election will be fabricated

2413
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:13,376
Or what is there a racist

2414
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:16,192
I don't think that's possible obvious

2415
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:18,752
Buy in the world

2416
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:28,736
Makeup similar connection

2417
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:35,136
Does get arrested

2418
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:37,696
Scripting this in order to make the Patriots look bad

2419
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:40,768
Perry identical to Alex's

2420
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:43,840
Sort of methods and narrative surrounding

2421
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:49,472
People who do really terrible things happened to be part of the self-selected group

2422
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:52,288
Her bill is very much heavily militia

2423
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:53,824
Brow wax

2424
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:58,176
In Western riots

2425
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:59,456
It is

2426
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:02,272
It is annoying to me that they

2427
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:04,064
Preach this rhetoric

2428
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,600
That comes down to

2429
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:06,624
The government is

2430
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,904
Is always attacking you

2431
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:10,464
Self defense measures

2432
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:13,792
Weird be basically whatever it is you want to do

2433
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:15,328
And then at the same time being like

2434
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:17,888
But we would never take offense of action

2435
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:21,216
Even though you've already said that any action is functionally self

2436
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:28,128
Right it is

2437
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:32,736
I think most people would agree with that are

2438
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:35,296
And you'd have a really tough time making

2439
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:38,624
The same time

2440
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:42,208
The narratives in that that sort of mentality has the effect

2441
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:44,768
Desired

2442
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:46,304
Follow through with it

2443
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,864
And then end up becoming proof

2444
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:51,936
The man is trying to make the Patriots look bad

2445
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:53,216
Becomes itself

2446
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:55,520
Perpetuating

2447
02:11:55,776 --> 02:11:57,056
Yeah which is

2448
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:00,128
So big for on the 20th

2449
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:04,480
The caller called in seismograph

2450
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:10,880
Sure little thing

2451
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:12,672
The University

2452
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:13,952
Over in Norman

2453
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:15,744
And I looked into this

2454
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,280
Report from Gary

2455
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:19,328
The report of two seismological event

2456
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,864
Consistent with Margie

2457
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:22,656
Organs on the morning of April 9th

2458
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:23,424
13th March

2459
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:24,448
T95

2460
02:12:24,704 --> 02:12:25,216
Ears

2461
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:26,240
Confirm

2462
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:28,544
At 1:20 p.m.

2463
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:29,312
Today

2464
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,896
Or 2195

2465
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:35,200
I spoke with dr. Luther

2466
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:36,736
I'll be Oklahoma do you like

2467
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:38,272
Google survey which is located in the

2468
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:40,832
McCarthy Energy building at the University of Oklahoma

2469
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:43,904
Doctor loser showed me the price

2470
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:45,696
Minecraft recordings made on Atmore

2471
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:46,720
Going to

2472
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:47,488
Supper

2473
02:12:47,744 --> 02:12:48,512
Cosmological

2474
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:49,280
Disturbances

2475
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:50,816
The first occurring

2476
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:51,840
9

2477
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:53,632
20 4 a.m.

2478
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:57,728
Occurring at 90 2:14 a.m.

2479
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,008
So this is interesting

2480
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:02,336
Because like I mentioned earlier what are you talkin about is a real thing

2481
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:04,384
Bill jumping to Wild

2482
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:07,200
Conclusions without any doesn't end up running this narrative at all

2483
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:14,112
The way you presented things there were two events registered on a seismograph

2484
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:14,880
At the Murrah building

2485
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:18,976
This is a simple conclusion to reach if you have a habit of not considering

2486
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,256
Other possibilities

2487
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:22,304
Which it seems like Bill might not do a lot

2488
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:26,912
The fact that there were two ways registered on the seismograph

2489
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:28,960
So they study the phenomenon further

2490
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:35,616
What the result of low and high frequency

2491
02:13:35,872 --> 02:13:36,384
Rates

2492
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:42,784
The low-frequency signal made it be 16 miles from the bomb site to the seismograph in Norman a few seconds prior

2493
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:44,320
Do the high-frequency signal

2494
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:45,088
Right

2495
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:51,488
Additional seismograph

2496
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,560
Review to wave signals despite there being only one

2497
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:55,584
Controlled explosion

2498
02:13:56,096 --> 02:13:57,888
Urban studies demonstrated clearly

2499
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:00,960
Signal pattern is not provoked explosion

2500
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:04,800
Conclusions about this

2501
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:07,104
He's breaking one of his own cardinal rules

2502
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:08,384
Because it's important

2503
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:12,736
Statistics of someone who believes the same things

2504
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:15,040
So he eat takes

2505
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:19,136
He doesn't know what it means there's no explanation that he can really provide

2506
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:20,672
2 things to bomb

2507
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:25,024
I understand

2508
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:26,560
But you just don't know it now

2509
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:28,096
So

2510
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:29,888
Terry Nichols

2511
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,424
Was I involved

2512
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:36,288
If we are found

2513
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:37,312
You know what's going to be left

2514
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:38,848
Not bad

2515
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:41,152
Call Terry Nichols no don't do that

2516
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:44,480
He is apparently

2517
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:47,808
At this point there's also been some discussion that he has some connection with the

2518
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:48,832
Militia

2519
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:51,904
Now bill has an easy answer for that

2520
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:53,440
I told you all along

2521
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:55,488
Symptoms of mono

2522
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:56,256
Montana

2523
02:14:57,792 --> 02:14:58,304
And others

2524
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:01,632
Our agent provocateur

2525
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:02,400
Couture

2526
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:03,680
They would fuel the flames

2527
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:06,496
And provide the ammunition that would be used

2528
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:08,544
Lacrosse boots

2529
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,312
Mesa

2530
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:12,640
And

2531
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:13,920
I was absolute

2532
02:15:14,176 --> 02:15:14,688
Correct

2533
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:19,040
AR reading Marissa of Montana material

2534
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:20,576
And all the other beer

2535
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:21,600
Put some more

2536
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:22,368
DOL

2537
02:15:22,624 --> 02:15:23,392
Sophia Grace's

2538
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:28,768
Again where is that naive that seems to be popping up there

2539
02:15:29,024 --> 02:15:31,584
I understand there are

2540
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,352
I'm

2541
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:33,120
Certain

2542
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:37,472
There are some people who are into malicious dolphins

2543
02:15:37,984 --> 02:15:40,032
Some patriots stuff

2544
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:42,080
Has that racism that's attached

2545
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:45,408
Universal

2546
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:52,064
You know maybe there's a there's an idealistic version of it bills and subscribe

2547
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,088
Did anybody else does

2548
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,672
It's just Luke

2549
02:15:57,184 --> 02:16:01,280
Yeah I would be shocked Irish octave Bill wasn't even aware

2550
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:04,608
Bill has to know if he's ever been to a militia

2551
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:07,936
He has to know at least one guy there who got a Nazi flag

2552
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:08,960
Like

2553
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:15,360
It doesn't

2554
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:21,760
He didn't ever want to

2555
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:26,368
I'm pretty mad at the militia Michigan because it should be the militia

2556
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:28,672
And they really wasted

2557
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:31,488
Yeah that is important

2558
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:35,072
Emotive

2559
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:39,936
For the bombing was Terror Bill through sure

2560
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:41,216
But there's a reason

2561
02:16:41,472 --> 02:16:42,752
That Oklahoma was chosen

2562
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,544
May 17th 9

2563
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,824
1994

2564
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:47,104
State of Oklahoma

2565
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:48,128
Gentleman

2566
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:49,152
Replace your cast

2567
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:50,688
HR 1040

2568
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:53,504
1047

2569
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,296
Oklahoma the very first

2570
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,576
State in the United

2571
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:58,624
To actually go on record

2572
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:00,160
Perusing

2573
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:01,184
The approaching

2574
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:02,720
New World Order

2575
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:05,024
It called for the United

2576
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:05,792
What states

2577
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:07,072
Not to move

2578
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:08,352
Military personnel

2579
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,632
To support the United Nation

2580
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:11,680
And many other things

2581
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:14,496
Okay

2582
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:16,032
Happened in Oklahoma City

2583
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:16,800
Oh boy

2584
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:25,760
Been passed by the Oklahoma Legislature

2585
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:29,600
New World Order decided to attack Oklahoma of all places

2586
02:17:30,624 --> 02:17:36,768
The first thing that's important to understand is that HR 1047

2587
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:42,656
Resolutions that our paths are not legally binding at all and they're really good things

2588
02:17:43,424 --> 02:17:47,008
It's like the recent thing we talked about where the San Antonio city council passed a resolution

2589
02:17:47,264 --> 02:17:49,056
Denouncing the use of the term China virus

2590
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:51,616
This resolution was introduced on March

2591
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:57,248
1994. May 17th

2592
02:17:58,016 --> 02:18:04,160
It completely completely absurd Proclamation but how the US needs to quote seize any support for the establishment of a new world

2593
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:06,464
Global government

2594
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,512
It's definitely paranoid and just

2595
02:18:09,024 --> 02:18:10,048
Very weird resolute

2596
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:11,072
But honestly

2597
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:14,912
If I were Bill HR 1056 works better

2598
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:16,704
Resolution

2599
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:19,264
Claiming sovereignty under the 10th Amendment to the concert

2600
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:21,568
Do some of the United States over certain powers

2601
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:24,896
Serving notice of the federal government to cease-and-desist certain mandates

2602
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:26,176
And directing distribution

2603
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:28,480
I want closer to Bill's introduction

2604
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:31,552
Intro May 12th 1994

2605
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:34,112
Works better for his narrative

2606
02:18:34,624 --> 02:18:37,440
I kind of suspected bill just combining or confusing me to Revolution

2607
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:39,744
What baby does nobody talk about

2608
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:46,144
No reason to blow the Federal Building because of a non-binding non legally actionable

2609
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:55,616
Cramps

2610
02:18:55,872 --> 02:19:02,016
They might as well be but at the end of them you halfway expected to be like for the UN and I hate my wife

2611
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:03,040
Angela

2612
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:08,416
I heard you Angela get rid of the New World Order and the UN is evil

2613
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:14,816
Three back-to-back kind of lunacy something very weird suspected there something else

2614
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:21,216
Behind marital strife

2615
02:19:23,008 --> 02:19:24,544
But how right he is about

2616
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:28,128
Right

2617
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:30,432
Our study d

2618
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:33,760

Wanelo tracking Congress

2631
02:19:57,056 --> 02:20:00,384
Any object of a lively debate as to whether it would violate some

2632
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:01,920
Fundamental civil liberties

2633
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:03,200
Including the right to

02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:04,736
Accuser

2635
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:07,040
Now after the Oklahoma City bombing

2636
02:20:07,296 --> 02:20:08,064

Calling for the bills

2641

The Cutlass

2643
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:21,888
Wonders are added again

2644
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:28,544
Is there any discussion about how right he is about everything he's talking about how certain a bill of passages that doesn't end

2645
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:35,968
About that he's right about everything I will not worry about that

2646
02:20:36,224 --> 02:20:41,088
Every move with perfect accuracy

2647
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:43,648

02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:56,192
Introduce like a really interesting there right

2650
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:59,520
But they're correct

2651
02:20:59,776 --> 02:21:05,920
The only explanation for them

2652
02:21:08,736 --> 02:21:10,784
Actually happened

2653
02:21:13,856 --> 02:21:20,000
For a reason

2654
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:23,584
But I do think it's wrong to suspend habeas corpus

2655
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,352

Not on your life

02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:12,992
This is all

2678
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:14,016
Planned

2679
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:17,088
To paralyze the American people

2680
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:19,136
To give up the Bill of Rights

2681
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:20,672
You can't prove any of that

2682
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:25,024
You're the guy who's mr. proof you can't prove that

2683
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:28,096
All of these bomb threats were done by the globalist

2684
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:32,960
Did you think that maybe they did let all of the people out of the asylum

2685
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:38,592
Or do you think that it's possible cuz that's not necessary for one to make a threat

2686
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:39,872
Play Maybe

2687

Before like the internet with

2690
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:51,392
It's good now for harassing people

2691
02:22:52,416 --> 02:22:57,024
Steal something

2692
02:22:59,328 --> 02:22:59,840
So

2693
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:00,608
I don't know

2694
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:04,960
It's very similar to Alex

2695
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:05,984
Why is

2696
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:08,032
Call to action is a little bit different

2697
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:11,616
Fairly large similarities

2698
02:23:11,872 --> 02:23:13,152
Are you going to continue to

2699
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:14,432
To say

2700
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:16,992
Nothing's going on the government wouldn't hurt

2701
02:23:17,248 --> 02:23:18,016
Are you going to come

2702
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:20,064
Can you until your rounded up

2703
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:21,856

Labor camp

2705
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:24,160
Because you don't

2706
02:23:24,416 --> 02:23:24,928
Fitting room

2707
02:23:26,464 --> 02:23:29,280
How your mind is supposed to work in the New World Order

2708
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:31,328
Is that what it's going to take

2709
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:32,352
Before you wake up

2710
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:35,936
Look around you this is not the United

2711
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:37,216
States of America

2712
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:39,776
Not at all

2713
02:23:42,336 --> 02:23:45,920
And that is not a constitutional Republican government in Waukee

2714
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:46,944
DC

2715
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:48,480
Nor in

2716
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:50,528
Dates of the several

2717
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:54,624
How many states

2718
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:55,648
Craigslist

2719
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:58,208
Continue

2720
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:00,512
Recruit for your militia

2721
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:02,560
Continue to prepare

2722
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:04,352
Continue to arm yourselves

2723
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:09,728
Continue to teach your children and your neighbor the truth about the Conch

2724
02:24:09,984 --> 02:24:11,008
Bill of Rights

2725
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:13,312
I'ma principles and ideals upon which

2726
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:14,336
Country was base

2727
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:16,128
So I mean

2728
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:17,152
Yeah

2729
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,944
Ynobe

2730
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:20,736
Illegitimate government

2731
02:24:20,992 --> 02:24:21,504
Kind of thing

2732
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:23,296
Sounds a lot

2733
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:24,064
Like

2734
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:30,720
Beliefs of people who might attack the government

2735
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:32,512
But no Patriot wood

2736
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:37,632
Legitimate

2737
02:24:37,888 --> 02:24:40,960
Going to take you off to camp

2738
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:42,240
FEMA camps.

2739
02:24:42,496 --> 02:24:44,288
It's all very similar

2740
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:51,200
It only makes sense if you're saying to me that the Socialists are going to take me to

2741
02:24:51,968 --> 02:24:53,248
That is going to happen

2742
02:24:57,088 --> 02:25:00,160
Well either I can be in a camper I can fight back

2743
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:05,280
This isn't alert

2744
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:08,864
Government in place

2745
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,912
Exactly

2746
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:17,056
Belief system

2747
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:21,920
Measure

2748
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:24,992
To get in

2749
02:25:25,504 --> 02:25:27,040
Until I guess the power

2750
02:25:27,296 --> 02:25:28,576
Struck powershift

2751
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:29,600
Something like that

2752
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:31,648
I don't I don't know

2753
02:25:31,904 --> 02:25:32,672
The point is

2754
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:40,352
Alex

2755
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:42,400
Stop you seeing this episode is very much

2756
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:47,008
Like exploitative

2757
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:52,640
Per episode

2758
02:25:54,176 --> 02:25:59,552
It's not like it's taking over his show

2759
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:02,880
Confused

2760
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:03,904
Like what

2761
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:05,184
Exactly the point is

2762
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:06,208
If it's not

2763
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:08,512
Create some sort of 8 brat

2764
02:26:09,024 --> 02:26:10,816
20 Franklin

2765
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:14,912
You can see how successful it is even with a small scale

2766
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:17,472
You can shut down government if you just have

2767
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:21,056
20 guys wearing fake body armor and fake guns

2768
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:22,848
Awkward Fox

2769
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:29,504
So I took a look

2770
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:31,808
These three days

2771
02:26:32,064 --> 02:26:32,832
Job

2772
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,136
Not good

2773
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:38,464
Lottery rumors

2774
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:43,584
Down. My time no worse

2775
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:44,608
Time for you to

2776
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:45,632
Suck up like a

2777
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:47,680
Then like in the immediate aftermath of

2778
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:49,472
Gigantic terrorist attack

2779
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:55,360
It's really really terrible

2780
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,152
Through this

2781
02:26:57,408 --> 02:27:00,992
Prism you do see a lot more of Alex

2782
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:04,320
Yeah in terms of these these patterns

2783
02:27:04,576 --> 02:27:06,112
These Trends these behaviors

2784
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:08,928
I think the picture becomes a bit quicker

2785
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:10,464
As to why

2786
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:14,048
Somerville other episodes

2787
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:19,680
Really necessarily make of the connection strongly enough as to why he is an important

2788
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:25,568
Figure out the context of our show clarified here

2789
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:28,384
It was better clarify.

2790
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:29,408
Yeah

2791
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:31,456
I just hate the cowardice so much

2792
02:27:31,712 --> 02:27:33,760
I hate how cowardly they are because

2793
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:35,296
In one sense

2794
02:27:35,552 --> 02:27:38,368
Alright you can have the courage to step up and say

2795
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:40,928
This is an illegitimate government and I support this

2796
02:27:41,184 --> 02:27:41,696
Terrorist attack

2797
02:27:42,464 --> 02:27:45,280
Another instance of Courage is you could step up and say

2798
02:27:45,536 --> 02:27:51,680
I don't believe this is part of the militia Movement we need to get these we need to find out where this is coming from

2799
02:27:51,936 --> 02:27:52,448
Rooted out

2800
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:55,520
Cowardice comes in

2801
02:27:55,776 --> 02:27:57,824
I want to be the leader of

2802
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:58,848
Fake militia

2803
02:27:59,104 --> 02:27:59,872
At the same time

2804
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:02,688
I don't want any consequences for the b******* that I say

2805
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:07,552
Very similar to Alex

2806
02:28:07,808 --> 02:28:09,344
Coward

2807
02:28:10,624 --> 02:28:13,952
I realize that

2808
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:15,232
Really explain

2809
02:28:16,768 --> 02:28:18,304
I completely got derailed

2810
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:22,144
Because I Was preparing this episode last night

2811
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:28,032
Another episode 4

2812
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:31,616
What we need to get to work

2813
02:28:31,872 --> 02:28:37,248
Gigantic fire in LA

2814
02:28:38,528 --> 02:28:42,880
Almost done getting ready

2815
02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:49,536
Somehow we

2816
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:50,304
Turn on bills

2817
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:52,096
To respond

2818
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:57,216
You got to go to bed

2819
02:28:57,472 --> 02:29:01,824
Just really quick before we get out of here

2820
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:07,712
So far is not been an all-encompassing

2821
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:10,784
Approach or coverage

2822
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:13,600
About Oklahoma City

2823
02:29:13,856 --> 02:29:15,392
Kobe possible number one

2824
02:29:15,904 --> 02:29:17,184
And number two

2825
02:29:18,208 --> 02:29:19,232
To take the same approach

2826
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:23,328
As he brings things up

2827
02:29:23,584 --> 02:29:25,120
5. Go to them

2828
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:28,448
Conspiracy gif

2829
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:29,216
It's denser

2830
02:29:29,472 --> 02:29:31,008
There'll be more of the

2831
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:36,384
Cuz I can see somebody listen to something like what about

2832
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:39,712
As time goes along will experience it as

2833
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:42,016
Bill's audience might

2834
02:29:42,784 --> 02:29:44,576
So I think that's the way to do it

2835
02:29:45,856 --> 02:29:52,000
Next

2836
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:53,280
