Alex Jones  00:00
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.

Andy In Kansas   00:04
Well, Alex, I'm a first time caller.

Alex Jones  00:05
I'm a huge fan.

Jordan  00:06
I love your work.

Dan  00:07
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledge fight. I'm Dan.

Jordan  00:10
I'm Jordan.

Dan  00:11
We are two dudes who like to sit around and drink wine and watch the world burn.

Jordan  00:15
That's a boy it's it sure is doing that now,

Dan  00:18
but the twist is I like to sit around and listen to Infowars and Alex Jones in particular and describe the events that unfolded to my friend Jordan here

Jordan  00:28
and I am consistently shocked appalled and giggly and

Dan  00:33
what it is this dude says And overwhelmingly confused, overwhelmingly confused the the world is on fire as we speak. We're recording this on Thursday afternoon. Senator Sessions. Now Attorney General Sessions is in not Florida, not for long either of those things. So he's in he's in, as they would say, as PG Woodhouse would say he's in the soup. Yeah, up to his thorax. Oh, man. He isn't troubled

Jordan  01:01
this who knows at this point? It's like it reminds me of that patent as well. But where George Bush and Dick Cheney are the Duke boys jump in the General Lee over the Constitution

Dan  01:15
how they gonna get out of

Jordan  01:16
this school? How they gonna get out of this pickle? Yeah, Mount man are now playing. Oh, yeah.

Dan  01:21
It doesn't feel like they are as slick as bush. Oh, crazy. They are nowhere near that's insane to think that like one of the most fumbling bumbling, dumb asses in political history. George W. Bush looks kind of slick.

Jordan  01:35
I think I think that was his genius at not his genius. I think that was the reason that he got away with so much. Shucks, he Yeah, he didn't seem like an asset. Like, no matter how evil he was, there was still that part of you. That was like, Ah, he just seems like a down home country boy.

Dan  01:50
And honestly, that's the marketing that like, you want to go get a beer with him?

Jordan  01:54
Right? Right.

Dan  01:55
I don't think that's I never felt that way. I think that was just no

Jordan  01:58
I again, I always thought he was a monster. And he faked a war and lied to everybody. And now we're trillions and trillions of dollars in debt for it. And

Marty DeRosa  02:06
here we are. And here we are.

Dan  02:08
Also, it's come out that a bunch of other Trump folks met with Russians. It's the whole fucking thing. All of the stuff in the dirty dossier is very true. Oh,

Jordan  02:17
man. I bet. I bet Trump had sessions pee on him at this point. Yeah, all of this is possible. Anything goes? Anything goes. Yeah.

Dan  02:25
So unfortunately, At press time, when we're recording this, some of these revelations came out after today's episode of the Alex Jones Show, right. So we don't know what his take on this Carter Page situation is I can't word the Kushner news. Yes. But I do know I listened to the episode today. Because the news about sessions broke last night, right? And so I thought like fucking Alex Jones is going to be on fire. And he was not the case. He wasn't he was subdued and heartbroken. It was very boring. It was just like, This man's a patriot. He wasn't like the Russians. He was calling them because it's his duty. That sort of thing is I sure it's just part of the game. It's part of his job. He's on the he's on the Senate subcommittee, and his job is to talk to the Russians. Meanwhile,

Jordan  03:13
all of the other people on that subcommittee talk to the Russians across the border. Yes, zero of them strange, strange. So

Dan  03:20
it'd be like, he's he didn't feel the flames coming in today's episode, but I think tomorrow, it's going to be a breakdown.

Jordan  03:28
You think so? You don't think it's possible that he's finally seeing the writing on the wall of his own where he's like, I'm starting to think maybe,

Dan  03:37
did you just pull your ear? Oh, no. Oh, God,

Jordan  03:40
I just pulled my ear Jordan legitimately. I just, I don't know, I'm scratching. I don't know. I'm

Jordan  03:45
nervous infecting all of us. We're all we're all part of

Jordan  03:49
the globalist

Dan  03:50
even though today's episode was kind of boring. And I there wasn't a lot of like, worthwhile shit in it. He had a bunch of interviews with the people who, just but luckily, he had some stuff from the Wednesday, March 1 episode that were very necessary to talk about. Excellent. So that's why we are here today to discuss some of the goings on of the march 1, pre sessions news breaking episode, his pre session session. Yeah, because he does bring up sessions, of course, but I want to start the show off today, Jordan, we talk too much shit about Alex Jones.

Jordan  04:31
And I have yet to hear that from any of our listeners.

Dan  04:35
I think it's important that we let the man get some propers when he deserves them, right. And I want to take a moment to celebrate some things that Alex Jones does incredibly well. Okay, first thing lie. He's amazing. He's a really good liar. Second thing, his intro music in and out of commercial breaks strong.

Jordan  04:56
You are praising him for things he is not yet Get involved in

Dan  05:02
these artists knew he was using them he'd probably very angry very angry Moby is extreme ways comes in. It's awesome. Quarter flash hardened my heart. Okay, it's a banger

Jordan  05:13
All right the other day he

Dan  05:14
played a triumph.

Jordan  05:15
Yeah, you actually had to texted me about that. Motherfucker is playing some solid music right now so

Dan  05:22
good.

Jordan  05:23
Are you saying power trio? You're goddamn right I'm saying Power Trip

Dan  05:27
song is amazing. He is great and he's choosing good music and I want to celebrate that because I had forgotten about quarter flash right. I heard it

Jordan  05:36
right there. Well, I mean, he is an Austin you know he's in a solid musical city there so I expect that he he's in the know on at least some of that shit.

Dan  05:46
Yeah, but so it goes a little deeper on it. Here's my third thing that Alex Jones I want to give him some props for all right. This is him talking a little bit about his views on marijuana.

Alex Jones  05:57
Okay. No plant has more medicinal uses than Mary Jane. I mean, it is a gift from God. It's 1000s of them. It's incredible. I want to decriminalize

Dan  06:09
I fully support this. Wow. That's amazing

Jordan  06:12
on unqualified agreement with Alex Jones. Yep, we have found it. Finally middle ground. We can begin from here. Yeah. So what we'll do

Dan  06:26
that's why I want to talk about it. Yeah, this is an episode that will be like no other because we have legitimately felt and there's another one I think that will both agree. Oh shit. Two and one episode are weird. Like Alex 100%. I still think you're a bigot. But I agree marijuana can be used for so many different things. That is there's no reason that you'd be well

Jordan  06:47
and as we know when he does get high, he goes into 12 dimensional shifts. So maybe we're all better off whenever Mary Jane is legal. I don't like I don't like him calling him Mary Jane either. Yeah. What What year is this?

Dan  07:02
Are you Tom Petty?

Jordan  07:03
I don't even like anybody calling it pot anymore.

Dan  07:05
What about reefer?

Jordan  07:06
Reefer? Gross?

Dan  07:07
What about the sweet herbs?

Jordan  07:09
I didn't know. That was one. I feel like you may have just made that out about little Indian boy,

Dan  07:13
little. Back in the day, we found like this long printout of slang terms of the years for marijuana. And one of them was a little Indian boy, but it was it's like how every now and again, you'll see those breakdowns of what the nation calls soda. And somewhat like that's like 50% soda, right? 50 or 20% Coke right? And then like down the bottom, it's like 1% fizzy water fizzy fizzy one

Jordan  07:39
calls it fizzy fizzy water. Why not just call it a phosphate then god damn it French

Dan  07:45
call it a blossom gases.

Jordan  07:48
I like that a lot. I mean, I think we should call that marijuana from now on.

Dan  07:52
It's French for fizzy beverage.

Jordan  07:53
God dammit. You've tricked me.

Dan  07:56
So Alex actually, he talks even a little bit more although

Jordan  07:59
I do disagree with him. I believe ginkgo biloba is the ultimate in plants that can heal people. I

Dan  08:04
have no idea. No clue used to take.

Jordan  08:07
I just like to I just love saying ginkgo biloba. It's great. It's supposed to help your memory. I think it reminds me of shaggy or whatever with Mr. Love.

Marty DeRosa  08:14
Ginkgo biloba, global Loba.

Dan  08:17
So he actually talks a little bit more about his feelings about marijuana in this next clip. And one thing that's really actually super awesome about this next clip, is that he talks about it in opposition to the beliefs of the Trump administration. What which is God same is happening I don't know it's crazy.

Alex Jones  08:37
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS just hinted at crackdown on legal marijuana. Well, he didn't tell him he didn't hint at it. He did it this is a bad move. Support police getting training and funding and medical care they need and and not demonizing police in the community and holding up the good officers as an example of real community policing. Make it an honorable profession so we get more good people to be part of it. Pay him more and don't make it be based on revenue generation.

Jordan  09:09
What in God's name is happening? It's all good luck you freezing What have you done? This is? Oh, did you text him before this episode just like hey, let's see what kind of cool shit we can get him to say, fuck is happening? How dare you? How am I still surprised? We've been doing this shit for months. And now I'm finding out that I'm okay with some of the things he thinks and there's no conspiracy either. No, that's just perfect. You shouldn't tie into revenue. No. But that's the whole reason that they that's the whole reason that they that sessions and wants to criminalize it is because revenue because of revenue because one of the things that they do is that if they suspect money is involved with drugs, yeah, they can just take it. Well, there's a law of seizure there. There's no challenge to that. You can just take it

Dan  09:59
we're gonna have to put this clip on and go to another

Jordan  10:05
clip. Excellent, excellent.

Alex Jones  10:07
You know if you guys want to call in and disagree with me about my gushing over Trump, please call in and make your real point. I don't like the asset forfeiture seizures a lot of that's unconstitutional. fuck is happening. But then Trump's like we could take yachts away from drug dealers. Yeah, but not all ladies cash and he's Texas. In those corrupt towns, most of them are corrupt. But when you get a bad town and unfortunately Texas is got the best in the worst of police. And there are some bad places in East Texas. My family by the way on my dad's house from there, so I know I'm not bashing.

Dan  10:42
This is not bashing East Texas.

Jordan  10:44
He's he knows he knows an old lady you fuck now. Yeah, because of the cops. That is a that is a man who's like, Yeah, I hate that. He said old. I mean, Laurie Sinha? I mean, old lady. They took an old lady's one a sweet old lady. She was my dealer for about three years. You get

Dan  11:02
that? Yes. Another thing we agree with him? Yeah, yeah. civil forfeiture. forfeiture is why constitutional? It's wildly inappropriate. Yeah, I think that to some degree, you should be able to take ill gotten gains from people, you know, like, but that should also apply to marauding billionaires. So like, it shouldn't just be poor people and drug dealers who get their shit taken away. It should be all sorts of like, right, but it's like

Jordan  11:29
cars and entire global recession, right. And then lobby to get all of the rules that kept that global Reception Reception Reception. We shouldn't have a global recession, we should have a global reset. That's what Davao says that's what sessions fucking did with the Russians see what I'm doing? Thank you. topicals fuck, um, no. Like those guys destroyed everything. But because they're still billionaires. Now. You know, Dodd Frank, and all that shit is getting repealed because they're rich enough to buy Republicans?

Dan  12:03
Yep. Yep, fucked up. But more fucked up is that we have two concrete examples that Alex is saying. of philosophical agreements. Right?

Jordan  12:14
So that's where what we're at now is two for the plus column. Yeah. And what is it? 6474 in the negative, right, it's tough. I mean, I've got little light check marks on the other notes.

Dan  12:30
So I know he's a horrible bigot and a propagandist. Right, man. All right on the weed brother.

Jordan  12:38
Again, he's in he is in Austin, like I bet he I bet he walks down the streets and just smells marijuana all day every day. If you're if you're that, and it is, it is another one of those things where I do kind of believe that if he just accepted a lot more black people and a lot more gay people and trans people into his life and his community. He would think the same way about them as he does about marijuana where it's just totally possible. Hey, man, we should just fucking leave those people alone. What are we doing? I like Tad, it well, Tanya, but his name's tad now honest, he definitely wouldn't grow into the music proper. No, no, not gonna happen there.

Dan  13:20
I think that if he didn't erroneously believe that the globalists were behind everything, he might be a great person.

Jordan  13:30
I don't know I think we were screwed. Since he was six. He had the he had the brain of an 80 year old man.

Dan  13:35
A lot of this bigotry and stuff comes from his belief that he thinks that it's social manipulation, and trying to control us through getting rid of genders and trying to spark race wars and stuff like that, if he didn't believe that there was a shadowy Jew order, because that's really what he's saying. Like, that's really what's behind it. When you say globalist, it's the Jews. But like, if you didn't believe that, all of that stuff would go away. And maybe what we'd be left with is a kind of angry dude, who also believes that we should be legal and doesn't pick the cops should fuck with you.

Jordan  14:11
Yeah, but then see that that's the ultimate.

Dan  14:15
He he's only anti immigrant, in as much as he speaks about on his show, right? Because he thinks that the globalists are flooding our country with immigrants to destroy us.

Jordan  14:26
Does he? Is that really why he's anti immigrant? Is it the racism that who knows is it the racism comes from the globalism or is it the globalism comes from the race?

Dan  14:37
That's a great great question. It is a chicken. Yeah, it's the chicken and

Jordan  14:41
the I hope eggs aren't allowed to procreate in Tuskegee. I don't know that one got away from me.

Dan  14:47
Anyway, less Do you think that this is all going to be an Alex Jones love fest? It's not. But of course, I wanted to you know, it is important that we we are fair, we're not here to just shit on everything he says right? He has some good points. But I also want to say that when we get to this the end of this episode, I want to remember the pro decriminalization of marijuana and the anti civil forfeiture right off. And I want us to think about how little agreeing philosophically really matters. But how is

Jordan  15:19
it that he doesn't take the very same arguments for those things that he makes? And then realizes that he is making the exact opposite of those arguments for so many other things? I don't know. Like, how do you not have any kind of logical consistency there? Oh, no, no, I mean, he. Now admittedly, this is not a trait that is unique to him at

Dan  15:44
all. No Sure. There's a lot of people who suffer from

Jordan  15:46
this is kind of a human trait. Really, that whole cognitive dissonance situation there were a lot of people don't

Dan  15:51
analyze themselves much. Well, like the weak don't understand logic. Right?

Jordan  15:56
Well, like the town. The one in the news now where it's at that M Night Shyamalan movie. I was actually talking about the Ben Affleck Ben Affleck. starring Jon Hamm, the most handsome man that aliens have ever created.

Dan  16:12
He's a globalist. I assume he is. Alright. Sorry.

Jordan  16:19
No, the town that was overwhelmingly pro Trump, 70% of the town voted for them. And then all of a sudden, they know a guy who's getting kicked out and they're like, oh, wait, I didn't think you were gonna kick out a good illegal immigrant. Like no fucking duck. Yeah, I've been shouting at you this whole fucking time. Yeah, I feel no sympathy for

Dan  16:42
them. Or you feel sympathy for the guy who's getting deported. Yeah.

Jordan  16:45
Although, although now it's kind of like, Dude. Those guys kind of hated you. You can see that.

Dan  16:53
You know what it is? It's the inverse of the they're gonna take our guns. Yeah, it's like, they're gonna keep firing. We keep warning like, this is gonna go bad. They're not going to do literally what they're saying. Right? He says he's gonna deport just violent criminals and illegals and the bad ones. That's not what's gonna happen.

Jordan  17:13
Because that's not how you you can't you can't figure that out. And with the Oh, yeah, go

Dan  17:19
ahead. The other side is like, Nah, he's just, you know, we're like, he's not gonna, he's not gonna stick to that. And they're like, Nah, he is it's fine. Meanwhile, the right is like, Obama is gonna take our guns and all of us are like, he's not dressed. Just please stop. That's not and lo and behold, he doesn't. Well,

Jordan  17:35
I mean, it's, I think it's genuinely turned into everybody now lives in their own reality. And that is not exclusive to the GOP. Although the GOP is entirely living inside its own reality. Yeah, if you if you support if you support Trump now, there's only three possible reasons. You are either in denial. You are stupid Russia or you're a racist. And I think for Russia, I think Russia is all three of those. I think they've nailed it. Only Putin is the he's the only pure Trump I think he's the only genius in global politics. Now.

Dan  18:17
We WarGames that last night. Yep. Yeah, we there's just no downside for Putin in all of this. Yeah. Because he's just watching America tear itself apart with his fake $100,000 a year salary sitting on his possible 100 billion dollar fucking, he knows Gold Tower like Scrooge McDuck. He knows that the only downside possible is another proxy war. Yeah. And the only downside to that is he might lose some troops, but most of the casualties will be of whatever country ends up being fought him, right. Or like in Syria, it's nonsense. Like that's not a real downside to autocratic doesn't care.

Jordan  19:03
Well, not only that, but you know, with, with other with other autocratic dictators, you know, like your, your Saddam's of the world. I assume there's more than one. They you know, that guy after I wreck fell Hidin in underground bunker. And then it gets murdered, right? You do not see Putin get murdered. Even if the entire country unites against Putin. He's in a helicopter in fucking Mars tomorrow, living like a billionaire.

Dan  19:36
He is a base on the Arctic coast. Yeah, there is no way you get Putin. Anyway. We're rambling too long. That's right. Let's get back to this clip where Alex is talking about weed because here's where it takes a strange turn and he makes an admission about Jeff Sessions.

Alex Jones  19:52
And again, we don't want to run around though and after half the young people who smoke pot they're not going to quit smoking pot, Senator session. I don't know that the Attorney General listens to the show. I'll just leave it at that. I know.

Jordan  20:06
Well, that's scary.

Alex Jones  20:08
I haven't know behind the scenes, there were some moves made to keep before Obama even left in going after me. And that the word was put out you do that we're going to overthrow it as soon as we get in. I mean, session has been one of my biggest allies. I'm just saying, I'm your ally to sir.

Dan  20:22
Oh, good, really bite him in the not a

Jordan  20:25
good thing. Now. He was very proud of that. In that sentence. He tomorrow will not be very proud of that at all. Another

Dan  20:32
reminder that this was the day before these perjury,

Jordan  20:38
I think it's amazing now that we're on a what a difference a day makes every single day

Dan  20:43
he keeps ending? Well, and that's why I wished that the next day, you would have been in hardcore defense mode, right? As opposed to just dismissive. This is nothing, right? That's boring, right? The juxtaposition of that isn't really, it's not really that much different in his head, because he doesn't think all this is real. He doesn't think all the Russia stuff and the perjury stuff is real, in the same way that I made the argument. Well,

Jordan  21:08
even well, he kind of does, because he has said in the past that, yeah, Russia was involved in the election. But that's because they were helping root out evil.

Dan  21:18
He said that they've infiltrated our government. Yeah, that's right. He did say that literally said

Jordan  21:21
that. Yeah. And now he's 100%. Correct. We agree again, we got three now.

Dan  21:27
Alright, let's finish this clip.

Alex Jones  21:29
And you don't want to start a fight with what's the statistic, something like 80% of America admitted smoked marijuana at one time or another. And then the last time I saw it was like 47% smoking on a regular basis, guys, Google, how many Americans smoked marijuana and studies? I mean, it varies in the study, but those numbers are pretty accurate. I've seen it repeatedly. You can't do this. I mean, this will be a disaster for Trump getting young people involved in liberty movement. Here's the deal sessions. If you call for banning liquor, then I would say it's not hypocritical but liquor kills a lot. And I saw the quote from sessions in my stack. This one I'm going off of the shag I was gonna leave this alone, but I can't handle it. He said marijuana causes people to be violent and causes violence. No, it doesn't. Not. People don't get in fights on marijuana. They don't speed on it. They drive 40 and 60 in the slow lane is a road common

Jordan  22:31
is a road hack.

Alex Jones  22:32
And by the way, that's my cup of tea. I'm just being honest about it.

Dan  22:35
See, this is the side of Alex that Luers dumb people in Yeah, again, because it's like, and it's even impressive. I hate that our first 25 minutes of this show has been loves us.

Jordan  22:47
Yeah. But like then all Well, I mean, go back through our catalog. Don't Don't worry. We've got we got plenty of negative on him.

Dan  22:54
I've legitimately over the course of this last. I don't know, two three months of listening to him every day. Never heard him break ranks. With the Trump administration. Really the only time he's ever criticized Trump was about torture. And we played that clip on this one of the episodes right and his reasoning was that because you shouldn't torture people because it causes bad PR Yeah, not because you shouldn't torture people and if you torture them, you gotta kill them. That was his argument. So

Jordan  23:24
like so if you arrest people for marijuana, you gotta kill him but that's if A then B this is marijuana

Dan  23:32
then kill a flunky syllogism but yeah, I've never heard him like even indirectly be like this is a bad idea. Don't do this right. The only other thing I guess is maybe like and I kind of agree with him for different reasons. He was like Don't let Flynn resign Yes, I agree with him. But but only if we're being strategic about Trump's goal

Jordan  23:56
well and even now now that we know that Sessions is getting hit Flynn would have been a great distraction for that like the longer you keep Flynn there the more he's like the the beachhead and everybody else's all of their Russian connections the entire fucking administration apparently Yeah, you

Dan  24:14
need what is it in like role playing games? Are those massive online Yeah, you need. You need a tank you need someone who's just got a lot of hit points. And that

Jordan  24:24
means that Sessions is our magic user. I believe that's what we're trying to say. He's the he's the wizard in the background. He

Dan  24:30
certainly has the look. But like you I don't think sessions can be the tank. Yeah, he's

Jordan  24:38
a half elf half half leg.

Dan  24:40
But then where do you go like he's got to fall and then the dominoes just keep going. Oh, yeah. No, you did to hold strong with Flynn. But once he once he toppled

Jordan  24:49
then everybody because and we said this back then now there's blood in the water, and blood is everywhere. Now.

Dan  24:57
Fourth thing we agree with Alex In different sides. Yeah, exactly. But it's very impressive to me to see that disagreement with his avowed team. Yes. It's impressive, but it's, it's it's utterly meaningless.

Jordan  25:15
Yeah. I hope full stop.

Dan  25:20
I would like it if he was more like this regularly.

Jordan  25:24
I would like it if literally anybody in the GOP house was more like this regularly. They just voted again to keep Trump from releasing his tax tax returns, or anybody seeing them. Yeah, like anybody.

Dan  25:38
Oh, and I heard some Senator came out of the secret room where they've got the new health care bill, and he was quoted as saying, there's no bill in there.

Jordan  25:48
Oh, yeah. Rand Paul went on a nice little Chase today. He brought a printer with him which also it was a giant printer. He didn't have like a travel bag with a nice little printer. And it was old school. Yeah, exactly. With the with the holes that you have to punch off to actually carry the paper weights

Dan  26:08
utter insanity. And this this, like, I hate that there's a show called House of Cards because this house of cards is going to fall

Jordan  26:15
it sure seems like it even then in the show House of Cards, at least people were in, in his own party where like, maybe he's a bad dude.

Dan  26:23
I watched the show up until his wife gave a dying due to hand job. And then I was like, I'm out of here.

Jordan  26:27
Right? What? I watched the first season and then the first episode of the second season whenever we push that reporter off of the spoiler alert. Train. I was like, alright, alright guys, where are we? Are we doing that? Let's

Dan  26:42
not turn this into a TV review show.

Jordan  26:45
Well, it's it's hard to agree with him without then just kind of rambling off. Like, what the fuck is happening betrays

Dan  26:51
the premise of our show. But actually, that's not true. Our premise of the show is to document what he's up to. Yeah. And unfortunately, it's usually terrible. It is almost always here. And I assure you by the time this episode ends, we're gonna get right back to terrible we're getting

Jordan  27:06
well look, I mean, hey, that's awesome. You support marijuana legalization. Yeah, you also support keeping trans people stuck into their fucking horrible or killing them. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So no, fuck off.

Dan  27:23
So here is our next clip. This gets away from the good bad dichotomy, right? This is just Alex sort of talking about how he's not a fear monger. And then also, he gets a little bit into the Trump's speech before the house,

Jordan  27:40
their their concentration camps at the airport? I'm not a fear monger. Yeah, buy these survival supplies. I would never be a fear monger. No.

Alex Jones  27:49
Now there were a lot of good patriots and the government and other corporations and groups all over the world and see this globalist plan and now know how evil it is and have gone and read the writings of the globalist. We've popularized a lot of those I can say our audience has helped get that info out. I always believed that if we told people what was happening in the world and expose the globalist in their own words, and how diabolical it was that people would unify and wake up and start resisting. That's why they always denied it existed even though it was being built in blind you.

Dan  28:20
I've gone and read a lot of stuff that he directs people to. And it doesn't say the things he he claims, of course, not in much the same way that he just misrepresents news stories, right read based on headlines and fake skimming. Yeah, he's done the exact same thing and building up his case, that evil globalist group exists, right. It's It's utter insanity.

Jordan  28:44
You know, here's the weirdest part I am starting. The more I listened to him. The more I'm starting to notice the parallels between his globalist rantings with just billionaires. Like it does seem like all billionaires basically know each other. And all of them are directing every country. Like even now I am Oh, I am thinking about you're going to I'm going to have gone all the way back. I would fool you. You've turned me I would now I support Alex Jones on marijuana, which basically means I agree with everything he's ever said. No, no, I mean, the more the more I think about this whole Trump situation, the more I think you know who the real enemy is, that billionaires fucking own the entire government likes just by politicians. And this has always been true, but now they finally won. And now I'm kinda like, These people don't have a country. They don't have any association with the United States. They're international corporations. Oh, no national corporations. They don't care if the country goes well or bad. They don't care about poor people. What they really care about is getting as much money out of the Oh god. I'm turning in

Alex Jones  29:55
Alex Jones. And guess what common sense prevailed show many people thought I was As a fear monger you are I thought I was saying all this just to be listened bubble, and not in that and that and that people were cowards and would hear this and hide under their beds. Some people hid under their beds, people that Kelly didn't. And so we've just begun to fight. Now the enemies out in the open saying world governments good and we should all just accept it. And so one of us on elected to see how far we've come. Everybody knows the Federal Reserve's private Trump's taking control of it, ordering him to loan money to small businesses, individuals.

Dan  30:29
I don't think that's happening.

Jordan  30:30
I don't think he's done anything even similar to ordering people to loan money to small businesses,

Dan  30:36
certainly not in these executive orders that he's signed. Oh, no,

Jordan  30:39
absolutely not.

Dan  30:40
Also, I'm not entirely sure. Like, I know that the Federal Reserve is private, but it's a really weird, murky territory. But also, I don't know if Trump has the authority to take over this private institution.

Jordan  30:52
I don't I frankly, I have read so much about the Federal Reserve, I still have no fucking clue what they do other than sometimes somebody will go on TV and be like, we're raising interest rates. Yeah, point, two 5%

Dan  31:07
They control the money supply, essentially, in order to make sure that our dollar doesn't become valueless. Right. That's a large part of what they do. And that's what the interest rates play into. Okay, so like, but it is in there, but they're private. Yeah, it's not it's not a government entity. It is its own like it's an independent, but it's a thing that controls the government's money. But it's it's intimately intertwined with the game, right? It

Jordan  31:34
has to be Yeah, otherwise, that would otherwise you've just got random guys. Money is free now. Like, yeah, it's gotta be there's gotta be some kind of

Dan  31:45
idea that it's private doesn't take everything into account. But it is. If you just take that simple fact. It is really, it sounds really fucked up. Really strange. Yeah. But as you get into more of the details about the government being able to impose things on it, it's not really as nefarious.

Jordan  32:03
And it does, it does kind of make sense. The more you think about the way China's currency is regulated, which is just the fearless leader ban like, money's free now. I don't know. Yeah, I have I have no clue what it is that the the Federal Reserve,

Dan  32:25
for we aren't economists or policy, why

Jordan  32:27
are they good? Are they bad? I don't know. We're not policy walks. When the Federal Reserve has evolved,

Alex Jones  32:32
ordering and alone massive money to cities and counties and folks that follow initiatives to hire American. You're about to see the power of the big fat state turned loose, to actually empower people. That's why they are particularly angry because everything they built to screw us over is being taken away, to re empower us and then be dismantled and handed back to the states and the people. It's so good. It's so beautiful. It's so pure. It's so winner. So winner.

Dan  33:04
Yeah, you know, Charlie Sheen. Did you pause

Jordan  33:07
this clip right before he said chicken dinner? What happened? I

Dan  33:10
wish I mean, he does hit me. He hangs out Charlie Sheen. So winning and Trump's does hang out with Charlie Sheen. We're friends. That's weird. But also it goes back to the star fucker thing. Oh, yeah, that's true. Any celebrity that would hang out with him. But also, that, what was I lost my thought. I got distracted by Charlie Sheen.

Jordan  33:35
That that will happen. Two and a Half Men was great. I'm not the first now. Come on, we're going

Alex Jones  33:41
to win win win. You're going to have so much winning or to say please stop the winning. It's too much. I'm gonna say no. Because the truth is winning like this is gonna be a great responsibility. I remember great

Jordan  33:52
winning comes great responsibility. We all know this.

Dan  33:55
I remember why I paused it. Yes. Because when you said fake laugh, you're totally right. In the video, he's about to hit the desk really hard. And you'd see him stop himself and fake laugh. It's like, oh my god. This is this is clunky.

Jordan  34:09
He was he was about to pray. And then he started laughing like what is happening?

Dan  34:13
He was about to emphasize his laugh by hitting the desk himself. Because he hits the desk all the fucking time.

Jordan  34:18
Yeah, yeah. Can you can hear in just about every clip, dunk, dunk. I hear that in my dreams.

Alex Jones  34:26
And not using incredible power. The United States is about to have again times 100 yen, and not let that be turned towards evil, but turned towards truly promoting human dignity and freedom and the next level for our species and all the advances that Trump started to talk about, again in science and technology and medicine that are right around the corner and you look in his eyes, they already got them. They just don't know how to deploy them yet.

Jordan  34:52
From the 12th dimensional beings, all right.

Alex Jones  34:56
From sitting in the White House going they've got all these cancer cures. and all this state are running eugenics program. With fluoride in the water and the vaccines with the additives to brain damage people, what the hell have people been thinking? Good quote is Trump's even more hardcore and more focused? Now? Here's

Jordan  35:16
here's here's this is after the State of the

Dan  35:18
Union, isn't it? It wasn't the State of the Union. It was just the address. Oh, which right? Yeah,

Jordan  35:23
I don't know. It was the it was the speech gave to Congress. Yeah. Yeah. So this is when even the presses like, well, he sure did look presidential guys,

Dan  35:34
right. But that's like, that's like, what a group of policies. It's like giving an A for effort. You know, it's like, that's it's damning.

Jordan  35:44
Praise, instead of instead of like grading, it was just a plus minus, that's really what it was. We now

Dan  35:52
have a president who went to like an alternative school. He's going to a hippie school. Right. But that thing that he's talking about

Jordan  36:00
how you feel, man, how do you feel about this school?

Dan  36:05
But what Alex is talking about with this, like the cures and all this, we're gonna let loose all of the that all these life saving technologies. That's not what Trump is doing.

Jordan  36:16
That's not not only is that not what Trump is doing? That's still not a thing? No, there's no way he could

Dan  36:22
do when Trump is talking about all these cures and stuff like that. What he's talking about is making it easier for drugs to get on the market. Right. He's talking about repealing regulations of the FDA. drugs don't have to be tested

Jordan  36:37
all the cancer cares. Yeah, who was his is going to test those cancer cares, then people would be cured of cancer. That's the

Dan  36:44
most expensive part of creating a drug. Yeah. And for a reason, because you can do serious damage to people. Yeah, and I can't wait. Yeah, hit Trump's pick for the FDA chair. He said literally, I don't think that you should have to prove drugs work. Yeah.

Jordan  36:59
What Yeah, the the pic for the EPA chair was like, I don't think the environments Okay. You guys want one? I don't I'm again, it seems pointless. Yeah. What are we doing with this environment? Shit. Why are you guys breathing? But this goes

Dan  37:13
back to like Alex being like, marijuana should not be criminal. Right. That's concrete. And right down the middle. Yeah, with done with extensive testing him saying that Trump is about to release these mysterious secret cancer cures and shit. Is him reading into what Trump is saying. But all he's saying is essentially, I'm going to make it easier for drug companies to fuck you over. Right? Where is his interpretation of Alex's interpretation of it is oh, my God, all the secret technology we're about to get at this is where he becomes an idiot. Yeah, yeah.

Jordan  37:48
Although, although now I do think anybody actually tells Trump anything. Or Alex, you mean, no, Trump? I don't know. I mean, period. Do you think anybody one? He's got no cabinet, basically. Yeah. And nobody in the government could have

Dan  38:04
less of a cabinet in about a week.

Jordan  38:07
Yeah, he's running out of cabinet real fast.

Dan  38:09
I saw earlier today that they, they like the Senate confirmed. It was Rick, and Rick Perry is Rick Perry. They confirm the two of them. It's like, why are you doing that? Wait, yeah.

Jordan  38:22
You're just gonna undo that. I think the worst part is that Rick Perry is probably the most blameless person here mainly because I don't know if Rick Perry knows where he is at any given point in time. No, he certainly doesn't know what he is becoming the Cabinet member for him.

Dan  38:37
He strikes me as a less funny version of Duke from the critic. Like in his office, he has those hillbilly bears. That's that's where I see curious Yeah. Oh, my God, animatronic bears. Yeah, we were though bears who sing for Duke. Anyway, let's move on.

Alex Jones  38:56
Because everything he'd read about and heard about and been told about in behind the scenes channels, he now knows is all true and worse than he thought. And he's like, Good God, we got to shut this cancer down. And the cancer is freaking out. So Michael Moore, in the clip I just played is saying oh at dinner. And they just make up news reports, weather spies and people listing Oh, he had well done steak and ketchup not even true. Or oh, he was looking at classified stuff with the Japanese Prime Minister. minutes after the missile launch. They were looking at news reports behind closed doors classified different, that's everything's alive. Oh, he's at dinner with you know, with his son in law, and Bannon and they decide to go after these al Qaeda and ISIS targets. He told you in the campaign he was he was advised by the former head of Defense Intelligence that knew about all the targets and all the planning between all the agencies that

Dan  39:49
but he's, he's conflating things there. Yeah, that's, that's,

Jordan  39:52
that's very different. For one first, why would you make up the well done steak and ketchup thing,

Dan  39:58
so make him look gauche?

Jordan  39:59
That's the seems but yeah, but that's so that's just so weird. Also, who cares? Yeah, who cares?

Dan  40:04
It's letter letter.

Jordan  40:05
Whatever bullshit that he wants to eat

Dan  40:07
right sometimes. Whenever it's like when I when I was younger I don't know if I would still do this today. I would do it on Thanksgiving turkey,

Jordan  40:15
put them ketchup and you put some ketchup in your revealing a lot about yourself.

Dan  40:19
Yeah, write an article about it while people like

Jordan  40:23
we will eventually get big enough for the WaPo to be pissed off about your food choices. Oh, we can only hope but but the Japanese thing that's the Japanese Prime Minister not the Japanese thing when you said thinking about the situation. Yeah, yeah, that no, that was their pictures. There are pictures there are pictures of that happening did happen. Everybody's watching it.

Dan  40:45
And the thing about them deciding to go on that Yemen raid over a dinner dude have did happen. There's a good reporting on that.

Jordan  40:53
And he didn't know the intelligence and as the good reporting showed the intelligence was like, maybe don't do this.

Dan  40:59
And he didn't monitor it. Nope. So oh, he was

Jordan  41:03
playing golf or some shit, right? Or he was tweeting. That's what they said at the same time that the Yemen raid was going on. He was tweeting but

Dan  41:10
all of this that Alex is saying is like data, so I'll make all this shit up. No one did. You're making that

Jordan  41:16
true. But God damn it, he can repeat it real strong.

Alex Jones  41:20
God dammit he can. Flynn's job was to have a bird's eye view of the whole deal. Just like Director of National Intelligence. But they just say oh, Trump, you know, just a shot at it Ghana just randomly to go attack Yemen.

Dan  41:36
He did. Maybe not.

Jordan  41:42
randomly. Like, now I suddenly have this thought of him over a well done steak really trying to dig in with that steak knife. Poor and more and more catch up on just going like, yeah, man, let's burn it down. And they're like, no, let's just send one guy in. Yeah,

Dan  41:57
it's just just Ryan. Yeah.

Jordan  42:01
Who's poor widow is used as a prop.

Dan  42:04
We're gonna get to that in a second. Well, but also Yeah, I mean, nothing, nothing but respect for our fallen. I don't have anything else to say. Yeah. Move on.

Alex Jones  42:14
And then some people got killed. Imagine that. They sign up for these dangerous missions. They signed up to be commandos and some people get killed. For I don't think they knew that's what they signed up for. Because they know they're talking to their coward audience of MSNBC. And CNBC. They're talking to that coward audience is like, yeah, they signed up to be on the welfare rolls and the Navy SEALs. They signed up for Delta Force and the Army Rangers and the Green Berets and marine force recon. Some people would wipe their noses for them. And they try to steal the glory of the fallen soldier.

Dan  42:57
Do you think he's gonna say that Trump is trying to steal the glory?

Jordan  43:00
Oh, oh, well, we've agreed with him multiple times today. So let's go for a double whammy. No, whammies, no whammies

Dan  43:08
whammy of the sailor.

Alex Jones  43:12
And then turn it around that Trump's opportunistic and Trump doesn't care. And Trump's bad and how dare them have this widow here? Sickening. And of course, he says how you just broke a record. They're trying to say writings? No, he meant for the longest standing ovation. No one.

Dan  43:30
No one was making the argument of ratings. They were just saying it was tacky for him to bring sort of crowd response.

Jordan  43:35
It was manipulative, tacky and horrible.

Dan  43:38
And a lot of people I've seen a lot of military folks that I've seen responding to it agree with the left. They were very pissed off, especially considering it had been like, what less than a month since he died. Yeah, that's that's incredibly inappropriate. Yeah, that sort of thing at best.

Jordan  43:55
Yeah, I do. I do want to I do know, I don't know how much I agree and disagree with the that's what they signed up for line. Because there is a certain amount of that where it is it is kind of like, yeah, you join them until military. You are a Navy SEAL. You knew when you went on this this mission that there was a possibility of this occurring. And a

Dan  44:17
Navy Seal is not an entry level position. Especially those do six Yeah, those dudes go through crazy training. You have to you have to really work your way there. Right. So then, but then there's

Jordan  44:27
the other thought that I have, which is that one of the main reasons that people sign up for the military is because they are poor and it's the way out for them.

Dan  44:36
Sure, they have all these programs that they can get insurance and they can get college exact location. So nobody's going in there to die. Especially if you join during peace times and then there's a war and then you're in and you get stop loss like

Jordan  44:51
that, like that Futurama episode where it's like, oh, we can use this to get free gum right and he's like, Yeah, unless war word to declared, and then they and he goes, war was declared

Dan  45:05
number back to TV review never gonna stop. But yeah, so I mean, I agree with you that it's a murky area the idea of dismissing soldiers deaths because they signed up for it right first of all, you should never minimize their deaths because of that right. But secondarily Yeah, I think that there is a difference between a private infantry man, let's say, and someone on the seals, there's a difference in their stature, right, and what their their goals

Jordan  45:32
are and what they're capable of. Absolutely. Because it's, I mean, it is one of those things where you know, want to know, you do know that the seals are really, really good at this shit. And there's a, there's a possibility, maybe not a great one, that he completely succeeded.

Dan  45:51
But no one signs up to die. No one signs up.

Jordan  45:56
I'm not gonna say no, what my goal there someday there's some days where I'm thinking, Oh, that's a good way to go. Why not?

Dan  46:03
You're gonna get some valor. Exactly. Your family will be proud.

Jordan  46:07
It's a it's like people who die by like the the cops who say some crazy people choose death by cop suicide by cop. Exactly. Yeah. Where it's like, yeah, I mean, that's one way to do it

Dan  46:18
a little less valor in that situation a little bit less. So yeah, he has some more thoughts about all this.

Alex Jones  46:25
He was trying to make her feel good. And it was so genuine. It was so real. And they hate that charisma. I mean, I've got so much important news to cover. But if you understand this, you understand everything. Let's go ahead and play the end of that club. We didn't get to know. But then why tonight, I know, to say, Oh, we got all this treasure trove and using but he started to stop this throughout the clip. They admittedly got a whole bunch of hard drives and computers and the rest of it. That's why they didn't just drop a bunch of bombs on.

Dan  47:03
But they didn't get any good information. No. So I mean, multiple, multiple sources. Yep, have very clearly said, now we got nothing the raid well, but they always say yet. So there is a decent chance that maybe something will come out. But at this point to say that it was a success. Decent

Jordan  47:23
is very optimistic. There's a possibility I would not say decent possibility. I'm sure

Dan  47:27
there's an outside possibility. Yeah, that that something will come along and you know, whatever. But at present, be able to torture somebody else At press time making the argument that they got great information out of it. And Michael Moore is an asshole for suggesting otherwise, right? That's absolutely just lying. Right? That's so I don't care that you would like weed.

Alex Jones  47:51
Because they want me to kill or capture the people and get the intelligence. This was the ISIS command base for much of the Middle East. And their headquarters. Was it to understand they wanted to get into the headquarters and get the data or they could have just dropped a bunch of 2000 pound bombs on it are flown around with C 130s. With you know, howitzers hanging off the side and blown the place in the molten slag. They wanted the intelligence that's the point of going on the mission.

Dan  48:22
Also, they couldn't have done that because they would have been an incredible war crime. Yeah, dropping

Jordan  48:29
not that it would be our first war crime.

Dan  48:31
No, it's even like touchy they killed like what 30 civilian

Jordan  48:36
I like I like how you very nearly said even for America that's a war crime. Yeah,

Dan  48:43
I mean, like even for us that's a big war crime indiscriminate like them going in killed tons of civilians. Yeah, them bombing would have killed hundreds of civilians.

Jordan  48:53
But we can't do that is that is one thing where I mean, yeah, Obama killed a lot of civilians. You you can't argue that point.

Dan  49:02
And he's not off the hook now or as we are concerned, right. We are liberal minded people who have always been opposed to that. Yeah. Then we have spoken out and been you could say were the extreme left maybe. So like, but him saying like they wanted the intelligence. That's why they went in it like there's other reasons. You can't go with that scorched earth technique there. So that's just stupid.

Jordan  49:25
And at no point does anybody bring up cuz it's immoral? Yeah. Scorched Earth is bad, sir. We know that because we did it a bunch of times.

Dan  49:35
We don't learn the lessons of the past and we don't Jordan. Here let's break it down. You got to get to a show. So we've got a shorter episode today. Yes, I apologize. But I am going to drop in some clips after our theme song which is just that.

Jordan  49:54
We are going to put in the we are going to put in the verse eventually. Yeah.

Dan  49:57
I I I have to do some major editing. Yeah, we're gonna have to do that. But we'll get there. I recorded an episode a couple of weeks back maybe about a month ago with our dear friend, the Larry's comedian, Marty DeRosa. We recorded an episode after the Super Bowl, where Alex Jones breaks down the events of the Super Bowl. There we go. And I've gone to Evergreen. Yeah, I'm going to add that into the end of this episode after after we're done. So look forward to that. Wonderful. But before we get out of here, we got one more clip. And this is where everything goes bad.

Jordan  50:32
You always end on a bad note. Not always. But we started on such a good we did we did this has been this has been a wonderful trip. The graph for this is the opposite of the graph for climate change. That's really what's going on here.

Dan  50:46
But this this clip is why no matter what you think about his philosophical beliefs about civil asset forfeiture, or marijuana legalization, you just can't get on board with this guy because he's a fucking dick. He's a fucking dick and an idiot. And here we go.

Alex Jones  51:05
I've never really seen a lot of white racism in my life. She's quite scared because

Dan  51:10
we got to start over because you yelled,

Jordan  51:11
I'm sorry. Okay, okay, it

Dan  51:15
gets so much worse. All right, if that was too much.

Alex Jones  51:21
I've never really seen a lot of white racism in my life. I really haven't. Obviously white scared because the media makes me scared everybody and overly guilty. But I have been in East Texas pulled over at 16 years of age with a half drunk six pack of beer. Wait, what? Two girls in the car my buddy coming back from the beach driving back to Dallas. And because we both had blond hair. The sheriff's deputy rolled up his sleeve with a big swastika and said Heil Hitler. Joy your beard.

Jordan  51:48
Isn't that white racism? Very much. Isn't that super white racism? Didn't you just say that I haven't seen any white racism and then saw a white dude say Heil Hitler.

Dan  51:59
The example that he comes up with immediately after saying, yeah,

Jordan  52:02
it's exactly what he described. It's

Dan  52:09
now watch as he continues the story. All right, and doesn't get the point. Okay, and then somehow flips it. anti-black.

Jordan  52:18
Oh, God. All right, the mic mic down.

Alex Jones  52:21
And I remember driving off going, man, it Chuck, if you were blacked out pulled over by that guy. There was another golfer, you got to have checks and balances on everybody. Because you can be pulling in place run by black folks and other races that they're going to Well, black people did something to me, I'm gonna do something to you. That's why you don't do something to somebody because of what color they are. You go off what somebody does and what they stand for. And who they are. Like Martin Luther King said you don't go off of and I've had for the racist white stuff I've seen I've got I'm not gonna exaggerate this true. 300 400 to one from black people. Now, does that mean I hate black people? Absolutely. Because most people are great, but there's a large minority of black people that are super racist. Which is even more racist. Those white people. It's the Liberals that watch MSNBC now that'll scream at you, hundreds of them when I was in DC, fu white male, sometimes a white male would say it. We got it on video. And people are like, that doesn't make sense. So white male would betray his race. I've even seen some of the more nationalistic kind of racist black sites even comment and say stuff about it. No, I think Alex Jones got a point. It's weird. Watch some cracker. Tell another cracker if you your wife. I mean, it's just it's weird. How did I go off on that Jag? Oh, that was talking about asset forfeiture seizures, you got to think about, think about all the angles to it.

Dan  53:53
When he thinks about a subject he thinks about all the

Jordan  53:57
all of the white nationalist angles you can take

Dan  54:00
that he thinks about that clip was two minutes long. It's not edited in any way. And it fully exposes I hate it deeply, deeply racist, Man,

Jordan  54:12
I hate it when we take him out of context. We have I hate it when we take him in context, actually, is what I meant to say. Yeah, because somehow in context, he's even worse. Yeah, like,

Dan  54:22
what do you take him out of context? It's just I'm policy wonk. Yeah. That sounds like pedophilia.

Jordan  54:30
Yeah, we got plenty of nice little bumps out of him even context

Dan  54:32
he's like white racism doesn't exist. A Nazi pulled me over and let me go because I was white. Sure, wouldn't want to be black getting pulled over by this guy,

Jordan  54:40
which is what he just described. Hey, he wouldn't want to be a different race because of this racist who's white, who's white? Also 300 400 to one Not

Dan  54:52
a chance, no chance he hypothetically created the exact right image in his head. like, man, it would suck to be black and be pulled over by this guy.

Jordan  55:03
It almost seemed like he had full on empathy in that situation was

Dan  55:07
not empathy. It was an imaginary situation to him as if a black person had never been pulled over by. Like, oh, wow, that would be wild. Yeah,

Jordan  55:15
I bet this Nazi has never pulled over a black guy.

Dan  55:18
Yeah, he's like, its weight is you want to think that he's halfway there. But he's not.

Jordan  55:25
He's living on a prayer.

Dan  55:28
He's not halfway there. This isn't ever gonna make progress. No, like, it's now he has

Jordan  55:35
enough. Maybe maybe on his deathbed. He'll be like, racism is real. No, not No, not a chance you don't chance.

Dan  55:44
Because he on his deathbed is gonna be like, Trump has a life saving cure that's gonna come in.

Alex Jones  55:51
He's gonna zero our

Jordan  55:55
trumpet has already been hung for treason when he's on his deathbed. And he's like, I bet that cures coming.

Jordan  56:00
He faked his hang. I don't think the globalists faked his Hey, that was a false flag false flag hanging.

Dan  56:06
So like, I mean, this is I think, the essence of what I always want this show to be about. And I'm glad that it can be very clear in this episode, is that, despite some some decent things that he says, which are incredibly rare, right, he is one of the worst people. Yeah, ever. One is just terrible. And that is spouting hatred.

Jordan  56:32
That is always that is always the weird thing about families and my own. And I'm sure plenty of our listeners have the same kind of dissonance there where he describes you know, this is how I raised my children. I raised them to be tolerant I raised them to love people. Yeah. And you're like, yes, you're doing great. He's like, but also I teach them that white racism doesn't exist. And you're like, No, you're doing

Dan  56:56
it wrong. white racism doesn't exist, but racism against white Yeah, exactly. 100 times more than anything else.

Jordan  57:04
I mean, it's, it's so you know, all of the all of the Christians now just going like, Hey, we should love everybody. God. Jesus said, Love thy neighbor as thyself, all of this stuff, and then the like, but yeah, let's kick immigrants out as quickly as possible and ruin their lives. And you're like, Oh, you're half you're,

Dan  57:22
you're so close. Not Close. Close. Not close. It appears close.

Jordan  57:26
And yet so far away.

Dan  57:27
It appears close. not close at all.

Jordan  57:30
I know. It's so hard. It's so hard to sit at Thanksgiving. And listen to my brother say, you know, 3 million illegal immigrants voted and not be like, you're a bad person should tell

Dan  57:42
them to listen to the show.

Jordan  57:43
I don't think I don't think you'd like it.

Dan  57:45
No, probably not.

Jordan  57:46
I know my I know my mom wouldn't like all the swears. Fuck. You just made my mom mad. Suck it. You just made Jesus cry.

Dan  57:56
That's not a first for us. But anyway, I wish that we had more time. I also wish that Alex would stop playing such good music on his show. That bums me out as soon as we stop recording. I'm gonna listen to that triumph. Fight the good fight to great song fight. You know what, I'm actually going to use that as a bumper music is that how we're gonna switch

Jordan  58:16
from us to 32 rows DeRosa

Hey, welcome back to knowledge fight. I am Dan. Today Jordan is not with us. He's not dead but he's just not with us in studio. So filling in as replacement Jordan, ladies and gentlemen. The very hilarious the very curious Marty DeRosa. I love you.

Marty DeRosa  1:02:58
Good to be back here.

Dan  1:02:59
This is a bit of a TYTYTW dot ytt reunion. That's right. Or old conspiracy podcast. That's what they want you to think. Yes. Which, sadly, we're both too busy for these days.

Marty DeRosa  1:03:10
Blame success people or the Illuminati one of the two or i Well, I'll say this. We haven't been on here in a while. On the on these. We haven't. We haven't. We haven't crossed microphones. While you've been so successful lately. I'm gonna say this. Yeah, really started out the Illuminati. Good are really starting to doubt him. I'm also on a fake news diet.

Dan  1:03:31
You mentioned that.

Marty DeRosa  1:03:32
What does that mean? I have not been an info warrior lately.

Dan  1:03:36
That's good. Probably haven't been.

Marty DeRosa  1:03:38
I used to wake up and go to Infowars I used to go to drudge I

Dan  1:03:42
Zero Hedge.

Marty DeRosa  1:03:44
I used to just kind of make the rounds.

Dan  1:03:46
But you didn't read those things seriously, right.

Marty DeRosa  1:03:50
I thought pizza gate was gonna be a whole big thing.

Dan  1:03:53
Which if you read conspiracy forums, it still might be still might be they had a big there's a we got to get to Alex Jones. We will. But before we do, it is important to bring this up. Yeah. There was a guy posting anonymously on 4chan guy named FBI anonymous. Oh, I like that. And he had

Marty DeRosa  1:04:11
one of those over on the red X squared circle. Oh, yeah. Often 19 something 1972 are turning to be Dolph Ziggler. No, he was just fucking saying here's who's gonna win every match. And he was fucking right every time. Oh, wow. And people kind of like, I don't know if this is fun. Well, this

Dan  1:04:25
guy might not be as accurate. But he does a lot of people believe he's just sort of role playing as a FBI Insider. And then a bunch of other people were like, No, this was for real. Yeah. But last time he made predictions, they all came true. Okay. They didn't really what's he saying? He was saying that we're recording this on Monday. Yes. And he is saying that. Hillary Clinton, John Podesta and then 30 plus big time household name politicians are about to get rolled up. Okay, in sex trafficking investigation, which is a little ambitious. I'm

Marty DeRosa  1:04:58
gonna say that won't happen. And I'm gonna say fake news. Let me down twice. And here's one first off I thought with the Hillary on 911 Sure. I'm like oh, here we go

Dan  1:05:10
we both kind of got a little bit duped by that. Yeah, the her being sick.

Marty DeRosa  1:05:15
Yeah. And I was like oh shit. And then I thought pizza gate was going to be

Dan  1:05:20
big I wish I wish we would have talked more about that when you were having those feelings. I could have helped you out a little bit

Marty DeRosa  1:05:26
and had you heard I heard I heard an A list a list or celebrity ringleader. What are

Dan  1:05:33
you doing those eyebrows?

Marty DeRosa  1:05:35
I'm gonna write his name down. I'm not gonna say his name because I'm not going to be

Dan  1:05:38
smart. Anybody will want to run afoul of slander law oh no no and and I think I think I'm mostly excited to know what you think is an A Lister. Oh, that's an A Lister

Marty DeRosa  1:05:49
plus Lister. But some people thought he was head of the because there's always that Corey Feldman had said or Cory Cory Feldman had said like there was an A list celebrity who was kind of in charge of all this

Dan  1:06:01
Yeah, I mean that goes That's a story as old as time Yeah. And you know real big

Marty DeRosa  1:06:05
celebrity if you know what I mean. Yeah, wink.

Dan  1:06:09
To be clear, I do think that there is abuse that goes on

Marty DeRosa  1:06:13
Absolutely. I know they busted Dennis from head of the class he was doing some stuff he was directing for Disney does not may Lister well I'm just saying you know and that kind of goes now hold Disney pedophile Sure. You know,

Dan  1:06:26
people you know people abuse power exist everywhere and that's

Marty DeRosa  1:06:29
damage quote. Yep. Absolute power corrupts corrupts people into being pedophiles, right. I

Dan  1:06:36
don't know if that's how it goes. But But anyway, let me ask you so how did you enjoy your Super Bowl? Do you have a good time?

Marty DeRosa  1:06:42
I didn't watch it. I didn't know I I was teaching. Oh, that's right.

Marty DeRosa  1:06:50
You're teaching I'm teaching

Marty DeRosa  1:06:52
underprivileged children how to be fun and how to be funny. And I say underprivileged children they're not but I that makes me feel a sense of humor as underprivileged and and I go out and care about the Super Bowl like that you guys care about Super Bowl, but I wouldn't care. I'm gonna go subclass anyway. And just do a bunch of football jokes. No. And then I came home and they were like the greatest Super Bowl of all time.

Dan  1:07:14
I think it was the first one that ever went to overtime.

Marty DeRosa  1:07:16
It was and it was the largest deficit a team came back from in one. It's pretty nuts

Dan  1:07:20
that this year we've had all of these major sports championships be like really buck wild. Yeah, Goldberg defeated Leser in under two minutes. That's insane. The Cavs came back from three one championship then cubs broke 100 year drought Yeah, it's it

Marty DeRosa  1:07:36
is made this may take the heat off of Golden State a little bit because the Golden State Blue a three one lead is a big like sign people hold up everywhere. Now. It's kind of a fun thing.

Dan  1:07:47
It seems fun. Yeah. Well, the reason I asked I your Super Bowl was because today we're going to be dealing with what Alex Jones was doing during the Superbowl. I

Marty DeRosa  1:07:56
was gonna ask I'm sure. He had lots to say about Lady Gaga as Illuminati ceremony here coming out. Was this her coming out ceremony much like

Dan  1:08:03
she's already had that. Okay, so there's a high priestess of this. Okay. Okay. I'm sure there was surprisingly little to say about that. Okay. He does hate her. And he does talk a little bit of shit. Yeah, literally and figuratively. Yeah, but let's just jump into it. This is how he decides to start off the show. This I want to give the sort of theme, overarching theme of the show, okay? Is insecurity of just Okay, so he gets into some polls, he wants to talk polls, Polish people, Hey,

Alex Jones  1:08:31
there's been a consolidation on purpose to make you poor by both parties. It's an admitted plan is that happens, the grassroots of every color, who are all the same race, humanity. all bleed red blood are waking up, and the poll numbers show him going straight up. He was at 41. Before the election was skewed numbers. Now he's up at 60. And they're panicking because those are even polls targeting key demographics. They believe it will show low numbers for Trump. His real numbers are above 70. Right now, remember, I told you that during the election, and it was true, Alex because there are internal polls you can get. But when you go to major pollsters, now they're so controlled, they will not give you a public poll, it's under contract that you can set the parameters of that are actually fair, and the demographics you want polled that are fair. They have their methodology. So the fix was in. And that's now come out. I told you the fix was him with poles. So the fix is him. But even in their cook poles, cookies, 19 points up in rash munition and pew and Gallup and so many others. This is very exciting. That's the real news.

Dan  1:09:40
He's not No that's an absolute lie. Yeah. First thing that's funny is that like, they won't even let you do real polls anymore. They won't hate polling as a whole is fucked. It's gone down. Yeah, I've pulled up these polls. Okay, Rance mucin. He cites and that one actually is pretty good. Trump's doing pretty well now. 150 4% approval rating 46 days. approval rating. The only one that has that big of a swing is a political online poll that found 49% approve 41% disapprove. Those are the only ones where he has net favourability is of eight, just the Approve minus disapprove. Okay. He also cited the Gallup poll, which has a negative nine net approval 43% Approved 52% disapprove. Look, it's not good. Basically, if you average out what is this, like 10 polls that were taken in the last week and a half or so 44.9% Approved 47.4 disapproved on average, negative 2.6. Net approval. Now, if you break it down a little bit further, it turns out that he does substantially better in polls where you can be anonymous internet polls and that sort of thing. He does very well comparatively on those, but ones where you're actually talking to somebody on the phone. Not so good. Uh huh. Well, that's kind of what happened in the election, too. Yeah. People just don't want to admit that they like Trump. Is that it?

Marty DeRosa  1:11:06
I don't know if they want to admit, I think there's some people I mean, if you're, you know, just some basic Yes, white person in Indiana or Ohio or something like that. And here's pi like, man, so far, so good. Nothing really affected me much. You know, these the same people who probably think like, feminism, why would I want to be a feminist everything's fine way things are.

Dan  1:11:29
We have this great you now live out here also. It is very approving.

Marty DeRosa  1:11:33
I know quite a few people who went to the protest, the Women's Day protest, and none of them were paid. But if you listen to Trump and his people, you would see they're all paid. Of

Dan  1:11:41
course they all protesters, everybody's paid. Yeah, we're paid. I paid paid opposition. This podcast is funded by George Soros. It's very important that we make no non

Marty DeRosa  1:11:49
controlled opposition. Oh, yeah. I didn't know if you were paid by Soros. Yeah. So yeah, I think a lot of it is and then also, Trump said, all polls that are negative to me are fake.

Dan  1:12:02
Yeah, that was a that tweet was ill advised. ill advised. If I were around him, I'd be like, Hey, bro, bro. Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro. No, no, no, that one's bad. Yeah, that one sounds real dictator ish. All right. Let's get to some fun. All right, this is Alex Jones being delusional as fuck.

Marty DeRosa  1:12:16
Alright, Dan, hit

Alex Jones  1:12:17
it. Here's the headline exclusive. Ron Paul says Trump is trying to stop global collapse. Folks, it's because he is listen. Listen, I'm a smart guy. I'm gonna be okay. During a global collapse. I'm selling Reagan. People are self centered, though. They're like, well, I don't care. You know, the general public gets hurt in this and of course, I'll get hurt as well. But what's really going to hurt me is seeing my fellow Americans and others really going bankrupt. Being on the street or living 10 people to a small house and not getting enough food.

Dan  1:12:49
He cares so much. Now, what's really gonna hurt him is when people can't afford to buy his bullshit product. Yeah.

Marty DeRosa  1:12:56
Have you have you seen the the the? What are those called lithographs? The. He's got some beautiful Reagan and Trump ones. Oh, he does. Yeah. Trump sign one forum.

Dan  1:13:08
He he was selling them for $19. And then he was like, these are too cheap. I'm raising them to

Marty DeRosa  1:13:14
50 tomorrow. Yeah, get them tomorrow.

Dan  1:13:16
They're going to be 50 these would cost 1000 in a gallery. Oh, man.

Marty DeRosa  1:13:20
I got one in the hallway. You can't see how good they are in the hallway because the lights aren't good here. But man who every day I walk in and I see Trump next to Reagan and I think yeah, we got this.

Dan  1:13:29
America is on the rise. Oh, also, this is an important point that I want to bring up. I've noticed he brings up Americana a lot. Yeah. And I think that in the next like six months or so we're gonna see that become a really dark buzzword where

Marty DeRosa  1:13:44
there's America versus Americana. Yeah, we're gonna see like nurses

Dan  1:13:47
that were into the Americana movement. And it sounds good. Oh, sure. Because it's like America, Tropicana. I like both of those things. But it's like, no, this is this is white nationalism with another name

Marty DeRosa  1:13:58
Americana. Sounds like good. Oh, but they'll get old times. Yeah,

Dan  1:14:03
it's, it's pretty scary. Yeah.

Marty DeRosa  1:14:05
But you know, it's fun when you when you kind of see one of their buzzwords starting. And you're like, Well, I was I was on I was on the early.

Dan  1:14:12
I might be wrong. That's entirely possible. But it sounds he's been saying it for a while now. And I kind of think it's like, it's like, no, like it's just not gonna happen.

Marty DeRosa  1:14:23
I Americana trying to make it stick.

Dan  1:14:27
So I don't know. I don't know how you feel about sports.

Marty DeRosa  1:14:31
Wrestler. I love talking about sports. I don't know why I've always liked listening to sports talk radio. Oh, sure. I don't mind it.

Dan  1:14:39
It's you know what it is? It's people who are interested in a certain thing.

Marty DeRosa  1:14:42
I love that x FL 30 for 30. Oh, yeah.

Dan  1:14:45
What about the one with Trump in it? Wow. Killed the USFL Yeah. Anyway, I asked you about sports because Alex has some bizarre ideas about the nature of sport. Okay.

Alex Jones  1:14:55
A lot of people are gonna ask me Hey, why are you even here on Sunday when the Superbowl Hold on. I couldn't care less about the Atlanta what are they the Atlanta watch? Seriously, I'm having a Falcons. The Falcons bullshit. And then England Patriots because I know this has all been built up and designed so that men put their normal male energies into watching a bunch of other overpaid spoiled rotten men involve themselves in what is proto virtual reality. Sports is the original simulation of business and family and war and life. Sports is mainly a war type competition carried out. It's like my cat, where I have a fake mouse on the end of a string, and I drag it along the cat chases it, the cat loves doing it because it has instincts to do it. But it's not a real mouse.

Dan  1:15:55
At this point, I don't totally disagree with his metaphor now that sports are a way for us to get out primal aggressions in a healthy way sure, but I don't that's not his that's not what he's saying. Right? If that's what he was saying I would agree with him but he's saying there's some evil motive buying the saying that the man is trying to get you to get those impulses out because he would Alex would rather you actually go to war but

Marty DeRosa  1:16:21
whenever he started saying like you're male whenever you start saying that I'm like, Oh, there's the plug for his fucking get that Male Vitality back to the NFL is stolen from you. Which we've

Dan  1:16:29
decided is a boner pill. Sure, because he was talking Hey, how great it is for men over 40

Marty DeRosa  1:16:34
have you guys gotten in need to get into a product

Dan  1:16:38
it's so expensive. How much is it? I think it's like 60 bucks for a bottle or something like that.

Marty DeRosa  1:16:43
Well, maybe I'll buy you a bottle you were so cool my you

Dan  1:16:46
were so close to actually say I'm just gonna buy I also don't want him to have my credit card information. Well,

Marty DeRosa  1:16:51
well maybe I'll use my Pay Pal and get you some All right. Well, what would you want?

Dan  1:16:55
Definitely the Boehner one donor one Male Vitality, you know, maybe

Marty DeRosa  1:16:58
we'll check to try it. And then back here a little bit. I mean, not on each other. But you know, with our

Dan  1:17:01
Sure, sure, sure. He has more to say about this weird cat metaphor though.

Alex Jones  1:17:07
By the way, my daughter's seen a mouse in the kitchen. I've never seen it. And guys, the other day, my cat walks up with the little mouse look right mouse prints mouth, kind of sad. But the point was, he actually got a real mouse this time she's got a toy on the end of a stick. It's like a mouse. He'll chase it around crazy for hours. He'll chase laser pointers, you name it. So will the dog. But see I'm not a dog. I'm not a cat. I'm a man. All of this is the same thing. You're like, well, so what let them have fun. I get it. Sports are great for your kids to be in or for you to be in big or to go see your friends in it. I'm not saying it's unhealthy overall, it's just the way it's force fed. And the messages they then coupled to it. All the anti gun messages all the open border messages, all the anti Trump messages, all the feminist anti family garbage, all the green police Audi commercials, and then force feeding us the devil worshiper. Lady Gaga on all the weird rituals they conducted who it's the big pageant of the Super Bowl, and the players coming in through like a spaceship entrance with glowing walls all around them. Like this is the most magic thing in all the world. Nothing is more important. Meanwhile,

Dan  1:18:19
I don't think he knows what his point was there.

Marty DeRosa  1:18:22
Also, his show is the laser pointer of politics.

Dan  1:18:28
There's a lot of pot kettle action here.

Marty DeRosa  1:18:29
And he also seems to have no sense of irony that him and people like him have created this sort of inside joke of the Illuminati. Yeah, it's a punch line and jokes. Now you can go to clothing stores and they'll have like Illuminati T shirts, like the Eye of Horus. Sure. Yeah. And make no mistake about it. People like Lady Gaga know that and they're putting this in their stuff. Number one, it looks cool. Number two, it makes them seem like whoa, I can go on a YouTube video and think maybe Lady Gaga is this fucking evil Illuminati princess.

Dan  1:19:03
It adds to your mythos

Marty DeRosa  1:19:03
and it gives Alex that fucking headache Yeah, which is great which

Dan  1:19:08
is so great.

Marty DeRosa  1:19:09
It's so fun.

Dan  1:19:10
There's a there's a great thought that I saw someone post I there's a there's a great thought I had which would have been fantastic. I'm not that confident. Oh, fuck yeah, I just read this. This interesting thought online there was like, people putting all of these Illuminati symbols and stuff in things is kind of marketing to another crowd. Yeah. Whereas the US we wouldn't get people interested in a movie unless like a certain subset these conspiracy theories, folks. They do free promotion for you if you just put a bunch of weird imagery in your movie. Yeah. Or in your music video. Yeah, stuff like that. Basically, it's it's possibly negative promotion, but no press is bad press right.

Marty DeRosa  1:19:50
Illuminati is jumped the shark. Yeah. And it's, you know, it's one of those things where like, you know, if your mom and dad are like You know, hey, hurt her neighbor down. The streets are real. Like, can they say something? Oh, mom and dad know about it. It's jumped the shark. We got it. I mean, like, what do we do now? We call it we call people HKex as a joke. It's so fun. And these boys still don't know it. Yeah, they don't know that it's toward Khalid tarde. HKex.

Dan  1:20:22
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let me that's what Alex has done basically with like, he used to talk about Bilderberg and he used to talk about Bohemian Grove all the time. Yeah. And those aren't sexy anymore. So now he talks about de Voce. Yeah. Is this new one. So whatever, who cares? Yeah, it's all so

Marty DeRosa  1:20:36
is there anything where he's ever just like, you know, comes back on the show on a Monday and, boy, I

Marty DeRosa  1:20:42
tell you what I went and I saw that new M Night Shyamalan movie split, and I just thoroughly enjoyed it.

Dan  1:20:49
Ya know, that's what that's what separates him from me enjoying anything? I don't think so. Yeah, seems to enjoy his whiskey though. I'll tell you that.

Marty DeRosa  1:20:58
I watched Maduro Suzuki versus Kazakh. Chico Okada from Japan. stayed up all night watched it on New Japan world it was so fantastic. I thought we were going to have a title change but boy did that Okada pull it out. Six stars male turn. Yeah, gotta give it five but I think it should be six.

Dan  1:21:18
So he's, he's just mad about everything. You're right. It's his business. But he has more thoughts about the actual Super Bowl that get into how much he's really we're actually, I feel like I'm skipping a clip here. Okay, because that one ended with meanwhile. Yeah, he's yelling about

Marty DeRosa  1:21:38
commercials and stuff, too.

Dan  1:21:39
Well, he doesn't really Yeah, he's mad about them. Yeah, because they give you a pussy green agenda.

Marty DeRosa  1:21:45
That fucking Budweiser commercial fucking talking about how immigrants came to this country? Yeah. Fucking mean to them. Yeah.

Dan  1:21:53
This this Americana. Yeah. Accepting immigrants. I like

Marty DeRosa  1:21:57
this retelling of history of like,

Marty DeRosa  1:21:59
people weren't mean to people from other countries. We weren't mean to the Italian or mean the Irish. We wouldn't bring. We didn't brettly slaves over here. Yeah, right. And the Mad Americana. Talk to the Scorsese movie about that. Gangs of New York propaganda, fake news, fake news. So

Dan  1:22:17
here, here's where his thought goes after that complaint about the Super Bowl. It goes straight into this. The last clip ended with meanwhile, and this one we'll start with meanwhile, just to illustrate that there's, you know, it's a bridging of thoughts. Okay, that's a crazy.

Alex Jones  1:22:32
Meanwhile, we discovered three years ago via ice sources. And it was later confirmed in the New York Times of all places. We were down in McAllen, Texas. And our reporters have it on tape, they admitted Yes, were ordered to bring in illegals. Only 70% are actually children. It's It's It's adults. They're from the Middle East, China, Latin America, Europe, you name it. And a lot of them have serious diseases that were ordered, let them in. And we'd air these videos of senior Border Patrol telling us this and they get a 500,000 views. When when other videos we do get 10 million. The most important stuff in the world was like Okay, so what the President ignored federal law on how you're able to come through a port of entry, with a proper passport, proper visa, time to be here, what your purpose is, check for, you know, diseases, check for vegetables, you know, things that are diseases in the plants, all of it. Because, you know, if you get one little egg pack of a type of beetle into Hawaii, that's gonna wipe it out Same deal. Then they say no, we don't care. It doesn't matter. Then we get a president says Oh, seven nations. Obama's done for before for the same. He also bombed them at the same time. You're not vetted, you're not you don't have real passports, your your governments have collapsed, we found all these fake passports. We need to have extreme vetting actually know who you are, and run you through a database biometrically. And they said, Oh, my gosh, are the meanest racist in the world.

Dan  1:24:09
We do plenty of vetting as is. I think that's been pretty well documented. But also this story that he had the New York Times covered. Yeah, looked into that a little bit. The story about how there are corrupt border agents who take bribes to let people in has nothing to do with Obama being like a they're being ordered by the government to let people in. It's about people having a side business. So

Marty DeRosa  1:24:32
Dan, what you don't understand is I have I have somebody in the agency, and I can't say who it is horsemen. But they've been telling me all these things. Is it

Dan  1:24:43
possible that the person inside the agency is just one of your wacky callers?

Marty DeRosa  1:24:47
No, no, I vet them very hard. I say Are you lying to me? Are you lie that I think he

Dan  1:24:53
needs extreme vetting for his sword? I

Marty DeRosa  1:24:54
think so. It might be I think so too.

Dan  1:24:57
I want to get to this because it's super fun. And you could call it you know

Marty DeRosa  1:25:01
enough me to call him. Yeah. And lie your way into thinking lie your way into him thinking.

Marty DeRosa  1:25:08
I don't plan from Chicago knows what's going on. I don't think he works in Ramah manuals office told me the ROM is head of all the gangs.

Dan  1:25:18
I don't think that you need that much prep to do that.

Marty DeRosa  1:25:22
I think you could wing it. Yeah, I think

Dan  1:25:24
you could wing it. Yeah. I don't think anyone listening could wing it.

Marty DeRosa  1:25:27
Like, I'll be. You'd be Alex and I'll be a caller. Hey, how's it going? Hey,

Dan  1:25:32
you're on the info war.

Marty DeRosa  1:25:34
I don't have much time to talk right now. And this is very urgent. I work in Rahm Emanuel is off.

Dan  1:25:40
I've already waited too long to cut you off. Oh, yeah. Rahm Emanuel, son of Satan.

Marty DeRosa  1:25:46
I work for him. And he's a bad man. He is trying to use Chicago as a test for all of America.

Dan  1:25:54
We know all about it. It's in the white papers. I can

Marty DeRosa  1:25:57
send you documents. They have one of those spy cameras like in the old movies. And I can I can tell you that. Definitely. What they're trying to do is take everyone's gun and they're going to sterilize all of

Dan  1:26:08
us. That sounds right now here's what would happen while you were getting to any substance what you were saying fake or real coal they would go to break the break music would start playing

Marty DeRosa  1:26:18
I am fascinated by this right now. I need you to hang on for a second I gotta sell some Reagan Lithia graphs.

Dan  1:26:24
It's nonsense. In this clip, Alex Jones let slip that he believes that the United States should control the world.

Alex Jones  1:26:31
The NFL and all this stuff is just a pointless idle to waste away your life. And it's a joke and the globalist are laughing at you and then George Herbert Walker, the author of the World Government program to get rid of our sovereignty the guy that was the head of the CIA and the head US Ambassador to China who got the deal through to let giant China take over us control of much of the planet.

Dan  1:27:01
What what Hold on What

Marty DeRosa  1:27:03
how did the end who is the Eric best shot of the NWO the real and who

Dan  1:27:07
are you sure he wasn't the Vince other events? What's his name? Vince Russo? That's the one I thought that Alex Jones might be the Vince Russo

Marty DeRosa  1:27:16
I thought Oh, for sure he's the guy he didn't isn't doesn't Aleksei that. He had something to do JFK stuff. Vince Russo? No. Herbert Walker. Yeah, I'm

Dan  1:27:29
sure he's on that camp. Yeah. He's a little cagey when he

Marty DeRosa  1:27:32
when it comes. It was kind of funny when they wheeled him out of the Super Bowl. It's kind of like oh, couldn't barely

Dan  1:27:36
flip a coin this little guy we're actually gonna get to Alex talking shit about that here in a little bell rang. Before we do Alex has some thoughts about the nature of the Super Bowl and what's going on? It gets really weird.

Marty DeRosa  1:27:48
Doesn't he know that that Super Bowl is part of Americana. It is it's

Dan  1:27:52
been it's a big part of American prosperity. There's a lot of money that gets made.

Marty DeRosa  1:27:57
Atlanta made a lot and Atlanta Houston made a lot of money free market share prostitutes, the stripper. Sex workers made a lot of money that weekend.

Dan  1:28:04
It was raining in Houston. LA. So anyway, here's some here's some weirdo fucking thoughts about the the Super Bowl, and someone who's involved in it. Maybe shouldn't be going to Alex

Alex Jones  1:28:17
and then Lady Gaga and the Pope, the globalist Pope, that most Catholics are battling is that the new Shiva who's openly calling for world Europe and calling for an Islamic takeover. He's going to have some video the Super Bowl or like the super crapper. Yeah, like the Super Bowl is like a porta potty. That's you climb

Marty DeRosa  1:28:41
he should have a super toilet bowl.

Dan  1:28:43
Yeah, that would have been a little bit slicker. Yeah, but I think he was like, it's gotta be one word. What's it gonna be fuck bowl already toilet ship? Super crapper. Yeah, so he's basically gets into a real fecal riff here. Oh,

Marty DeRosa  1:28:56
also we sell super crappers when the apocalypse does hit, you know, they

Dan  1:29:01
do so baby wipes now.

Marty DeRosa  1:29:02
Yeah, no. You told me all about that. We're real happy. We're proud of

Dan  1:29:06
them. You gotta you gotta order so I'm gonna eat Super Male Vitality. You've got to keep your

Marty DeRosa  1:29:10
butt clean, and your blood pathogens, your blood borne pathogens where they need to be

Dan  1:29:16
what if you do buy me some Super Male Vitality as a joke. I take it and all of a sudden I like this podcast is done.

Marty DeRosa  1:29:24
Alex's right I opened the door. You're ripped to shreds.

Dan  1:29:27
I got a barrel chest. You're just like, hey,

Marty DeRosa  1:29:29
I have a woman in there and I can't stop pleasing her. Crazy and she called her friend going you got to get a shot at down here. This is unbelievable. I want to share you with the world.

Dan  1:29:39
I got her some super female vitality and her pussy is like a flume. It's like a log flume at an amusement park. Ladies so what ladies

Marty DeRosa  1:29:47
don't take don't take that will try it but you ladies don't take that.

Dan  1:29:51
Actually. He said on the show many times that super female vitality is good in a pinch. If you're out of Super Male Vitality, just take super sure that doesn't sound You know what, if they're similar enough that you

Marty DeRosa  1:30:02
could just entertain this fucking hucksters? Yeah.

Dan  1:30:05
So anyway, here's more of this poor riff

Alex Jones  1:30:07
and into it when you watch it on television, and then George Herbert Walker Bush and the Pope and Lady Gaga and Madonna and a bunch of spoiled rotten roid head football players and a bunch of people all come and get inside of the porta potty and go to town on you. Hope prepares video message for fans attending Super Bowl. He says sports is healthy and brings us together we should do it more. Don't have culture, don't have tribalism, don't have family don't have values. Don't have a country don't have nationalism. Just go to the big corporate sports games with the big rituals and all the Satanism and all the rest of the cried. And all the drunkenness that go to this clearly big giant evil event.

Dan  1:30:54
Also want to take a second to pause here. He I've noticed that he starts rubbing his ears as a like a nervous tic. Yeah. And when he said all the drunkenness He rubbed his ear, which is like, I mean, you were just wasted publicly on it on Joe Rogan's show. Yeah, you've been caught a couple times at the inauguration. Just fucking drunk off your ass. Like, I think you might have been like, oh, I shouldn't have said that. Oops, oops. And I opened myself up to a tech

Marty DeRosa  1:31:21
also isn't Tom Brady, a Trump supporter? He is He but

Dan  1:31:25
he's not one of these spoiled, rich athletes. No, no, he's not write it out. Because he's a quarterback. Right? Yeah. Right. So he's fun. And he's one of the good ones. Which means what why? The poor talk is not done. Oh, great. And now

Alex Jones  1:31:41
the Pope is one more person that wants to use the Porta Potty on people. I mean, that's it. The Super Bowl is a big toilet. And when you climb into the Super Bowl, you willingly go in there and open your mouth, like a baby bird. So Pope Francis can get over your mouth, and squat and crap right in your mouth. Now the reason I bring up Pope Francis in that and everyone talked like that, but he's the Pope. He said a few months ago that if you believe in nationalism, or support Donald Trump or question government lies, that you quote, are someone that takes sexual pleasure in eating feces.

Dan  1:32:20
It's not true at all. It's not true at all. Hi, guys.

Marty DeRosa  1:32:23
I'm the new pope, the globalist Pope. If you support on HBO, they're just really knocking out of the park. And if you are for Donald Trump, you eat feces. I don't know if you know that or not keeping keep joining it.

Dan  1:32:39
He was the Pope did say that weird. Okay. His comment was weird. I don't know what he said. He was basically talking about

Marty DeRosa  1:32:45
I'm sorry, I don't really follow what the Pope says per se. He's not really my Pope.

Dan  1:32:51
Not my Pope. Yeah. You were out there on the streets protesting when he got put in, right. You wanted that Nazi back

Marty DeRosa  1:32:57
that Nazi pedophile apologist? Yeah.

Dan  1:33:02
So when he said essentially was that people who delight and spreading and taking in of obviously fake news, yeah, all these stories, it's the equivalent of taking sexual pleasure and eating shit. Wow. So that part is true. Maybe he did say that. He said that. But he didn't say that. If you support Donald Trump, you eat shit. And they see nationalism and he lives

Marty DeRosa  1:33:24
in in Italy, we have a different way of saying to go we have a different way of saying a theme. That's not much of a different impression. It's a good anyway, come on when he shared that come on

Dan  1:33:36
fuckheads. So this segment is just all about insecurity. Yeah, it's real nice. This is really what Alex is all about on this episode, is that Infowars and himself in particular, are not getting the recognition they deserve. Okay. They need to be everyone's favorite thing. Oh, the fact that they're not is really pissing.

Marty DeRosa  1:33:57
You know, it's, you know, it's really interesting. I was watching one of Sean Spicer's press conferences, because they're very fun to watch. A man shows his mind. And he's a he's having trouble. I don't know if they did this for Obama. I'm kind of hoping they didn't. Well. They're Skyping in questions now? No, because

Dan  1:34:18
they certainly weren't for like weirdo podcast. Oh, and

Marty DeRosa  1:34:21
it was like read directly from the Rex Rex Lee show. I want to ask two questions, because apparently, that's the modus operandi of everyone in the room there. First of all, I want to congratulate you on a wonderful victory. President Trump has always been and always will be a friend of the show. And he's just as fucking weirdo, you know? And his questions are like, Hey, does Donald Trump know and this might be a hard hitting question. Does Donald Trump know he's doing a great job because he is question number two follow up question. Will he ever doubt that he's doing a great job because if he does, he can tune into my show every day? I'll take my answer off the air Rex rectly first big first Tom long time.

Marty DeRosa  1:35:02
Yeah. And you and I watched it and I was like, Oh no, there must be people from like, the real news being like, What the fuck?

Dan  1:35:09
We had to get degrees.

Marty DeRosa  1:35:12
Hey, bro Vince Russo from the Vince Russo show? Well, at

Dan  1:35:16
what point it was shut off. Sure. So there was that whole thing about the White House said that they did not offer Alex Jones credentials and Infowars credentials. Yeah, Alex says they're they're his for the taking. Yeah. And he has been offered them. He's started opening up a Washington bureau blah blah run by a guy named Jerome Corsi, who was a guy who, as I mentioned, wrote an entire book about how Obama's birth certificate is fake. And also was the guy behind the Swift Boat attacks on John Kerry that were proven to be erroneous, and the term swift boating has become a it's basically a pseudonym for getting Rhett fucked. Yeah, it's like dirty political tricks. Hey, man,

Marty DeRosa  1:35:59
I'm in a Swift Boat this guy and getting fired.

Dan  1:36:02
Yeah, exactly. That's a term that's in our vernacular now and the guy well, he was probably alone in it but one of the main guys behind it is now Alex Jones is DC bureau chief who is trying to get credentials for to be in the press where

Marty DeRosa  1:36:15
only the best Yeah, it's fucking insane to that time we get some real pro creators in that room. Yeah, people who

Dan  1:36:21
take super male Blue take the brain force. Yes. DNA force.

Marty DeRosa  1:36:28
What does Alex think of Putin?

Dan  1:36:30
He is very careful not to answer that question. Okay.

Marty DeRosa  1:36:33
Does he not believe that Putin is poisoned journalists and so you know, you know how

Dan  1:36:37
whenever Trump is asked he deflect things like the most recent one was you

Marty DeRosa  1:36:42
mad men out there's a lot of bad hombre they wield went out in the Superbowl

Dan  1:36:46
so bad dude is a globalist leader the NWO? Yeah. Alex does a lot of that. A lot of like Russia.

Marty DeRosa  1:36:55
We could start naming bad people.

Dan  1:36:57
Yeah, we'll be here all day, that kind of thing. And like we really need to worry about the Communist Chinese. That's what he's more up on the he's whenever Russia comes up. It's like Saudi Arabia, the Communist Chinese the chai calms the

Marty DeRosa  1:37:10
real bad Hollywood. Ben Affleck.

Dan  1:37:14
But if Matt Damon so anyway, he just went on Rogan's podcast and he kind of sort of cooks out. Rogan this election.

Marty DeRosa  1:37:25
Okay, I couldn't watch it. But never really had any desire to watch it knowing that it was probably gonna be a train wreck. When you mentioned like, Hey, come on in. We'll talk about it. I was just like, You know what? Daniel has some good clips because I'm not wasting and all that time watching.

Dan  1:37:39
It was way more of a train wreck than expected. Yeah, I mean, he got and his hand and his

Marty DeRosa  1:37:44
Rogan's little cohort, brother. I got no time for that. Dude.

Dan  1:37:48
I've warmed up to him. He's a nice guy, and I got no time for him there. I had fun. Anyway, he's Alex says some unintentionally disparaging things about Joe Rogan.

Marty DeRosa  1:37:57
What does he think about the UFC and MMA and stuff? Alex? Yeah, it's probably under it. But that's different than the Superbowl hypermasculine Yeah, those guys aren't on steroids. They're

Marty DeRosa  1:38:05
they're not they're not crybabies.

Dan  1:38:07
They're not act like acting out war. They're engaging in it. Sure. Whereas football.

Marty DeRosa  1:38:14
Okay. Yeah, I

Dan  1:38:15
don't think that would be as argument but it would probably be more logically sound than whatever he would say. Okay. Anyway, this is incredibly insecure, and very sad. All right,

Alex Jones  1:38:25
podcasts get out to folks. We already dominate to a great extent, the internet not just you know, political news, but but Infowars all put together as one of the biggest media outlets in the world.

Dan  1:38:44
That's not true. But also, I want to say this. Yeah, this is gonna go on for a little while on this clip. It's a little bit long, and I apologize. But in the middle of it, Alex accidentally says one of the funniest. Perfect, I can't wait. Just wait for it. Oh, you'll know it when I was gonna

Marty DeRosa  1:39:01
say point me when it's ready. No, no, no, I trust Oh, fucking me. I trust my comedic chops.

Alex Jones  1:39:07
But for me, it's not how big we are. It's how effective we are. And an example is Joe Rogan has one of the top five podcasts in the world. He's been doing it seven and a half years, 90 million downloads a month. 20 million on YouTube. That's 110 million. was talking to him about it if you count all the derivative stuff 200 million people watch or listen to the podcast now some people obviously don't see the whole thing but 200 million people that's a lot. Okay. Now Infowars basically does the same thing or more. But I don't care. It's not about it. That's the biggest I went on Joe Show.

Dan  1:39:46
Did you catch that was fun. That was that was the cooking right there. That's the look. I don't care if we do that or more. I don't care about numbers. Yeah,

Marty DeRosa  1:39:55
also That's so wrong. It's also so fake. There's no way that many people are Listening, it's hard to tell, because to gather, they're not 100 million what he

Dan  1:40:04
calls the derivatives are really tough to track down because you could post like three minute clips here and there. And if you're counting that, I don't know what it adds up to. But after like a, like four or five days or so, yeah, the episode on YouTube was at about like 2 million. But if you say that, like

Marty DeRosa  1:40:23
150 times that, and if if Joe Rogan was pulling in those kinds of numbers, you would not be able to leave your house without seeing Joe Rogan everywhere. Okay,

Dan  1:40:33
that's, that's probably true. Okay. Same with Alex Jones, you will not be able to you wouldn't have to wear a hat in public.

Marty DeRosa  1:40:40
Now. You you would be all Joe Rogan all the time. Wait a second,

Dan  1:40:44
I just realized that he likes to yell about how CNN, like their best shows have a viewership of 1 million. So Rogan is getting 200 times, Joe,

Marty DeRosa  1:40:56
they're only getting 1 million.

Dan  1:40:58
Anyway, we haven't gotten to the hilarious thing yet. Okay.

Alex Jones  1:41:01
And I talked to him yesterday. And he said, Yes, it's now the biggest ever. And he said, he's been on iTunes for seven and a half, eight years since they started, he said, it's never happened. They held it up for a day and a half, and we're gonna censor it till it was a backlash. And it's already shot up to the very top of the charts. And of course, you know, there's hundreds of YouTube versions of it with 1.9 million 300,000 400,000 200,000. Under. I mean, right now, there's more than 10 million views of it conservatively, I just don't look myself. And that was spending a few minutes look it up. On YouTube. There's so many versions of it. But that kind of 10 million views up just an hour. And I didn't spend that much time doing the research, maybe 45 minutes. But

Marty DeRosa  1:41:43
do you catch that? What he's going to he's going on all the different things and counting the numbers and stuff. First

Dan  1:41:49
of all, he's spending like five minutes of his own show, talking about how many views things get, which is a little petty, first of all, yeah, but then second of all, he's like, look, I counted up 10 million. That was just an hour of looking. Yeah, I didn't spend that much time. Maybe 45 minutes. Yeah. Fuck you, dude. Five minutes of your day,

Marty DeRosa  1:42:07
I got a notepad out. And I'm just writing numbers adding them up. I got an old timey adding machine. And I'm up to about 10 20 million. And there's no stopping me now. Yeah,

Dan  1:42:21
then. First of all, I mean, like, not accounting for overlap possibility.

Marty DeRosa  1:42:26
Glass. How much did he pay you for being on that show? And he's making all that money?

Dan  1:42:29
Well, I mean, those podcasts actually are bringing in tons. I read an article about that that fucking scare the shit out of me. Yeah, the amount of money so anyway, I still haven't gotten to the funny part but I do think the image of Alex spending 45 minutes yeah of his day with generally he broadcasts for like four hours a day. Yeah, that means he has no time to do other research now.

Marty DeRosa  1:42:49
Well, who needs to do research you just fucking go half cocked and everything.

Alex Jones  1:42:55
The point is, is that I don't have time to do all this research. I go on there. It's number one ever. And he's had top rock stars Top Movie Stars everybody on Joseph Movie Star TV star. You know, host the UFC. One of the top 10 comedians in the country, sometimes he is as many as 20,000 people to come hear him speak alone. He sells old movie theater 5000 Every time he comes to Austin, what's

Marty DeRosa  1:43:21
up? Can you see 20 million people come to see him alone.

Dan  1:43:22
I think he's at 20,000 out him. But still, that'd be a huge auditorium. Yeah, it's possible. I mean, it's he's sold out the like Chicago theater that seats. Probably not 20,000. Right. A lot. Right. So it's a lot chair. I'm not saying he's embellishing but he's, he's not wrong. Here it is for sure.

Alex Jones  1:43:40
He sells out four shows in a row at Cap City Comedy Club and holds like 2000 The point is, he's big, big celebrity. And by coming on the show is the biggest thing ever happened to it. The point is, is that when think about how iTunes is blocked us having our own podcast, it's video, they won't accept our videos on there. We've gone through the you know the process for years, they just kicked Breitbart off that was on the news. And it just we just take it oh, he's just kick us off because they will dominate it will be number one. Just like will dominate everything else we do because we know what we're talking about, and will defeat the globalist just like Trump's dominating on every front and they want to censor him and shut him down and I'll let you hear what he really has to say or does. So later, I'm gonna play his weekly address and we're gonna play his speeches here. We're gonna focus on it because you know what I've looked at what he's doing, and Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior said you judge a tree by its fruits. He's got the biggest juiciest fruits I've ever seen. It's unbelievable.

Dan  1:44:50
That's such an unfortunate phrase like he's got the biggest juiciest routes, Alex. Oh man, but he's not done. He's still gotta get a new car. Oh

Marty DeRosa  1:45:00
Trump Daddy might as well just go Milo,

Marty DeRosa  1:45:02
I'm gonna calm daddy.

Dan  1:45:03
He's got a little bit more pettiness to get out though.

Alex Jones  1:45:06
You think I care about personality or Trump coming on the show are telling me he likes what I do. I could care less. Except he's the real deal, then I do care. You understand? I tried to have them all. I had the Clintons tried to recruit me. I had Bush tried to recruit me. I've had the biggest radio networks tried to recruit me. I was even put on all sorts of big stations. And XM then told now Alex, people are upset with what you're saying you want to be taken off XM. And I said, I never You made a big deal that I said, Yeah, I can't stop but let him off. Just like I've been fired off radio stations. I mean, you know, this is not about me. Okay. It's about the mission. But I'm telling you. I've won all the Super Bowl rings and the radio world. Okay, you know, this guy is looking for his fifth or sixth ring or whatever it is. The i that is or 15. But I don't want the stinking rings, but they're ridiculous. The point is imagine winning every time every time being number one. And I'm not just number one. Look at Paul Watson. He's dominating. Does he get the attention? No, no, because they have now nor are

Dan  1:46:10
the real victors? Well, because Paul Joseph Watson, all he does is sort of race bait and sort of complain about social justice warriors. Yeah. But he just makes these super manipulative videos where he reads tweets, about like, that sort of he attacks. He builds up tweets as a straw man for himself to attack. When it's like, oh, yeah, that's a dumb person who tweeted that. The note nobody on the left really agrees with that.

Marty DeRosa  1:46:34
As he bangs on the desk. He probably does gotta bang on the desk.

Dan  1:46:39
Paul. Joseph Watson isn't as angry as Alex, but he's like, he looks like he's about to cry all the time. He looks like he's either just a desperate need of some like red eyes. devisees. Or he's stoned out of his mind, which is also a possibility or he is the world's biggest pussy and he's always just about to cry. Ah, good beat. Okay. Oh, these social justice warriors make me so sad. He's a British guy. I hate him. Yeah, I don't hate him. I hate him.

Marty DeRosa  1:47:08
It's funny to think that there'll be a new one soon, you know, a new Alex Jones and new Milo it's me a new. I'd love to be like I knew Dan when he was not like this.

Dan  1:47:19
Well, you give me that Super Male Vitality. It's the beginning of my origin story could be this whole thing is the prologue.

Marty DeRosa  1:47:25
You know, me and Dan were joking around on his podcast, and I bought him that. And if I can fucking go back in time, I would make sure I didn't buy him that I got

Dan  1:47:32
to try and resurrect Tesla to get a time machine together.

Marty DeRosa  1:47:34
I look in his eyes and I don't see the whole damn, his eyes are straight, straight straight in his eyes. It's crazy. I don't know who he is.

Dan  1:47:41
So a bunch of other stuff goes on on this episode. That's not really important. Yeah. One of the things is he has he has Roger Stone on

Marty DeRosa  1:47:51
How's Roger doing? I heard he was getting a little ill. I heard he was getting a stomachache.

Dan  1:47:55
He has dropped that poisoning narrative. Oh, yeah.

Marty DeRosa  1:47:58
Didn't catch the catch the media like he thought it

Dan  1:48:01
was I think everyone laughed at him and told him he was full of shit. And now he's just not using that at

Marty DeRosa  1:48:06
all are like oh poison a journalist like Oh, Putin does.

Dan  1:48:09
But they tried to spin that as that wasn't actually Putin who did it. It was mi six trying to frame Putin, which is sure unnecessary layers for anyway, he was on it. What they were talking about is about how there's leaks coming out of the Trump house. Yes. And that there's a civil war within the administration. Yes. And you got to like the band and people on this side. Who are the real patriots Americana is the real Trump folk. And then you have Kellyanne Conway and Reince Priebus who are trying to sink the ship there. They're never Trump errs, who were just hanging on because they know that they can keep some power. And it's fascinating because it's like the world is shrinking on you. It's like okay, we've tried to make the Democrats the enemies and we they they're consolidated against us a shit let's try the media. Yeah. Oh, media is not working. They're starting to fight back. Oh, what are you gonna do? There's division in the ranks.

Marty DeRosa  1:49:03
I like everyone's fighting back. Yeah, I do. With with, like Reince Priebus. It's very funny. I kind of wish I knew hoots due to this tweet. They tweeted does anyone else ever when they hear his name think of Scooby Doo saying nice pianists. Yeah,

Dan  1:49:19
it's or just like it sounds like a weird Star Wars character.

Marty DeRosa  1:49:24
We're gonna get to the but the dadgummit with rants pre

Dan  1:49:28
made it through the parsecs Yeah,

Marty DeRosa  1:49:31
no, but I agree. It's there's got look. These people are all maniacs. There's no way they're all gonna get along. No. Even if Papa maniac is in charge. Yeah.

Dan  1:49:40
But what's fun is you're you're like the I was talking about this on the last episode that I have a little bit of hope that everything is going to work out. And one of the reasons is because of this trend that I'm seeing, which is once you start blaming your own team, yeah,

Marty DeRosa  1:49:53
your foot your thought and this is they're not even 100 days in no 20 collapsing on themselves. Would you have like, do you do you? Do you think Trump will make it? Oh, four years? No, right? No, I don't really? I really don't think so. They're already

Dan  1:50:07
talking impeachment in the house. Yeah, Maxine Waters when she was asked about it, she's like, I'm not talking impeachment. He's doing it to him. So yeah, I love it. He's making the case for himself. I love it. And like, look, I'm no super liberal. I'm not a big limitado. Guy. Gara Labtop. I swing far more to the left than to the right for sure. But like, of course, he has to be impeached. Yeah, this is we're going to end up in the weirdest fucking situation in the world because he and General Flynn are threatening war with Iran. At the same time. They're getting their dick sucked by Russia and a 69. They're both everyone's Dick sucking with 60 with Russia. Oh, yeah. But now Russia comes out and they're like, Hey, if you want us to fight ISIS with you, Iran comes with the package deal.

Marty DeRosa  1:50:51
What the fuck you're gonna do now? Oh, they want us to go to war with Iran. Oh,

Dan  1:50:55
they want Iran to be cool with us. Because Iran and Russia are super cool. If we attack ran, Russia is gonna be mad about that. Now, it's like you didn't think about that possible angle?

Marty DeRosa  1:51:07
Oh, no. It's all gonna blow up in a crazy

Dan  1:51:09
way. So none of this is going to work out. It's all embarrassing. How many had that raid in Yemen? That wimp ass up? Yeah, they got a guy killed, killed tons of civilians and killed including a child. Who was the daughter of that? Our our recovery guy who was a US citizen, who was over there and got killed by a drone strike. Yeah. Also, you know what that makes her she was a citizen of the United States. Who was you know, living abroad that killed in this, this raid in Yemen. But of course, that's Obama's fault. Anyway, look, all this shit is nonsense. But ya know it once once we have this narrative being sold that it's like, listen, the real problem is that within our own organization, there are traders. Yeah, we're witnessing essentially, like, didn't something

Marty DeRosa  1:52:01
come out about he didn't like Sean Spicer's suits? Well, I

Dan  1:52:05
mean, he's got new suits. But yeah, and

Marty DeRosa  1:52:07
it's like, instead of just saying like, hey, get wear darker suits, like we were here to leak it. They leaked it. And then someone's like, oh, Trump loves this. Trump loves the leaking and the dissent. Because like Vince McMahon, he likes when everybody's fighting, because it keeps people guessing. But also it keeps him from all getting together and being like, hey,

Dan  1:52:25
well, actually, we have a little bit of a clip about Yemen and leaks. All right, let's hear it. That is crazy. fanfiction. Anthony

Marty DeRosa  1:52:33
from Yemen, you're on the air.

Alex Jones  1:52:35
This is bigger than 1776 if Trump can deliver, and then I see all the news, I've got articles today. Haha, there's 10s of 1000s of bureaucrats that are gonna leak everything you're doing militarily and sabotage you. That's called treason. That's executional. And then I saw that earlier in the week, and then I started seeing articles going well, where it is they leaked about that mission. And the list, because it was so effective. And you know, Obama doesn't want al Qaeda and ISIS to get rolled up because Hillary and Saudi Arabia and all them were behind them. And then I made some phone calls. One of the calls hadn't come back yet. That I called others. They said, Yes, that's what's being looked at. They were ready for them when they got there. And we know, Obama wouldn't Greenlight these lists, that the Navy Seals and special operations in the In the Green Berets and the Delta Force wanted to go after. So that's what happened. And the CIA came to Trump and said, there, here's a list of a whole bunch of targets we've had for six months. Obama won't hit him because it's his real command basis. And Trump said, well, let's have meetings about it. They said, Okay, they said he had them, then that's what you're saying. And then that now, moles in those very Gribbs have now leaked the end of the list, so that when our forces show up to take out the worst terrorists in the world, they're waiting for them.

Dan  1:54:02
That's one theory. Yeah. It's not substantiated or backed up by anything. Wasn't Trump not in the War Room, and they did the attack. Nope. He was tweeting angrily about how someone should buy the New York Times. New York Times also how was tweeting about the media being shady.

Marty DeRosa  1:54:17
Yeah. Which is totally what he should be doing. Yeah. And it's funny how Alex when they talk about this, these, you know, people giving away secrets is treasonous. Yeah. But when Secret Service agents were telling him about Hillary, it was patriots, of course, trying to get the word out. Yeah, of course. Yeah. It's interesting.

Dan  1:54:35
But I'm gonna defend him a tiny bit on that. Because if it's traveled to defend me, it's patriots leaking about Hillary's health. Yeah, they're doing it to save the Republic. They are whereas in this case, people are being petty against Trump by leaking the locations of attacks, and that will get good men killed.

Marty DeRosa  1:54:52
Yeah, they're waiting for them, right. With their guns drawn.

Dan  1:54:55
So I mean, that's, you know, in some bizarre world, that's maybe pa I suppose share. But also another possibility is just doing a really bad job with preparation shirt and going in half cocked not knowing what the situation is on the ground.

Marty DeRosa  1:55:10
And you'll never go in half cocked if you buy Male Vitality, three quarters or

Dan  1:55:13
better. But and all the reports that I've read, everything I've seen seems to indicate that that is what happened. Yeah, they did not thoroughly figure out what was going on on the ground. They walked into a situation that they were unprepared for and got people killed. Yeah. And I don't think that's leakers fault.

Marty DeRosa  1:55:34
Now, it's happened before and it'll happen again.

Dan  1:55:35
Yeah, but it's so much more satisfying to say like, oh, yeah, the reason that we lost was because someone else cheated.

Marty DeRosa  1:55:41
What's a great narrative? Yeah, there's no they can do no wrong. Yeah. And I'll be curious to see if he ever does call Trump out on anything. No, but it's it's a great narrative.

Dan  1:55:51
I don't think he's called him out on so far was being against torture or being for torture, which was interesting, but his reasons for being against torture were not really morally based. Let

Marty DeRosa  1:56:01
me torture them. That's my problem. Making room. I roll my sleeves up. I'll get in the face. I'm a patriot.

Dan  1:56:09
I'll give them a little Americana.

Marty DeRosa  1:56:10
I'm a man. I procreator.

Dan  1:56:13
He know his reasons were like, if you torture then people can use that against you in a PR campaign. They're like, Oh, that's that's not the reason you shouldn't torture people. We got one more clip Marty night. This is a little bit of a shorter show in terms of length because it was a Sunday show. Yeah. And I think I think look, I don't think this is your fault. I think this is Alex's fault. Okay, this show is not boring. It's fun. It's Obama's fault. Not I'm not saying our podcast right now hasn't been as fun. Yeah, his show wasn't as fun right. And I think it's because he phones it in on Sundays. I think it's the Lord's day and he's just like, Who gives a shit? Okay, and it was the Super Bowl. He knows he's not really going to get great ratings. Yeah, but yes, the more thoughts about the Super Bowl, okay, and about how he has fucking principles, and he's not gonna eat I'll just let you see what all right all right.

Alex Jones  1:57:04
These are just a bunch of globalist that are hated trying to go to a popular event and force themselves on us. I'm boycotting it. You see my country and my world is under attack by globalist Here we go. Oh, he was able to flip it. Let's see who gets it. It's the coin toss right now. Roger stones weathers coverage of the live Super Bowl that I forgot to tell you guys I wanted to call the Wi Fi today. Coverage Super Bowl 51 Because we're doing it. Here you go. Ladies and gentlemen. We have audio was printed up. Who got it? Good luck.

Dan  1:57:36
If you can't tell what's going on. He started the segment by saying I'm boycotting the Superbowl and then started playing the Super

Marty DeRosa  1:57:42
Bowl. I own show live streaming this show, which I don't think is legal. Also. I don't think he has written consent to the NFL.

Dan  1:57:50
I would imagine he does it. But also it's the opposite of boycotts.

Marty DeRosa  1:57:54
Yeah. Hey guys, I'm gonna boycott WrestleMania this year and I'm going live to prove

Dan  1:57:58
it. Yeah, exactly. Boycotting it from some great seats. So yeah, he boycotts this a little bit more.

Marty DeRosa  1:58:05
Thanks, gentlemen.

Alex Jones  1:58:06
Pay attention to the stupid crap. Oh, thank you, sir, for your world government is these these people that everybody hates the 41st President of the United States 41st President United States battling Trump HW Bush peddling America selling US China Navy pilot ship the super satanic egomaniacs killing bone synthetic rituals in this covering Super Bowl propaganda not wanting to even take the transmission. Don't even pay attention to who got the coin toss right there. I'm glad we don't even know it's the possums versus the dirtbags seriously that we're not just saying we got censored it was in the news that CNN MSNBC were banned by David Brock at Media Matters the main Soros operative. Two weeks before Trump got into office is president elect Obama passes a law signs at the CIA over media to quote ban fake news, Drudge Report and Infowars and Breitbart. Now, Trump is so busy trying to turn the economy on he doesn't even know that they've got advising Congress right now Brock on short websites to ban and shut down when he wants his chief presidential advisors site shut down. Even if it was fake news, which it's not. You have a right to shut it down. We're not North Korea. And now this book, which we're selling, everybody should get it we need funds to fund ourselves. It can be a piece of toilet paper, you should buy it for 9095 Hell for 30 bucks is a big old thick, juicy color photos making of a president 2016 How old shows got Trump's here it's all in here. And they're trying to censor it because it went to number one on Amazon political and it usually goes to number one after that. They don't want this to be made into a movie they want to block. Ignore the fact who's gonna play Alex and again, we the Joe Rogan podcast hit no one should buy track number one on the front page of YouTube I'm in the trending section everybody goes to, they just blocked it. And then for a day, they blocked it on iTunes. I talked to Joe yesterday. He says it's already the biggest thing they ever had. He sees the internal numbers. They're even blocking that from the public. So again, everything we do is number one, number one, number one, everything we do is number one, a lot of America watch is what's the number one? No, they give you the false number one.

Dan  2:00:28
So that's petty as hell yeah. It's so insane to me how like he's doing the show on Sunday. And he can't stop just talking about how great he is and how people don't give him enough attention. He's basically breaking multiple deadly sins. Yeah, in this broadcast, and it's also very, there's wrath very on brand with Trump. Yeah, certainly lying about being religious.

Marty DeRosa  2:00:53
No, well, but it just like saying how great he is, but it doesn't matter. Doesn't even matter. It's false

Dan  2:00:58
humility, and it's disgusting. But in the middle, he talked about how they're trying to ban websites, saying that Obama pushed through this legislation, right. I would like everyone, if you're curious at all about this, go ahead and read it. It's s 2692. It is a bill that what is colloquially called

Marty DeRosa  2:01:20
Oh, I'm just a male. Oh, I'd

Dan  2:01:22
love to hear that. Oh, yeah. The Alex doing some Schoolhouse Rock, countering foreign propaganda and disinformation act. It is not at all what Alex pretends it is, but CIA being put over the board of directors. That is complete poppycock. Bullshit

Marty DeRosa  2:01:40
a lot. Just in a website, you go online and find me every time.

Dan  2:01:45
Also one of his biggest narratives is that it was pushed through by Obama during Christmas, so no one would notice. Oh, yeah, under the shadows of Christmas. It was introduced in a bipartisan group into Congress in March way

Marty DeRosa  2:01:58
out That's Christmas for that's communist Christmas. I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. They just celebrated guide Chinese New Year over there. And Chinatown in Chicago, Dan. So you check your check your record Communist

Dan  2:02:12
Chinese New Year? Lunar New Year? I apologize. Lunar Christmas is March. All right. Fair enough.

Marty DeRosa  2:02:20
Got to read the calendars. have documents for $30. Yeah, you should. You should let me send you my poop. Yeah, that also that keep the lights on here at this tiny mon pa website that has 2 million listeners

Dan  2:02:34
that idea to that, like, anytime there's censorship stuff, we gotta weave this into a sales pitch. Ya gotta fuck and swing is great. Also, I'm going to play this really quick. It's probably one of the funniest things I've ever heard. All right, it's out of context, but it doesn't really need context. Okay.

Alex Jones  2:02:50
I'm a policy wonk.

Marty DeRosa  2:02:54
Alex, what kind of Walker you I'm a policy wonk. Okay, that makes sense.

Dan  2:03:00
I want that just to be like, I'm gonna have that always ready on my phone, just in case I get in the conversation. I don't want to be in and just be like,

Alex Jones  2:03:08
I'm a policy wonk.

Marty DeRosa  2:03:09
But what does that mean? I'm a policy wonk.

Dan  2:03:12
It's an expression that people use in political circles, like I'm all about the policies. Yeah. And people who like dig into the like the little parts of bills. Yeah, people get really into the weeds about legislation. I'm a policy wonk get into the tax code. Get into the details, so you really understand Oh, yeah, you can't trick me. He doesn't understand shit about codes. As we went over in the Rogen episode, he claimed that chemtrails were justified by this subsection 1520 Paragraph B. He hadn't read paragraph C, which said, informed consent is required of any human subject. Oh, man,

Marty DeRosa  2:03:53
it got me again. Completely invalidates it. Shit.

Dan  2:03:56
He is no,

Alex Jones  2:03:58
I'm a policy wonk guy. No,

Dan  2:04:00
he is not a policy walk.

Marty DeRosa  2:04:02
What did they hurt my voice? Yeah, I

Dan  2:04:04
apologize, Marty. This

Marty DeRosa  2:04:05
has been fun. Dan, thank you so much for having me back in the brain battle.

Dan  2:04:08
Yeah, this is you know, I feel it's my holy quest to sit around and talk about Alex Jones.

Marty DeRosa  2:04:14
I'll tell you what. It's worked with me because I was a I was a an Alex shows walk for a little bit. It won't out policy long. Yeah, I got I got seduced by thinking.

Dan  2:04:29
Yeah. Oh, it's there's a siren song. It's seductive. But, hey, we gotta wrap this up. So you can go watch some wrestling. You can pretend it's warfare, or masculine energy suck down

Marty DeRosa  2:04:39
the wrestling walk. You are. I like it.

Dan  2:04:42
Thank you all so much for listening and catch us. Over on iTunes. Please rate and subscribe. We would appreciate it Jordan will be back in the studio tomorrow. We got another episode for you. But until then,
