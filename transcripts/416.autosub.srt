1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect but knowledge babe I'm sick of them posing

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge vype.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody was making outside of death fix it around novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
Jones Jordan

7
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
I guess maybe I don't know if you want but Sunday is

8
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,592
Any weekends

9
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm not sure

10
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,040
Thoroughly enjoyed the first it's still fun you know I don't know I was telling you about the Boneyard

11
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:33,440
Before we started recording I thought it was horrible watching it baby I'm out of the mainstream and that opinion but

12
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,744
It was fun to tell you about it

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
I guess there's that

14
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
I texted you was telling me that he loved it

15
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,288
I just thought it was cool.

16
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
Record against maybe so maybe I'm a little jaded

17
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
Get another crack

18
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,320
Maybe maybe I always go into Alex's attempt

19
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,368
To prove things with the highest of hopes

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
I will ask your night to WrestleMania also with like better what I'm going to enjoy watching a little bit of nut

21
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,680
Absolutely for me

22
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,544
King of the Raptor princesses John got me a very very

23
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
Generous generous gift

24
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,176
Aura trick me into giving her address

25
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
Is the BTK Killer

26
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,576
It could be that the abbreviation correctly there

27
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
It was an incredible gift

28
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,000
It came at a time when just blindsided me and hers is very very

29
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,608
Super cool food is not a gift for me but I'll still say thank you John

30
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Slightly

31
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,336
Little more disappointing I will take

32
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,200
WrestleMania

33
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,808
The bright spot fight that's the challenge

34
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,904
Today we are going over April 2nd

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
2020

36
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
2020 babies

37
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
I don't know didn't feel quite right by Felicity

38
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,752
April 2nd episode That's Thursday of last week

39
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,568
And I intended to do Thursday and Friday for this up

40
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
Episode but Thursday is just too

41
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
F****** insane

42
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,968
This is one of the weirdo rides we're going to go on

43
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,040
There's a lot of emotional ups and downs

44
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
Alex trying to prove stuff

45
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
Stairs

46
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,904
Factually inaccurate claim as theirs

47
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
Casus belli

48
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Oh okay

49
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,352
Alright so we're just taking territory now that's all

50
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,912
DFI mean it gets that by the end of it

51
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,984
So get ready strap it in okay we will see

52
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
We make it through but before we get to that

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
Thank you so much you're now a policy wonk

54
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,832
I'm a policy wonk

55
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Next

56
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
This could be

57
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
Zoetrope

58
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
Or Zoe

59
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
Propzy

60
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Propst

61
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,536
Not entirely sure but either way thank you so much

62
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,399
Thank you very much thank you so much you and I hope all is well

63
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Dallas

64
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
But style Evian thank you so much

65
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,847
Rachel

66
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
Thank you so much you're an alcoholic

67
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:39,039
Who donated an elevated level appreciate that very much

68
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Google Andy thank you so much

69
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,671
You're now a technocrat and Sean thank you so much

70
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
I'm a policy wonk

71
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
Money off that heroin

72
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,031
Freakishly large

73
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
Declare

74
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,527
The showed like the sport with these Gents

75
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,415
Contour website

76
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Sports people who are

77
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,023
Dunedin these drying difficult times we find ourselves in

78
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Yes we would like

79
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
How are you there hello

80
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,007
But also

81
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
Okay let's not forget the real charity come on now

82
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,711
Play we're going to start on April 2nd at the beginning of Alex's episode this is a little bit of a longer

83
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
Clip for a first

84
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
Quit but I wanted to

85
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:47,391
Alex is insisting that this clip you plays of Anthony fauci

86
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Is

87
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
Play me something

88
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:55,071
Okay and it's going to be like a guiding thesis for the episode moving forward

89
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
And it's not

90
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
It's it's pretty it's pretty lame

91
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:04,287
Yes this is at the world government bio attack we always knew was coming from the very Medical

92
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
Mad scientists led by dr. Faust

93
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:16,063
Are we looking at wedding with some sort of social distancing guidelines

94
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
Baseball games

95
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
Political conventions over the summer

96
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,655
Possible or safe

97
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,983
I think if we get to the part of the curve that

98
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Berkshire

99
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
Yesterday when it goes down

100
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,639
Down to essentially no new cases Note

101
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
Had a. Of time

102
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
I think it makes

103
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
Since that you're going to have to relax

104
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
Social distancing

105
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
Thing we hopefully would have in

106
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:56,255
Place and I believe we will have in place for robust system to be able to identify

107
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
Play Summer disinfect

108
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Isolate

109
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,887
Play them and then do contact tracing

110
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Program of can

111
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Payment

112
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,615
Prevents you from ever having to get into mitigation mitigation right now that's what they say

113
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
Distancing is the

114
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
Ultimate

115
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
The ultimate solution

116
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
To a virus

117
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
Might keep coming back

118
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,855
Would be a taxi

119
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
The weekly conference call with the

120
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
Who sponsored group

121
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
All the health leaders in the world

122
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,655
Dealing with this and we all came to the agreement

123
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
That we may have

124
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
Cycling with another season

125
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,799
Would be much better prepared we likely will have interventions

126
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,871
The ultimate game-changer in this will be a vaccine

127
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
The same way

128
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
Other diseases that was Sturgis of the past

129
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
Now we don't even worry about

130
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,439
Say 1 minute 21 seconds clip that you're going to hear me play probably 10 more times today on air because

131
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Confirmation

132
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,399
It's all absolutely

133
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
So I don't think that proves

134
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
I did

135
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:16,895
Didn't get that first react not your take away that wasn't the thing that I was thinking about

136
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Where this goes

137
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,479
I think you could predict where it go

138
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,599
I mean the clip of thought you was explaining makes perfect sense to an adult

139
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
But it's interesting

140
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,951
Because you know you listened to enough Alex Jones that

141
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,023
I think you can hear that and see the points where he's going

142
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,119
To take things well contact tracing I heard that and I was like nobody

143
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
You should be allowed to tell Alex

144
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
About contact

145
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Have to wait from him

146
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,335
Certainly that's one thing you can point to like okay

147
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Bunch of little things in there's like

148
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,687
Oh I see how he's going to manipulate this

149
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
That's a fun little game

150
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
At home

151
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
If you're listening

152
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,231
What is UNIX going to go on and we'll we'll see how you do and your prize

153
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
So Alex

154
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
Gets down into talking about how it psychology

155
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:12,191
Talk to you saying if there's going to be forced vaccinations that end up coming any sort of brambles

156
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
We got a divorce

157
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
Irises

158
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:24,223
Yearly injection of Coors

159
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
Yearly or monthly shot

160
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:37,023
Well and you criticize it anyway you're not allowed to travel you're not allowed to live

161
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,423
So Alex is severely misunderstanding what was being said about the future reaction to the coronavirus ND post distancing

162
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
The pre-vaccine landscape

163
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:51,871
Dr. fauci was saying in the in the clip that we listen to up top is it there are two distinct phases of response to an outbreak wear different style

164
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Allergies or affect

165
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,479
When there are not many new cases of no real Community spreading of the

166
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,783
The disease you can isolate individuals who get sick

167
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
I can track down the people who they been in contact with

168
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,159
And have them also self-quarantine

169
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Imperial for the disease of Pat

170
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:12,351
This strategy can work well in those circumstances but once there as many new cases and as much Community transmission is

171
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
Is happening now you have to adjust a mitigation Tech

172
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
Fix like what we're seeing now with social distance

173
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,799
Alex seems to imagine a world where self-quarantine will be used

174
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
Does punishment against anti-vaxxers or sub

175
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Dumb s***

176
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
I don't know how he got that for

177
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,783
Southeast comments but I would bet that when this is all over the country is gone through this deeply traumatic

178
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Experience together

179
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
If you're actively trying

180
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
To get people not to be vaccinated and risk all of this happening again I bet a lot of people will distance themselves from you Sophie

181
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
I don't think

182
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:47,679
Anyone will need to force anyone to I think we will tell you to f*** right off I don't think anybody saying hi.

183
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,751
Melissa McCarthy

184
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
April that mutations thing Alex has no evidence of reason to suggest that the coronavirus mutates more than fluids do

185
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,247
Just making that up but even if it were true it's not necessarily a good argument

186
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Against vaccinations

187
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,879
You should have mutations and vaccines are not a clear-cut black-and-white issue

188
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,023
Alex wants you to think it's a thing where you make a vaccine against the coronavirus and then mutates them the vaccine doesn't work

189
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
Anymore but of course

190
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Issues more complicated than that

191
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
For one just because of vaccine or a virus has undergone a mutation that doesn't mean that existing vaccine won't be effect

192
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
This isn't really a cure

193
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,615
Mutations that happen with viruses are random events

194
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,455
Send all the mutations that occur aren't really relevant to the immunity the vaccine will

195
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Create

196
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
It's entirely possible they could be multiple

197
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
What strains of the coronavirus that are all prevented by the same vaccine

198
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,487
On March 24th the New York Magazine Intelligencer reported on how the coronavirus actually has very low error rate

199
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
We just say that it's mutating

200
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Very slow leak

201
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,351
Considering how many times it's been transmitting a triplicate

202
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
Peter thielen a

203
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,471
Johns Hopkins molecular geneticists said quote

204
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,823
That's a relatively small number of mutations for having passed through a large number of people

205
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
At this point the mutation rate of the virus would suggest

206
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:05,759
The vaccine developed for SARS coronavirus to would be a single vaccine

207
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,831
Rather than a new vaccine every year like the flu

208
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,439
What Alex is really doing here is just some basic ass anti-vax stuff

209
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
Send it

210
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
Pretty uninspiring off

211
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
Yeah I hear slow

212
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,727
Anti-vaxxers stuff is a far more palatable whenever there's no massive global

213
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,287
And it going on right now anti-vaxxer stuff

214
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
Kind of feels a little bit more murderer

215
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
You know a little bit more on the side of like

216
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,271
Maybe unintentional manslaughter area steaks are becoming a little bit to avert yet

217
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,855
This is uninspired level levels of

218
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,647
The ship that Alex is doing well.

219
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:48,767
I want him to be a little bit more creative or crazy with his ideas but he's bringing

220
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
His basic ass s***

221
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
So what are the big things that everyone

222
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Of course is being

223
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,959
Bombarded with it probably for good reason then

224
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
And well

225
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
You know

226
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Justifiably

227
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,615
I is washing hands everybody and others

228
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
There's messaging

229
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
Wash your hands

230
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,759
Write a message that we're still struggling

231
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
To Grapple with

232
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
So Alex is mad

233
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
That they played a video

234
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
Elmo

235
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
Telling people to wash their hands

236
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,327
You can't say that to on Fox Business on speak those aren't words

237
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
It's very weird

238
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,311
Dave

239
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,175
Talking to adults about how to wash their hands

240
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,063
Thank you

241
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
Go ahead and go to this clip

242
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
Palomo

243
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,743
Call boy oh boy here and I think Alex just committed slander

244
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:30,399
There have been accusations backlash in the past and I'm not entirely sure what the reality of that situation is

245
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,471
But Alex isn't saying that there were accusations

246
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,311
Is a convicted pedophile which is not true

247
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
Demonstrable a false statement and Alex is reporting it as fact

248
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,783
Even if the puppeteer of a particular character were to be a criminal that doesn't make the puppet

249
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
Is the Puppeteer dad ventriloquist dummy is really rude

250
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,239
Play give you learned of the person who played Big Bird is a fence for stolen goods that doesn't affect the character of Biggby

251
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Ridiculous

252
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:17,247
Alex is mad at the elbow positive

253
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
That's all we're all in

254
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,623
I'm not positive that video being played on Fox Business is trying to convince

255
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:28,255
Adults to wash their hands based on an elbow it might be reporting on that video is

256
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
Existing

257
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,119
I don't know anyway I don't really care

258
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
Who's going to be playing Elmo videos

259
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Probably

260
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,799
His next move is where I got really excited cuz this opening today episode is not

261
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
Strong but

262
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,895
Like whenever he says he's going to

263
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
To prove something

264
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,711
I get pop and Alex

265
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Excuse me

266
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
At ease

267
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
For the minutes coming up late

268
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,391
In the last hour we put together an extremely informative

269
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Powerful report

270
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
That is going to Premiere here

271
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
But lays out

272
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Admission

273
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,703
By The Establishment technocrats that by 2020 they would launch the biotech

274
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,335
F*** yes absolutely Alex is going to prove it

275
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,687
Of course he's giving himself an artificial deadline of I have a report that I'm going

276
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
Play it's already

277
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
Oh my God

278
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
You're doing the thing that makes me think he's not going to play

279
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
Play a dog no you can play okay but you should be making me think that he's not going to prove it

280
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,279
I never considered that as a possibility.

281
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
He doesn't up playing

282
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:38,655
But it's really disappointing but I always get really excited cuz it's like

283
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
You're trying now

284
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Yeah you're trying

285
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,311
You have you have stated on your own without anyone for some

286
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
That you are

287
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Ryan

288
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
You think this proves something

289
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,479
Therefore I can take it more seriously and oh boy

290
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
You have entered my

291
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Right

292
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:02,207
So here is this isn't the actual report but it is another like sort of factual claim that Alex makes about

293
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
The bring in the world

294
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
We will have

295
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
2020

296
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
No matter how much money and how much blood if

297
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
We will have world government

298
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
With money and blood

299
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,487
Fun Alex's nose

300
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
This is a little bit of a lie

301
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,351
Which inspires anyone because it's Alex Jones talking about a quote

302
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:46,495
One thing it's important to point out is that it doesn't mean anything for someone to say that something's in the Congressional Record

303
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
If they're saying that to say it

304
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
Proof that the real or proven

305
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:56,735
There are countless examples of weird editorials and opinion pieces that Congress people have just read into the record over the years

306
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
Not as hard to become a Converse

307
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:06,207
Yeah this doesn't make the things that they read into the record officially accurate it just means that someone in Congress decided to read them on the floor

308
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,047
My point is that if someone says to you it's in the Congressional Record record

309
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,863
Odds are very strong they're trying to pull a fast one on you

310
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,911
That is not a good like

311
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Argument

312
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Do you know what else is in the Congressional Record

313
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,775
Quotes from f****** Elmo

314
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
Sure

315
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,663
As for the actual quote Alex's referencing he appears to actually be mixing up

316
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
2 quotes

317
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,295
The first is a comment by James Warburg in front of the senate in 1950 which was quote

318
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,879
We shall have World Government whether we like it or not or whether or not we like it

319
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
The only question

320
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,719
Weather World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent

321
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
This is in the context of a speech about the need to create peace with the Soviet Union and about how international law and relations needs every positive ask

322
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Aspirational goal

323
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
Because if that wasn't the focus

324
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
Things will remain the same

325
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,519
Say they will tend towards War

326
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,871
Yeah so we talked about this in the endgame episode I'm about to Greater Tampa that that that

327
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Completely out of

328
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
Text somebody really close to

329
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
Post-war situation

330
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
Watching the

331
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
Korean War about

332
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
What's a breakout all over it

333
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Was probably like

334
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,879
Baby let's War would be a good eye

335
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
Yeah yeah

336
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
The other quote is quote

337
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:16,095
We are not going to achieve a new world order without paying for it in blood as well as in words into money

338
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,959
Isn't that to come from an article by Arthur Schlesinger Jr in the Foreign Affairs a journal

339
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,079
The citation that's listed with it says that the article is called quote back to the womb

340
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
Isolationism new threat

341
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
From volume 74 number

342
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
Virtu of the journal

343
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,295
Jstor has the full catalog of Foreign Affairs available to you to read if you'd like

344
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,879
You find yourself like I don't know quarantine but whole lot of time to kill

345
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
So if you pull up volume 74 issue number to the journal one thing you'll find is that there is no article by that name

346
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
In it there's no article by Schlessinger Eve

347
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,167
That's because most conspiracy sites give the wrong citation

348
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,751
It's actually from volume 74 Issue 4 of the journal

349
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,103
And the title is actually back to the womb isolation isolationism is renewed

350
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,431
Fret very bad citation work here but

351
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Anyway

352
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,759
First I will say that the quote is actually in the tech

353
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
That is fair

354
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,391
That's a good sign but we're off to a good start of course it's taken out of

355
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,719
The article is about the push and pull

356
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,791
In the United States between isolationism in internationalism

357
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
And how it seems like

358
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
Except when we're in a crisis that appears to

359
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
The directly affect us interest

360
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,263
We forget about International matters or any responsibility we may have to help

361
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
Facilitate worlds

362
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Stability

363
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
Crazy thing for somebody

364
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
Well to be fair license or even

365
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,223
He said that makes total sense

366
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,015
From the piece

367
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:44,671
How to persuade the housewife in Xenia Ohio that her husband brother or son should die in Bosnia or Somalia

368
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,487
Or some other place where vital us interests are not involved

369
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,327
Nor is it just the Zenia housewife who must be persuaded

370
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,375
How many stalwart internationalist

371
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,911
In the Council on Foreign Relations

372
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,727
Would send their own Sons to die in Bosnia or Somalia

373
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,847
Dying for World Order when there's no concrete threat to one's own nation is a hard argument to make

374
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,663
For understandable reasons our leaders are not making it

375
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,343
Yeah he's saying it's like a it's a good dream but doesn't seem like we're doing it

376
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
You can't

377
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,184
Send people to die for strangers.

378
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
Despite the humanitarian reality

379
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,144
So here's the wider context of the quote about paying for paying in Blood and Money from this paragraph

380
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:32,032
Despite two Grievous hot Wars a draining Cold War and a multitude of smaller conflict

381
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:37,664
It will soon Envision is as far from realization today as it was three-quarters of a century ago

382
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,784
In the United States neo-isolationism promises to prevent the most powerful nation in the planet

383
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,600
From playing any role in enforcing the peace system

384
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
If we refuse a role we can't

385
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,976
Expect smaller weaker and poorer Nations to ensure world order for us

386
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,840
We're not going to achieve a new world order without paying for it and blood as well as words

387
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Send Bonnie

388
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,680
The point he's making his at the dream of the peacekeeping system

389
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:04,544
Detached from material and concrete interest is possible for the United States but it's probably unlikely

390
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Do.

391
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
Detroit isolationism

392
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,176
What was on the rise back when this was written in 1995

393
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,248
Pleasanton wraps up his Essay with this thought

394
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,320
Perhaps our leaders should put the question to the people

395
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
What do we want the United Nations to be

396
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,696
Do we want it to avert more Killing Fields around the planet

397
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,744
Or do we want it to dwindle into impetus

398
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,560
Leaving the world to the Anarchy of nation-states

399
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,144
Robinson's you might draw the conclusion that he superposed

400
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Nation-states

401
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
But if you read a little further he says quote

402
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:38,080
If we cannot find ways of implementing collective security we must be realistic about the alternative

403
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,152
A chaotic violent and ever more dangerous planet

404
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,224
Maybe the cost of military enforcement are too great

405
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
National interest narrowly can

406
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,600
Extrude maybe the safer rule in an anarchic world

407
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:54,464
But let us recognize as we return to that womb we are surrendering magnificent dream

408
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,792
I would say that

409
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,888
He was way wrong they should say to the best I haven't seen any negative

410
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,448
Are you saying that there's been some intervention

411
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
Resume is that the world is

412
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:10,848
Violent conflicts where is it we are humanitarian they're fine what

413
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,248
If you just take the original quote I paying for the New World Order and Blood and Money

414
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
You do make it sound like the author's talking about the villainess s***

415
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,880
But if you read the full editorial you understand the

416
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
Text Maurice.

417
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,952
Alex's never read this article

418
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
He doesn't even know who wrote it

419
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:32,352
Is just seen a quote on some dumb blog he's pretending like this is from the Congressional Record this is just all a lie

420
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
Alex is just lying liar

421
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
I mean it's not really

422
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,312
Oh no I mean yeah absolutely I mean this is that hole

423
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
Yeah

424
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Sure

425
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,712
So we've heard of the pass Alex comparing

426
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
Heavy coronavirus to the flu

427
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,320
Certainly I've noticed a little new thing

428
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
I'm here on the 2nd

429
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,416
Seems to want to compare to the common cold

430
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
A bunch

431
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
Doubedeesarai

432
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
Is ramping up on a comparison

433
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,632
Big World healthier

434
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
All these systems

435
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
I want to learn from you

436
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Analogy

437
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
Here we go

438
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,992
You understand that the coronavirus is the most common virus on terra firma

439
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
Alright well that's out

440
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:32,256
Common cold you always heard you in my 11th manuals and studied

441
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,840
Call Nicole.

442
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,192
Fifty million people year globally

443
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,896
Stop.

444
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
Disabled

445
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
It is true that

446
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,624
The cold can be caused by viruses that are part of the coronavirus family but that's a severe over-simplification

447
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,696
Listen to try and pretend that this 2019 novel Coronavirus

448
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,512
Isn't it anyway really similar to the cold

449
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,840
It is a specific virus in that umbrella group

450
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
But that doesn't mean they're the same

451
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,680
Also the cold is caused by many other thing

452
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
Things like rhinovirus

453
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,056
Too humid Republican in name only viruses I expose

454
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:22,176
Talk to human coronavirus oc43 and 229e

455
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,272
Are responsible for the common cold or are ones that are responsible, code

456
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
Coronavirus nl63 is also thought to cause

457
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,416
Some cold symptoms but it's a slightly different situation

458
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,256
Hku1 is another virus that causes mild

459
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
Incentive the generally

460
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
How many of the big one

461
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,840
SARS MERS

462
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,120
I'm covid-19

463
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,960
That is it in terms of known coronavirus has that can affect humans

464
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,800
It's a big family of viruses but there were only seven that we know of

465
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
They can affect people

466
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:56,736
This isn't a science show so getting into the nitty-gritty details over to probably beyond my capabilities but there is no attacks on

467
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
Coronavirus

468
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
And this is just one family

469
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:04,160
They sure distinctive characteristics like the fact that they have single stranded DNA

470
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:08,768
But Pastor similarities there's a pretty substantial differences between the just like the Huxtable

471
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:16,192
One of the problems with Alex's claimed that about the deaths from a common cold is it there's no way he can have a good stat on that

472
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,776
Cold and flu symptoms are often in almost indistinguishable

473
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,360
You're not going to be able to find isolated numbers of deaths caused by the

474
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Common cold

475
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:28,992
From sources I was able to find it appears that those numbers would most likely be lumped in with quote

476
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,040
Influenza-like illnesses

477
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,576
Stats that Alex already uses

478
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,904
Report regularly

479
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,256
What at least three viruses that can contribute to

480
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,352
Common cold like symptoms even more

481
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,656
You could die of the common cold that's like saying

482
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,704
You could die of any virus that exhibits

483
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,520
That's causes humans to exhibit common cold likes

484
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
And just say that that's

485
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:58,176
The common cold symptoms

486
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
Yeah that's a problem for Alex's

487
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,832
Bulshit

488
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,184
So Alex gets back into talking about the virus

489
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,024
It's killing men

490
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
What else would it be

491
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,096
I think he's

492
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,912
Getting back into like scepter and sell his in

493
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
Specific

494
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
Set of Chinese man

495
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
Asian man

496
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
Race specific

497
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
Statistics today

498
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
You forget that

499
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Weapon

500
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
You have to be deficient

501
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,976
Get the f*** out

502
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Vitamin D

503
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
Vitamin C

504
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,944
Some of the data is tending to show a higher incidence of men being folks have died from this virus

505
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
Burly for anyone

506
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
Glue myself

507
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,296
Alex to definitively say they know why that's

508
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
McKay's

509
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:14,720
The earliest numbers morning this Direction came from China where they showed a 2.8 fatality rate among men compared to a 1.7

510
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
Rate among women

511
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:20,096
The first hypothesis that was offered was that men smoke way more in China

512
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
So this might be the cause

513
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
An article in the guardian site to stat

514
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,776
50% of men in China smoke compared to only 2% of women

515
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,360
Whoever is data is coming from other countries this loses some of its

516
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,152
Potential explanatory power

517
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,992
And Italy more men than women smoke but the Divide isn't nearly as

518
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,832
Because it is in China at the trend of more men dying of coronavirus still hold

519
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:47,744
Numbers are showing the people who smoke are at a higher risk of having severe cases if they could check the virus but it doesn't look like a

520
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
Good explanation

521
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
For the difference

522
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
The death rates

523
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:57,472
An article in the independent quotes Angela rasmuson the virologist at Columbia University who pointed out that this differ

524
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,544
Death rates was also observed in the case of SARS and MERS

525
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,872
Might be a distinct feature of coronavirus is in general

526
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,688
Right now no one has a good answer about

527
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,248
But in time or information will come out

528
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,784
Hopefully he'll be better understood

529
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
The answer is just a y chromosome

530
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:19,488
Boo you could there might be a chromosomal I don't know

531
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Yeah

532
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:26,912
For Alex to come on his show and pretended he knows what's up here is basically I'm saying the understand science better than literally all of the

533
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
Scientist in the world which is

534
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
A little bit full of

535
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,544
Humorous as he pronounces it here is my pet

536
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
But then again

537
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,640
I don't know of any scientist for the cogitate like a couch

538
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:41,248
That's true

539
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,808
They are they generally cogitate differ

540
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Currently been through

541
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,648
I think here's where we go

542
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
Here's what you bring back now that you

543
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,232
You got the men die more

544
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,560
Bring black the fluoride in the water Dan

545
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,400
That's where you go with it fluoride turns with the frogs gay

546
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:02,496
That's why men are weird

547
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:09,152
Men for years now Dan and he's right all along like a little fluoride gassed up

548
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
Appearance later but

549
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,784
Yeah I don't know I don't know he had to lean into it could make that work

550
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,600
A little complicated

551
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,160
So the rest of the clip I think he's just trying to sell his ink

552
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:25,024
It's an interesting strategy and I wonder if you can get in trouble for aggressively selling one of your product

553
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
Because there's ink in it

554
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:32,704
Then stopping doing that and pivoting to just presenting the zinc is a proven prevention for the virus

555
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,240
I wonder if that's

556
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
Trouble

557
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,824
All I heard there was

558
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
4 people in a room

559
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
And two lawyers

560
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
Is and them coming up with different strategy

561
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
No

562
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
Worse

563
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
No

564
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
Maybe that'll work I don't know give us

565
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
I'm done here

566
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:54,976
Anyways I'll just get more billable hours who cares

567
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,048
So his next step is bad science

568
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,096
My favorite 80s movie

569
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,192
And then a weird ramble

570
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,032
It's on record

571
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,872
Manufacturer of virus

572
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,224
30 40 50 60 replications down

573
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,504
That's not possible

574
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,040
Even between Syfy

575
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
Don't be silly

576
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,400
I said

577
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,448
At least

578
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
Drop your weapon

579
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,408
It doesn't matter it's here to take your rights

580
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
Officially

581
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,856
Coronavirus coronavirus Alpharetta

582
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:59,232
Government would just say somebody died from

583
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
You're a hero

584
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,096
1980

585
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
They didn't jump out they jump

586
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
Victory to the side

587
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,544
Clear lag

588
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,944
Make sure the local pool and they got rid of the diving board and all the king's horses and all the king's

589
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,344
I don't know why that's the analogies do them to make because many pools still have died from Florida

590
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
They're diverting don't understand

591
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:33,536
I don't understand the Lincoln is brain even shut down the government didn't make anyone stop having diving board

592
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:39,936
The government suing anybody decide to sue whoever

593
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
Like the pool

594
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:47,872
This has led to some people choosing that it's not worth the risk to have a diving board or not wanting to pay for liability insurance for diving

595
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
What related injuries

596
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
That's a factor

597
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
Publican at home pools

598
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,064
Like but it's a choice you can still make if you want to this I don't understand

599
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
Pennywise

600
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,184
Scientists can't predict what mutations viruses are going to have that's absurd

601
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,816
These mutations are caused by random errors in RNA replication which isn't necessarily A predictable process

602
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:12,704
To be clear there are a certain number of replication errors that can possibly do you know it is

603
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,496
There's only so many

604
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:20,896
Play suspicious replication errors

605
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,480
In one cycle of replication is possible one out of eight

606
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,528
Honda of possible areas could be made

607
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,368
What is a giant number of possible mutations in any number of them

608
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,160
Possible so I don't know how helpful

609
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
It is

610
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
Incredibly stupid for one very

611
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,304
If you know what

612
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,328
Mutations that

613
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
I could make 50

614
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,912
Replications down the line

615
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
Yeah

616
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,496
Suggest that when you create the virus

617
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
You knew how it's going to Beauty

618
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,616
Giving you a depth of knowledge that would give you the ability to

619
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
To keep it from you today

620
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,224
Well

621
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
Deem the correct

622
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,904
If your goal is to get it to where it is 50 mutations later you would just release the 50th you thinking

623
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,280
Later or if you wanted it to achieve a goal you wouldn't want to commute

624
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
And do some

625
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,120
Write the strategy is stupid and it doesn't make sense

626
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,520
There are there are some caveats just because like me saying scientists can't predict these things

627
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,056
It gets into like

628
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
Complexity

629
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
And I don't want to just make that blanket statement

630
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:31,040
The scientists can use the principles of natural selection to guess what sorts of mutations would be favored by nature to be more

631
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
Successful

632
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,440
Have you tasted that would make a virus less debilitating for example and make it more likely to be passed onto new hose

633
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,280
Do you expect that in the case of that kind of a mutation happening

634
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,608
It would be, more prevalent strain of a virus

635
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,264
What I want to talk about is the idea that scientist engineer this virus because they knew how it would end up you dating which is just not within the

636
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
Arrange wood signs

637
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
Can do in the real world

638
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,152
They can take an existing virus and with some accuracy predict what sorts

639
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,200
The medications would be the most success

640
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,760
It's just not even close to what I was saying

641
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,296
Because he's just making s*** up

642
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,904
Most importantly In that clip Alex is saying that the virus is very bad and

643
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,184
It keeps coming back

644
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,512
This is a direct contradiction to his narrative from March 24th

645
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,584
This year where he was saying that it wasn't a big deal

646
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,680
If you get any dinner just could be sick for 9 days in your gut that was forever

647
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:24,032
It's really important to recognize that Alex's narrative make no sense when combined with each other

648
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:28,640
You simultaneously telling his audience of his no big deal he getting sick for a little bit

649
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
Please go back to work

650
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:35,040
And he's also saying it's a horrible bio-weapon that affects your body and keeps coming back

651
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,112
These are incompatible and Alex should be able to do stuff like

652
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
This to his listeners

653
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,976
And nobody's going to stop him

654
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
Sure

655
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:48,096
So a given textbook we learn that Anthony fauci

656
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Is bad news

657
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,192
Someone might die

658
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,216
Coronavirus

659
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,520
So we will

660
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,312
Head officer

661
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
Running this

662
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
Oprah

663
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,016
Operative

664
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,344
Jumpman

665
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
Amazon

666
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
Conduction Beyond

667
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
Cloud

668
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
I'm somebody else's

669
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Freedom

670
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
I mean

671
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,384
Okay so Trump is

672
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
Trump is a globalist

673
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,944
Trump is officially working

674
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:42,368
Trump is no longer the strongman powerful their leader that he wanted my man my man

675
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:48,256
Nothing matters

676
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,608
I'm honestly shocked at the accusation that fauci works for Bill Gates hasn't come up yet

677
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,400
I'm shocked it took this long to

678
00:36:54,656 --> 00:37:00,800
That seems like a real no-brainer considering is the head of the National Institute of allergy and infectious disease and a ton of the Gates Foundation

679
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,360
Philanthropies around issues of infectious disease

680
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,432
But I think Alex is getting things a little twisted

681
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,272
The National Institute of allergy and infectious disease is a government agent

682
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,808
It's funded by tax dollars

683
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,344
It's not grants for Bill Gates

684
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:18,976
It's one of the Institute of the National Institutes of Health which is contained within the Department of Health and Human Services

685
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,536
The National Institute of allergy and infectious

686
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,400
Disease is really the same kind of lame as the Gates Foundation in that they both fun to research

687
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,216
That's pretty easy to connect fauci and Gates that way

688
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:34,848
A simple Google search will pull up articles about joint ventures between the niaid and Gates but

689
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
It doesn't prove it

690
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,688
Thought you got money from gate so that he works for him

691
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,344
I looked into it a little bit and I don't really see what so suspicious about their connection so I consulted right-wing blogs to see if I can get

692
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,928
The better sense of what the proof was

693
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Payroll first shift

694
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,816
Wauconda post on Alex's buddy top Hertz website National file tote

695
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,840
Titled quote

696
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,912
Talk to you in Berks both have big money Bill Gates come

697
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
Conflict of interest

698
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
The pap smear if I ever

699
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,240
11

700
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:07,104
Something I thought was really interesting was that the image they chose for this post was just a Bill Gates

701
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,128
When it's super

702
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,432
Super easy to find a picture of how she and Gates

703
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
Together

704
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,760
No idea why they didn't use that for heightened effect

705
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
That is kind of

706
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Or lazy

707
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,344
Lazy was the word I was

708
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,440
To hear that this blog entry sets

709
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:27,072
Gates has a lot of pull in the medical world he has a multibillion-dollar relationship with dr. fauci

710
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,912
Fauci originally took the gates line supporting vaccines

711
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,960
And casting doubt on chloroquine

712
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,104
So there's a claim with you there's any proof

713
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
Lied

714
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,688
This is as close as the article gets to prove

715
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
They are co-funding the Cambridge Massachusetts biotech company Moderne Inc

716
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:54,464
Vaccine against the Wuhan novel coronavirus now called SARS coronavirus 2

717
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:59,328
Moderna's other partner is the US National Institute of allergy and infectious disease

718
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
The part of the national in

719
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:07,520
Head of niaid is dr. Anthony fauci the person at the center of the Trump Administration by Richard Burgess

720
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Response

721
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,128
I guess my response to be that this would be so what

722
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Smoking Gun

723
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
Funky Music co-funding anything

724
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
The NIH

725
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,272
Stop smoking got the and I hate you providing

726
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,344
Funding for crucial medical research that Bill Gates also provides

727
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,136
What is the conspiracy

728
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
What the buck

729
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
Stops

730
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
Everywhere else dad

731
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,768
That's where that's all I know

732
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,304
Doesn't go

733
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:37,216
The only other evidence provided is that in 2019 it was reported the gates in the NIH or also both providing funding

734
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:41,056
Initiative to develop Gene therapies for HIV and sickle cell

735
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,360
Again what's the conspiracy

736
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:50,272
Out there this article is legitimately so pathetic that It Ends by trying to smear fauci by showing a picture of him with

737
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Hillary Clinton

738
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:57,696
And a screenshot of someone tweeting an email released by Wikileaks get the f*** out of shows that quote fauci is a Hillary Clinton

739
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
Admirer

740
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,584
This article is nothing it's a complete zero but the headline

741
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,656
Ouchie has Bill Gates related conflict of interest

742
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:11,264
And that allows Alex to spin it and say that he's on Gates payroll and now we're off to the races

743
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,592
I reckon this work I really feel like these guys are doing

744
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,688
Because you're going about it all wrong somehow I feel like they're still trying too hard

745
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,504
Because it seems like you could write a program

746
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,344
That looks all you need to do here's what you need to work on if you're in a right-wing

747
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
The headlight

748
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
Programmed

749
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:35,328
Copies and pastes. You've had lines

750
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,448
Onion infuriated Alex

751
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,496
Never tell if it was real or not

752
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,288
So I'm also

753
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,336
I know you were laughing and scoffing about this

754
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
But I'm sad to hear that Alex is not realizing the Trump is not cool

755
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
Trump work with Bill Gates to get

756
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,320
That buck whatever

757
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,744
I don't know what the newest information about the Pentagon Cloud deal with Microsoft is but the last update I saw was for March 3rd

758
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,560
And it was about the Pentagon

759
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:11,168
It was a bunch of stories about how Microsoft had been awarded this contract

760
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,752
But the Pentagon was asking courts to give them time to reconsider it

761
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:20,896
This is because Amazon was claiming that there were irregularities with the contract awarding process so they wanted time to sort it all out

762
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:26,784
Either way it's really strange dear Alexei the Trump giving a contract to Microsoft instead of Jeff Bezos is bad

763
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,112
Reply that it should have gone to Bezos who Alex also hate

764
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:34,720
I don't know man this is a good times I need to remind you that nothing Alex says me in something

765
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Nothing

766
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
No

767
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
So

768
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,632
Alex teases his big report again

769
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,656
In this next clip

770
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
And

771
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,216
Based on the way he describes it

772
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
I'm like this is not going to be good

773
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,431
Robin

774
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,735
Any problems they want to shut down

775
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,855
Document

776
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,951
Premier

777
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,167
Know what were the two big strikes there

778
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,703
Alex and he's proud of it

779
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:23,103
Not good

780
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,663
Great at peak hours

781
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:31,551
You've got great I can't imagine how bad is working late at night

782
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,599
Red Bulls and vodka

783
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,927
Katana kitten that is a guy who will put out some good chips

784
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,975
Hell yeah this is like

785
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:46,143
Trailer for a movie you didn't like you two had no hope

786
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,727
Woody Guthrie

787
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
You know what

788
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:55,359
Alright I already thought that was going to be bad that trailer is disappointed that's how I feel

789
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,687
In in his nightclub Alex talks about like these

790
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:03,039
Sort of distancing measures and how like it's polite

791
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,831
If you're walking down the street

792
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,135
Not to walk next to somebody

793
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
That is helping you know

794
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Alex

795
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,511
Vintage bad to be polite hug strength or something

796
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,095
He keeps doing this weird condescending voice

797
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,167
About I whenever you talk about the bike

798
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,519
And then everyone gets into it and it's like a new form of hospitality

799
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,847
Origin

800
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
I'm sorry

801
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
20

802
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
We we we we we

803
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
Says I'm essential

804
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,599
I get to go out

805
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,439
Voicemail

806
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:48,351
Wachowski says

807
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
And

808
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
I called their chin throttle it

809
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:17,791
CC eating multiple things that he's completely twisting from fauci satcom at there

810
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
Exactly what you were

811
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
It's very productive

812
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
It's kind of rude

813
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,703
But he sounds like a whiny baby while pretending to make

814
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
Make fun of other people

815
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:30,079
Wait until we get through this

816
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,639
Go outside where I want to go

817
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:36,735
Some of this towards the middle and end of this episode is

818
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,039
As babyish as I've ever seen this

819
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:45,439
F****** the 46 year-old man

820
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,719
Is so pathetic

821
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,511
Oh my God I can't go out for

822
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,839
Two months ago but I want to go places

823
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
I don't

824
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
I don't know what to save life

825
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,935
Shut up I don't know exact

826
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:01,055
Entirely what's behind his internship but there's a there's a strain of it

827
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,871
So Alex believes the people love corn

828
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,199
Emptying and self isolate

829
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,271
The reality is

830
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,855
That's that's what that's fair

831
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,951
This gets into like this is the first point of the show where I was like

832
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,255
Like I really felt like untethered

833
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,535
I'll be this point

834
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,303
I think it would stoop

835
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
Alex Jones Show stupid

836
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,887
This is where I was like

837
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,935
Here we go

838
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,727
Get that feeling of like

839
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,031
I don't know I would relate it to like

840
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,311
Maybe when you're a kid

841
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,895
And you're in the pool and you don't really know how to swim but you

842
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
Consumed a little bit

843
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,455
And you like you know you

844
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,783
You're walking towards the deeper end it get to that point where you realize your feet

845
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,831
You can't touch

846
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
Yeah that little moment of panic

847
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,903
Of like oh no no no

848
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
That's

849
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:55,071
But I felt about that happened to me and I went down

850
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,631
Untethered it feels

851
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:03,007
Domesticated so soft

852
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,823
People are getting into it

853
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:12,223
Because they don't want to go to work and those people at most jobs aren't even working anyway

854
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,111
Most surgeries are elective

855
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,927
Mozart

856
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:32,703
People get surgeries every month

857
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,639
I was like oh oh I just felt like a what are we doing what are we doing

858
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Odell

859
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,479
Did somebody give him a buck before the break

860
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,783
What happened

861
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:52,671
I don't know where he's getting any of that information

862
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
Feel like you need some

863
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,287
It doesn't cause brain damage

864
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,823
Unless something goes wrong

865
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:17,247
That's sad that seems like something the health Ranger must have told Alex and now he's just repeating on are without looking it up

866
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,039
There are some caveats of course

867
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:25,695
A 2019 article in the Journal of anesthetics does point out that Studies have shown that quote multiple rounds of anesthetic

868
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:30,047
Exposure in children under 2 to 4 years of age are associated with learning difficulty

869
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,583
In academic underachieving

870
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
Childhood and Adolescence

871
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,399
That sounds right

872
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
The same was not true single exposure

873
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:41,055
And generally a doctor would not anesthetize someone whose brain was still developing

874
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:44,383
Multiple times unless there was very good reason to do so

875
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:50,527
Even so this article makes a really good point about the limitation of retrospective studies that could be done about the effects

876
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
Of anesthetic

877
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,879
And that is that no one just takes anesthetics

878
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,415
There's another variable that

879
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,719
Always in place which is the surgery

880
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,255
It's pretty difficult

881
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,535
Ignore that when you're looking

882
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303
Bodega

883
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,119
Just why both of these studies will not talk about

884
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,167
Defective anesthetics on

885
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,959
Like development of rain

886
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,519
The anesthetic and surgery right almost

887
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,079
Impossible to uncouple

888
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,871
Nobody's getting a

889
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
No

890
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,455
Note 2 year old is getting an elective surgery

891
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:24,575
12 year olds looking over in like selective surgery is a surgery

892
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:29,183
But yeah that's what I'm saying you don't work right

893
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,719
Know what it was

894
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
Nobody uses

895
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
Square

896
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:36,863
Well I think anybody who is is dead

897
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,655
They're very difficult

898
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:46,079
So that article there's there's an elderly patients who undergo Anderson

899
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,663
Cesar called postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive

900
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
Dysfunction

901
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:55,807
The prior is a short-lived condition that we usually pass within days where the ladder can linger for a long time

902
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
However quote

903
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:01,439
Clinical evidence attributing pocd surgery and anesthesia exposure

904
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
Inconclusive

905
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:07,071
As long-term follow-up study found only 1% of elderly patients suffer from persistent

906
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:10,911
Pocd with preoperative cognitive performance

907
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
Which is to say

908
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,215
Mild cognitive decline

909
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,519
Possible or probable Alzheimer's disease

910
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,591
That's a better predictor of postoperative cognitive

911
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
Doctor

912
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:25,247
Anyway the point is here that that they're obviously some people who can be negatively affected by anesthesia

913
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,599
The surgery is mishandled

914
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:33,951
Absolutely no right to say that

915
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
Every time

916
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,279
Nonsense

917
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
Is weird

918
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,607
Me too

919
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,167
My name is beat the the waking up part was I

920
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,983
It was yeah

921
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:52,383
So also the sort of surgery Alex is describing where people are getting a little surgery on their fingers can pain pills that doesn't work

922
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,919
Require general anesthetic

923
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:58,527
That would a hundred percent just be a localized anesthetic situation where you don't go under

924
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:04,927
If I understand the conspiracy here Alex is saying that these doctors are in on the scam and they're performing these trivial pointless finger surgery

925
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,951
Used to justify their patient

926
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
Pain pill prescription

927
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,815
If that's the case there is literally zero chance they would use General

928
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:16,447
Aesthetic another person there who specially-trained anesthesiology

929
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,751
I have a ridiculously high liability

930
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,799
Are these doctors not in on it

931
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:27,199
If that's the case then most of these doctors are probably do an x-ray or look at the first medical charts the other recent surgery

932
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,223
Reason probably report them

933
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,247
Drug-seeking Behavior

934
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,599
One thing they probably would not do if you never give them

935
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,647
Generalized anesthetic for finger surgery

936
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,927
That's insane

937
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,975
You not learned about the opioid at

938
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
Epidemic and how you don't

939
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:43,583
Need to get Circle

940
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,863
Jesus has so many doctor

941
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
Or just like

942
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,191
Paid by pharmaceutical companies

943
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:54,847
Give them away you don't even have to pretend I usually get a fake finger surgery

944
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,895
Prescribing 10 million pills every year

945
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,663
Not enough

946
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,455
Finger surgery

947
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:05,855
Also according to a 2008 analysis by the American College of Surgeons using data from Colorado Florida New Jersey

948
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:10,975
It was estimated that the average American will receive 9.2 surgeries in their lifetime

949
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:15,071
But this number is based on an assumption that a person lives to 85

950
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:19,167
And obviously there are way more surgeries that will happen in the elderly portion

951
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
Of your life

952
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:26,079
Also the range workout to the surgery in that study is pretty wide so it's kind of silly to be talking about this

953
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:32,479
My point is that I was just making s*** up about people getting 15 surgery by the time they're 50 and that anesthesia gives you brain damage

954
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,551
Like legitimately that was where I was like we are

955
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,623
In Cuckoo Land out this makes no sense

956
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,415
It's barely connected to anything

957
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,207
That we were talking about

958
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,767
It was it made me feel worried here we go

959
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,839
And the speed with which he is speaking

960
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,191
So anyway is brain-damaged

961
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,799
Dementia

962
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,615
Fluoride

963
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,151
And now it's going to be

964
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,967
Yearly coronavirus vaccines

965
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:19,327
A bunch of articles about anaesthesia and brain damn

966
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,655
Damage but I realized after they closed that I didn't Google the exact words

967
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,959
Anesthesia causes major brain damage

968
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
So I did that

969
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,031
And I found an article on the website

970
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,311
Play Patience. Org

971
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,103
I'm sorry patient info

972
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
And here's what this says

973
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:38,783
Brain damage as a result of having an anesthetic is so rare that the risk has not been put into numbers

974
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,831
Alex should stop telling me to look fat

975
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,391
Has not been put into numbers

976
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,695
Yep that's such a small risk

977
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,791
Every time

978
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
Get the f*** out of here

979
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:57,215
So Alex is her story about a surfer getting arrested for surfing on a video about it

980
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,031
By themselves

981
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,335
Quarter mile office

982
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
Fornia

983
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:12,063
While you're still serving that be cool

984
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:19,999
New York

985
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,815
Boy we catch you

986
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,679
Hand sanitizer

987
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,007
The general public being criminals

988
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,055
The criminals are taking over the government

989
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
Your guys

990
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,919
And they get it all

991
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,991
What is going wrong with it

992
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,783
That's not good

993
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,159
Price gouging is okay with Alex now he's falling in line with the nice Institute

994
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:55,327
Did the stories that the Alex is talking about with that murderer who was released in New York is a bit of sticky situation

995
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:02,239
This is a story about Pedro then Aunt Marcia and the issue is that he's been charged with the murder but he hasn't been tried

996
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
Convicted

997
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,543
So he doesn't have a sentence

998
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,847
At the same time he almost certain

999
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,871
He killed his girlfriend

1000
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,175
I don't know about the daughter that Alex is talking

1001
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:10,943
About that was

1002
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,967
In the story bud

1003
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
The New York Post reports quote

1004
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,855
The gruesome attack was captured on surveillance video and Witness by numerous bystanders

1005
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
According to court papers

1006
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,695
A cops nabbed him he allegedly asked

1007
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,743
Quote is she dead I hope so

1008
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:29,375
We as non-state actors can see this information say that did that murder

1009
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:33,983
You'll be completely different thing for the state to do that without first having a trial

1010
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:39,103
To treat him as a convicted murderer prior to trial would go against some of the very basic rights that the

1011
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,127
Alex

1012
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,687
Professes to love all the time protect never heard of it

1013
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,711
Second Amendment

1014
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,319
To make matters slightly more complicated this dude is 63 years old

1015
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
And quotes

1016
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,647
Cardiovascular disease pulmonary disease

1017
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
Type 2 diabetes

1018
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:56,767
Which basically put them in realtor the danger zone in terms of being exposed

1019
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
The virus

1020
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,607
Here's a real high likelihood that if he gets it it could kill him

1021
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,959
And certain level putting him in prison where he could be exposed to it would

1022
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,543
When he's not been to trial

1023
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
Obviously this

1024
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,615
Is Messi

1025
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,895
Bartolotta option

1026
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,943
He would have gone to Rikers

1027
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:20,575
Square 231 incarcerated persons and 223 staff have tested positive for the virus

1028
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:23,135
According to an April 2nd article in slate

1029
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:26,207
He hasn't been tried but seems like the only thing the steak

1030
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:30,303
I can do is put them on some kind of a supervised release program or house arrest

1031
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,583
Or something like that

1032
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,607
It's a mess

1033
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:36,959
Listen.

1034
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,495
Be in favor of

1035
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,311
Aruba kind of cruel and unusual

1036
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
Body weave

1037
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,871
We haven't gone to try

1038
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,943
With this coronavirus going around

1039
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:48,991
We just don't want

1040
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:49,759
Put you in Rikers

1041
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,319
I'm going to have you sit in this chair over here at the

1042
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,087
The very

1043
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,879
Quietroom it's all empty

1044
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:00,767
Well I mean yeah there's straps on it and no don't even worry about that thing that it's hooked up

1045
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:06,399
Oh okay so it does look like a franken's a doctor Frankenstein handle don't worry

1046
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:11,007
And it's not like they're letting him free of being like have fun

1047
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
It's like there

1048
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,103
It's still murder trial that you've going

1049
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,663
To have everybody what I'd like you to do is leave the state

1050
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
You you have a good day

1051
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:25,599
Another case of that Surfer got arrested was a situation where all the beaches have been closed in Los Angeles County so people are essentially

1052
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,623
Trespassing if they go to

1053
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,951
Guy in Malibu goes episode of anyway and gets arrested

1054
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,511
Little harsh just get a ticket

1055
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:33,791
Yes

1056
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
And you probably would have

1057
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,119
If you had to put a total a****** to the officers

1058
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,143
Score, declarative

1059
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
Terry go

1060
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:45,311
According to an article in the Mercury News it says that he was out surfing and was quote seemingly teasing the cops in life

1061
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:50,175
Cards like he was going to get out of the water only just been back out towards the ocean and ride more waves

1062
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,711
He was doing it like

1063
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:03,231
Pictures

1064
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:11,423
I honestly I'm going to be honest I think that might be worth a little truly you're wasting the cops time

1065
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:15,007
First we have better things to do than most likely

1066
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,799
But I'm still sure he just got like a

1067
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:21,919
Ticket and got released on his own recognizance

1068
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,503
Nonsense nonsense stories

1069
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,087
So

1070
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:35,487
There's this weird tension that Alex is describing where and he's talking to people a bunch in his daily life who are they

1071
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:41,887
Like that we don't want to shake and but they also know that it's b******* and everybody should still be doing all the same stuff

1072
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:44,191
But they are just trying to be like they just think

1073
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,471
Alex doesn't want to shake

1074
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,751
It's weird

1075
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,591
Everyone seems to be doing it for each other or something and Alex's can

1076
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,359
Confused

1077
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,807
I know I just thought maybe

1078
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,855
Everyone

1079
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,207
I think I was a bit of a

1080
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,095
You go along with it and so

1081
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,399
Going to take everything you've got

1082
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:17,727
Coronavirus vaccine

1083
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,799
And coronavirus vaccines

1084
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,591
And they're going to beg for them

1085
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,871
I think

1086
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,151
The people are already

1087
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,223
Bacon for the 4th I think they would have been out already

1088
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:33,855
And if that were the case that they're like there's wait until you beg for it

1089
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,903
Could pass that fly

1090
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,671
Isaac

1091
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,999
If we're this the globalist plan

1092
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,559
They have missed IMDb

1093
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,607
Installing

1094
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:48,703
The only people who are not begging for a vaccine right now are zealots

1095
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:55,103
With regardless of like a religion or political ideology there's a certain zealotry

1096
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,199
That goes along with that anti-vax

1097
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
Are you people

1098
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,735
F****** crazy

1099
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,015
Yeah

1100
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Let's go

1101
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,855
Is the last one before we get to that

1102
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,391
Amazing report

1103
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:13,535
That Rob do stayed up late working on a book report you wasn't ready for

1104
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,583
This is just all so stupid

1105
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,007
Because it's always changing

1106
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
It's got to be exact

1107
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,103
They don't care

1108
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:37,343
You and your mommy they're going to block your ass now it'll kill you slow

1109
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:54,495
Officers military

1110
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:19,071
I was quite a pivot that was literally that was impressive

1111
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,631
That's Alex playing at top

1112
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:30,847
That's the stuff I be in your body whatever you do don't buy my product

1113
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:42,367
Still got that cold vaccine

1114
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:49,023
The reason there is no vaccine for the common cold is because the virus is constant it's not because the virus is constantly changing

1115
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:53,887
There's a bunch of different viruses that cause what we call the cold already talked about this a little bit but

1116
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,167
Cold is really just a collector

1117
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,959
Can have symptoms not a specific condition

1118
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,775
And because it could be caused by so many different things

1119
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,823
He'll be really unwieldy to try and vaccinated

1120
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
Against all of them

1121
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,919
The CDC says the quote more than 200 viruses

1122
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:09,503
Can cause a cold and many of them are from different virus families

1123
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,063
Something that would prevent them all

1124
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,599
Would probably be impossible

1125
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:19,999
Frost plus most goals are pretty mild so the demand for cold vaccine is pretty low compared to other pressing that

1126
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:20,767
Medical research

1127
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,327
Although there are people who are working on

1128
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,143
It's some similar things in there may be a breakthrough at something

1129
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,167
But it's like

1130
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:31,007
There are other things that most of the funding goes to

1131
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:38,175
See they haven't cured every disease in the world yet so obviously that they dates

1132
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,711
Too complicated or whatever

1133
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,759
Yeah something like that

1134
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:45,343
So anyway Alex goes out to break with that abrasive

1135
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:50,207
Bill Cooper ask siren here-we-go announcing

1136
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:57,119
Time

1137
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,679
Infowars.com

1138
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:04,287
Mission is to get this report out here it is

1139
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,823
Okay should I accept it

1140
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,407
Alright I don't don't don't don't don't

1141
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,175
Don't

1142
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,183
Bingo burlesque

1143
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,719
Okay that's right

1144
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
Miss it

1145
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:32,447
Virus that was terrifying virus you can do what you love

1146
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:37,823
Best to use

1147
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639

Vendetta's Realty

1150
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:01,375
The heaviest this report the Rob do stayed up all night hallucinating

1151
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,679
Together we're starting off with

1152
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,727
IMovie

1153
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
As always

1154
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
Bingo

1155
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:14,431
So our sort a little bit more about this about how there's real-world inspiration in V for Vendetta than you

1156
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,711
Is that

1157
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,167
#trumpcare

1158
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
Monsters

1159
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,455
Hugo Chavez

1160
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,255
The other slaves

1161
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:06,655
So is true that the government in V for Vendetta is inspired a bit by some real-world fascist and authoritarian States

1162
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Weather

1163
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,983
Stories intended to be more specific on that

1164
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:16,639
V for Vendetta was based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore who's been pretty clear that he wrote it with a strongly aunt

1165
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,431
Anti Margaret Thatcher message

1166
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:23,807
He felt that the government depicted in his book was The Logical extension of where British conservative

1167
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:24,575
Six were heading

1168
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:28,415
Also Alex if he's so concerned about how the movie is reality

1169
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:33,535
I'm certainly am excited for him to get to the part about how the government scapegoats vulnerable population

1170
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:37,119
For the problems in society that should be fun

1171
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,655
It was Chinese people who wrote

1172
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:46,591
Also a big part of the vibe of the graphic novel is about the national front the rise of the

1173
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:52,991
Which incidentally is a group that was associated with the English Defence League which was founded by Alex's friend Tom

1174
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,015
Bobby Robinson

1175
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:58,879
I was literally friends with someone who Pals around with the information for the feelings at this graphic novel

1176
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,183
Yeah but the villains are always the good guys

1177
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,719
I guess

1178
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:07,071
Also this is the reporter Alex is supposed to layout globalist admissions

1179
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:11,167
And it's about V for Vendetta should have expected that

1180
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,215
Of course it's about V for Vendetta

1181
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,007
So anyway

1182
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
Stupid it's just

1183
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,311
Art imitating life

1184
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,847
4 something

1185
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
Are timid

1186
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:20,895
Life imitate

01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Art Munoz

1188
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
Baby

1189
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,335
This

1190
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,687
This is clearly and off

1191
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
Call Francisco

1192
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,735
Biological

1193
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,015
Warfare

1194
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,087
Egypt the top scientist Boyle

1195
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Scientist

1196
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,647
Around the world

1197
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,207
Play that clip one more time

1198
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:12,607
Scientist isn't true and the Clippers playing to demonstrate it is Francis Boyle on

1199
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,655
Top Southwest

1200
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:17,727
That's a huge

1201
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:23,103
Clip from his own show do you know how much that cost had to

1202
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,639
Dick for that one

1203
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,175
So anyway he goes on

1204
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,711
He probably got it from us

1205
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,271
Choreograph

1206
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,583
Permanently erase

1207
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:51,775
So in March 2018 the World Health Organization did lift disease access one of the on their list

1208
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,799
The top concerns

1209
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:56,895
It wasn't them scraping out eventual release of a bioweapon it was an attempt to focus

1210
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:00,223
Attention on the fact that the next big problem that we will likely face

1211
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,783
From a public health standpoint was something that was

1212
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,343
Completely unknown to us before it happens

1213
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:09,183
They were they weren't saying we need to go blibber teas because of the

1214
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Disease X

1215
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:14,559
Central air brakes are handled correctly they don't become big outbreaks

1216
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:20,447
You know there were multiple cases of Ebola in the United States in 2014 and it didn't spread because appropriate steps were taken

1217
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
To contain it

1218
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,543
That's what the World Health Organization was advocating in the discussion

1219
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:29,663
Zach's not letting an outbreak it bad and then trying to play catch-up so you can take people's rights away

1220
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,455
Is all nonsense Alex's a match

1221
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,759
So It Goes On

1222
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,319
I'm just playing basically

1223
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:40,159
Caught a whole cut-up little part where he's just

1224
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:43,999
Rambling whenever there's like a specific piece of information

1225
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:47,839
That's that I've just taken all of these specific

1226
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,863
Pre-taped segments

1227
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,191
Ran at a time

1228
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:56,543
Late at night time

1229
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,967
465

1230
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,927
Robot drone enforcement

1231
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,207
Of course

1232
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:19,071
So Alice is making s*** up there about the event 201 to make a better fit his narrative

1233
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:25,471
Exercise wasn't related to this coronavirus outbreak you just happen to use a mock coronavirus as it's hypothetical

1234
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:32,383
Because they're easily transmittable and because the world is already seen is SARS and MERS outbreak in the recent past there by May

1235
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,175
Making the scenario more realistic

1236
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,479
Do the participants who were in it as an extra

1237
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,343
I was just making up the recommendations that the exercise arrived at

1238
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,879
There's literally a webpage

1239
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,647
Page dedicated

1240
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,671
The recommendations

1241
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
Which are as follows

1242
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:52,607
One government's International organizations and businesses should plan now for how essential corporate capabilities can be

1243
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,143
I will be utilized during

1244
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,423
Large-scale pandemic

1245
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
Good thing they did that

1246
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:03,103
To Industry National governments and international organizations should work together to enhance internationally held stockpile

1247
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,639
House of medical countermeasures

1248
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,223
To enable rapid and equitable distribution during the severe pandemic

1249
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,527
Okay Counterpoint what they should do is

1250
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,087
Have a fireball the medical so

1251
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
Supplies

1252
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
Enforce governor

1253
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,183
Stupid for them and then do them out as

1254
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,487
His personal that wasn't on their list

1255
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,023
Are you sure I'm positive

1256
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:27,679
Three countries International organizations and Global Transport company should work together to maintain travel and trade during severe

1257
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,215
Pandemics

1258
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:34,079
Essential to the global economy as well as to National and even local

1259
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:40,479
Economies and they should be maintained even in the face of a pandemic steal supplies from other

1260
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,503
And keep them in your eye

1261
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
Ford

1262
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:47,391
Government should provide more resources and support to the development

1263
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,463
Manufacturing a vaccine

1264
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,791
Therapeutics and Diagnostics that will be needed during severe pain

1265
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,119
Five Global business should recognize the economic burden

1266
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:57,887
Pandemics

1267
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,167
Sandpiper stronger preparedness

1268
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:04,543
International organizations should prioritize reducing economic impact of epidemics

1269
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,311
Pandemics

1270
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
7

1271
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
Government

1272
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,663
And the private sector should assign a greater response

1273
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,967
Greater priority to developing methods

1274
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,991
To combat Miss

1275
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,271
And disinformation

1276
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,039
Prior

1277
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,831
The next pandemic.

1278
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,391
It's so funny whenever people do with

1279
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,207
And then all wrong and you're like

1280
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:27,583
What who could have known who could possibly have ever figured this one

1281
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:33,983
Recommendations do they have everyone gets locked

1282
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:38,335
A panel of experts go to the simulation in order to brainstorm actionable advice

1283
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,639
They could help better prepare for an epidemic

1284
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,687
I think a point we're seeing

1285
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,735
As a camp with an alright list

1286
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
I was just make

1287
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:50,367
Yeah well you got a smear people who kind of predicted where

1288
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:53,183
We should have gone and are watching us go the opposite

1289
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
Manuel

1290
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:56,767
When we back to this dumb report

1291
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,535
The Rob did

1292
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,119
True

1293
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,239
Are you not going to reference

1294
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,263
The graphic novel

1295
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,079
Brothers

1296
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,111
Graphic novel

1297
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,647
True but it's on the white paper

1298
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:31,327
He's not going to reference it was based on a graphic novel they made it up and wrote the script.

1299
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,119
Bring up Alan Moore at all

1300
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,399
You know

1301
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:39,519
Besides it's from these white papers because I'm being specific about any of them but

1302
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,823
What kind of work he's doing here

1303
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,639
They see it in white papers officially

1304
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:47,967
So let's see where it goes I mean I need I need meteor

1305
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,527
These ideas

1306
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,159
50 years ago

1307
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,047
For the elite believe

1308
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,095
He did it himself

1309
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
The population

1310
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
Good morning

1311
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,711
Text cities

1312
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:25,343
As far as I can tell Mathis didn't say that was really is a bioweapon to get rid of people

1313
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:30,207
He was most closely identified with what's known as the malthusian catch a catastrophe

1314
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,815
Hypothetical event that happens when population growth outpaces the supply of resource

1315
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:39,423
It was his belief that after that point people being really terrible shape and so we should avoid it

1316
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:43,775
He also had a feeling that population was going to be kept in check one way or another

1317
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,823
Either we could do it ourselves with birth

1318
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:51,199
Control and Family Planning Coordinator would end up doing it with famines and resource Wars that would come after this

1319
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
Pathetical

1320
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,735
Catastrophe

1321
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:56,063
A lot of folks are not a fan of Malthus is work

1322
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:00,415
Eventually if Alex is a Critic of his but he'll find himself standing side-by-side

1323
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:06,047
With Carl barks and all the Communists he likes to yell about all the time who also hate Malthus

1324
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:13,727
Honestly I could get into the Play-Doh stuff but I don't think Alex has read it and it seems stupid to try and even engage with him

1325
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,519
When he's talking about philosophy

1326
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,311
Not doing it all of Plato's

1327
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:20,639
Socratic dialogues are written as debates that Socrates is having

1328
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,919
With some other person

1329
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:27,039
So if you want to cherry-pick lines as being the point of the text itself it's really easy to do that

1330
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:34,975
So far Alex's talked about V for Vendetta a bunch of nothing and proved and then vaguely pointed at

1331
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,999
Malthus

1332
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,279
And Play-Doh

1333
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:40,607
He made an airtight case.

1334
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,143
Sure that's how I

1335
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,031
The club of Rome

1336
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,639
Calling for Global

1337
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,991
Prince Charles

1338
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,551
Constantly

1339
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Constantly

1340
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,975
In the event that I am

1341
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:12,607
I would like to return it

1342
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:20,031
Reported by Deutsche presse-agentur DPA 1988

1343
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,311
Prince Philip quote

1344
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:25,919
He didn't constantly say it it was just include in the foreword of a book called if I were an animal

1345
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,759
That voice over here reading the quote is from the movie and the game

1346
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,551
Caesar cut that out of endgame

1347
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,599
It's actually misattribution and

1348
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,623
And incorrect quotes

1349
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:37,695
I can find no primary source from the Dutch

1350
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:41,535
Press Argent or from 1988 that book

1351
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,839
About what you would like to be if you were an animal

1352
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,375
1987

1353
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:52,031
Unless Alex is a primary source on this I have to assume this is a bad game of telephone and maybe there was some German press

1354
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,335
Set reported on the forward to that book

1355
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,639
And it got mixed up in Translation or something

1356
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,455
But all of it traces back to the foreword of that book

1357
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,503
Mandu had to do some real work to

1358
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:05,087
Oh yeah

1359
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:10,207
The club of Rome that specific text Alex is obviously referring to their publication

1360
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:10,975
The limit

1361
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
Growth

1362
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,559
Which came out not in the sixties but in 1972

1363
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,839
Howard should know that

1364
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,655
Because the club of Rome wasn't founded until 1968

1365
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,703
And limits to growth was their first release

1366
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,983
They did not put out anything

1367
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
In the 60s

1368
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,031
I've read limits

1369
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,847
Growth and it doesn't recommend or support for

1370
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,127
Global depopulation

1371
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:34,527
It's more of an analysis of how continuing unrestricted growth would be unsustainable past proximately 2070

1372
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,319
After which point we're in for disaster

1373
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:42,207
The authors have released multiple follow-ups like the 2004 limits to growth 30-year update

1374
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:47,327
And in 2012 they put out 2052 a global forecast for the next forty years

1375
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:52,191
None of them say that we should have forced Global depopulation but do recommend people have less children

1376
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,519
Totally up to you to decide if that's good or bad advice but it's soup

1377
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,567
Reedley dishonest to pretend that these texts

1378
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,591
In some way proof

1379
01:15:58,847 --> 01:15:59,615
But the authors wanted to

1380
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,895
To populate the world

1381
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:04,223
Their main point was the population growing itself limit

1382
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:07,039
Buy all of its own it will limited cell

1383
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,343
Well we've never seen evidence of that in the wild

1384
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:13,951
Under the assumption that there are finite resources population has its own limit

1385
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,231
The goal is not

1386
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,279
To find a way to kill people off

1387
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,303
Find a way to

1388
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:24,703
Continue some kind of growth that averts the disastrous consequences that they foresee coming from unbridled growth path

1389
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,239
That's the points that the resources

1390
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:31,871
You cannot trust people who spend all of their time analyzing past event

1391
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:36,991
Ants and synthesizing current information together in order to create a forecast

1392
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,271
As for what could happen

1393
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,343
Obviously as we saw with all these Bill and Melinda Gates things

1394
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,391
I have no idea what the f*** their talk

1395
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:48,255
Talking about listen to those recommendations we're not doing any of those things then we're fine

1396
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:52,351
So far I would say this report is not going well

1397
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,887
And it continues

1398
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,079
Population

1399
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,319
Have more money

1400
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,415
Panel

1401
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,439
And you're not

1402
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
Pretty near the cereal

1403
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,519
ICloud

1404
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,287
Let's take a look

1405
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
Following

1406
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:45,087
Alex has some f****** brass balls complaining about that Newsweek article the case for killing granny after you spent

1407
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:49,183
Considerable time on his own show advocating the people go back to work and risk a ton of

1408
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,487
Because they're not do so I would hurt the economy

1409
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,839
Also Alex is taking those comments from Bill Gates while they are contacts

1410
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,375
We just got to the past but those

1411
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,447
Clips of Alex uses there are tiny slivers of Gates making

1412
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,471
Sweetly different point

1413
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,495
Alex is playing

1414
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543
Alex knows what he's doing

1415
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,079
He complains about being taken out of

1416
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,359
All the time

1417
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:10,175
Most likely because he knows that's what he does to people

1418
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:10,943
All the time

1419
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,503
If if there was a good

1420
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:14,783
Democratic op

1421
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,879
Episode

1422
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,647
Easy to

1423
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,671
Put side-by-side

1424
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,463
Now being like

1425
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,743
Go back to work

1426
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,279
We need the economy goat look

1427
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:28,863
Several people are going to die that's just something that we have to accept

1428
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,655
Juxtaposed with

1429
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:35,775
Going to kill grandma

1430
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,823
Everyone take 02

1431
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,871
Somehow we're not do

1432
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:43,967
Also what is the Rockefeller Foundation Carnegie endowment plan

1433
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,015
Alex can't claim that this is a report that

1434
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:49,855
Approves all this s*** and then randomly pull names out of a hat he needs to use

1435
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,623
Lifx

1436
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,415
He wants this to mean anything which

1437
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,207
It does not so far

1438
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,767
Maybe this is what he's talking about

1439
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,815
Rockefeller Carnegie endowment plan

1440
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,239
Hugo Reid

1441
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,263
Caldwell

1442
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,591
World government

1443
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,871
Will redic

1444
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,895
Starbucks

1445
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:22,111
That is just embarrassing that is embarrassed because he's only red

1446
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,415
Little dumb blurbs about it on stupid blogs

1447
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,231
So he only knows about one scenario in the report

1448
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,279
That's cringe level stuff

1449
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,815
Particularly when he says ice

1450
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,839
Suggest you go read it

1451
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:34,143
I suggest you read it

1452
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:40,543
Actually called scenarios for the future of technology and International Development we covered it in-depth on a recent episode

1453
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:44,127
Has nothing to do with the plan to bring an authoritarian Rule and crush the public

1454
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:50,015
That's all just a paranoid delusions that Alex has picked up most likely from its coverage on Jim's that's a Blog

1455
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,295
So great

1456
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:57,183
So far not proving anything no that's not that's not very good but I was going to go with my

1457
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,719
My scary plan is be

1458
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:00,255
Kardashian Cuban

1459
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,559
Watch out for bees play

1460
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:09,215
That was Mark Cuban and Kim Kardashian got together and they created a simulation where and we all get to eat

1461
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:09,983
Eaten by bees

1462
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,775
So that's one to watch out for

1463
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,055
Or they're going to implement

1464
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:17,920
That real Sarah believe is they say watch that space

1465
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,248
See what else is coming in this stupid report

1466
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,624
World

1467
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:38,912
Visual saying

1468
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,448
We should get rid of the old p

1469
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,312
What you're the one saying that you'd come back to work so they can die for us

1470
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,080
I don't know

1471
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,128
I was getting a lot of mileage out of the phrase

1472
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:50,176
Former British prime ministers and others

1473
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:55,296
There's one all he's referring to is a comment from a singular former British prime minister Gordon Brown

1474
01:20:56,064 --> 01:21:01,696
Gordon's not talking so much about calling for world government is he's calling for an emergency International task force

1475
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:04,512
To deal with the medical and economic crises that are popping up

1476
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,048
Largely because they are issues

1477
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,096
They don't have concern for National boundaries

1478
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:12,704
These are Global problems that could be much more easily solved if

1479
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,496
Now heavy International cooperation

1480
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:20,640
If that's World Government I guess fine I'll let Alex have that but isn't pretty weak stuff for him to hang his hat on

1481
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:26,528
It fast this is a tappet call for World Government from a guy who hasn't been prime minister in a decade so

1482
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:31,392
Nation-states in constant conflict

1483
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
Actually agree

1484
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
That's all I'm saying

1485
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:35,744
Alright

1486
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:36,768
Interesting

1487
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,536
Perhaps

1488
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,608
But if Alex could use a report

1489
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,400
And he uses a quote

1490
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,448
Actually gets right

1491
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,496
Are you still wrong

1492
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,288
Aaron Franklin

1493
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,056
No no

1494
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,336
Those

1495
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,408
Ford security

1496
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,528
You always

1497
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,672
Who's running

1498
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:10,816
Cliche

1499
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,352
World population

1500
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,728
So Alex is largely quoting that Benjamin Franklin saying correct

1501
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:21,568
Play however it's kind of interesting to understand the original context of the quote

1502
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,848
Benjamin wittes

1503
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:27,712
The editor of warfare explained the context in a 2015 interview with NPR like this

1504
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:33,088
He was writing about a tax dispute between the Pennsylvania general assembly in the family of the pens

1505
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,648
The proprietary family the Pennsylvania colony

1506
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
Who ruled it

1507
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,184
From afar

1508
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:40,512
And the legislature was trying to tax the pain family land

1509
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:43,328
Pay for Frontier defense during the French and Indian War

1510
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,888
Depends family kept instructing the governor

1511
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,656
DeVito

1512
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:51,008
Franklin felt that this was a great affront to the ability of the legislature to govern

1513
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,616
And so he actually meant purchase a little temporary safety very literally

1514
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,152
The pain family was trying to

1515
01:22:57,408 --> 01:23:02,272
To give a lump sum of money in exchange for the general assembly's acknowledging that it didn't have the authority

1516
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,040
To tax it

1517
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,832
Which goes on to say quote

1518
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:08,672
It's a quotation that defends the authority of the legislature to govern in the interest of

1519
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,952
Collective security

1520
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:14,560
It means in context not quite the opposite of what it's always quoted as saying

1521
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:17,120
Much closer to the opposite than the thing people think

1522
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:22,752
It's fine to use this quotation in the way Alex's people do it all the time and it seems to resonate

1523
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:23,520
With people

1524
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,288
He just shouldn't

1525
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:27,104
Quote Ben Franklin when they do because he was arguing

1526
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,128
Please Lee different position

1527
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,456
And you can really tell from Oz analysis of the quote

1528
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,248
Like you. He drives a

1529
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,368
Lele different meaning from within Franklin intended which tells me he's never read the original Source material

1530
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:41,952
But just read the quote on some dumb blog which is basically all he ever does

1531
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:45,024
Also that part about reducing population to 500 million

1532
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,840
It's just Alex referencing the Georgia Guidestones

1533
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,168
Come on so sad

1534
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:57,568
So sad cuz you reference the Georgia Guidestones a 100%

1535
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,616
Reliable thing to rap

1536
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,664
Now I got enough

1537
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,992
What else you got

1538
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,272
Nothing

1539
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,424
Microsystem

1540
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,728
Word world

1541
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:44,928
That is not true based on the article in Wired Magazine by Bill Joy that is

1542
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,696
Alex

1543
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,232
Only reading

1544
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:50,816
A part of the article where Bill Joy quotes

1545
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:51,584
The Unabomber

1546
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,400
Alright is all that's going on there

1547
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:56,960
Passage

1548
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:59,008
From the Unabomber is the

1549
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,544
The point of the article

1550
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,568
It is not

1551
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:08,736
Just make it hard

1552
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:14,368
It does have it does make it hard to have a conversation at a party

1553
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,392
Subway

1554
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:19,744
Alex is using that Source their he's not proven

1555
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,048
Anyting in a lot of this isn't even like

1556
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:24,864
The pic it's not

1557
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:29,984
The suddenly there is a lot of V for Vendetta and it but a lot of it sold

1558
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,752
S***

1559
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,776
A lot of it

1560
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,080
There was a clip from endgame

1561
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
Drew

1562
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,920
Misattributed recited quotes

1563
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:38,688
Then

1564
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:41,504
So here's how this ends and I would say that he has failed

1565
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,576
And robbed you should get a complete this project

1566
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:46,880
I laid out

1567
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,336
Corporation

1568
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:22,208
Powerful video it's at Man. Video

1569
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:22,976
False

1570
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,304
Now this is critical

1571
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,352
Jackson now they're going to kill her

1572
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:34,496
Attention fellow American just missed the break after the special report so sad

1573
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:38,336
Now do you know why I know for a fact my

1574
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:42,176
Kardashian Cuban planning something to worry about the weather

1575
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,456
Have you seen the Bee Movie

1576
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:49,856
Dog With The Wind

1577
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,696
By the club of Rome

1578
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:59,072
They're on the f****** think they know what's going on and produced it

1579
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,144
I got to say I

1580
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:07,776
Once again and pixelated by Alex's incompetence when he tries to prove something none of this proves anything

1581
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,824
Oh God it's so bad

1582
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,408
So bad it is a Rob deposition of Nvidia

1583
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:15,456
Well-done Rob Purity paycheck

1584
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,528
So Alex comes back and he starts picking up on a

1585
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,552
Conspiracy theories

1586
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,576
I'm going around the internet

1587
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,904
Absolutely right that

1588
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,720
There are thousands video we try to plan a few weeks ago

1589
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,000
Hospital

1590
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,792
Now more more people

1600
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:19,456
Hardee's

1601
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:25,344
I live a mile from this hospital and they said they're long lines and people dying everywhere

1602
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:38,144
Pretty funny Alex is a little late to the empty hospitals conspiracy

1603
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,496
Subtraction online and then places like Fox News days prior to this episode

1604
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:46,848
Also it's really funny to remember that Alex declared war on Cuba.

1605
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:50,176
In the April 1st episode of the show to the day before this.

1606
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:50,944
Episode

1607
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:57,088
Because a lot of these videos he's claiming to have research were created by qanon followers with me hashtag filmyourhospital

1608
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:59,392
Yeah cuz there is at War

1609
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:03,232
Are you going to understand your enemy dad by promoting 12 course

1610
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:08,352
All these videos are shot in front entrances of hospitals which showed no real traffic which

1611
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:12,448
Supposed to demonstrate there's no real coronavirus pandemic and the stats are a lie

1612
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,520
What they actually shows pretty decent evidence that things are bad

1613
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:20,896
Most of the people you would see coming in those entrances to the hospital people coming in for minor things or visitor

1614
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:23,200
So the fact There's No One Billing about ism

1615
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,224
Isn't active

1616
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,784
Are there not being visitors coming which is right in line

1617
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,808
With the current situation

1618
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:34,720
None of these videos show anything that's happening inside the hospitals and people inside the hospital can't legally release those sorts of images

1619
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:38,048
Of things that they're see because of patient privacy and HIPAA laws

1620
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,096
And honestly I don't know what these

1621
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,680
Dumb dumb conspiracy theorists are imagining should be happening outside

1622
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:49,312
Do they think that if it wasn't real outbreak there just be a couple hospital employees running around screaming for affect

1623
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,848
I guess that what they would expect

1624
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,896
I I think what they would have

1625
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,432
Is there

1626
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,968
Here's why because here's the real

1627
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:03,136
There's no line there so the like this was a real pandemic there would be lines down the street of people needing to get treated

1628
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:10,304
And then of course if there were lines on the street they would like to see these people are all paid to look like there's a pan

1629
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:16,704
Dammit going on

1630
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,984
That says anything in

1631
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:25,920
Fox News host Todd Starnes he went outside the Brooklyn Hospital Center

1632
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,712
And is made one of these videos

1633
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:33,600
But unfortunately the exact same Hospital someone else was

1634
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,648
They release video of

1635
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,928
People

1636
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,952
Loading bodies

1637
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,744
Picture of 18-wheeler truck

1638
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,304
Maybe not at the front entrance

1639
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:48,960
I'm amazed that there that the Fox News host are being spit on

1640
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,728
Regularly

1641
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:56,384
If you're if you're not if you saw that guy as I swear to God if I see that guy anywhere I'm going to spit

1642
01:30:56,896 --> 01:31:03,040
No no

1643
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,320
Maybe a little bit Way Beyond

1644
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,088
The pals

1645
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:10,208
What do you mean is disrespect

1646
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,536
Like

1647
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:18,400
Old timey like Violetta

1648
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,680
This needs to be brutal

1649
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:25,056
So Alex is talking about these videos that have come out about like these these empty hospitals and s***

1650
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:31,200
And he remembers that he had a guy on who it made a video of along these lines

1651
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:34,016
I think in Hawaii any tries to come up with this guy's name

1652
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
And

1653
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:37,856
When Alex started talking about anesthesia give you brain damage

1654
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:39,136
That's why I felt like

1655
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,928
I can't touch the floor anymore

1656
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:45,024
I'm a little worried

1657
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:45,792
And I was like

1658
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:46,560
Oh no

1659
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:50,144
The pool is 20 ft I can't tread water

1660
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,728
If I see a shark

1661
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:58,848
For this cuz this is a f****** freak out

1662
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:13,440
He was the first chain reaction

1663
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:19,584
Any reaction and then everybody just starts going out

1664
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:20,864
Toosii

1665
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:21,888
What's going on

1666
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:27,008
Get back on

1667
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:35,200
Quick fact check it's not you Michael Jones it's actually a guy named Jason Jones who's this guy with the YouTube channel

1668
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:41,600
Doesn't have a million views as of April 5th

1669
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:45,952
Thousand little difference but also Alex thinks it might be e Michael Jones

1670
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,232
Which means he doesn't know who's

1671
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,768
His guests are

1672
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:54,144
Because he was he was just going to be tested

1673
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:05,664
Ladies gentlemen and it's a chain reaction

1674
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,224
Hospitals open

1675
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,272
Table Mountain

1676
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,136
Cross

1677
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:15,904
The board

1678
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:21,024
There are people lined up there

1679
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,048
In hallways

1680
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:26,656
Can eggs

1681
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:37,408
I really want them back on

1682
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,832
That's another Jones Arthur Jones

1683
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:47,904
That's why I begged hard I want

1684
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,384
Asian gentleman

1685
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:20,672
I totally butchered and just just two Tire once in a suite

1686
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,424
Absolutely out of control

1687
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,872
Baby daddy

1688
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,248
Protection

1689
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,272
From the planet

1690
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:50,880
So in the middle of that rant Alex's earpiece fell out

1691
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,648
Haha

1692
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:54,464
So the party towards the end there where he's growling

1693
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:59,072
Is what he's trying to subtly put his earpiece back on

1694
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,864
He's really struggling with it

1695
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,680
I'm becoming more certain than ever that he's just getting

1696
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,448
Like stage

1697
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:07,520
He's not getting dressed like Jesus time to go to break through the air.

1698
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,568
I think you being fat lines through there

1699
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:13,408
Because he's really freaking out when is your piece falls out possibly

1700
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,712
One of the reasons he seems all over the place all the

1701
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:20,320
The time is going to Carolee integrate all the information that's coming to him through his ear

1702
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,088
And you just like

1703
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,368
Maybe skips

1704
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:24,928
Protopic ab2c ride

1705
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:27,232
It's disjointed cuz you can't disjointed information

1706
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:29,792
Write a lot of people think that he

1707
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,072
Conspiracy theory that he

1708
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:31,840
That Bill Hicks

1709
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:32,864
His own death

1710
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,680
And what they don't

1711
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:36,960
How far is that

1712
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:41,056
It was actually Veruca Salt who faked her own death and became a

1713
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:44,384
Did you have a earpiece famous haha she wanted things

1714
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,200
Now

1715
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:49,760
This is not Samantha bees husband

1716
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:54,112
Jason Jones

1717
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,184
I don't usually walk. Recommend watching

1718
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:01,024
The video of Alex but this little segment is pretty funny

1719
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
Watch

1720
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,352
Try and fail to put his earpiece back

1721
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,264
Through this country

1722
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:14,336
Just it's just you know what it is

1723
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:20,736
Is it the perfect encapsulation of his impotent angry baby

1724
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:23,040
And I can't I can't

1725
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:25,856
I can't

1726
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:30,976
Get my hand around my head my earpiece. 41

1727
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,768
God

1728
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,840
He doesn't want to like Jaw tension to it so you

1729
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:42,240
That's why he's doing a lot of like Beatrice would like

1730
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,056
Such a dork

1731
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:48,896
Anyway it deteriorates he descends even deeper into

1732
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,432
Anger

1733
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,200
Of course

1734
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:57,600
And you want Satanism to you're going to be killed very slowly they're going to inject

1735
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:02,976
Oh boy

1736
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,632
Will do nothing

1737
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,680
I got to turn into a giant blueberry

1738
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:14,240
Do all of this over and over again

1739
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:22,944
Golden egg

1740
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:23,712
Oh

1741
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:35,488
You want some chocolate buddy

1742
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:39,328
It's the same problems that whatever cuz I'm insane

1743
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:42,912
Grow the f****** no s*** absurd

1744
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,728
This is so weird

1745
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:47,264
Wow I mean

1746
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:49,568
I read the day before

1747
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:54,688
He's having this breakdown about how Everyone likes qanon more than him

1748
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,480
Right now the breed any of that

1749
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,272
Add stuff to the next day's episode please

1750
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:01,088
Clear still struggling with something

1751
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,672
This is a sad outbursts

1752
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,744
America's being destroyed

1753
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,792
Just mad about it

1754
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,840
You can get this far while still being a chow

1755
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:16,448
Kind of an accomplishment in itself to be a nine-year-old trapped in a

1756
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,472
Giant

1757
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:22,080
Connect monster

1758
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:25,152
America's being destroyed and it is not cute

1759
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:27,712
Alex is not in control of his anger he is still

1760
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,480
Profoundly mad

1761
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:33,088
Everything our ancestors fought for is being murdered

1762
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,648
Wiggling around

1763
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,952
It's fun and it's cute

1764
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:39,744
Cute

1765
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,280
Funny

1766
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:44,352
Let's go to the Elmo song

1767
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:54,336
Have never guessed

1768
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,808
Nothing

1769
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,648
Alex isn't really being honest there about the flu vaccine

1770
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:14,304
It is true that all sometimes flu strains pop up in human populations that aren't the ones that are covered by that Year's vaccine

1771
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:20,704
Ridiculous to say that scientists have never guessed the right strain

1772
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,800
Just want to admit they're scared of needles act if they're a little dumber than they think they are

1773
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:28,384
Intellectualize their immature response but the point they're making it

1774
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:32,992
Is childish and stupid that's all I can obviously I'm not afraid of needles

1775
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:34,784
What is the same behavior

1776
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,320
Display near

1777
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:39,648
It's Alex there is still like really spinning out

1778
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:43,232
I think he's gotten his earpiece back in now but

1779
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,512
Just all over the

1780
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:50,144
Whatever it is

1781
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:53,984
German Italian and other firms

1782
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,800
Vaccine and scanned it

1783
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:03,456
Engineered

1784
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:09,600
The news by the Italian government

1785
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:10,368
Because

1786
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,440
The manufacturer of the vaccine in the who shed

1787
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:14,720
Did

1788
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:17,792
You're not allowed to scan what we put in there

1789
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:24,192
This story that Alex is talking about regarding is that it's about to anti-vax folks

1790
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,984
Italy named Antoinette

1791
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,520
The end Stefano

1792
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,056
Montara montanari

1793
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:35,712
In 2017 they released the paper called New Quality Control investigations on vaccines micro and Nano contaminate

1794
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:42,112
His paper was released on a non. Viewed website and no one has an anyway confirm their findings which according

1795
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:45,440
Analyses of it that I found where not even scary to

1796
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,976
To begin within our little dubious

1797
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:49,792
Have some of the metals they claim that they founded vaccines

1798
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:52,864
Could easily have been found due to methodological errors

1799
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,680
That lie to themselves being because

1800
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:57,984
The contamination as close to the vaccine itself

1801
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:02,848
I can't find any reliable sources of their office is being rated but I can't find a ton of logs

1802
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:04,896
Claiming without evidence that that did happen

1803
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:11,552
How does no idea what the actual story is here he's just seeing articles about them on dumb anti-vax blogs he skins headlines on

1804
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:15,136
That's all it's going on here I feel like I could have been like

1805
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:19,232
If when I was 9 and my parents were like we're having spinach

1806
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,768
You got a

1807
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,096
I was instead how to be like here

1808
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:24,864
Eat spinach

1809
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,424
I was like actually

1810
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,960
The government is using spinner

1811
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:35,616
To get inside your body to give you an abortion on top of the abortion that you already had sent me and I was

1812
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:43,296
Spinach Slovakian scientists control weapon

1813
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:51,744
Thrown in the hoosegow and then cuz my parents were birchers they were like

1814
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,280
That actually makes a lot of sense

1815
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:55,328
We need to get you out in Paw

1816
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,096
Yeah

1817
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:57,120
So Alex

1818
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,656
His turn to you on the audio

1819
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,448
And I'm saying like f*** it

1820
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:04,032
F*** all this I can't do the show f*** it

1821
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:05,312
Is working with Bill Gates

1822
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,080
We have

1823
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,104
Not really disgust

1824
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,128
It does

1825
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:10,944
Fall by the wayside for sure

1826
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,016
But Alex goes out to break after this like weird

1827
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:17,088
F****** fall into anger by two

1828
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:17,856
Like I think

1829
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,672
Y'all get his audience that they're all going to burn in hell

1830
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:23,488
Everything they give you is for another

1831
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:30,400
Play Tetris

1832
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,416
Wow

1833
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,184
Okay

1834
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,208
That was

1835
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:54,976
A bit much

1836
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:57,024
I do enjoy being left with a

1837
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:57,792
Positive

1838
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,840
That's a bit much

1839
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,168
It's Alex realizes but like

1840
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,960
I think someone gave matoke

1841
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:06,496
Commercial that was like

1842
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,264
You just

1843
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,056
Yelled at your own audience

1844
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:11,616
They're going to burn in hell

1845
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:15,712
I know you do that a lot when you say it towards the globalists or something

1846
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:18,272
This was a kind of a real dick thing

1847
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:22,112
I think your audience might be weird about that so Alex comes back

1848
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:23,392
And as a clarification

1849
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:30,304
Now we deserve everything is about to happen to us

1850
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:36,704
Nyet coward jellyfish

1851
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:46,432
Killing babies

1852
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:54,624
I love that kind of apology I love that kind of listened I wasn't mad at you when I told you

1853
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,648
You specifically

1854
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:58,976
You are going good I hate you you're piece of s*** your eternally brought

1855
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,256
That wasn't about

1856
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:04,352
You that was just me being mad at people who rejoice and getting abortion

1857
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:10,496
Okay okay now I'm sorry I didn't mean to be threatening when I said I would kill you personally and stop on your gut

1858
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,032
Meant to be

1859
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:12,800
BRAT diet

1860
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:15,360
But also the idea that I like

1861
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:22,272
If I mean I don't know what the reality is but if he is just mad at people who rejoiced abortion and that is called

1862
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,296
Empty Outlet is audio

1863
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:27,136
They're all going to burn in hell and all this that we deserve what

1864
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,160
Coming

1865
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,696
I would suggest

1866
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:33,280
That maybe when Alex says that he paid for a bunch of abortion

1867
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,840
Somebody was younger and he's repented and made peace with that

1868
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,632
Maybe that process yet

1869
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,400
Because I complete

1870
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:40,960
Valentine

1871
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:47,616
He was the last person who could make peace with that God only understanding

1872
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:54,272
He is not okay with all this maybe some of what we're seeing manifesting is unresolved issues

1873
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,552
Surrounding that

1874
01:44:55,808 --> 01:45:01,440
Okay that maybe he needs to take a look at this a little closer because you seems to be

1875
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:08,864
In a bad place paraphrase you I'm glad you're starting to get the word dealing with a lot of his unresolved issues here

1876
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:12,448
I think some of them are becoming

1877
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,472
Farmer over

1878
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,496
Yeah this is bad

1879
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:18,336
Exclaimed in the beginning of this clip that

1880
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:21,664
He has played a bunch of clips of women

1881
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,480
Rejoicing in the bushin

1882
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:25,504
Knock play these clips

1883
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,064
That is best as I've seen their things he's misrepresenting

1884
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,088
And people trolling

1885
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,880
But

1886
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:32,160
Sarah Silverman joke

1887
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,440
Why not

1888
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:40,864
At the end of this clip he gets into the Andrew Cuomo nipple ring controversy

1889
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:47,264
Going to be on just four months ago when suddenly on all the comedy major shows all over the news

1890
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:55,712
Love killing babies and I like to get pregnant and then I've done it three times my boyfriend

1891
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:01,344
Like to have sex while I'm pregnant what to think about the baby a little girl as little boy

1892
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,160
When I go in there I thought shut the power they

1893
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:07,488
A little piece of trash up I feel like

1894
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,328
Again

1895
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,376
I don't know what again

1896
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,968
Got it I mean again with being served

1897
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,272
You don't

1898
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,040
Care

1899
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,624
Crazy

1900
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:37,440
Okay if your nipple rings

1901
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:44,864
Yep if you're gay if he's your blackmailed gay politician

1902
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:50,240
This is obvious then I mean I'm sure there are some issues that come with that

1903
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:58,176
Some I mean not in terms of blackmail

1904
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:58,944
But there's some

1905
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:03,040
Social stigmas that people would probably feel about there

1906
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:06,368
Their sexuality and public and private license

1907
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:10,464
I don't think they were as evolve to society as we like to imagine sometimes

1908
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:13,024
But to the point where it's like

1909
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
The 50s

1910
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,376
You know if you are a

1911
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,912
Hypothetically gay person

1912
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:20,192
You must be black

1913
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,728
That's

1914
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,288
Is a sign of

1915
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:27,872
Something bad and I was praying he never group

1916
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:29,664
McCarthy

1917
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:37,600
So in this next clip I know that Alex is always talked about how like you know the global 7 extermination is playing and either

1918
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,368
Against it

1919
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:41,696
It seems like he kind of thinks we deserve it

1920
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:42,720
Now

1921
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,000
Interesting

1922
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,896
Abortion devil worship

1923
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:04,224
Republic

1924
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:11,648
The operation of God they're the ones

1925
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,000
Incentivize it thanks

1926
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:19,072
Play God do it the same time everybody

1927
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:24,448
It seems like Alex's problem is that he wants to run the extermination

1928
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,216
Look yeah

1929
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:28,032
I guess we should be exterminated people cuz I haven't,

1930
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:34,688
Where do I go from there I just don't like that the globalists are playing God

1931
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:41,088
Terminate the people who have gone along with the globalist

1932
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:45,440
Yeah they aren't they are an arm of God

1933
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,208
Wow

1934
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:47,488
That's not good

1935
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,304
Globalstar going to fail

1936
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,072
Slides

1937
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:57,472
Before that they're going God's going to let him kill half the planet or something

1938
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:59,008
I want it

1939
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,032
Never going to work right

1940
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:05,152
Text Emily where they were empty them

1941
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,856
God is going to allow it

1942
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,392
Fruition

1943
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:17,440
To coerce

1944
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,744
Revelation says

1945
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:23,584
World population

1946
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:29,984
Social distancing and doing what they say and taking their inoculations keep you safe

1947
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,264
Good

1948
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,312
You take the shot

1949
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,504
Jesus

1950
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,136
Call yourselves

1951
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:48,160
You know Dylan

1952
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:50,208
How to make me take your shots

1953
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:51,744
Wow

1954
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,048
You just still get the other radio

1955
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:01,984
I use already available but like there's a real like

1956
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:05,568
Really getting into this dark side

1957
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:09,408
Don't get this other place

1958
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:15,808
No I think that's because struggling to feel like this is real

1959
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:18,368
Beforehand

1960
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,440
What are the reasons if it doesn't happen on other shows

1961
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:24,000
It's because other people have bosses

1962
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:28,096
These behaviors are so unprofessional

1963
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:30,912
No matter what you're doing if you're like

1964
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:36,032
If you have a job that's not running a show where you lie for a living

1965
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:41,664
If you act like this you're fired

1966
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,736
He said he's only been rewarded for the Warriors

1967
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:51,392
Entire life can get away with whatever you want I'm sure most of his staff is

1968
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,672
Terrified to

1969
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:56,512
To respond to these are things you don't get what you want

1970
01:50:57,024 --> 01:51:03,168
You throw a tantrum like a little bitty baby ear plug falls out of your head

1971
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,264
I wanted

1972
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,592
Go ahead kill your kids

1973
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:12,640
We all deserve to be exterminated

1974
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:15,712
Ahmed

1975
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:21,856
The message for the BuzzFeed people out there

1976
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:23,392
He wants to know

1977
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:24,416
I told you

1978
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,696
Is it going to happen

1979
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:27,232
Call Sunny

1980
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:31,072
The BuzzFeed New York Times folks out there

1981
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:43,872
Got your ass up and feed you bug poisoning radiator Athens take every damn dime out of you

1982
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:53,600
So after break Alex declares himself a

1983
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:56,416
The prophet of God God said Alex Jones

1984
01:51:56,672 --> 01:52:02,816
Do Warner's that's not good and God is really striking out these days

1985
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:08,192
Choose the lowest Among Us definition Alex is about the lowest

1986
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:10,496
It doesn't get much lower than that

1987
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,776
There are very few

1988
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,056
So earlier

1989
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:18,176
Alex said that everyone's going to burn in hell he came back from break

1990
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:24,576
Zen spiral deeper

1991
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:26,368
Exterminator

1992
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,672
Now it's goes back for break and he has another

1993
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:31,488
Hello bello

1994
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:32,512
A little bit

1995
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:42,240
I have been really upset about what's going on because

1996
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:47,104
Operation

1997
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:50,944
You just can't control his emotions like it's just

1998
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:53,248
It just preferably saying this is just

1999
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:54,528
Embarrassed

2000
01:52:54,784 --> 01:53:00,928
Got to watch it at a certain point like I like looking into things like that Rockefeller report you know that

2001
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:04,256
I like looking into that I can enjoy that

2002
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:06,560
There's a part of me that feels a little bit dirty

2003
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:07,840
Listening to this

2004
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,632
Like

2005
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:12,192
There's a part of me that feels like

2006
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:14,240
This is so sad

2007
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,776
It's it's funny

2008
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:17,568
On what level Alex

2009
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,896
Socket everyone deserves to be exterminated

2010
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:24,992
The behaviors are so like a child lashing out

2011
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:27,296
Almost doesn't feel good

2012
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,064
It's

2013
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:29,088
Like

2014
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:34,464
It's it feels a little bit like maliciously laughing at a three-year-old for not knowing out of string sentence

2015
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:37,024
Kansas together relax

2016
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:43,424
Stupid you three-year-old same time the three-year-old is actively trying to get the hundreds of thousands of people who'll

2017
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:48,288
But at the same time too you know acting like

2018
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:51,104
It somehow so far above

2019
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:57,760
You know however operating is also a little bit condescending on my part infantilize him to the point where it's at

2020
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:00,832
Looks like this is a child that these behaviors are f****** childish

2021
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:03,392
Well this is a difficult bike weird thing

2022
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:04,416
I mean this is

2023
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,952
This is somebody who should be

2024
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:09,536
I receiving a large amount of help right now from

2025
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,560
Medical

2026
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,864
Not getting out of it

2027
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,448
Yeah you think so

2028
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:19,520
We're done with emotional outbursts for now

2029
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:22,080
Now it's gets into like the heater starts hitting like

2030
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:23,104
Buckshot

2031
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,896
Some of the stuff does not

2032
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:28,736
Connect to each other it does not make sense a lot of its non secretary

2033
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,016
And a lot of it is wrong

2034
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:34,624
There better be

2035
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,416
Bildungsroman

2036
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,952
Before Christ

2037
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:40,000
Okay

2038
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,024
After death

2039
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,840
What are different

2040
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:44,864
Common

2041
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:47,680
Before the Common Era

2042
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:50,752
That's the modernist thing to get rid of the Christ

2043
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:54,592
Sobc does mean before Christ but ad does not mean a death

2044
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,128
Exactly

2045
01:54:56,384 --> 01:55:02,528
For in the year of Our Lord

2046
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:06,624
33 years when Jesus was alive but didn't get number didn't count very weird

2047
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,648
Tom is great

2048
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:10,976
You know if you want to be marked I'm based on your religious beliefs

2049
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:15,328
But we're all going to share the common reality that this is the year 2020 baby

2050
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:21,984
That is no reason to not secularize at a little bit so Common Era and before Common Era are completely acceptable copper

2051
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:24,288
Unless what you're angling for

2052
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:26,080
Berkeley religiously-based Society

2053
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:29,152
Is one little clues that might be what Alex's into

2054
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:31,456
That is so funny to be

2055
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,480
In the context

2056
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,248
Dove

2057
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,272
How

2058
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:37,600
Awful he is about the year zero

2059
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:39,904
For him to actually be like no

2060
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:44,000
It's actually 1974 right now okay idiots

2061
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:50,400
That's because we didn't count the 33 years or 1991 whatever it is that's so funny

2062
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:51,168
Snowden idiot

2063
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:54,752
Here's another thing that sounds completely unrelated

2064
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,776
Because it is

2065
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:59,872
60% of births are

2066
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,040
Really

2067
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:10,112
So it's interesting history

2068
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:17,024
According to all the data I can find this is absolutely a made-up stat about 60% of births in Travis County being C-section

2069
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:20,608
According to the 2017 healthy Texas babies databook

2070
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:23,424
Released by the Texas Department of State Health Services

2071
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:24,960
In 2016

2072
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:27,008
34.4% of Altex

2073
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:29,312
The deliveries were delivered by cesarean section

2074
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:32,640
The number is actually slightly lower than it wasn't years

2075
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:34,944
2009 through 2015

2076
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,760
But right around the same level it was in 2008

2077
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:42,624
This report does not a full breakdown by County every year but it does include figures

2078
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:49,024
2015 putting the early non-medically indicated elective Caesarean section rate in Austin

2079
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,048
21-point

2080
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,584
3% or lower

2081
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:56,192
A 2019 article on the usnewsandworldreport had a county-by-county list

2082
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:59,264
Counties with the highest percentage of C-sections based on CD

2083
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,032
ABC data

2084
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,824
The highest was Rapids

2085
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,640
Parish Louisiana with 47.3

2086
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:08,736
Percent so there's no way I believe Alex's dad that he's absolutely just making up

2087
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:14,624
According to their data Travis County was at number 176 on that list with 32.8%

2088
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:20,256
Stop at our to say about Cleopatra is even stupider he's not even getting his fake history right

2089
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:22,560
There's a legend about the birth of gas

2090
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:24,352
Julius Caesar that help that he was

2091
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:27,680
Cut out of his mother who died while she was pregnant with him

2092
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:29,472
But his mother wasn't Cleopatra

2093
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:30,752
She was irelia

2094
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:34,592
True mostly prove by fact that Caesar's mother survived

2095
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:35,360
Birthin exist

2096
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,384
Historical record

2097
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:42,272
In reality the name is most likely derived from the same Latin word that Caesar seems related to is Sora

2098
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:44,320
Kadari

2099
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:46,368
Which translates to

2100
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:52,512
There are some other theories but would normally take seriously the idea that it's actually named what it is because

2101
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:55,584
Became popular after Caesar or Cleopatra or whatever

2102
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,608
But by all means

2103
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:57,888
Alex's Eddie's fun

2104
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:59,168
History

2105
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:00,448
I was want to know a little

2106
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:05,312
I was going to say that's that was the first thing cuz I don't remember Cleopatra dying in childbirth

2107
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:07,104
And if I remember

2108
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:10,688
The history of the C-section though

2109
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:11,712
Is a

2110
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:14,016
What are the pioneers of the C-section that first

2111
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:18,112
Successfully the mother and the Child live

2112
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:20,672
Was actually a woman

2113
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,720
Who was

2114
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:24,768
Raised as a man

2115
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:28,608
In order to go to medical school because women weren't allowed to go to medical school

2116
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:30,912
So at the age of six she was raised as a man

2117
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,960
Man who became a professional doctor

2118
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:34,240
And was

2119
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,264
By all accounts

2120
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,080
Incredible one of the best doctors overtime.

2121
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:40,640
And they didn't find out that she was a woman until after

2122
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:41,408
She was dead

2123
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,688
When they dug her up and then

2124
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:44,736
Performed an autopsy and realized that

2125
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:45,760
She herself

2126
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:47,808
Had given birth to two children

2127
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,112
Until I don't know this story at all

2128
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:55,232
Very fast you could be making this up

2129
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:59,840
This is from The Book of the Dead which was written by the

2130
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:00,608
Fantastic

2131
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,888
Q iPhone

2132
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:03,424
I've looking today

2133
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,448
Stephen Fry

2134
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,728
Spurlock's

2135
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:09,056
Funny way everyone's getting C-sections now and soon

2136
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,336
Vaginal birth

2137
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,616
Is going to be outlawed

2138
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,152
Right that's out to prediction

2139
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,200
This clip

2140
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:15,968
Ends

2141
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:16,992
Weird logo

2142
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,808
One day

2143
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:21,344
They will take

2144
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:25,952
Children from mothers that try to have babies at home and try to have them vaginally

2145
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:31,328
Also get your money with cesarean they can run quicker

2146
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,984
Need to make vaginal birth

2147
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:46,176
About a third smaller brain

2148
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:50,016
And fluoride is Douglas tricks

2149
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
Yeah

2150
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:57,184
My mama Target was 18 months

2151
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,000
Goddaughter skirting I said Mama

2152
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:01,024
Oh Gotti

2153
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:08,192
When I was 18 months old

2154
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:18,688
Breastfed for a year-and-a-half I guess I don't know

2155
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:24,576
Whatever the reality is that makes me incapable of looking into any of those other nonsense you think

2156
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:28,160
The story goes on but I do

2157
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:29,952
I had to take a break there for a minute

2158
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:33,536
I want to buy Mom and Tony about 18 months

2159
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:36,352
Mama

2160
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:40,960
Energy said no no no we got the car

2161
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:47,360
Which I never did

2162
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:49,152
Big head

2163
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:51,712
The milk my mother predict

2164
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:56,576
Conspiracy theory

2165
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:58,112
Women's breasts

2166
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:58,880
Ever

2167
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:01,440
Okay

2168
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:08,352
Wilson this some Game of Thrones that he's tossing people out of the f****** Spire like what is this dude doing

2169
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:10,912
He kicked his mom laughs

2170
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:12,704
18 months old

2171
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:13,984
Teddy

2172
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,312
God

2173
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:21,664
Idiot Alex gets into talking about how is going to go into the

2174
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:22,944
Situation soon

2175
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:24,480
How do you say something about

2176
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,760
Trump

2177
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,296
Pretty disqualifying

2178
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:34,464
We're not going to do that

2179
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:38,048
Projections too well I guess we better

2180
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:40,352
Because

2181
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:44,960
He's never gotten from the media settling

2182
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,288
We're doing a good

2183
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:53,664
Problem because we're buying into the fear and going along with it

2184
02:01:55,712 --> 02:02:01,088
How old were the people go

2185
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:03,904
This is a sad level of blaming yourself

2186
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:04,928
For Trump

2187
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:05,952
Ridiculous

2188
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:08,256
Also I would say

2189
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:09,024
That like

2190
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:09,792
If Trump

2191
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:13,376
Going along with this because the media's praising him that's

2192
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:15,168
Evidence he's a terrible leader

2193
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:17,728
Yeah if you so desperate for the media to

2194
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:23,360
Give him a round of applause that means that you can't trust him to make a good decision

2195
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:30,528
Real bad hahaha easily manipulated by Praise

2196
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:35,392
Might be somebody who is incredibly stupid as well

2197
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,024
Feel slightly better about them

2198
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:47,424
A little bit as much as he constantly fooled by Steve pieczenik

2199
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:53,056
Flattery about like first person to ever cure the coronavirus antibiotic

2200
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:56,896
Alex read the headline that I'm almost certainly didn't

2201
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:57,664
Mean to read

2202
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:00,736
Cause of death in United States

2203
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,552
Usually

2204
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,880
But that's not true and it's also really dishonest

2205
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:09,696
One will meet in early April here

2206
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:16,096
This year's not even close to over so using the number of death Racine now to compared to a whole Year's Day dies intrinsically dishonest

2207
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:22,496
You'd only do that if you're a liar and trying to minimize some piece of really bad information that you wish you hadn't just accidentally said huh

2208
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:26,592
Also the flu isn't really a top cause of death in the United States

2209
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,920
Even if you accept a 60000 a year estimate

2210
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:32,480
That's still far below the approximately 650

2211
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:33,248
3000 Oz

2212
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:35,040
Heart disease or 600,000

2213
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:37,088
Cancer the 170,000

2214
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:37,856
Accidents

2215
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:39,648
Who's absolutely shity work

2216
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:41,184
Positive

2217
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:45,280
He just was cold reading that I had no idea I was about to come out of his mouth

2218
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,304
It's

2219
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:50,656
Another headline that's a bit of a problem for him

2220
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:55,520
Coronavirus outbreak

2221
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:56,800
Official

2222
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:02,944
So it is true that originally Alex was yelling about the Chinese government lying about the virus numb

2223
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,224
That's fair

2224
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:09,088
He's basement literally nothing other than his hatred of China but just saying those things

2225
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:14,720
Yes however more recently he completely change that story as evidenced by this clip for March

2226
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:15,488
March 24th

2227
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,280
Operate

2228
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,560
It's a real problem

2229
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:22,912
Older people go ahead and video tape it put it on the internet

2230
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:24,192
Locked up for that

2231
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:27,008
The party said

2232
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:29,312
Everything

2233
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,296
To get the maximum feared

2234
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:45,696
How to turn middle of Trying to minimize the virus at March 24th at that point was on the party line of saying that everyone had to go

2235
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:46,464
Go back to work

2236
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:52,864
So he was invested in pretending that the Chinese that inflated the number so Trump would take it seriously while the Chinese went by

2237
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:54,144
Back to work or something

2238
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:57,984
Now the narrative has shifted begins Alex's pretending he was never reporting

2239
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:02,592
Wall Street Journal numbers now there underreported

2240
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:04,384
Nothing Alex says means any

2241
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:08,480
He's just making it up as he goes along to see whatever the party demands him support

2242
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,248
That's fine

2243
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,016
I guess

2244
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:12,064
That's what a Thor attarian propagandist

2245
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,600
Do they prey on their ID

2246
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:14,624
And how willing

2247
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:15,648
Let's go along with

2248
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:16,928
Constantly changing

2249
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:18,464
Self-contradictory narratives

2250
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:22,304
Now what would be really abusive would be an Alex immediately after me

2251
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,352
Making this claim that directly contradicts them

2252
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:25,376
Reported as fact

2253
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:26,656
About a week ago

2254
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:28,192
When are the Reds by the globalist

2255
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:29,728
Don't want you to have a memory

2256
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:33,056
Get nasty I get negative because

2257
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:37,152
A lot of compliance enabling is virtuous. Virtuous

2258
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:42,784
Tchaikovsky

2259
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:46,880
Flying about an incubating at the Democrats

2260
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:56,352
It's really not virtuous is it people don't

2261
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:57,888
Remember

2262
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,680
What just happened a month ago

2263
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:00,960
That's abusive

2264
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:02,752
That's hard

2265
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:05,568
That's what I'm talkin about shunning

2266
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:07,360
This is this is

2267
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:08,128
Stunning

2268
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:12,224
This is like everybody if you see Alex Jones outside

2269
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:14,784
You should say calmly and quietly

2270
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:17,344
Alex is a very bad person

2271
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,648
Space you are a bad human being

2272
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:26,560
Yeah but calmly part is good but it's still imagine you're a demon with like a face

2273
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:27,840
That'd be great

2274
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:32,448
So Alex Goes to break and comes back and he has

2275
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:34,496
He's found a

2276
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:36,032
Video on Twitter

2277
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:38,080
That Rob do or someone has told them

2278
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:38,848
About

2279
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:45,504
Now they just don't put me in there when I said it

2280
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:51,904
Bet your ass 300 100%

2281
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:54,976
Areas

2282
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:58,304
When

2283
02:06:59,072 --> 02:07:01,376
Forced coronavirus test

2284
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:02,144
Dragon Blood

2285
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:02,912
The old desk

2286
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:05,216
I'm sticking a needle I need

2287
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:07,008
This is on Twitter

2288
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:12,896
Here right now. Hush this is bad reporting procedure

2289
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:19,296
Like he's found a video on Twitter that may or may not be real there might be other circumstances that you have no idea

2290
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:20,064
About

2291
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,088
With this person

2292
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:23,392
I don't know who this person is I don't know what

2293
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:24,416
What circumstances are

2294
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:25,952
I'm not going to get into it

2295
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:28,000
Alex is reporting it as like

2296
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:31,840
All things being equal no other surrounding context

2297
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:33,120
People are now being

2298
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:36,448
Held down and forced to have their blood drawn for Coronavirus test

2299
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:39,264
Which is not really good it's not good

2300
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:44,640
He's pushing it he's got to push it because if it weren't it's the line right now exactly

2301
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:49,504
You got put in the u.s. is confirmed real

2302
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,040
A Abril

2303
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:02,560
Sorry G Edward

2304
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:08,192
This morning

2305
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:09,984
Days ago

2306
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:19,712
Michael Porter something Edition

2307
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:29,184
Okay

2308
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:36,096
So he's got this video from Twitter that he's not reporting is real

2309
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:42,496
And Rob do is giving him some other pieces information that he knew days ago but he's mad cuz he hasn't done it or covered it

2310
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:47,872
Too much data I've got to go to a special report

2311
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:49,152
Andy gets

2312
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:50,944
To what the news is

2313
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:52,736
Involve some fake crying

2314
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,784
And

2315
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:58,368
The story that when I said casus belli earlier

2316
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:00,416
This would be that

2317
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:01,696
If you was like

2318
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:02,720
Legitimately

2319
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:05,280
There's no conclusion to this other than

2320
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,816
Go to war with China

2321
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:07,840
Which is

2322
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:09,376
Not an ideal outcome

2323
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:23,968
Battle Cry

2324
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,784
They sent testing kit today at least they sent

2325
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:27,552
Here

2326
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,624
And they're sending in Matthews math

2327
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:33,184
But the last delivering to be able to spread it

2328
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:36,768
Add

2329
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:44,192
A wheelhouse where you can't just sit around and talk about this owner

2330
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:44,960
Exactly

2331
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:48,800
Doesn't move against the people doing this

2332
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:50,336
Then

2333
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:58,016
What are we going to do exactly your rhetoric is becoming a problem

2334
02:09:58,528 --> 02:09:59,808
The escalation has gotten

2335
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:06,208
To a point where it's like what the f*** are you going to do Alex you just said that China released a worldwide attack

2336
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:09,792
So

2337
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:11,584
What is the

2338
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:13,632
Well I guess

2339
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:14,912
We should

2340
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:18,752
So here's one of the reasons I don't trust this reporting

2341
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:25,408
Alex is going off a story on National file and here's one line. Haha yeah

2342
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:26,432
One line from the Arctic

2343
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:29,248
The United Kingdom reportedly of covid

2344
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:35,648
19 testing kits sent from China found to be contaminated with the coronavirus when they were being surveyed by a Luxembourg

2345
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:36,672
Berg based company

2346
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:40,768
That line hot links to a story on MSN news but if you

2347
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:41,536
Read that story

2348
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:44,096
Nowhere in it does it say that these kids were being sent for

2349
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:44,864
Vagina

2350
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:47,680
It says the kids were Bound for the United Kingdom

2351
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:50,752
And they were from a manufacturer in Luxembourg

2352
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:52,032
But if the sources

2353
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:54,336
Do what they're using for their claim that they're from China

2354
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:56,896
That's absolutely fabricated from the source

2355
02:10:57,408 --> 02:11:03,040
It's not in the article and based on the reading of the actual article it seems like this was more of a lab error not an intentional

2356
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:03,808
Contamination

2357
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:09,440
I brought a bunch of other articles about this and none say the kids were from China or the China was involved at all this is

2358
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:15,584
A pure fabrication it appears to me on the part of national file but they don't have another source

2359
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:18,400
It's it's

2360
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:21,472
The editors added into the Meredith that's just that's murder

2361
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:23,776
That's that's just trying to get people

2362
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:24,800
2 kill

2363
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:25,824
Like

2364
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:27,360
Play it could be argued that

2365
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:31,712
Now the other thing too is that they're also mixing in a bunch of stories of like

2366
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,480
Defect

2367
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:35,040
Active masks the China ditch them to like

2368
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:35,808
Experience

2369
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:41,952
And that's lesson issue of them being contaminated from what the article said I was reading and more of them just not being well

2370
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:42,720
Producer

2371
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:45,024
And that could be a function of

2372
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:45,792
There

2373
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:47,584
Manufacturing not being up to

2374
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:52,192
Snuff but I'm more Furious because two weeks from now

2375
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:55,008
Alex is going to be saying that we need to hold

2376
02:11:55,264 --> 02:12:01,408
People down to draw their blood in order to test them for covid and that America released this to attack China back

2377
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:04,480
Who knows I'm running out of giving a s***

2378
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:11,136
Alex's found the story about the tainted tests and he is really getting wild with it

2379
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:12,416
Towards the end of this episode

2380
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:14,464
When I got this new info

2381
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:16,256
I said the Rob.

2382
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:19,584
Let me guess who's behind it

2383
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:25,984
The latest company on record contaminating people in England with the test

2384
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:39,808
I wonder if Alex's audience ever get suspicious that he never gives specific details about anything

2385
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:43,648
Like are they wondering when he says that he doesn't use the company's name

2386
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:45,440
Do they think that maybe it's because

2387
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:46,976
You might get sued

2388
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:47,744
If you did

2389
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:48,512
No

2390
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:51,840
The only company in that article is eurofin

2391
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:55,424
And Steve luxenburg manufacturer and I don't know if Bill Gates is involved with

2392
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:59,264
I'm up for Alex to try and explain that connection and we'll see if he does

2393
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,544
Wait hold on a second

2394
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:04,384
Do you realize that a few episodes ago I said that it was

2395
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:05,664
Luxembourg's fault

2396
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:06,944
Oh yeah maybe you did

2397
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:09,504
I don't know baby we're Wizards

2398
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:10,784
This is evil

2399
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:13,600
So when you were saying that this is like murder

2400
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:15,648
You know

2401
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:20,000
The trend of Alex blaming Chinese people as opposed to

2402
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:23,840
You know having certainly some reservations or

2403
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:24,608
Suspicions

2404
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:25,376
About

2405
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:27,936
Stop mishandling by the Chinese government

2406
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:29,216
The difference

2407
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:31,520
Is becoming a real problem

2408
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:35,104
In this next clip Alex is really f***** up man

2409
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:39,456
Parrot they do it

2410
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:47,136
It's not trying anymore they're saving us a Chinese please

2411
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:52,768
What did you just say

2412
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:56,352
Celebrating

2413
02:13:57,888 --> 02:14:00,704
America

2414
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:07,616
What is this called information overload

2415
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:11,712
You're doing a bad job real bad job

2416
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:15,040
Real bad job Alex

2417
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:19,904
So you suspicious

2418
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:20,928
You're saying that

2419
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:23,232
You don't know which Chinese people gave

2420
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:26,304
But you do nothing specific

2421
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:31,936
And forwards made a specific accusation about a chinese-american Rodger

2422
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:33,984
Just don't got sued for 100 million dollars

2423
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:35,776
So I think

2424
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:37,568
Alex is better than to be specific

2425
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:42,944
So Alex can't handle all this special report before

2426
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:44,224
Trying to

2427
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:47,040
Really do a good job and he doesn't

2428
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:53,440
It's very important because during that break I was unable to get the

2429
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:58,816
The articles I need nobody's fault

2430
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:03,168
I'll be focused on my office to get the article say a little prayer

2431
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:08,544
It all just came together

2432
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:13,920
Red handed in every country

2433
02:15:14,944 --> 02:15:16,224
The Chinese Center

2434
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:19,296
It's contaminated with Coronavirus

2435
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:20,320
Purpose

2436
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:23,392
Companies

2437
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:28,768
Melinda Gates doing the same thing

2438
02:15:29,024 --> 02:15:35,168
So Bill and Melinda Gates and China are in cahoots

2439
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:39,264
And Alex's got to go say a little prayer and get some headlines together it now Jordan

2440
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:42,848
We have a second instance on this episode of Alex saying

2441
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:45,920
He's going to prepare and try and prove something

2442
02:15:46,176 --> 02:15:50,784
So here we go

2443
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:52,832
One of the one of the big problems

2444
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:54,368
With not having

2445
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:55,136
Universal Health

2446
02:15:57,184 --> 02:15:57,952
Guaranteed jobs in

2447
02:15:58,976 --> 02:16:00,256
Is because

2448
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:01,792
If you are a person with a

2449
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:02,560
Conscience

2450
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:06,144
And you worked at like Infowars or Fox News or any of those places

2451
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:08,192
You have to think of it

2452
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:09,472
Hey I got to stop working

2453
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:10,752
Immoral

2454
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:12,288
Officially

2455
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:13,312
Immoral

2456
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:18,944
If the buyer was a while ago

2457
02:16:19,456 --> 02:16:20,992
You are contributing to

2458
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:22,528
Deaths that are

2459
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:25,088
So

2460
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:26,368
If they had

2461
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:28,928
Income or Healthcare

2462
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:30,720
I would imagine the people with a conscience

2463
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:31,488
Ends with stop

2464
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:32,256
F****** work

2465
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:39,424
Yeah I know and you know like I know from that Josh Owens article about his time working there

2466
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:40,704
There was

2467
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:43,264
The feeling of I be unemployable anywhere else

2468
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:45,056
So I mean like there's also

2469
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:48,896
That's kind of puzzled in with that that's kind of leaving

2470
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:53,248
That fear of leaving probably does keep a lot of people there I would assume so

2471
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,552
So Alex tries now he comes back

2472
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:59,904
Back from his special report and he decides he's going to really break this down and heater

2473
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,208
I have just cut out the specific

2474
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:05,280
Instances of him trying to prove the narrative

2475
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:10,144
That China intentionally sent contaminated test to infect

2476
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:10,912
The world

2477
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:17,056
Labradorite

2478
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:22,432
So this article is from about a month ago

2479
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:26,528
And there's nothing to do with China this is about a lab in the United States that had some

2480
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:27,808
Some contamination issues

2481
02:17:28,064 --> 02:17:33,184
It's not even necessarily indicated from the article that it was there has anything to do with

2482
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:34,208
After being contaminated

2483
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:37,280
So here the next one is

2484
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:38,560
What kind of a non sequitur

2485
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:40,096
Just one place

2486
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:45,216
There's another one Los Angeles

2487
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:51,616
Ladies and gentlemen

2488
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:53,920
I don't that doesn't have anything to do wealthy

2489
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:54,944
So

2490
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:56,736
We get to this next headline

2491
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:02,112
The Chevron countries

2492
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:05,184
Natural.com

2493
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:08,768
That's just an add-on file headline

2494
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:14,656
Tender.

2495
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:19,520
Are the virus of independent

2496
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:21,568
Kitchen The Daily Mail

2497
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:29,504
These are all just stories about the same underlying story The National file is lying about so that it's not another story

2498
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:30,784
Are you just have one

2499
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:31,808
Haha

2500
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:33,600
Headline here you don't you don't

2501
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:37,952
Get credit for reading all of the headlines about the same story different places

2502
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:41,792
What are you doing in your office when you're preparing there

2503
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:43,072
I guess

2504
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:45,888
So the next headline

2505
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:47,936
Proves that Bill Gates

2506
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:49,216
Is in the mix

2507
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:55,360
Analytical

2508
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:56,128
LabCorp

2509
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:00,480
I can't believe it

2510
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:02,016
Foundation

2511
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:04,832
That's right

2512
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:11,232
But this is a different side of the business from the eurofins that's in Luxembourg North America

2513
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:15,840
Answer food division that purchased a different company called Craft Technologies

2514
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:17,120
Car Technologies

2515
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:20,192
Had received a Gates Foundation Grant back in 2015

2516
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:23,520
Is a very weak connection but the best Alex can do it

2517
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:25,568
Why the f*** not pretended mean something

2518
02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:27,616
Got them

2519
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:29,664
So that's that's bad

2520
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:35,296
Headline that really is to make this case

2521
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:38,624
What continue coronavirus testing delayed

2522
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:42,208
19

2523
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:52,704
That's the same story

2524
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:56,544
The Daily Mail and the guardian and then he brought up and now the last thing

2525
02:19:56,800 --> 02:20:02,688
The Daily Mail it's all just the same headline about the same story that is being able to

2526
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:03,712
Turned into

2527
02:20:03,968 --> 02:20:08,576
A narrative about China having sent these because of the manipulation of the national file Hadley

2528
02:20:09,344 --> 02:20:11,136
So what you have here is a load of bulshit

2529
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:12,416
2nd episode

2530
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:13,952
But that's not how it is

2531
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:17,024
Because it's Alex Jones

2532
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:48,768
Auto-tune your family right now in Fort Worth Florida

2533
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:52,096
That's what it's all about Adam

2534
02:20:52,864 --> 02:20:54,656
That is what it's all about

2535
02:20:55,424 --> 02:20:56,960
Get this really intense

2536
02:20:57,216 --> 02:21:00,288
Spilling of China affect the world

2537
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:02,592
We're all going to die world

2538
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:03,616
By myself

2539
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:07,200
What is Gammage

2540
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:10,272
For the lowest possible state

2541
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:11,296
You know

2542
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:15,136
Making enough money off pills down to justify

2543
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:20,512
Well that's a problem like I'm saying with the like the escalation of his rhetoric has nowhere to go

2544
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:22,560
Already at the point of life

2545
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:28,960
Any rational person listening to this that believes with Alex's saying the natural conclusion is call for

2546
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:30,240
Yeah

2547
02:21:30,752 --> 02:21:32,544
There's nowhere to go past that I look

2548
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:38,944
I get it if your Chiquita banana of course you need the United States government to overthrow a bunch of

2549
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:39,968
Governments for you

2550
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:41,504
That's that's just got to be done

2551
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:46,880
But I'm not going to war with China over f****** zinc sales from the red pill

2552
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:48,672
Based on wachowskis

2553
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:50,976
Different types of different Wachowski movie

2554
02:21:51,232 --> 02:21:52,768
Yeah this is

2555
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:58,144
I wanted to hear about qanon

2556
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:00,448
Still build

2557
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:01,472
Instead I was just

2558
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:07,360
The f****** messy getting rid of the whole serialized and episodic

2559
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:08,128
Nikes

2560
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:09,408
I do think that it's

2561
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:11,712
It's very difficult to do episodes about Malta

2562
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:14,528
Multiple episodes of this show anymore Jr to f***** up

2563
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:16,832
Getting to a point where it's just like

2564
02:22:17,088 --> 02:22:18,368
Like this is a dude

2565
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:19,136
Losing it

2566
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:19,904
David David

2567
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:20,928
Out of

2568
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:24,256
Yeah so anyway this episode has been

2569
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:30,656
Interesting I always enjoy when Alex gives me a chance to try and take him seriously and he failed once again

2570
02:22:30,912 --> 02:22:37,056
In one go records

2571
02:22:37,312 --> 02:22:40,896
But until then Jordan website

2572
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:51,648
We all relied on this ugly go to activate leaving review it's at local charity of your choice

2573
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:59,072
Build it back but until then Neo I'm Leo I'm dzx Clark I secretly Road V

2574
02:22:59,328 --> 02:22:59,840
For Vendetta

2575
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:02,144
Holding

2576
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:07,264
