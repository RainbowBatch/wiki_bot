00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,408
That I've been moving some stuff around in the apartment to make things fresh

13
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
I had a big part of the

14
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
Was to create

15
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
An insulated space

16
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,832
Use for a particular reason

17
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,648
I am not here to tell you that there is a plant Warner

Deep into growing plants

22
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,104
Right before the beginning of the pandemic

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
I'm but I was deep

24
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
Into the Green Thumb territory and it was a great hobby it really did a lot for my mental health

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
And I just felt great

26
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,160
Love these little little green things

27
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,304
And unfortunately there were two problems they came at me in a pincer attack

28
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
Was that I did terrible job was watering

29
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:18,752
I didn't really understand what I was doing

30
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
Right that ended up the

31
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
Leading to me getting rid of all of my

32
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,712
It was a very funny situation how many bugs there it was off

33
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,040
That was coming at me was

34
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
That I had

35
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
An inability to grow a lot of things

36
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,440
Is based on a concern for Saline

37
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
Because a lot of things are socks

38
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
6 cats

39
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,584
And even beyond that things that aren't toxic to cats

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,888
She would find a way to f****** and eat

41
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,728
She would eat my plants dated me

42
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:54,592
Yeah she f***** up a lot of stuff to ya-ya so I have rearranged things

43
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
In such a way that I have an isolated space

44
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
But I can keep Celine out of

45
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
And

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
I could be more careful with the watering right

47
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
And I'm very excited

179
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823

00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
Cell block

188
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Where I Wanna Be

189
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
I just got to turn

190
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
What's the name of the goddess

191
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Because it again they will

192
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Billy got indirect me

193
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Because we haven't

194
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Nothing

195
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
But success

196
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
Nothing but Victory it has been

197
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
You

198
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
The viewers and listeners

199
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
You did this

200
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,863
That's why

201
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
I just cut finger off

202
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
ShopRite on airshow you

203
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
How much I appreciate you and what you've done

204
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Beginning

205
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,879
David Mann

206
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
Is it reminds me of what he had on his desk

207
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
Talk about this

208
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:31,615
Is very quickly bulshit background

209
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
I do

210
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
Think I mean

211
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Obviously

212
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,391
This is a desperate attempt

213
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
Hook Line & Sinker

214
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,511
We've talked about this a tiny bit off air

215
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,887
There's an escalation aspect do this because generally he has talked about cutting off his finger for sure

216
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,167
He has not brandish

217
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,263
That is true he's got a dagger that is nice

218
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,591
It is all little bit weird man

219
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Also

220
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,943
I think that you can tell from

221
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
The listening to it

222
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
Exactly this it's right

223
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
Yeah that comes out of

224
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
I've been out of nowhere

225
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,951
I feel like maybe

226
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:22,303
Weider's there's a Twilight Zone episode to be had about

227
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
Alex

228
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,423
Like the devil appears you know whatever however

229
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
He does in a Twilight Zone episode

230
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
I'm just

231
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:36,639
Forces him to do all the things that he says so Alex accidentally says I'll cut off and then he starts to sweat

232
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
And then

233
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,015
The devil looks

234
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
Slowly chops that finger off and it fades to Black

235
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:49,951
Holy s*** that was a good Twilight Zone this is the sequel to Liar Liar

236
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
The Twilight Zone version

237
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
Horror movie version of Liar Liar

238
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Amplifying

239
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
Everybody bizarre display wraps

240
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
Talks about cutting off his finger

241
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
Said he's not going to do it in any goes to calls

242
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
That's basically out of this guy

243
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Amanda schull farming

244
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
Appreciate you and what you've done

245
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Nothing

246
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
You

247
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519

You've got that

252
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
A very

253
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
Bottom of my heart

254
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
You got my

255
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Full commitment

Real people

Friday all day salmon

258
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
Because they know

259
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Shout out to them

260
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,079
Justin Elser to match a lot to them

261
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
Zaino

262
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Finger off to prove that

263
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:26,207
I say that Alex is a f****** liar and a fraud and as evidence I submit the past 5 years of my life represent

264
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
About 700 podcasts

265
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
But demonstrate

266
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
The lines that he sells and more importantly

267
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
Only the specific strategies he uses

268
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
To push his dishonesty

269
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Alex

270
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,239
Please feel free to wear buttons that

271
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,335
I wish I wish the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf

272
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
What matter

273
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,455
But then I think about it more and then I realized that

274
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,807
That's not how the media and Alex work like Alex says he's going to do something outrageous

275
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
And the media reports on it

276
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,951
And it's like the boy who cried wolf except it's like if the boy who cried wolf

277
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,535
Gave the media 20 bucks every time he cried wolf and they're like

278
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,655
I need twenty bucks today so I'll get ya all know he's crying wolf this time for sure

279
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
Unfortunately symbiotics

280
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,031
Things sort of you know because it's an easy story

281
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Alex

282
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,639
Brian said some dumb s*** that's pretty funny I don't like him

283
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,967
57zz easier than taking the time to

284
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,807
You know maybe go over some of the content that he's and it shows that is

285
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,927
That that sucks yeah and it is it maintains this

286
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:35,327
Like there's maybe a hope that you can tell yourself it's like 10 people will see this and realize he is out

287
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
And it doesn't it doesn't

288
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
It doesn't have that effect

289
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,215
Holding onto hope that people like oh my God he is

290
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,079
He is not a trustworthy source of information he threatened to cut his finger off

291
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
I just don't I think it's

292
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Unproductive

293
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
Yeah it's work earlier in the podcast

294
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,991
I would have a

295
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,367
Cover Alex over and over again

296
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
Too many too many

297
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Too many

298
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
No I don't mean you know the boys

299
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Give them 50

300
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
50 bucks when he cries well if it doesn't

301
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,095
50 bucks whenever they point out he's a giant bucket races

302
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
True

303
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
Hard to go back to the boy cried wolf

304
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
After you like

305
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,007
This motherfuking racist piece of s***

306
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
Only cries wolf all the time

307
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Civilization

308
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
And they're like not will take fifth

309
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,783
It's not newsworthy that Alex has once again threatened to cut off his finger

310
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,879
It is newsworthy some of the other s*** that he believes in F

311
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Is is

312
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
This problem

313
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
So we jump in here on July 11th

314
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
And I Alex has a

315
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Hot take

316
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
Sri Lanka

317
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
There are massive

318
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Riots

319
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,935
Government building hours

320
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Find a visual saying

321
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Death to the New World Order

322
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Bill Gates

323
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
Downtown

324
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,895
Sri Lanka

325
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
Dutch

326
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Countryside

327
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Texas

328
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,575
They're saying it in Chile

329
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
And Venezuela

330
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,487
Over the world in Brazil leading the charge

331
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
The best leader come out

332
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
National level

333
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
50

334
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Don't say

335
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Wow

336
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,775
Apparently the Sri Lankans

337
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,847
Yeah they were mad at you

338
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Halo

339
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:31,551
Wow okay I just don't even engaged other than to say stop it

340
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
Bolsonaro

341
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,183
The best leader national leader in the last 50 years

342
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
I guess that's

343
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
I'm trying to see where the cutoff is there

344
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,863
I guess Andrew Jackson was before that

345
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
Ragnaros best

346
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,167
Right yes

347
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Fellow

348
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
Was that he likes

349
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Truthout

00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
This Broad

351
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
Nation point

352
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
Patient zero of Liberty

353
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
This audience

354
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
Tucker Carlson

355
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
Otherworld

356
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:28,895
It hurts to watch Alex embarrass himself like this throwing his support where he does but it's

357
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
I would love for Alex

358
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:36,063
Specific thing that bolsonaro orbon have done to make him

359
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:42,207
Support them some vague b******* like they stood up to the new world order or they resisted the Takeover

360
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
They hate carslaw

361
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
I got one

362
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
Mostly just because I know for listen

363
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
This dumb show that Alex has no specific

364
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,191
These dudes are just know what they

365
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
What their policies

366
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,031
I mean I imagine if you could he would be like

367
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Well both

368
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
Bolsonaro accelerated the decline and infect destruction of the entire Amazon rainforest

369
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,503
Dooming the planet to further

370
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,903
Describe how the planets those Forest grape

371
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,951
More CO2 in order to save the world

372
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
Narbonne

373
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,279
Beat the s*** out of journalists on The Daily

374
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
So that's again

375
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Right on there

376
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,655
You know First Amendment

377
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:29,567
Yeah this continuing fetishization of Tucker

378
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,151
Alex needs to wake up and realize that Tucker doesn't like

379
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,039
Tucker defends Alex when defending Alex is a useful props for him to use to attack his Target

380
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,855
But he does not give a s*** about Alex

381
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,743
Illustrate this point here's a clip of Tucker attempting to argue that his great replacement conspiracy theories

382
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,047
Actually aren't all that crazy

383
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,367
How many

384
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,416
That's so casual for Tucker

385
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
Racism when he's

386
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
Confronted with it it's second nature for Tucker

387
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,816
To attempt to claim The High Ground by into

388
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,120
System that his racist theories are solid

389
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,680
Hey based on real stuff I'm like Alex Jones

390
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Who's racist theories are crackpot s***

391
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:36,128
The dynamic here is very simple on one level and then there's a little something underneath it that makes it a little bit Messier

392
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
The simplest

393
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,552
Is that Tucker just wants to differentiate himself from a symbol that all right-thinking people can agree is insane

394
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
And that is

395
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,880
The things that Alex Jones says

396
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
18

397
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Trope

398
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
Escape goat

399
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,280
Yeah the more complex thing here is that

400
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,096
The theory that they're discussing the core of the great replace

401
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
Conspiracy theory

402
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,424
Alex and Tucker agree on

403
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Identical

404
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,592
Alex yells about the great replacement Tucker yells about the great Replacements so in order for Tucker to really get away with

405
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
His kind of dogs that he's attempting

406
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
He needs to clearly articulate what it

407
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,504
He's about his great replacement Theory That's So factually based

408
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Scholarly

409
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
In what aspect

410
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,880
Alex is great replacement Theory make it turn into crackpot Raven

411
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
Tucker can't do that because they have the same thing

412
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,512
Siri and it serves the same political purpose for both of them

413
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,400
Belief in the great replacement theories is to attack your own position which is why

414
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
Does this dodge the way he does

415
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:39,872
The same s*** that he does in order to use Alex as a punching bag in an attempt to bolster his own credibility

416
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,736
If Tucker were to be engaging honestly and he believed what he was saying

417
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
He would give

418
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,600
This same defense of his replacement Theory being based on fact

419
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,392
And instead of attacking Alex

420
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
He would say and you know who was way ahead of everybody else on this

421
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
Alex Jones

422
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,048
Lauren Southern with her documentary

423
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,400
If you truly believe this s*** and he needed to bring Alex's name into it

424
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,680
PewDiePie

425
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,520
The people who were preaching this gospel long before Tucker realized it was profitable

426
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,336
He doesn't do that because to him Alex

427
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,384
Isn't that ideological forefather

428
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
He's a puncher

429
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Check bag at a property

430
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,736
To use to maintain his shaky grass pump public respect

431
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Debility

432
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
Offended

433
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
I'm sure he's not though because

434
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,952
She knows that all the people he interacts with her self-interested backstabbing Liars

435
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:30,560
And nothing outside of the accumulation of and exercise of power really means anything

436
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Chinese flag

437
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Once you start looking

438
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,216
Can boot there's no what are you going to complain about the different Taste of boot

439
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,800
Helix movie kind of hope that like

440
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
You

441
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
You hope that Alex Wood

442
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
Feel hurt

443
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
By somebody

444
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
Clearly being like

445
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,016
You're a f******

446
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,344
Ranting lunatic I'm going

447
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,184
To use you as an example of the thing I would not when I'm being accused of being

448
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,232
A racist Theory

449
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
Now you're so smart

450
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
You're so smart

451
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,376
That's such a smart idea that's what you got to do you got play the Smokescreen

452
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,520
I totally like you you me you really love me you realize the image of me

453
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
In the world

454
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,408
You can use me as a shield and it WI a diesel bus

455
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,760
Really really f***** up is that

456
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
Alex

457
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,576
Even five years ago

458
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
Used to be that

459
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,416
Things that push the Overton window

460
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
You know

461
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,768
Because he was so out there the Republicans could

462
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,328
Take a more extreme position but they would still have to

463
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
The moderate in terms of that

464
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,656
It feels like now it's just a smokes

465
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,776
They all say the same thing Alex says another like while we're not like I like sounds like

466
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,360
No no you're there man you don't do that anymore

467
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,408
It's December gray Alex is like a focus

468
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:54,784
Kind of

469
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
You can get away with

470
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
See let's let's let him test drive some of this s***

471
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
That is that is such

472
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,488
I would describe it as exactly the way things are going

473
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
That's a bummer

474
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,888
So Alex spends a lot of time talking about Hunter Biden's iPhone

475
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
On this episode

476
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
Hunter Biden's nice

477
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,528
Looks like his father

478
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,136
And we cannot show you this information

479
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,488
Legal

480
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
Obviously

481
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
Him in bed

482
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
As trophies

483
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
We cannot show you

484
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
We will not show you

485
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,592
Quite frankly after I looked at some of that.

486
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Stop looking at

487
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Last night

488
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,920
Because never in my life

489
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
And as a journalist

490
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
I'm a pundit

491
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
An analyst

492
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
I also am a journalist

493
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,232
Look at it I will not look at it that's okay you could stuff man

494
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
That's fine

495
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,048
He doesn't

496
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,448
It's true so with this stuff I really feel like it's gotten to a point where the police should just arrest Hunter Biden

497
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
Alex can try and get a charge 2

498
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Sister stick in court

499
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,824
If you can prove his case harder to go to prison

500
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,664
Alex goes to jail for definition of defamation

501
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
And malicious prosecution

502
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,784
There needs to be some steaks through this cuz it has just on except

503
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
Here's the situation as I

504
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,160
Someone on 4chan claimed that they'd hack

505
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,232
Hunter's iCloud and released a bunch of stuff from it

506
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
Go to pictures and videos

507
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
Hunter with

508
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
Is Kraken sex-workers

509
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:48,704
Okay the authenticity of the material isn't fully confirmed which is actually something we should be careful about

510
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,752
Is it does appear that some of it

511
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,544
Is previously unreleased stuff

512
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,104
At least according to motherboard there's an article there they

513
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
Claim

514
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,808
But in situations like this because of the really dicey origins of the stuff being put out it can be very difficult

515
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:08,928
Difficult to know what is the genuine product of a hack and what could have been slipped in along the way

516
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
So I don't

517
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
No

518
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
What to

519
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
Do about it

520
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
Has more authenticated by

521
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
Respectable Source other than

522
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
Some weirdo 14

523
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:24,032
I'm confused about the whole Hunter Biden thing to do people care

524
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:30,432
WeCare do the bank I think I think that is some people is a positive correlation

525
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,224
Between caring about Hunter Biden

526
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
And stuff and

527
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,552
The Durham report

528
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,600
Yeah they were the only people that care

529
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
I mean

530
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,672
ICare inasmuch as I think

531
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:47,328
There seems to be a problem Maybe

532
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,632
There's a personal you know what it is

533
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
Mine no problem

534
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
No

535
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
I think that if

536
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
Things were

537
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:59,872
What Alex's describing it would be a problem

538
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,920
Everybody else to take care of

539
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:06,784
From everything I understand this is outrageously sensationalized

540
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
Describing that

541
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,112
Look I just

542
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,184
Growing weary of Hunter Biden stories

543
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,304
First it was his laptop now it's his iCloud.

544
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,376
The Jacob Wohl is going to announce

545
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
That he got his hands

546
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:28,288
On the graphing calculator

547
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:34,688
F****** sketchy s*** on it even the even more simple you turn that upside down that mother

548
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,528
Biker is dirty

549
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,576
So I I just I mean I don't

550
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
I don't know

551
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
This is a crime

552
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,536
Tired of hearing Alex say stuff that doesn't go anywhere and it's disgusting

553
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,352
I mean honestly and I just don't care it if

554
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,960
If you had him on one of those strong man things where if I hit the thing with a mallet

555
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,264
Hunter Biden would actually go flying up

556
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
And his head would hit a

557
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
Bell

558
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
I still wouldn't care

559
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
I just don't care

560
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,176
I don't care about him

561
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Nope so

562
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,760
Alex and his mom

563
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
Yeah

564
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
There's something's going to happen

565
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,880
That is never going to get that titty again

566
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
Nope

567
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,072
My mom's really smart person

568
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,376
Biden was installed here in Africa

569
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,960
She said mark my words I've said this many times here we go

570
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Told you this

571
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,616
They're planning to kill Biden as a false flag

572
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:41,248
Change the subject

573
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
My mother

574
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
I also think of right-wing

575
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
Common Sense thing

576
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,608
Your family sounds f****** annoying

577
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,168
So yeah Alex is both

578
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
Take that the other guy

579
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:00,960
Jill Biden

580
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
Is a false flag

581
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,896
Man what a dinner conversation this is the only way that Hunters iPad story is going to go away

582
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:14,016
False flag kill Joe Biden it is kind of fascinating to think that like

583
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:20,672
When I sit down at the dinner table with my family for like Thanksgiving or whatever

584
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
You talk about our lives

585
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,280
Even if it gets to politics or something like that

586
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,096
We're still talking about stuff grounded in reality you know

587
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
Legacy games to me they would Alec

588
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,936
Does that and either sitting around the table

589
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,264
They're all just in a writers room just tossing out bit

590
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
So just like

591
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,104
Okay here's what's going to happen all right

592
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,504
The North Koreans are going to... And that's how we know it's going to happen and you like what are you talk

593
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,904
I'm picturing like Alex's mom pulling him aside and then I got a Hot Chip

594
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,168
Yeah but Alex really thinks is going to happen

595
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
He's not predicting

596
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
So I predict

597
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
Prendela mine

598
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
Common Sense thing

599
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,136
The weather building a shop that they're going to kill by

600
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,696
I really think so,

601
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
Before the midterm

602
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,472
Who cares about the birthmark

603
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,336
Probability in the next 120 days

604
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
October surprise

605
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
Yeah that would be a

606
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,160
Surprise in October okay

607
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:01,792
So if you get this I mean this is the way this s*** works with Alex it's like I'm not pretty

608
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:07,424
I'm predicting that the globalists are going to do this is a 90%

609
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
Please just give yourself up

610
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,800
Back exit Escape Route when it doesn't happen

611
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,104
Although I'm gonna feel real dumb if

612
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Is false flag

613
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,176
Next couple months

614
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,968
I still won't feel dumb

615
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,296
I refuse to feel dumb if he's false-flag murdered

616
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
Fine

617
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
Qualify

618
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,392
Hopefully I do think that what this is

619
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:32,256
Representative of an indicative of is that Alex is responding to the idea that there is such a

620
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Fever Pitch

621
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
It's growing with

622
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
The thing

623
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,632
Things like the January 6th committee

624
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,424
I think things like

625
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
The continuing covid

626
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
Situation

627
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,360
There's a pretty good chance that someone might take a shot at 5

628
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:52,992
And I think Alex knows that the people who are ideologically

629
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,808
Very much in sync with him

630
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:03,488
The doj puts on their big boy pants and actually charges drop with a I mean any number of the crime

631
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
You know that they proved he did

632
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
I got really excited because I thought I might still have the outside play

633
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,800
How did my iTunes

634
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
You know people are going to start

635
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,384
Putting putting bullets in Long Rifle

636
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:27,040
It's it it seems like it's not a zero possibility and I would recognize that to his preemptively creating

637
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
His storyline

638
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
It's going to happen but also by.

639
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,120
Help them

640
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,192
I wish you harm against by there any of these people

641
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,496
I want to be tried and put in prison

642
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
Process

643
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,616
But I've already determined the

644
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,944
So do process but it is

645
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,736
Arteriogram

646
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
Methodology the poles

647
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,600
Democrat

648
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,160
Always baked into the falls

649
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,512
But now Biden is polling in

650
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,144
Biden approval rating six historic

651
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,496
Believe me

652
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:23,872
Awaits

653
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
Before but also these poles are also

654
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,968
Yeah there's still super fake

655
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,784
They're faking

656
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
8 hits

657
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
Still Rick Lowe

658
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,880
That's their idea

659
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:41,280
Of how to do this are likely playing

660
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,560
Embarrassing

661
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,960
Listen he's hitting 185 you going down to the minors man there's nothing to say

662
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,008
It's over

663
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,848
We got to save face with an all-time low

664
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,152
201

665
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,944
It's going down

666
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,504
Does it matter

667
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,136
Wow yeah it makes sense though when you really think about it

668
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
No it does

669
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
Know each other

670
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
Subway

671
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,792
We got to we got tacos energy crisis

672
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
Texas

673
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,096
Again

674
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
And

675
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,912
Refuses to understand how Texas

676
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:23,264
Power grid works

677
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
Following

678
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,104
Bilderberg Group

679
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,152
And public relations arm

680
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
Screw

681
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,880
Operator blackouts that was months ago

682
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,440
They're not allowed to use coal

683
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,744
Shut down most of those plants

684
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,192
It's fine if they don't

685
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
Prison time

686
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
A year-and-a-half ago

687
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Add

688
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,624
Joe Biden

689
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,440
Who just got that office shed

690
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
No

691
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,792
With three!

692
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,888
This is just straight-up pathetic

693
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,448
41 Alex is completely lying about

694
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Pretty much all of

695
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
The details of that blackout

696
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,664
But if you zoom out he's actually also lying about the entire reality that the blackout existed in and there's a

697
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,944
Good reason for him to do that

698
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,272
Texas power grid failure is an indictment of his ideology

699
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,600
The reason they were outages like the ones that happen Tracy

700
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:48,000
Is back to a deregulatory is disconnected from the two major Countrywide

701
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
One so they can avoid any federal over

702
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:54,144
Alex needs to lie about everything related to this case because if he doesn't

703
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,216
His listeners might catch on that those blackouts were tragic

704
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,800
And deadly example of political ideas are bad

705
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,664
You won't go to prison for having a coal-burning power plant there are plenty of them in Texas

706
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,272
It is pretty sad but honestly the alternative to lying here is Rekha

707
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,600
Hypnotizing that deregulating be power grid in Texas was a

708
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,184
Really dumb destructive idea what Alex can't do without admitting like

709
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
Hey my guys were wrong

710
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
Yeah

711
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
Listen

712
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Okay

713
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
2022

714
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
If your

715
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,680
Like a big solution is

716
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,960
Burning coal

717
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,240
F****** get out of here

718
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,544
YouTube Fargo

There's tons of really toxical as well agree we should use the Clean Coal first

728
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,480
Alex thinks Clean Coal is a different things in Kohl's

729
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,528
He thinks it's a different like

730
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
To a Subway

731
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,160
Thanks feels better too tempting to make coil cleaner

732
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
He thinks that it's a different Rock

733
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,864
Different mineral

734
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,144

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,784
I understand where you're coming from but I also think it's

744
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,928
You're distracted from the Psychedelic speaks of Clean Coal is difficult

745
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
Which was the Noid

746
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
Which was the point

747
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
Just calling it Clean Coal but

748
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:03,680
The reason that I'm stressing it is because he clearly has no idea what he's talking about or

749
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:07,520
Is audience for the sake of big big Cole

750
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,336
Scrub it down that's what I mean

751
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
Just regular cold

752
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,408
But I scrap it down first all that dirty

753
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,808
Is you also have to use scrubbers but Clean Coal is like

754
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,136
You know how do you see the chunks of cold shoulder black

755
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,184
Write these ones are like grey

756
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,720
The clean their clean

757
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
Alright

758
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
Hello

759
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
Completely come on

760
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,168
Our sweet pedantic saying this little bit more about the the power

761
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,496
We know the place they run we know their scams

762
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,616
That was the power operators months ago

763
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:45,920
And now

764
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
They have come out

765
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,648
Grid operator potential rolling blackouts today

766
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,280
Issues call for voluntary conservation

767
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,840
That's right you got to conserve

768
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,936
Because they cut your power your learning in this great transition

769
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,728
No more Heating in your houses

770
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,360
The government will give you a place to be warm

771
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:22,016
Two groups like ercot are making these sorts of announcements because they know that the alternative is to connect the Texas grade to the interstate

772
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,296
State infrastructure and that's

773
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
Something that

774
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,136
Is heavily conservative State isn't going to go for

775
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:33,792
They would rather die and have rolling blackouts then to give up his imaginary sliver of Freedom that they think

776
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
Do they have from the Federal

777
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,960
A solution that would help with the problem is categorically off the table so the way to live with it

778
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,544
Is the ask people to voluntarily limit their energy intake

779
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:49,152
This is not build back better or the great reset this is conservatism enact

780
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,224
Heidelberg Germany they didn't say the people could

781
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,248
Heater own houses

782
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,064
That's enough to scare the audience

783
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,392
The German government is concerned that Russia May restrict

784
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,208
Gas supply the comes into the country and this would create a

785
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
Huge energy

786
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
Crisis come winter

787
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,304
This is a potential merger

788
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,192
That may come up months from now so to prepare for that possibility some cities in Germany or setting up heating Halls

789
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
Where people can

790
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:17,312
Can go to make sure that everyone has access to a safe warm place to be

791
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,616
Oz intentionally misreporting the

792
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
Story because the cover

793
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,456
Sincerely would reveal things he doesn't want the audience

794
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,224
It's to realize

795
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:30,368
First be potential for this German energy crisis has to do with Putin restricting the supply of gas that flows

796
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
Country

797
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
The audience

798
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:36,256
Supposed to think that the globalists are meddling with energy not the guy who Alex

799
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,792
To protect is fighting

800
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,376
That would really suck up their heads

801
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:48,032
Second the story is about the government setting up emergency centers to save the lives of vulnerable people should

802
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
Worst case scenario comes

803
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
The pass

804
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,407
I was present this as a government saying that you can't heat your home and you have to

805
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
Independent Big Brother 4

806
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,223
Because if he didn't

807
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,247
People might ask

808
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:01,855
Like why are you opposed to humanitarian efforts to make sure the people don't freeze to death on the

809
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,903
Mistreat another hop

810
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,927
The simplest

811
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
Humanitarian effort

812
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,743
You don't even need to talk about the

813
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,023
It's

814
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,815
Undaunted f******

815
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,119
There are heated things

816
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Cuz it's fun

817
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,655
King Cole

818
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,447
That's how it's just the same s***

819
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
God dammit

820
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:24,127
Yeah just more centralized in like a Hall that's dedicated to even more importantly then

821
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,991
Deregulation is why they're having the blackouts in the conservatism being

822
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,343
It is also that the people who run ercot are billionaires

823
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,391
Who make even more money

824
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,183
Whenever you can't have power

825
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,231
If it's if they lost money

826
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,255
For a moment

827
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,583
They would come out and they be like holy s*** guys we really f***** this one up

828
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,887
It'll give us a little bit more profit if we're

829
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:52,287
Good people may be true for the the companies themselves the workouts actually

830
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,591
Does the electric electric reliability Council

831
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Cheerleader

832
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,687
It may not be them that has the harsh profit motive

833
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,527
Necessarily I'm sure they're not at all captured by those energy

834
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,551
Companies that would be

835
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,367
Fair enough

836
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
To be hyper

837
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,975
Clear there are other factors at play that

838
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
Relate to why

839
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,535
Babies energy crunches

840
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,095
Are happening but a large amount of the burden

841
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,375
Could be taken off

842
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Bye

843
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
Not making your

844
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
F******

845
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,007
Entire electric grid

846
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
Independent

847
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,103
In order to avoid Federal lovers being stupid

848
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
Stupid

849
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:34,783
So you made a really good point about the idea of Alex's enemies getting a fair trial

850
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
Fixated on that

851
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:45,023
Broadcasting worldwide in defense of human Liberty we are the resistance

852
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:51,423
From enemies foreign and domestic

853
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,823
Alex Jones humanity is getting off

854
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,015
My body

855
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,951
I am so proud of the people

856
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,511
Sri Lanka

857
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,631
South Africa Nigeria

858
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
Humanity

859
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
The blinders off

860
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,687
And the globalist are going down

861
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
But we need

862
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
Is Nuremberg to

863
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,159
World trials

864
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,463
We need him convicted

865
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,351
And we need a break their necks

866
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
But only once

867
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,007
They've been given a fair trial

868
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,823
Which will be so fat

869
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
The Farris trial anyway ever

870
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,943
For the world to see

871
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,479
Full HD

872
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:18,207
Ladies and gentlemen yeah so like there is a trial for Klaus Schwab

873
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,767
America

874
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:27,935
I don't think that's fair trials

875
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,543
Did we lose our stolen and Charles.

876
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
Think anybody should be allowed to

877
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
To talk about

878
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,687
Sri Lankans

879
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,735
A Sri Lankan group

880
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,551
Break into your home steal all of your s***

881
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,879
Live in your pool and then beat you to death for being too rich

882
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,463
I don't think Alex gets to be like congratulations srilanka

883
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
Cuz if his house was there

884
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
He's dead witch house

885
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
Exactly

886
00:45:55,071 --> 00:46:01,215
Yeah also go fuc yourself with this idea of Nuremberg to you should not be in favor of world Courtney

887
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:07,615
Alex

888
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,895
Quartz he want

889
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,687
Americans to put this

890
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
Skort

891
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,479
On the world

892
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
Look for them to see

893
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,575
I mean I guess that is probably what do you want

894
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
But you shouldn't

895
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:23,999
If you don't want to One World Government don't argue for world try I mean I do feel like what he really wants is for us to put stick

896
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:24,767
6 steaks

897
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,095
With dead bodies on the border of the United States

898
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,655
Klaus Schwab Bill Gates and all that

899
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,703
Beware globulus

900
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,239
Know what he wants

901
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
Is 4

902
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
People

903
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:36,799
Kill them

904
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:42,687
Look for him to keep this flimsy veneer of I like the rule of law don't hurt anybody

905
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,551
Anyway so did Alex

906
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,087
Larry does again

907
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
US Secretary of State

Around the world

909
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,095
Masturbated

910
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,167
By the Russian aggression against Ukraine

911
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,495
1% of it

912
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
No it was

913
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
Tears ago

914
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,079
Play Shine On

915

Paris climate Accords

916
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
Anime

917

30%

918
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
Really happening

919
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,439
You will eat some bugs

920
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,719
Dialysis is making

921
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:32,351
Shut up signed onto the Paris Accord back in April 2016

922
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
The Kyoto Protocol

923
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,399
Since 2002

924
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:37,215
The information Alex's providing is just made up to

925
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:40,287
You can go to the Sri Lankan government's National livestock statistic

926
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,591
6 page and you'll find that the number of cows has been

927
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
Been steadily increasing year-over-year

928
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:51,039
The professional numbers for 2021 included in approximately 2 million liter increase in average monthly milk for

929
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,599
I guess I could just say whatever you want

930
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
Provide no evidence for it

931
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
Expect his audience

932
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
A nod along with it cuz

933
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
That's the game

934
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
I mean

935
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
How do you even

936
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
Come up with

937
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,863
They just killed half of their cows

938
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,167
Whenever the truth is they have more cows

939
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:11,007
How do you do that it's because the stories of

940
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:17,407
Sort of revolve around ideas of emissions

941
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:23,551
I get that responsible farming thought process

942
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
Sri Lankan

943
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,927
Livestock sector is mostly made up of smaller

944
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,999
Operation of course

945
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,047
And those are less

946
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
Damaging in terms of

947
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
Environment

948
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
Olympics

949
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,911
So

950
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
Look

951
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
We need

952
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
Coal-burning

953
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
No

954
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,871
Why cold cuz they're good for trees I swear to God

955
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
Done with it

956
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,175
Coal power plants are good for trees

957
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,295
So my trees and plants

958
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
Directly downwind

959
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,135
Coal Power Plant

960
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,671
Grow much faster and healthy

961
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,975
Carbon dioxide

962
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,327
The bad guys in FernGully aren't this evil

963
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,935
Play pump carbon

964
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,591
The exact opposite is actually with most studies

965
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:22,175
I found fire power plants are

966
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,967
Pre bath in the surrounding area

967
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,271
Likely due to a combination of air pollution

968
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,623
PH level and nutrient composition of the soil

969
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
Sometimes

970
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:39,071
Alex's example there about humans walking around in CO2 and being fine is actually a really good argument again

971
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,095
Against his own position

972
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,167
No one is saying that we need to get rid of CO2 in

973
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,215
Hi early because that's stupid

974
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:49,311
Obviously CO2 exist as an important natural process

975
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,591
However

976
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:54,431
Excess CO2 has really negative consequences on these processes

977
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:59,039
And there's plenty of evidence that our actions have increased the levels of CO2 in ways that are danger

978
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,855
Alex is human exam

979
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,647
Just walking around

980
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
Their CO2 in the air

981
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,463
And if you're fine

982
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,559
Generally because it's a low enough level that there isn't a problem

983
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,655
However once the air becomes more concentrated CO2

984
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,703
It becomes really dangerous to breathe

985
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:23,359
At about five percent composition you may end up with some respiratory problems and it could become serious but the real issue

986
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,895
Is when you get over 10%

987
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:29,503
Hey which point you'll likely have convulsions you could end up in a coma and you might die

988
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:34,367
When you get higher than that you're in a situation where you'll probably lose consciousness

989
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,391
Free quick

990
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
If someone with a mask

991
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,719
Isn't there to help you you'll die

992
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,559
CO2 super dangerous to people in the levels are high enough

993
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:46,655
But it's a normal not dangerous part of life when the levels are in

994
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Check

995
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:50,495
This exact same principle applies to the lottery codes

996
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,591
The mad if Alex is so certain that CO2 isn't dangerous to people

997
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,895
You should do a livestream where he goes into a room

998
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:00,223
Where the CO2 levels are like 30% so we can children have seafood

999
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:04,063
I'm I'm waiting for the day and I don't think it's

1000
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,087
Going to be that long

1001
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,879
You remember when that a****** brought us

1002
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
Snowball in

1003
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,439
Congress seems like C climate

1004
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,487
You know I'm waiting

1005
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:15,071
Waiting for the a****** to come in with a jar of CO2

1006
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,399
Unscrew it and then release it into there and be like

1007
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:24,543
Zc02 doesn't hurt any of you today and I just idental happen

1008
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:30,943
30% CO2 what I mean is

1009
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,575
Take there to drag him out I just want a demonstration of him passing out I don't want to die

1010
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,135
I just think it would be funny if you had a lot of hubris

1011
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:45,791
Like when me and Kyle waterboarded himself

1012
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:54,751
No he didn't

1013
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:58,079
The paperwork and everything

1014
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,615
Paperwork yeah

1015
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,895
Amazing

1016
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
Any day now

1017
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
So Alex is a guest

1018
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,759
The guy was running for congress

1019
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,039
I also used to run

1020
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
On the football

1021
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
Feel okay

1022
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:14,975
There is an incredible Herschel Walker

1023
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,279
This country

1024
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,887
Primary

1025
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,215
Tyrone Davis in is Going to Be Our Guest for exploit

1026
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:34,943
I didn't realize until I set it up that way that'd believably have been Herschel Walker

1027
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:41,343
It's not okay Davis is a former football player who's getting into the political scene

1028
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,743
So he's running for Arizona's 4th District and the reason he's got Alex's attention is that he recently

1029
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:51,071
Very extreme Pro AK-47 campaign

1030
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:56,447
Stevenson is 15 candidates in the GOP Primary that's taking place on August 2nd

1031
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:01,311
The primary candidate isn't running unopposed

1032
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,847
I'm going to predict he loses

1033
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,383
Knowing nothing else

1034
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:10,527
Arizona's 4th is a republican + 22 District so whoever wins at GOP Primary will get elected

1035
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,575
But that's still pretty big hurdle with

1036
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,855
The field of five

1037
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:18,975
This is a really good strategy for these friend Infowars ask candidates

1038
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,767
It's troubles me that they're taking

1039
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,607
You attacked the primaries of Super Save GOP disc

1040
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,167
You're probably not going to win but there's a

1041
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,959
And if you do

1042
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,263
Is a cakewalk into conquer and Youth

1043
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,031
The Cakewalk.

1044
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,823
Stay in concrete you have the incumbent

1045
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,359
So crazy

1046
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,943
This is the only way lunatics like the sort Alex loves are going

1047
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,039
To get into office so if your political strategist your best bet would be

1048
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,319
Cook's partisan index

1049
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:48,159
Just focus on getting insane primary candidates

1050
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,207
In most of those heavily.

1051
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,487
District

1052
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,303
And then the more airtime you get them in Congress

1053
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,887
The more cover they give to the insane Republicans who at least talk

1054
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,679
Like people I mean

1055
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,495
On some level if you're even just like a

1056
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,287
Playing with fire but

1057
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,567
If you're just remain

1058
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,871
Rino Republicans

1059
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,687
That would even work to your advantage

1060
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,503
Maybe don't do too many of these primary

1061
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,831
Challenges

1062
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,367
It does it does work to your van

1063
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,159
I mean

1064
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
It's not hard to

1065
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:26,815
To see how the unintended consequences of this strategy are going to come back and bite them in the ass but it's all of

1066
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:31,679
But most of them will be dead by then so they don't care it's us who are going to be bitter

1067
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,959
Let me ask which is

1068
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:38,079
Would you like to know exactly what it's going to be like if Davison goes to Congo I would love to

1069
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,359
Now you out here like

1070
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,967
When I get in here I'm going to wedge war against these evil

1071
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
Evil people

1072
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,087
People don't understand this what America needs to wake up and understand right now

1073
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,391
You need to wake up right now because your sister five churches

1074
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:55,231
And pastors are not going to come to the rescue they are not involved

1075
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,255
In the spiritual battle

1076
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,047
You need to understand that

1077
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,071
Evil is

1078
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
Evil

1079
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:04,447
In America does not understand how evil is because they think that this is some kind of movie

1080
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:08,543
This is a real evil takeover and they coming to take your children from you

1081
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,871
They coming to take your wealth your life and everything from you right now

1082
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,431
Hey man the guy you're talking to thinks everything

1083
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,223
Movies are real

1084
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,783
So also what you just described

1085
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:23,135
The government coming to your home taking your children your stuff and then your life

1086
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,439
That sounds like a lot a lot like a movie

1087
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,743
Yeah and also I mean

1088
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,815
Wants to go to Congress

1089
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,839
Wager holy

1090
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,911
You know cuz that's how you want government to work

1091
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,471
It's not so what happened first

1092
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,519
So here's how it goes what happened

1093
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,567
You want somebody

1094
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,103
Probably Young

1095
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,919
To really fill their brain with absolute

1096
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:52,319
Garbage nonsense and then later on like a Manchurian Candidate they'll appear from nowhere and spout back bulge

1097
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,623
And then there's a good chance that

1098
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:57,951
Your other bulshit people are going to go for a go f****** cares

1099
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,719
Look

1100
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,487
I don't want to leave

1101
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
Luckily I don't think

1102
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,351
He's going to win the GOP Primary but if he does

1103
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:08,959
Bad stuff

1104
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,543
Hey man this is a complete War

1105
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:18,943
The spirit that was with God he saw God he was created by God he watch God make the stars and the

The planets and everything

1107
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:25,855
In the Bible says in Joel that they rejoiced when God made all of these things that he was The Sovereign Elohim

1108
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:30,975
But these papers with the God and saw him and knew him as God but yet

People just stayed in heaven or was just between the pages of Genesis and exodus evil is prevalent today and it's in

The Democrat Party at we have to stop at right now

Parties

1119
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,599

1121
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:05,791

1127
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,759
Like this V's ideas that are being spouse

1128
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,807
Essentially they like biblical demons

1129
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:30,623
Still walk amongst the Earth and they are at the Democratic

1130
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:34,975

00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,999
Yep

1132
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:36,767

00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,751
This call made me sad

1170
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,799
I've had conversations

1171
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,919
Stuff that you're spinning

1172
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
Well yeah

1173
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:36,575
Between these things happening our government is run by C

1174
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,879
Panic pedophiles they have their signs

1175
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,183
And they're trying to bring about

1176
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,743
Play the second coming of Jesus Christ

1177
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,559
This is why we think things are bad now it's

I just get really sad whenever people are like people think I'm weird

1181
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,895

1183
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,831
Advice

01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
To anybody

1185
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,951
Before you read between the lines try reading the lines

1186
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:18,047
Oh man the lines are usually more important than what's between them read those lines

1187
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,887
And then if you read the lines you might find out that those spaces between them racks

1188
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,679
Spaces so you can read the line

1189
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,215
Is it Eerie between them then it's

1190
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,495
Dutchess black ink all over the place

1191
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:33,407
It's stuff in between the lines often is really an art of analysis and assessment

1192
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,199
But you need to know the lines

1193
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:37,759
In order to know what your analyzing and assessing

1194
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,551

You can do a 900

1198
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,487

1200
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,655

Are there all boner pills

1235
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:27,839
So Alex gets back to his prediction that is not

1236
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,863
A f****** prediction

1237
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:35,263
Don't say it's a prediction really feels like if he agrees with the prediction then that means he is all Talladega cannot predict

1238
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,031
Biden's going to be

1239
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,567
I believe

1240
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,615
It doesn't mean it's going to happen but

1241
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:44,479

Trump said I'm going to run in July

1245
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,631
I don't know if I heard anybody covering this

1246
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,399

Worldwide

1249
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:12,895
But I don't think I heard anybody covering a

1250
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,967
Discovering it. Even after he said so

1251
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,759
I think we just made fun of them

1252
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,319
Is planes done repaint American flag on it

1253
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:23,903
Just talked to talk to for people to talk to Trump

1254
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,719
They said yeah he's going to announce in July as early as

1255
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Monday

1256
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,767
I said hey

1257
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:34,143
He's aware that for most least reliable people ever

1258
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,679

And what would help them get rid of this liability

1262
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,783
Blame it all on him

1263
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,831
Criticizing

1264
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:53,855
Bad

1265
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,927
Makes perfect sense

1266
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,231

We don't support that we're on record

1278
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,303
That's all I'm getting

1279
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,095

I don't know

1284
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,431
I do I do think that there is just like this

1285
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
FedEx

1286
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,991
Relationship with information

1287
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:57,343
But if you pay attention to Alex's show you start to recognize over and over again

1288
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,135
And that is exactly what he's

1289
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:05,791
Sort of lashing out about In that clip about how people took me out of context and said that I was going to

1290
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,815
Forthright

1291
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
Yeah what

1292
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:14,495
A gun out on the 4th but also

1293
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,079
Nothing means anything

1294
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,103
He's going to get killed

1295
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,175
Before the midterms

1296
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
Not predict

1297
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,735
90%

1298
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:25,759
Not going to happen

1299
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:28,063
Eventually when it doesn't happen he can complain the beep

1300
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,599
Contact shirt

1301
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
Checks

1302
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,671
Here's what we're going to talk about

1303
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,439
Statistics

1304
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:37,023
Okay if you claim that something is 95

1305
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,303
Percent likely to happen

1306
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:41,887
Is 90% likely to happen he's right 95%

1307
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:44,703
All right so if you're right 95% of the time

1308
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,007
Then that means out of every

1309
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,287
20 examples

1310
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,823
You're wrong one

1311
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
True right

1312
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:51,871
So

1313
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,663
If you have less than

1314
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,943
Five examples

1315
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,735
And all of them are wrong

1316
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:03,647
By what measure could you describe yourself as having anything close tonight

1317
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,463
A lot more things than we have so far

1318
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,535
And here's another piece of unfortunate news for Alex

1319
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,119
If you have been right about 95% of the things of the past

1320
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
But you have not

1321
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,679
That has no bearing on

1322
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:20,799
Your future prediction it is how that work be wrong 100 per-cent of the time moving for

1323
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:25,407
Yeah you do not ever have more than one in whatever chance on a roulette wheel

1324
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
So you can't like

1325
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,199
Get more chance

1326
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,247
So we jump to the 12th

1327
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,295
And Alex is in a

1328
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,063
A good mood

1329
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:36,159
Wow the worldwide Awakening

1330
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:40,511
Against the New World Order has eggs bloated

1331
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,839
They're flying the Gadsden flag in Argentina

1332
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,119
In Venezuela

1333
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,655
In Sri Lanka

1334
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
In Eastern Europe

1335
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
In the UK

1336
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,519
Right here in the United States and Canada

1337
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,591
The Chinese are writing and taking over

1338
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:57,919
What time is party central banks the same things happening

1339
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:00,479
Other countries Dutch farmers are torching

1340
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,927
Turn off the energy

1341
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:15,071
Enemy

1342
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,863
Play Gwar

1343
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:22,751
Power outages

1344
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,567
Launch by Russia

1345
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,591
Okay

1346
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:30,943
Alex Armenian the Dutch Farmers had burned down a factory that was owned by Bill Gates

1347
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,039
That made synthetic meat and that's part of what he's a ranting about it that's not true

1348
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:41,439
There was an online grocery service Distribution Center in the Netherlands that caught fire but it wasn't owner-operated

1349
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:47,071
So once again Alex is approximately as good a source of information is your grandpa's Facebook feed

1350
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,143
Some triumphant music

1351
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,935
That's nice and fun

1352
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,983
But there's a reason reason

1353
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:59,871
It's not that Litany of b******* right is not the Gadsden flag being

1354
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:06,271
Flown around the world

1355
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,039
Countdown

1356
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:07,807
Was

1357
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
Like

1358
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:12,927
But it's part of the proudest moment of my high school career when you saw a rest

1359
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:16,767
Master development High School fight song

1360
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,559
Was the final countdown

1361
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,839
And we will play it March

1362
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
Band Style

1363
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,399
And then after the football games

1364
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:25,471
We would go and we would kind of huddle right near the door and we

1365
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,775
We play what we do you know who played double time

1366
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:32,127
Blasting that song as fast as we possibly can right

1367
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,407
So what night

1368
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,943
I was playing in the football game

1369
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,503
And I got a pretty serious concussion

1370
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,063
Right but I also played in the marching band so after

1371
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
The football game

1372
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,367
I put off my drunk

1373
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,391
Walked over there

1374
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,671
I f****** killed it

1375
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,207
I had a concussion

1376
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:52,607
My proudest moment of high school are proud of you and I'm super happy about it so it was

1377
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,679
You know what I'm remembering and I miss was that

1378
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:00,031
I miss the times when Alex would play fight the good fight by Triumph

1379
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,311
You know like

1380
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:07,967
It's like I hate to say this because it involves your proudest moment of your life but I think that The Final Countdown to little bit hacking

1381
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,503
High School

1382
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,831
Life let's not go to what bar songs a little hack

1383
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,367
It's a little bit

1384
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
F***** out

1385
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,671
It's play too much

1386
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,487
But I haven't heard of double time by marching

1387
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,327
I think that fight the good fight by Triumph is

1388
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,863
Enough of like

1389
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,887
People don't listen to

1390
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,911
On the rocks

1391
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
Stations all the

1392
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
The time

1393
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,727
You know

1394
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,519
I don't know I feel like

1395
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,311
I feel like Alex

1396
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:40,479
You should bring back dry up how does how do you make Triumph field about

1397
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,015
Comic I don't care

1398
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,575
You don't think so cuz I feel like they have to get like

1399
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:48,415
Triumph is good for me to poop

1400
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,695
Somebody would do that

1401
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,231
I think that anybody

1402
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,047
Was going to a Triumph concert now

1403
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,119
Your rights day baby pass the

1404
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,655
Robert Smigel Joker

1405
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,935
Of my

1406
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,007
30 is a pair of Nike wheeled nerds

1407
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,799
Real Transformers

1408
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:07,615
They don't want to insult their tomorrow

1409
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:12,223
I think the reason that Alex is in a good mood

1410
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,039
Venusian zinncredible

1411
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,367
Let me give you just one example of this and I'm sure they'll take it

1412
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,231
Audi covering this morning's Jackman

1413
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,535
But Alex is war is

1414
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,887
Ugliest things I've done

1415
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,167
And I

1416
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,703
Really promoted it yet

1417
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,287
And it has gone once it went on pre-order 2 days ago

1418
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,103
Thousands of films you can pre-order

1419
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,711
Number for

1420
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,735
Ladies and gentlemen

1421
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,783
Just behind Top Gun

1422
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,575
Jurassic World

1423
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,599
And the Justice League

1424
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,183
We pulled past Elvis

1425
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,743
God facing Noland

1426
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
Freedom

1427
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,095
I mean those Jessica

1428
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
In the top

1429
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,215
50

1430
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:09,055
We are at number for headed to number one

1431
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:10,847
As usual

1432
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:15,711
So I guess there's a lot of pre-sales for this documentary / Puff

1433
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,015
It's coming out at the end of the month

1434
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:22,367
I guess that's big news so much so that Alex needs to open the show with it

1435
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,135
Weird

1436
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,439
So I can do to the champion Narcissus

1437
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:29,535
It's really remarkable how about him

1438
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,327
Over performing in pre-sales

1439
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,143
It somehow evidence that the globalist are going down

1440
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,543
Just that guy who gave Alex 8 million in Bitcoin

1441
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,103
Since the film's the film's Twitter if you do it only

1442
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,895
6700 follow

1443
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:51,295
I know it's not like it's setting the world on fire there's not that much anticipation for it

1444
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:57,695
Haley's book becomes a bestseller and you're like okay well if you block purchase iris flower

1445
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:01,535
You go to the dollar store and there's a thousand of them are

1446
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:05,119
So I wanted to learn a little more about those documentaries

1447
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,911
John IMDb

1448
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:11,775
Apparently a guy named Hadrian belove is one of the primary producers

1449
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,055
Hadrian belove

1450
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:18,687
Yeah that mean probably doesn't ring a bell to you but he used to be the executive director of cinefan

1451
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:25,343
An independent leaning theater in Los Angeles

1452
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:31,743
2017 email circulated that accused him of engaging in a pattern of sexual

1453
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:35,327
Harassment carried out by beloved as well as other board members

1454
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,143
Chamblee shutdown

1455
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,959
Permanently with the board releasing a statement quote

1456
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:47,359
The damage caused to the organization by the conduct of some and the crippling debt now facing the cinefamily are in the

1457
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,895
The board's View irreparable

1458
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,455
I don't want to go out any details but

1459
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:57,855
It seems like this is a shity dude is behavior heard a bunch of people and pelvis Troy movie house that had been in business for a deck

1460
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:01,951
I can see that guy making a documentary about Alex for sure

1461
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,767
Another producer is John Isom

1462
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:09,375
Who isn't the same John ice and men who killed the dude like a year ago but if you Google his name

1463
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
That other dude comes up

1464
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,423
Wild

1465
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:17,311
Also produced Amanda Milius Is 2020 Trump propaganda film the plot against

1466
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,615
The president

1467
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,199
You can't say all vocal

1468
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,991
Immediately after that I was like

1469
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
This guy

1470
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:32,159
Also killed a guy like that can't be how it goes

1471
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:40,095
Also seems like somebody who would make a documentary about Alex

1472
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:45,215
Movie Howie like in the early days of Studios whenever these guys would get together and

1473
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,799
Make Ben-Hur that's the type of s*** these guys are up to

1474
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:52,639
Right there's no Robert Evans Easter of them on this project

1475
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:58,015
The other producer is Philip Hancock whose other credits include the plot against the president

1476
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:01,087
Upcoming documentary about John McAfee called wack

1477
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,159
I feel like I can guess what the angle of that one

1478
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:04,927
It's going to be

1479
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:08,255
Hancock also worked on the series called the witness project

1480
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,303
Told stories of people who escaped for

1481
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,071
From communism

1482
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,863
The point is this team suck

1483
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,959
Subjective

1484
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:23,359
One of The Producers is a disgraced former member of the LA art movie scene and the other two are people whose resumes are just

1485
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,175
Trump propaganda and anti-communist short

1486
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:29,503
I'll still watch it but it's absurd to pretend that this is

1487
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:33,599
Is anything other than something that the glamorized and rehabilitate Alex

1488
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,623
His Public Image

1489
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,159
Which is why he's promoting

1490
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
Also I can

1491
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:42,815
Count the number of no-name ass Comics who went to number one on iTunes when they released an album

1492
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:49,471
None of these metrics really mean that much on their own and often they're pretty useful as a tool to make something look more popular

1493
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,007
That it actually is and I would guess

1494
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:51,775
What that dynamic

1495
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,799
Is somewhat

1496
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,567
At play here

1497
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:59,199
Listen I'm not saying it's not important but I have intro'd far too many of my friends with

1498
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:01,759
Their album went to number one on iTunes

1499
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,063
For me to believe that it is a

1500
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,879
High honor

1501
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,927
Those sorts of charts don't

1502
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:13,023
Numbers of gross downloads for a rehab

1503
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,559
There's not a lot of

1504
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,143
So

1505
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:18,911
Alex

1506
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,471
You know he's

1507
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,263
Said that he has an octopus

1508
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,799
Just before the history

1509
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:30,687
Also during the deposition of his corporate representative

1510
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,783
Add to that note

1511
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:42,463
Does come up again I'm sorry what

1512
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,071
It's going into the prisonplanet.tv archives are now free to the world

1513
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,911
Clips

1514
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,471
And again

1515
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,031
Ago when I

1516
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,079
Called for operation

1517
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:05,759
Freedom really fear that

1518
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
Yeah

1519
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,807
Now they're afraid

1520
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
The clip is from 50

1521
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,391
18 years ago

1522
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,439
They clearly haven't been that of

1523
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,463
Nope

1524
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:18,047
Not really I think maybe more just sort of like

1525
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,607
Annoyed until 7

1526
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,423
1976 starts to really be associated with

1527
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:26,751
Violin

1528
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:31,615
If you're talkin about 7076 in terms of like looking back on the founding of our country share

1529
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,175
Hey Anjo appreciating history

1530
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,967
I get it that's cool

1531
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,783
Becomes a rallying cry

1532
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,831
Like Alex uses it as right

1533
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
It starts to be

1534
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:43,647
Become something that is a little bit less

1535
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,975
I appreciate our country in the freedoms that it's based on

1536
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:51,327
And more we're going to do it again yeah it is a little bit like

1537
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:57,471
Most of us look back on 1776 and we imagine you know something and they look back on it

1538
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,287
In that imaginary way but in the spirit of the

1539
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,079
The true 1776

1540
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,151
Insofar as they're a bunch of slave-owning terrorist

1541
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,199
And that's kind of their their jam

1542
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,479
I also

1543
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,015
Like

1544
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,551
Stewart Rhodes

1545
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,087
Desperately just

1546
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,623
Wanted to be a

1547
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,927
F****** soldier in a revolution

1548
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,207
Yeah like that

1549
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,999
That's what he wanted to be and Eve

1550
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,279
Play that it for

1551
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,303
For quite a while

1552
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:25,631
Alex wants to be the guy who's like

1553
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,911
Yelling

1554
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:30,495
During the revolution

1555
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,287
And unfortunately

1556
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,311
Things of a rodent

1557
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,079
To the point where they

1558
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,871
They're kind of giving their wishes

1559
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,431
Civil War reenactors

1560
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,479
So look

1561
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:43,807
Alex Hales about 1776 or maybe an entire sect

1562
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:46,111
Fourth is

1563
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,439
76

1564
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:51,999
Is

1565
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:56,863
76

1566
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,423
You're either 1776

1567
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,215
Are your 1984

1568
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
Baby

1569
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,055
17

1570
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:09,919
All day long

1571
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,455
What

1572
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,063
Her boy

1573
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,343
So yeah it it's it's

1574
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:23,743
Weird it is you know that that thing that happens when you say a word over and over again it is its meaning

1575
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:29,631
What happened as I was listening to him yell 1770

1576
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,423
Also I really

1577
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,447
Really just

1578
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:35,519
Degree with a dichotomy of you can either be 1776

1579
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:38,335
1984

1580
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,615
90s guy I'm like

1581
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
The Gutenberg

1582
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:44,991
Bible Gaza 4022 guy because I live in

1583
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:49,599
The presence there is nothing else except this moment

1584
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,903
But there always was this moment of the past

1585
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,927
This is also this moment

1586
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:56,767
Oh no paradox

1587
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,815
Plural

1588
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,095
Betty White

1589
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,119
Jordan

1590
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,447
Alex Optical office

1591
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:09,567
I remember that vaguely about that a little bit at the beginning of the show

1592
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,103
I want of the reasons is

1593
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,919
Recovered it even though it's

1594
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,455
Obviously a desperate

1595
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,735
Publicity

1596
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,015
Is the things taken

1597
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,551
Call the 12th

1598
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,367
And

1599
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,391
Finger off

1600
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:26,975
No he basically just admits that this was a troll

1601
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,255
People

1602
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,047
Need you to bow down.

1603
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,095
They need you.

1604
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,911
They need you to go along with them

1605
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:38,495
Thousands of times that played the Corp

1606
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
Right

1607
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,103
On the Sunday show I was doing it

1608
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:51,807
This is archetype.

1609
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,831
This is satire

1610
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,855
Stop saying Ark

1611
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,415
Illustrative

1612
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,231
But if we could defeat

1613
01:19:59,487 --> 01:19:59,999
The New World Order

1614
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,303
Find me simply cutting a finger off

1615
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,119
Blood spilling

1616
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
Doing

1617
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:10,495
To show the listeners and viewers how much I have

1618
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,775
Appreciate them

1619
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,080
Willing to give up my body

1620
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
In the fight

1621
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,664
Why would I not

1622
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,736
Join the mafia

1623
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,832
He didn't even say that stuff you didn't say it was that tire

1624
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:28,160
Because he says that all the time

1625
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:34,560
So at no point did Alex say that what he was doing with threatening to cut off his finger was

1626
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,608
It was meant to get attention by trolling Tubidy

1627
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:43,264
It was really obvious to me that this was his goal because he's a transparent con man but if you were a person who liked his

1628
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,312
Show and thought he meant anything he said

1629
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:48,640
You would not take this as a publicity stunt or satire

1630
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,176
You would read this as an

1631
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:52,992
An expression of his sincere feelings of appreciation for the audience

1632
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,040
Sacrifice that he's willing to make

1633
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,576
The defeated imaginary items

1634
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:03,744
Obviously Alex was just trying to trick Publications with wider audiences than his into writing articles about him

1635
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,048
Misrepresented what he did

1636
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,144
Which is another example of how the media always lies about

1637
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,424
That's one

1638
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,984
Hammocks at play here too

1639
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:20,384
The first is that Alex probably knew that the January 6th committee was having their hearing on Tuesday and the topic of it at

1640
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,664
Announced as the connection

1641
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:26,016
Ministration extremist groups that Alex is deeply entwined with

1642
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:32,928
I don't think this is the case but I don't think it's impossible that Alex would try to do some kind of a media stock to attempt

1643
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,464
How to control the narrative is about him

1644
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:40,352
Do people be talking about him threatening to cut off his finger instead of his clear association with a bunch of really suspicious groups

1645
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,888
Score charged with seditious

1646
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,656
Conspiracy

1647
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,192
The second thing

1648
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,496
Is much less speculative and more

1649
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:49,312
Alex is trolling the media to get attention

1650
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,336
That is true

1651
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,128
But this Cuts both directions

1652
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:57,504
When Alex was talking about God and how he would cut off his finger as a tribute to his amazing audience

1653
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,088
He was also trolling his audience with his performance of sincerity

1654
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,160
That wasn't sincere at all but it was meant to be

1655
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,696
Experience as if it were

1656
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:10,816
Alex has gotten himself in a certain position where in order to pull off dump licity stunts like this

1657
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:14,400
You have to exploit the parasocial connection he has with his listeners

1658
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,960
And make them the ultimate butt of the joke

1659
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:20,288
Anyone wrote an article about this was playing into Alex's

1660
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:24,128
Plan but the real idiot here is anyone listen to Alex do his whole Act

1661
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,664
And took it to mean any

1662
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:29,760
Oz business model relies on a really uncomfortable intersection

1663
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:35,904
He needs to appear sincere enough to convince his audience that he would do something like cut his finger off so they can

1664
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,184
Feel that level of commit

1665
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,952
The fight

1666
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,232
Which is code for

1667
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,512
You need to give me money

1668
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:46,400
Essentially no access to any media that exposes his content

1669
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,424
To nuada

1670
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:52,544
His Radio reaches non-existent he's not allowed on YouTube or social media

1671
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,408
He can get his audience on banned. Video but those are people who are in the already

1672
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,944
They're already in the pool

1673
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,272
In order to Lorde new people into the web

1674
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:06,880
Do you need the audience to recruit or he needs to hijack other people's media

1675
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,440
Which is why going on Rogan is so important

1676
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,744
That's why he's heavily promoting this documentary

1677
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:15,328
NYU does s*** like pretending to be so committed to fighting the globalist

1678
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,608
So you cut his finger off

1679
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:19,168
Other people would write stories about him

1680
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,192
And tequila

1681
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,984
Get them talking about him

1682
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,312
In places you wouldn't be talking about otherwise we got high with Ty

1683
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,360
Alex's on the ship

1684
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,408
Before he's even threatened to cut off fingers

1685
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,944
Before because he's not that

1686
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,712
Creative

1687
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:35,808
It's pretty f***** up any of that big ass knife at Arm's Reach while he's doing his show though

1688
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,904
Very sad and I mean this from the bottom of my

1689
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:43,488
People need to ignore this kind of unless they're able or willing

1690
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,536
Discovery in its full context highlighting

1691
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,584
Desperate nature of these cries for attention

1692
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,632
Because here's the thing to remember

1693
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,192
Without anyone covering this.

1694
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,728
It's no longer a star

1695
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,288
It's just a sad loser threatening to cut off his

1696
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,080
His finger in front of his captive audience

1697
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,360
And no one caring

1698
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:01,152
That's the way it should be

1699
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,200
Because that's the reality of what this is

1700
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,480
Yeah yeah

1701
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,784
Yeah I hope those people feel bad

1702
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,320
Everybody involved

1703
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:14,720
Should feel at least a little bit of shame I really think that I understand what your job is but

1704
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:21,120
You should feel shame if you got at least by Alex Jones this bad don't know if it's actually that bad of a fleecing like I do

1705
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:26,752
Don't know if you saw that concrete of a game from that attention

1706
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:30,848
Didn't work out the way Alex wanted it

1707
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,152
Because here's what he had to do neck

1708
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,272
Mediaite

1709
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,576
All of them ran the story

1710
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,600
Last night today

1711
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,648
It's in thousands of Publications

1712
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,720
Is mentally ill

1713
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:48,512
Finger off

1714
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,048
Manisha

1715
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:51,840
No I said

1716
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,960
Joseph

1717
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,544
We cut the balls off

1718
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:04,384
In the UK and European 11 Canada New Zealand Australia

1719
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:05,920
You're old

1720
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:08,736
Because the government convinces them there a girl

1721
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:11,040
Little boy has their penis cut off

1722
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,624
Penises

1723
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,696
I'm going to get up right now

1724
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,256
I'm going to cut my penis off

1725
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,864
That would be stunning and brave

1726
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,888
Alex

1727
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:29,728
Continue on from his finger cutting thing into his normal transphobic bulshit

1728
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,752
He just took some

1729
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,520
Calls

1730
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,080
This is just Alex attempting to escalate the police

1731
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
The Beast.

1732
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:39,456
He's high on pulling off that first one so he's trying to double down and apparently no one

1733
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,480
I'm scared this time

1734
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:44,064
This is legitimate lie like a kid getting a bunch of attention

1735
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:49,184
For eating a bug trying to get more attention by eating a bigger bug and then too late

1736
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:53,280
The people really aren't into watching people eat bugs they were just laughing at him

1737
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,560
And now the joke has run its

1738
01:25:54,816 --> 01:26:00,448
Of course Novelty Ohio

1739
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,984
I'm a say this too much

1740
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:05,056
I am special and this episode but this is absolutely pathetic

1741
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,872
It's so transparent A desperate in this one work

1742
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:11,456
So poorly headline on his website

1743
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:13,248
Alex now threatens to cut his pee

1744
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,552
Penis off

1745
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:16,832
Adult

1746
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:20,160
It's been a long time since I thought about

1747
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,440
Kafka's the hunger art

1748
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,744
But I am really getting that Vibe here

1749
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,512
Except

1750
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:28,352
In kafka's way he was kind of turning it into a sort of noble situation

1751
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:31,424
You know suffering for ones

1752
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:37,824
It's a little bit different but if he'd cut his finger off then I would actually go with it yeah

1753
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,104
Text drops that I couldn't play it

1754
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,128
The beginning of the show

1755
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,176
I'm going to cut my penis off

1756
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,200
Here's the other one

1757
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,248
Penis

1758
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:52,928
Those are to be sampled again sooner or later

1759
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,464
Technocrat is going to hear that

1760
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,256
Boy

1761
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:02,656
Anyway this is all just nonsense that he transitions into

1762
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,936
The publicity stunt

1763
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:04,960
Detention

1764
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,752
Theoretically gained from it

1765
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:07,776
I've been trying to reach

1766
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:13,152
Contextualize the whole idea of cutting off his finger versus cutting off his

1767
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:13,920
Is dick

1768
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,968
I'm going to get up right now

1769
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,528
I'm going to cut my penis off

1770
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,832
Would be

1771
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:23,136
Host

1772
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,208
What I say I'll

1773
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,744
Cut my finger off

1774
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,048
To show you how much I appreciate you

1775
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,120
And a flip-out

1776
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
Oh my God

1777
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,104
Liberal

1778
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,920
But Joan says

1779
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,224
You cut my finger off

1780
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,464
Call Ironman

1781
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:04,352
Oh no not you know I'll do it so

1782
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:09,216
Is a child trying to impress

1783
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,240
Absolutely

1784
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:16,640
Hey man you know it I'm that kind of crazy dude that's why you keep me around

1785
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:19,200
It's so desperate but like

1786
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,224
The desperation

1787
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:24,064
Really the reason that it hits that nerve or whatever is

1788
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,648
Is because the desperation is covering up the reality that know you would

1789
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,512
Absolutely not and we know it I don't care whether you cut your finger off or not

1790
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,536
It's D

1791
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:38,656
Beef cutting your finger off is a way of discussing your ultimate commitment

1792
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,936
Do this fake cause

1793
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,472
That's right that you've dedicated your life

1794
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,264
You're not really that committed

1795
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,568
Nothing to do with whether or not you cut your finger off

1796
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,896
All you have is anybody called you

1797
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:50,176
You make me very sad

1798
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,456
You know I do it

1799
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,480
You know I do it

1800
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:53,760
Hold me back

1801
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,784
Colby-Jack

1802
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,624
I'll be back if I if you guys were holding me I would cut his finger off

1803
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,648
Totally

1804
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,208
So we have one last night but I was talking about

1805
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,488
Cutting his dick off

1806
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,304
So it's all over the news

1807
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,096
Associated Press is everywhere

1808
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,120
Jones

1809
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,400
What About Us

1810
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,384
Oh my God

1811
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,152
But it was

1812
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:29,600
Little children's balls and penis has been cut off is good

1813
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:32,416
Carrabba's bad which way is it

1814
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:37,792
Nice illustration of how Alex teaches is audience to accept incorporate bad thinking pattern

1815
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,072
A relationship with

1816
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:39,840
Information

1817
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,656
The purposes of this explanation

1818
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:46,752
I'm going to translate Alex saying supporting cutting kids balls off to me

1819
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,544
Supporting trans people existing

1820
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,568
Because that's what he's talk

1821
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:56,736
He's framing is disgusting a defensive but at the end of the day he's not literally talking about cutting peoples balls off he's talked about any

1822
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,784
Any kind of trans affirming activity

1823
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:02,624
When understood of the proper context is dichotomy makes no sense

1824
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,952
It's not a matter of not being able to have it both ways

1825
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,232
These are unrelated

1826
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,512
Good things

1827
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:11,328
Easily support trans rights and also think that I was probably

1828
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,400
Shouldn't cut his finger off

1829
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,680
Reason that

1830
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:19,776
Interesting start was cutting your finger off is because people who are unfamiliar could be like

1831
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:22,848
Maybe that guy is crazy enough to actually cut his finger off

1832
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,384
There is that level of

1833
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:30,784
Perhaps it's in the possibility of possible rain and also I don't think anybody was like oh Alex is bad

1834
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:37,440
For cutting his finger off or he shouldn't cut his finger I don't think I'm cut his finger off

1835
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,464
Honestly I think ever

1836
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,000
Everybody who saw that headline

1837
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,816
And has any familiarity with him to be like

1838
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:47,936
No not this ends with no finger everybody's time

1839
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:50,496
For sure so look me up a larger picture is it

1840
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,776
No I was saying I was

1841
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:52,544
Shouldn't cut off a

1842
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,312
Finger

1843
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:57,408
The media article that this was that was what the root of this is basically

1844
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:01,504
It's just a transcript of what Alex said on his Sunday show with this little intro

1845
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,064
Controversial radio host Alex Jones

1846
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,624
Took an alarming route when making an impact

1847
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,928
Speech about his appreciation towards his audience

1848
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,232
That's fair

1849
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,512
Yeah weird

1850
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,072
Google is it cut your finger off it's alarming

1851
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,352
Jeff said he had a knife

1852
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:20,960
There that is alarming but also that's how you know is a pre-planned dumb stunts

1853
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:26,336
I actually choose to believe that that night is always there

1854
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:30,176
That's fair I just underneath the skull

1855
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,712
Think that there is something

1856
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:34,272
Weird about this predictable

1857
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,296
And sad

1858
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:38,880
The way that I was just trying to make transphobic lemonade

1859
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:39,904
Out of this

1860
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,696
You know it it's

1861
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,488
It's it's

1862
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,024
What's

1863
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,304
What's what it is

1864
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,120
What it is is just that point that you made it

1865
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:49,888
Trans people

1866
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,656
Existing

1867
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:56,032
He's using this kind of example as a way of making it

1868
01:31:56,288 --> 01:32:00,384
Visceral thing for people who don't have any trans people in their Library

1869
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,432
Always brand

1870
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:05,760
Your kids balls off it's something that's like

1871
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,064
Disgusting

1872
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,832
Anybody

1873
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,904
But doesn't mean like oh if this actually happened

1874
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,696
If somebody says they're trans

1875
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:18,304
That's what he's going to assuming that's what is priming is audience to assume and that's the

1876
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,584
That's just exist

1877
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,400
I'm let swimming be totally clear about something

1878
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,216
Is there were trans

1879
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:25,984
Person

1880
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,800
Oh they're doing the radio show and they said

1881
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,568
I'm going

1882
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,104
Going to cut my dick off on air

1883
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:34,688
ABI would be upset by that

1884
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:38,528
No even if they said I'm going to cut my dick off during the

1885
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:42,112
The commercial break that would be upset I just I mean

1886
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:44,416
Unsanitary

1887
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:49,280
Adapt that's not the surgery either it's not a f****** nice

1888
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:54,400
It's not like they put an iPhone a hot plate and then they're like well we got to solve this problem

1889
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:56,960
Alex take some calls

1890
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,264
After this

1891
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,824
Has come to a close here

1892
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,408
This color is a little bit confused I can clear it up

1893
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,480
25

1894
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,504
With a lot of people

1895
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:12,320
Early College especially they just don't care

1896
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,856
They don't care what

1897
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:18,208
I'm wearing a shirt

1898
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,304
It's usually the only people that

1899
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,888
Respond so I was thinking maybe we should like

1900
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,960
Megafon live video or Patriots you know

1901
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
Just blast

1902
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,032
Highlights of Infowars clips

1903
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,056
Out in public

1904
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:37,664
Some areas young people are awake

1905
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,224
Younger people been talk to me

1906
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,016
Jellyfish to not care

1907
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:44,064
Yeah if young people that are the problem

1908
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,112
No

1909
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,392
Is almost entirely

1910
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,416
Cold

1911
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:53,024
The new young people are responding well to do yourself

1912
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,048
Because young people

1913
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,584
Don't buy into this

1914
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,864
Load of s***

1915
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:01,472
And the solution is not to force everyone in public to listen to

1916
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:04,032
To Alex's insane disgusting Rambo

1917
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:07,360
Yeah I appreciate anybody who can

1918
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,128
Find

1919
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,152
A

1920
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:09,920
Soul

1921
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,456
Boiled down

1922
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,736
Cause and effect

1923
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:13,504
Problem

1924
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,784
And still with

1925
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,832
You know that is there

1926
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:23,232
So many times where everything is confusing there's so much information that doesn't necessarily have a have any of

1927
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:26,304
Effect on things but you feel like it does there's so much nuance

1928
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,328
You're not sure what you're supposed

1929
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,376
But every now and again something is

1930
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:33,728
Boiled down to so simple that it's a yes or no question like a real

1931
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,520
Solid binary

1932
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,056
And he's still with

1933
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,592
Amazed

1934
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,872
Amazing

1935
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:43,968
I like that the solution is just like well people don't like him for

1936
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:49,088
Let's force them to listen thought process that's exactly what he is

1937
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:50,112
Taught you to think

1938
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:55,488
Now people are not watching the panda video down and prop their eyes open

1939
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:03,680
It does Alex does presented in the Innocence though of like

1940
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,472
You're doing

1941
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:11,616
Good these people are are it's not that they don't want to listen

1942
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,152
Right

1943
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:15,968
Get that moment then they're automatically convert

1944
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:16,992
Not like

1945
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:20,064
If you play this at high-volume people are going to attack you

1946
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,112
Sooner or later there will be an attack

1947
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:22,880
Packed out

1948
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:26,464
The 25 year-old lamenting

1949
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,792
Jerk with Alex Jones isn't more popular

1950
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:37,984
This rally and I'm surrounded by Nazis I really don't know why there's so many Nazis at this rally

1951
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,776
So crazy

1952
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:40,544
Is

1953
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,872
I mean I've been to that I've been bummed out by some of these calls so far

1954
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,200
It's called bums me out on a visceral level

1955
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,016
Josh Josh

1956
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,112
You for taking my call

1957
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,904
It's a real honor to be on

1958
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:56,672
Michelle

1959
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,696
But

1960
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,488
But I really wanted to talk about

1961
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,536
Was Klaus Schwab

1962
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:02,816
And how he is

1963
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,352
Making masks

1964
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,912
And his little

1965
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:07,936
Mind game offense

1966
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,240
And I'm just

1967
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,008
Not going to

1968
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:11,776
Stanford

1969
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,592

Black beautiful Josh how did you find the show and what do you want to say to

Millions of people right now

01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,208
I found it because my dad watches it

1975
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,256
Interesting

1976
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,536

I don't even know but

1980
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,496
I just really wanted to get that off

1981
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,800
Call Schwab

1982
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,080
Making of

1983
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:46,848
Making us

Car shops making us

1986
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,016
Puppets in his little mind

Is in fifth

1988
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:59,392
Great when I was 11 the main the main villain was f****** Shredder

1989
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:05,792
Okay letter is a problem is not a problem dr. Wily

1990
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:08,864
Years old

1991
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,448
Outlook

1992
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,776
It's it's it hurts your brand if you're Alex

1993
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:17,312
And you say

1994
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,616
I appreciate the call I can't talk to an 11 year old

1995
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:22,432
You're not you don't have the intellectual maturity or just be

1996
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:25,248
Like you can't possibly process the information that

1997
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:27,040
Is being put forth on the show

1998
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:30,368
He has a responsibility to do something like that

1999
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:34,208
He can't take a call from an 11 year old is complaining about clothes Swap and be like all this is

2000
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:34,976
Beautiful

2001
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:39,072
An eleven-year-old doesn't know what the world economic forum is

2002
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:42,400
11 year old probably has difficulty understanding

2003
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:44,704
Other countries forms of

2004
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,984
What you say

2005
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,544
It's not even it's not even just that maybe

2006
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,360
He does know that those things are at

2007
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:54,176
Nothing but the ability to comprehend

2008
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:59,552
Woody's that they exist in the ecosystem that all this around this is impossible

2009
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,576
And you can even

2010
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:04,672
Hear that in the concrete way that he's expressing total this is a line

2011
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,976
Klaus Schwab is making us puppets

2012
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:08,512
It's in his little mind game

2013
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:11,072
That is a concrete sentence that he is either

2014
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,608
He's repeating

2015
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:14,656
Or is the way that he's able

2016
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,424
To save it

2017
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,496
There is an abstraction around the ideas

2018
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:21,312
It's really really f****** inappropriate

2019
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:24,640
I feel bad for this kid and

2020
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:30,528
Remember the other content that's going on in this episode Alex just got done talking about I was going to cut his dick off

2021
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:37,184
This is not okay for 11 year olds to be listening I mean it really does feel

2022
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,208
If it was our show

2023
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,232
That we

2024
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,280
It's okay call from 11 my first

2025
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:44,864
Hey excuse me tell your parents never to let you listen to the show

2026
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,168
Maybe when you're an adult and you can make your own

2027
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,704
Choices but otherwise

2028
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,984
I'm mad

2029
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:54,080
You should go spank your parents that is what we should be doing right here

2030
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:57,408
Inverse banking my childhood should come full circle

2031
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,224
Nah

2032
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:04,832
So we won last call here and this guy

2033
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,392
Daddy is about Georgia

2034
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,184
Wanted to let you know

2035
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,000
Smoke and mirrors

2036
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,024
We got stuff

2037
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
Still

2038
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:17,888
The Albertson Granite Association Vice Pres

2039
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:22,752
Albertsons mayor Daniel Craig

2040
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:23,520
Your name

2041
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,288
Yes you can

2042
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,336
Yes you can

2043
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,456
1 years

2044
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:35,296
Again

2045
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:39,136
The governing Authority dollar King County's who owns that land

2046
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,928
Downey weather

2047
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,696
And tell them

2048
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:44,256
Capri bill that's literally all it would take

2049
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:48,608
But the reason that they're saying that is intact on the community and the reason they would want to rebuild it is

2050
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,144
Of course because it brought a ton

2051
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:51,680
Of traffic

2052
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,704
To the area

2053
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,568
Business to the local

2054
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,384
Accounted for a lot of the town's Revenue

2055
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:03,968
Quite frankly I don't know why anybody else is going to Elberton

2056
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:04,736
George

2057
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,808
So there would be very high motive

2058
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,344
4 people

2059
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,368
To rebuild them

2060
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,464
I did not suspicious at all today

2061
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:18,304
Based on his whole presentation of like this isn't the right thing to do

2062
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,168
Chuckling when he says that can't wait for someone to blow them up again

2063
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:25,984
I'm right

2064
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,848
Yeah but

2065
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,872
Kind of like

2066
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:32,896
So

2067
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,176
Political terrorism

2068
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,480
You're trying to intimidate a group that occurs

2069
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:37,504
Sure

2070
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,528
This

2071
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,064
He's trying to intimidate the global

2072
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:40,832
Right

2073
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:43,392
This is an imaginary group that does not have

2074
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:44,416
Exist

2075
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,464
Is it is difficult to intimidate

2076
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,232
San Jose

2077
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:49,536
That is currently very difficult

2078
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,304
To do

2079
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,096
I mean

2080
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,912
I would argue if I were lawyer

2081
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:55,936
Normally

2082
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,472
Normally I'm against

2083
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,752
This however

2084
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,776
If if

2085
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,616
We can eliminate all of our other conversations

2086
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:07,200
And turn just the Georgia Guidestones

2087
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:09,504
Into the ultimate proxy war

2088
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,040
Between conservative ism

2089
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,832
And progressivism

2090
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:14,624
Just never ending

2091
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:20,000
Arms race to build and destroy those very still while the rest of us get to live our lives

2092
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,536
I think I'll be great

2093
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,584
But I don't think the progressives have

2094
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:29,984
An interest in rebuilding them in Elberton done

2095
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:39,712
It'll be a war between the Elberton Business Association

2096
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,760
And conspiracy weirdo

2097
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:45,856
Yeah that is the problem with my plan

2098
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:50,976
You could make it a proxy war and that we are at siding with Alberton and they're siding with

2099
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,280
Discount america

2100
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:57,632
Plus Albertsons

2101
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:59,424
Of the other side is in prison

2102
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,704
Right round

2103
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,264
Jefferson Davis

2104
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,544
This is Dad so he can't come back

2105
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,640
About his ancestors are still alive

2106
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:13,504
Come to the end of this and I think Alex heard you yell

2107
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,528
Cut his dick off

2108
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:17,088
To literally

2109
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:19,648
It's becoming a more common

2110
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:21,440
Rallycross

2111
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:25,024
This is a bummer I mean Lord is a real bummer

2112
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:30,400
This is not like on the level of some of the other

2113
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,192
Publicity stunt

2114
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:34,752
That have worked in Alex's advantage

2115
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:37,824
Some of the other ones we've seen

2116
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,360
Obviously was like

2117
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:43,200
Call Mike

2118
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,736
You should have better instinct

2119
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:48,064
Because of the the nature of

2120
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:48,832
Giving

2121
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:49,856
You will

2122
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:50,880
To this

2123
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:53,184
Exposure fire

2124
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,232
Needs to operate

2125
01:42:55,744 --> 01:43:00,352
Without the artificial inflation from people

2126
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,376
Posting

2127
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:04,704
These little videos and talking about him cutting his finger off

2128
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,984
Without all that

2129
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,264
It's a

2130
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,800
Publicity stunt without a stock

2131
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:09,568
It's just

2132
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:12,896
Us going look at how sad this is

2133
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:13,664
And that's

2134
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,432
Great

2135
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:20,320
For the world that's the best way to do it yeah you know what wasn't like a big cycle on Twitter

2136
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:23,136
Alex throwing a hatchet at a camera on Christmas Eve

2137
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:26,976
That's good clean fun

2138
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:29,280
I demanded okay

2139
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,072
Here's here's my

2140
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,608
Demand of the media

2141
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,632
Okay alright

2142
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:34,912
The next

2143
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,192
Time Alex threatened

2144
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,472
To cut anything off

2145
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:42,336
Everybody publishes one article on every page which is just

2146
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:45,664
If you don't cut that off will never talk about you again

2147
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,712
Yeah that's that's

2148
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,736
Steaks on there

2149
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:51,296
I don't care I don't care if he does or doesn't

2150
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:57,696
But somebody eventually has to decide okay or every headline has to include Alex

2151
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:58,464
Engages in a

2152
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:01,024
Pathetic 100%

2153
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:07,168
Yeah Tim in the headline every chance you get

2154
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,960
A upsetting

2155
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:13,312
Fairy thing

2156
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:17,408
Really wants people to look at him if you know it's a publicity stunt

2157
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,176
Then York

2158
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:18,944
Play sit in it

2159
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:26,112
That's just the truth because your headline cookie but instead of

2160
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:30,464
I suggest that there are some people who still don't quite understand fully

2161
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,256
You are not

2162
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:35,072
Knowingly playing into these.

2163
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,888
I would just wish that everybody who's in a position to

2164
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:38,912
You put out an article

2165
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:42,496
Would learn that lesson is that

2166
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,032
So this oxygen

2167
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,080
Feed this publicity fire

2168
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,872
Won't be there anymore

2169
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:49,920
And it'll just be sad Alex drunk

2170
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:51,712
Only throwing hatchets on Christmas Eve

2171
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:53,248
And we can all have a good time

2172
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:58,880
Oh man I hate it when are solutions always come back to learning and the woohoo that's not good

2173
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:00,672
There's four ways to

2174
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:06,048
That is true none of them are listening to us apparently apparently not

2175
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:08,864
Indeed but until then

2176
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:11,424
Before we do it.

2177
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:16,032
There's also some controversial

2178
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:21,920
Reviews on the movie Summer on the GoFundMe

2179
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:28,320
