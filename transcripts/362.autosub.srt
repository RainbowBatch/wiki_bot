1
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

2
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,832
College vype.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,744
Everybody

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,352
Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,424
What was the last Halloween

7
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,472
Costume you wore unironically

8
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,032
With Aurora

9
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
Pure joy you do not like an adult. I like the note it's like I'm just going to The Regular Guy

10
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,968
I don't like that kind of thing I'm talking

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
You know I dress

12
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
Set up as a ninja turtle and

13
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
My f****** loved

14
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,208
I probably talked about this in the past but I have a problem with over-committing

15
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,536
Two things like that a guy Halloween costumes always been a problem for me

16
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,888
Because I'll just go too far with it the big time there was sort of like the break

17
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
Chicken point for me

18
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,216
Was I went as a monk

19
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
1-year okay and I shaved a circle on the top of my head around the side

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
And I went around with a jug of Carlo Rossi

21
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
So your party

22
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,552
And maybe people take drink

23
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
Eggs when they did things that were again

24
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
The social order

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,232
A blessed people who were behaving well and everything

26
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,120
The character super drunk the next morning I woke up with a

27
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,936
Terrible hangover I walked into the bathroom and like oh my

28
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
My head

29
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
It was

30
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:26,176
Gatorade and a hat just like that

31
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:31,040
Just are walking away like happy Halloween you know what's up

32
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:36,160
Yeah but that was when I was probably I don't know

33
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
Early 20

34
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
I don't. So I don't really

35
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,792
I don't really get into that too much

36
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
Care for the Halloween

37
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
Not really a Halloween guy

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,008
Any good ones when you were can you trick or treated right you were super pour like growing up my parents

39
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,408
Make our own costumes and we weren't very crafty so I know there was nothing no there's nothing good

40
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
The only time I got to eat candy in my entire childhood around Halloween and

41
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,624
Candies good but it's just a sheet

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,952
You're wearing you know Alexa

43
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,024
What can you do with cardboard

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
It could do that much

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,864
The memories are good

46
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
Sandy was good at Candy's

47
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
Except that what those want those Taffy's

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Just come in like

49
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
Rob Brown

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,688
And orange oh yeah it was like a labeled

51
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
Piles of garbage

52
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
And that

53
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Candy corn sucks

54
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,064
I don't know why there's like a

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Vishnu

56
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:43,232
Effort to rehab the image of candy corn dog on

57
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
Over in his grave right

58
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Is he dead

59
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,400
I feel like there's a effort that I'm seeing online

60
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
This year more than

61
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
Pastors to be like

62
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
F*** you I like candy corn candy corn stop making me feel bad for it

63
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:00,896
Polaroid

64
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Polarisation

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,784
I don't like the idea of like if you like

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
But I don't feel like we need to feel bad for not liking it and

67
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,952
Declaring the objective fact that it stinks

68
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
That's my position

69
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,815
I thought that was one thing that was the last thing the America

70
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
Can people could real iCarly YouTube or

71
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:27,007
No that's not no Americas

72
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
Record to own the libs

73
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:34,687
I do appreciate though that it hasn't yet extended to attempting to vainstream

74
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
The pumpkin

75
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
Yeah I know that would never have

76
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,671
Did accept candy corn in a tiny little thing but not that big

77
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
Bulbous

78
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Pumpkin

79
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,071
I don't know too much about dressing up for Halloween anymore

80
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
But I do know a lot about Alex Jones

81
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,399
And I don't know anything about either

82
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,727
Is correct and today is actually a spooky Halloween

83
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,847
That's not a fair way though

84
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:08,991
I want earlier this week where I just felt like I was kind of not interested in

85
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
I needed to take a break

86
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
And so I was thinking about a great week

87
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
It embarked on this Coast

88
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
Coast AM

89
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,255
Do a lot of s*** about wacky

90
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,815
Crazy paranormal topics

91
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,143
But that was like okay forever year-round Halloween they do ghosts

92
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
To go well

93
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Ghost ghost ghost

94
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
I don't blame them

95
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
To close

96
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
Right but a lot of that is just taken

97
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
Calls from people have ghosts

98
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,735
And I don't really want to make fun of that cuz as much as we

99
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,807
You know can focus on George Noory and some of this

100
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
Like toxic platforming

101
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
But he does I don't want to spend a ton of times being like look at these dumb College

102
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
Crystalline

103
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
I've liked what I think is probably a

104
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
Acceptable for us

105
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
Talkingshit about the colors over so I can the other guys talking then yeah we're kind of that song

106
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
Is politics

107
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
And some of the city stands for

108
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
Possible

109
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087
Maybe not maybe not something I'm going to do but possible

110
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
Household are you didn't have to

111
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
Search out a collar

112
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
Ghost seems like now that's a non-starter

113
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
But like

114
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
We could do that

115
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
I found something

116
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
I found a notch

117
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
To go into

118
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
I'm pretty excited about it

119
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Here is not a contact drop

120
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
In the case of the mermen

121
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
There's a lot of

122
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,663
People eyewear misunderstanding it in

123
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Oh yeah

124
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503

Something to go over that I might have something to do with the Birdman but it actually does not

161
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
A little bit of sound issues on our last couple episodes

162
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
We are shifting up some of the recording

00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
Is we are going over

188
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Episode

189
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
Of

190
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Kevin Moore

191
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,031
So Kevin more for those of you who have not kept up with

192
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Tire projects

193
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
Camelot Saga

194
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
Is a gentleman

195
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
And who believes he can Channel

196
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Intelligences

197
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
Maybe maybe aliens

198
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
Maybe other dimensional beings who knows

199
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
He does not have

200
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
How to do

201
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
He's absolutely doesn't have to do with

202
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
Boys because they have confidence in him

203
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
He also runs a psychic hotline

204
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,655
Probably I'm not sure

205
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:20,031
He runs a psychic hotline and he has decided that Kerry Cassidy over Project Camelot

206
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
And Mark Richards are running a scam and so he is in the process of putting out a document

207
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
Country about how about Richards is a murderer

208
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
And he is not hung out with raptor alien

209
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,367
And this is all very delightful

210
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,951
Is furious at him and has decided he's a part of the game Mafia

211
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,255
Mortal enemy

212
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,863
Probably involved with the Illuminati on sublevel to discredit Mark Richards

213
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
Right is friends

214
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
The space Raptors

215
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,519
And they're trying to help yumanity against the Illuminati it's all very complex

216
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Yeah

217
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Anyway I

218
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
I know that we were shifting away from Prague

219
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Hot stuff

220
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
But I can't

221
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Not be

222
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Intrigued by this mystery

223
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
It's surrounding it

224
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
And one of the big things that I find

225
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Mysterious is

226
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
Why is Kevin Moore doing this

227
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:14,815
Good question we talked about it it's supposed to be money it's got to be money but I don't understand why he would get it at

228
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,239
Mentioning himself in such a way as to be like a critical voice

229
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:28,639
I am within this paranormal community and I'm offended by these charlatans

230
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,943
He's like Kerry Cassidy

231
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,039
They make us look bad and that is what the voice

232
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,367
But I am channeling right now aren't telling me

233
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
And you

234
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Break so I feel like

235
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,487
I want to understand a little bit better

236
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
This guy right

237
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
Trying to think

238
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
Take that as

239
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
The his motivation that he wants to be

240
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
A thorough GateKeeper

241
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Hey I'm a trusted voice

242
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
I'm going to say this is

243
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
School

244
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
So I know

245
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
Look around a little bit

246
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
He's going to be a Spaceman

247
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
You know what

248
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
Because it's honestly because my

249
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Rhythms are all complete

250
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
We we f***** up

251
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
With my YouTube

252
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,231
I got suggested a video that he did about time traveler

253
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Of course you did so

254
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,351
Of course you did I figured he did do some stuff about ghosts

255
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,679
Like channeling dead relatives

256
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Kind of feels

257
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
Greeley yeah

258
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
Death is not going to be fun

259
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311

260
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359

So here is the introduction

268
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
The Kevin Moorehead

269
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:53,631
He's talking to a guy who runs a website or it gets the YouTube channel called Apex

270
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:59,263
And he is on video and he is just almost completely obscured facial

271
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
On purpose

272
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,151

303
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
The alarm

304
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,959
I do appreciate that caveat there you got to make up your own mind on this one

305
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:06,079
If I'm going to be completely clear with you Jordan I like this episode is a little bit bent

306
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
Okay

307
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:13,759
There's really nothing complicated going on nothing to adapt there's no real like a lower to sort out or anyting

308
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,879
The subject at the heart of this episode

309
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Yet

310
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
There's no floor

311
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,767
Yeah I have bad news about to start driving

312
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,351
Took the subject at the heart of this episode is this YouTube channel called Apex

313
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,959
The channels run by an anonymous guy who appears on camera wearing a hat

314
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,055
Big sunglasses and headphones with his head mostly behind a big microphone

315
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
They mostly post videos by people who claim that their time

316
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,223
I don't want to make people wanting super clear right off the bat

317
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
I'm not mad at anyone for engaging in online immersive

318
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,391
I know a lot of people really enjoy the titillation of stuff like that

319
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,207
You know the clearly fake stories presented as truth

320
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,047
And I don't necessarily believe that a lot of people who take in this kind of entertainment

321
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
Actually believe the things that they're watching

322
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
Just kind of fun

323
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
It's not my

324
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,543
But I'm not going to spend a lot of my energy judging someone for liking that kind of entertainment

325
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,335
Another extension of that I'm not go

326
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Don't spend too much of my time card

327
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
The person who creates that kind of

328
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Themselves

329
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,807
To the extent this is just a YouTube channel that lets people send them videos where they pretend to

330
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
3 time travels

331
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Travelers which they then

332
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Post and make

333
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Money off of

334
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
I'm not going to make too big a deal out

335
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,791
I'm not going to get all like I self-righteous about that

336
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,095
Yeah I'm going to go with this one's fun

337
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,679
Tell me that there's some secret racial animus beneath it

338
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
I don't know I don't know if that's the case

339
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Okay

340
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
There is a difference though because

341
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Between that

342
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
Kind of thing

343
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
And you know like online immersive

344
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
Eviction and a hoax

345
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,991
I'm not quite sure exactly what the difference is but it's something I wanted

346
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
Explorer with a corset

347
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
This episode

348
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,903
The only reason I'm even doing this episode at all is because like I said I needed a break from Alex

349
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
And my YouTube

350
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
S***'s f*****

351
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
And it accidentally revealed this episode

352
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
David Kevin Morris

353
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,631
Time travel guys I got to listen to this

354
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,935
So I did and here we are

355
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,495
It's completely blocked up

356
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
These characters in mine

357
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,895
He's got to put out that documentary about and I feel like that will be the

358
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
Alright bet I feel like that will be

359
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
What is it

360
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:26,367
Third Act of our projects

361
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
High tide

362
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
Just my two cents

363
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
I don't think he's ever going to a

364
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
If he's smart he probably will

365
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
Some of those like trailers that he has a

366
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,471
It's clear he is getting interviews of a lot of people like a lot of work.

367
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
CC

368
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:48,639
Anyway apextv started out with your standard-bearer of paranormal clickbait videos

369
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Headlines like

370
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
10 haunted dolls caught on

371
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,015
Okay I like it

372
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,575
It wasn't really successful Enterprise

373
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,623
Since there's a lot of competition in the

374
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Videos mark

375
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,047
Then in September 2016 someone sent apextv an email claiming to be a time traveler

376
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
From 21

377
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,655
This guy agreed to film himself talking about time

378
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:16,287
Apextv posted it and over 1.5 million people have watched that video ever set

379
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,359
Really can't be traits crazy I really don't like that

380
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,991
I want to go back to 10 f****** haunted dolls that are real

381
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
Yeah

382
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
Shirt and then

383
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,927
They claim they got contacted by another time traveler who told them that he

384
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Holborn.

385
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Define

386
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
NSYNC had flooded

387
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,887
He tried to fix it

388
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,703
I had to crawl inside the cabinet and as I did so

389
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
I discovered

390
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
Continue

391
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
So I kept on crawling

392
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
Further and further into

393
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
To the cabinet at the end of the tunnel I saw a light

394
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
And when I got there

395
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
I realize

396
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
I was in the future

397
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:59,807
Okay John Malkovich situation

398
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
I love that

399
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,159
So he caught this guy claimed that he traveled to 2042

400
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,975
Read met be 72 year old version of himself

401
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,071
He proved this with the video he shot with his older self

402
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Sorry

403
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,727
If you watch a video they both seem to be taking this whole thing it's dry

404
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,847
Put their arms around each other smiling like not freaking out at all of that time ripples

405
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,407
Well one of them knew we was going to be there eventually

406
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
The other one is fine

407
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
Good point I guess you would have to

408
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
That explains their blase attitude

409
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,719
Baby I met you a while back so they both shows they have the same

410
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
Tattoo on their forearm

411
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
But honestly that makes me believe this either

412
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Unless

413
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,143
This dude is supposed to be 40 years older and his tattoo looks

414
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
Just as fresh as the one on his younger self also it looks slightly bigger in size and the positioning on the arm does

415
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,615
It look identical but who knows that could just be shoddy camera and

416
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,711
Looks like you just solved the case of the mermaid I didn't mean to

417
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,527
Cuz in reality the video of this guy whose name is

418
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
The cotton orchid

419
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,903
It was actually a viral marketing campaign created to promote the pension plan

420
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:12,255
Sold by the Swedish insurance company AMF

421
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,423
I want

422
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,847
What is it that pension plans are doing better commercials that anything that we've got going on here as I understand

423
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:33,247
Stand at the advertising campaign was meant to be like you can feel secure about your older self

424
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,647
It all makes perfect sense the moment you described it as an atom like no I got it all.

425
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695
Stop is a time traveler by

426
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
These guys over at the Apex TV

427
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,911
Matter you know that it's all clearly like bulshit 5 million

428
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,519
Everybody everybody wins except I guess

429
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,591
Oh yeah Provident reportable

430
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,479
YouTube viral

431
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,135
To the extent that anyone knows that it was a viral campaign

432
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:18,047
It might not have had the follow-through that you need to keep / Swedish insurance plans but

433
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
Are also in the Swedish

434
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
But whatever the case

435
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
You got these two incidents

436
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:31,871
You know you were making these listicles and it's doing whatever traffic if you doing you got one time traveler

437
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
1 million

438
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
And plus reviews

439
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,735
Swedish insurance commercial presented as time-traveling

440
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:43,135
2.5 million views in later but that is

441
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
Time travel is what you do

442
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,279
So from there the channels just put a tons of videos featuring people who are claiming to be Thai

443
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,119
Many other stories are contradictory but that's okay

444
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,983
Because apextv wants you to decide whether or not these people should be believed

445
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
It's the standard paranormal

446
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Outlet line

447
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
I'm just passing along the information

448
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
You get to choose

449
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Believe it or not

450
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:11,295
And I think that's where the Victoria pot policy is floppy an idiotic but whatever the world has room for sloppy idiots

451
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,367
As long as they're not actively creating this content then

452
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Tending their just passing it along

453
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
It's all just kind of been good fun

454
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,512
What is Ripley's Believe It or Not except for you

455
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Really

456
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
It's embarrassing

457
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:28,448
For Kevin Moore to be interviewing this guy I'm not taking no more critical stance then we will see

458
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
By the time that they have their interview

459
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,640
It came out that the person apextv was suggesting was a real time traveler was just an insurance

460
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
If Kevin's trying to Rebrand

461
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
Himself is the guy who calls out frauds in the

462
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Community like marker

463
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Richards

464
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
Is a good place

465
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:50,976
Work that muscle a little bit real Prime opportunity

466
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
I mean

467
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Ears ears

468
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
Quickest

469
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
And dirtiest way of figuring out

470
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
That

471
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,496
The Time Traveler's giving an interview

472
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
To you

473
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
So

474
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
He is not actually a time frame

475
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,968
Very simple talking to Kevin is the time traveler himself okay

476
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,296
I apologize to all the time

477
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,624
Stave time traveler situation

478
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Of course

479
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,488
Yeah so you might ask yourself how did the

480
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
This interview,

481
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
How did

482
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Kevin

483
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,096
Hooked up with the guy who talks

484
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
The time travel

485
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
Maya probably at some point during this process

486
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752
With that thank you for contact

487
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
When you did

488
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
I really appreciate that

489
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,944
That was a bit out of the table but was the weird thing about that is

490
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
I had just been looking at your channel a few days ago

491
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
Before that

492
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
Yeah I was actually going through the

493
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,744
The people who were a subscribe to my channel sorting by the most popular and you were just only a couple down so I'm just and I went under your Chan

494
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,048
I saw you have a bunch of interviews with people

495
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:02,400
That I'm really into and I'm really into the subject set the videos that you make

496
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:08,288
So I thought hey I mean maybe he'd be interested in having me as a guest on the show and it looks like a cool show so

497
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
I'm glad to be on

498
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,896
This was the first indication to me that something might be up here

499
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:19,296
You know I was looking for the people who subscribe to my channel and you were there in the most popular so I thought I

500
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Reach Out

501
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,904
Bananas yeah that kind of gives me a sense of like

502
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,464
This is this seems to be driven by public

503
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
Sounds to be like

504
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
First indication of like

505
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,120
Crass promotional concern

506
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
And that's like minute one of the

507
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
The interview

508
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,008
Yeah that was trouble it's almost being presented as like

509
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
You know we running

510
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,592
Circle

511
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Quiet

512
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:48,224
Because he is still saying that I was looking at the most popular of my drivers you got it

513
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
That was kind

514
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
I mean there's a

515
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Refreshing

516
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:58,464
He's like yeah but you're putting your nothing's on the table.

517
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:03,072
What I got for you I don't know what to

518
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,888
Hetalia hobnob with people who know the

519
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
F****** secrets of

520
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,496
Subscriber

521
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,568
I like there was a little bit of a troubling

522
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,688
So also traveling Kevin is subscribe

523
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
Knowing that this is all like

524
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,320
Cheats for children

525
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,696
I watched a couple of their videos yet

526
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,560
What is this b*******

527
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:40,960
That's why I'm saying is is kind of pretty that says like it does not take any critical thinking skills to deconstruct what

528
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:46,848
This is mostly interested in anyway

529
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,688
It deserves to be talked about Siri

530
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
The more I find out about Kevin Moore

531
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
The more I'm like

532
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,344
F*** are you doing yeah

533
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,928
I have I have a couple theory that

534
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,976
I want of them is just as bad

535
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:07,840
Underlying Theory

536
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
It'll be hard to talk meow

537
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,704
There's a second theory that I have

538
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
About like

539
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Why you

540
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
Against Kerry

541
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,616
I'm not sure it can't prove it but it

542
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:26,272
I'm working on it and it's developing we'll get to that probably couple episodes down the lion

543
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
Navigation continues

544
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
Butts

545
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
What are the things that like I said

546
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,160
I'm concerned

547
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,464
Primarily with the fact that Kevin is talking to

548
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
Treating it

549
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Seriously

550
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,328
I think one of the things

551
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
I think we're going to see

552
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
One of the reasons

553
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Why

554
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
He's baby

555
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:52,128
That way this is the kind of weird is interview I've done

556
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:58,528
Play interviews today right this is the most fun one even though it stresses me out right

557
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Have no question

558
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,600
But it's still kind of car

559
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,184
Yeah I've done a lot of interviews where I don't have many questions

560
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Prepared and

561
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
But yeah

562
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,816
I got to say that this interview is not starting off promise

563
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:16,192
Kevin just outright said that he hasn't prepared for this interview is no question

564
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
Who's ready which I find

565
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Troubling

566
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:24,896
This is where the whole thing becomes really interesting to me cuz like I'm the one hand this apextv is never something I want to cover

567
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:30,784
It's really just amateurs clickbait bulshit targeted idiot some children naturally which I'm not particularly interests

568
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,112
I feel like it would largely be a waste of time to critique it and

569
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,512
Insane way I don't have time to tell you about how that link for that one superfood that'll save your life is not on the up and

570
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,792
Dude I've got this

571
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,120
Is one weird trick for you that will do I don't even know how many

572
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,448
Right that's not a good use

573
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
Frivolous

574
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
But Kevin Moore

575
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Journalist

576
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,104
You trying to establish his brand is this gatekeep

577
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,688
Like a trusted voice to guide you through the good and the bad of these

578
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
Paranormal weirdo world

579
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:05,344
He clearly has interesting calling people out who he feels are giving the community a bad name

580
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,648
You'd expect you'd have that more broadly

581
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,488
Avenger singularly applied to carry it Martin

582
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
It would make sense

583
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
Unless there was something

584
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,328
Personal unless all s***

585
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
Is Mark

586
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
Actually his real dad

587
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
No

588
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,240
Are you sure I can't prove it but no

589
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,056
He's trying to present himself like we talked about like a Tesla

590
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,152
Some sort of a gatekeeper you think you'd apply this prospective more Broad

591
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
Opposed

592
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
Singular Focus

593
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,504
Like if he wants to get any mileage out of the

594
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,552
The perception that he takes this stuff seriously

595
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,368
People who are out there scamming people

596
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
You're making

597
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
Serious researchers look bad

598
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,232
He takes on certain responsibilities

599
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,280
Namely that he should be trying

600
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
Kingston Pointe

601
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,632
He's starting this episode out framing it is if Apex

602
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
Stevie is talking

603
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,192
The time-traveling whistleblowers

604
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,752
Which is meant to lend credibility to their videos

605
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,848
If you done any preparation he could ask about how exactly the

606
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,688
These people ended up promoting of viral insurance at is if it was a time traveler

607
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,736
Whistleblower that would be a good place to

608
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Start

609
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,064
I feel like that's the first question that needs to be answered

610
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
Before you can even proceed with the inter

611
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
At least

612
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
It would be if Kevin were an interviewer who is X

613
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,024
Play interested in upholding certain standards

614
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
In the Paranormal world

615
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
He's not

616
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
So anyway I don't know this is bad

617
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:27,008
What do you start off at like I don't have any questions for you guy who talks to Time Travelers

618
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,056
How could you not have what you have

619
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
So many

620
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
I have a car YouTube

621
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:38,016
I just ate but even better is that he commiserate the long with him he's like yeah I don't have Quest

622
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,344
For interviews all the time to we are both bad in our jobs

623
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
It would be what do it like legitimately

624
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Let's say

625
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
Out of the blue

626
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
I get it

627
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:51,328
Big Bang message it comes up on my screen right and it's like hey

628
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
I talked to Time Travelers

629
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,168
I will allow you to interview me in 10 minutes

630
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
I would still have

631
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,288
No there's no amount of immediacy

632
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:05,408
The interview could come that I wouldn't have some sort of like all right imma gather my past really quick

633
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,688
How do you time travel

634
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,992
Can answer that one all right next

635
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
Why do you time travel

636
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,880
He's not talkin to the time traveler but you know you still could ask those questions

637
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,208
You clearly if I still question

638
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:18,976
Better half

639
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
Although on the other hand

640
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
And you just told me that a lot of times you don't have any

641
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Any questions

642
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
The best insurance

643
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
AMF

644
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
All right I don't know we'll know in 40 years though

645
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
So

646
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,312
The questions that we do get are at the beginning of

647
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
This are like

648
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,896
Hey why you hiding behind that microphone

649
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
So why are you name is to

650
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
To begin with

651
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,832
Oh well I don't want to give out any personal information as of right now cuz

652
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,136
I've been refused A lot of people who

653
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,928
Who've expressed

654
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
Concerns for this

655
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
Security and I think those

656
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,072
Biot Distributing their messages if they're telling the truth they could

657
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
That

658
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,168
Concerned for their security could translate over

659
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Intimate

660
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
And in the team here at 8

661
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
Text TV Soho

662
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:07,616
We want to that's that's the reason we chosen to stay Anonymous as of right now

663
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,992
Another possibility is you know you're scamming people right right

664
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,832
That could be why you don't want people

665
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,416
That's another possibility

666
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,232
Another reason could be he works at home.

667
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,280
Deebo

668
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
Fired from home

669
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:31,424
There's a lot of reasons a lot of people use anonymity when they're f****** around online

670
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,288
I don't care I didn't do too much looking

671
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,640
Going into trying to figure out who this person is cuz I'll respect their anonymity to the extent that they are

672
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,688
I don't think there's anything

673
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,760
But I can tell that they're up to that

674
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,064
Elevates past the level of like

675
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,856
I don't know

676
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,904
F****** around internet nonsense

677
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,720
Of course you would

678
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,048
Like in that line of work it's just a good idea to say you have

679
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,584
Have to be anonymous

680
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,424
Just throw it out there just in Subway's whenever you're engaged

681
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
Did this sort of like LARP

682
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
Or whatever

683
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,056
You have to it's by default you say you need

684
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,152
Need to be anonymous for protection cuz if you don't it almost raises too many questions

685
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,456
You should

686
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,272
We have to be anonymous if you're saying

687
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
Mark Richard

688
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,160
No I was off-planet but they're giving you a difference

689
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
Store

690
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,512
They know I'm crazy goes fine

691
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Right

692
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:33,376
So glad we get to a discussion of Apex

693
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
Stevie is greatest work

694
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,984
They're they're really there's a Swedish

695
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
No that was big

696
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,568
But what really put them on the map

697
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
Was this one time travel

698
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
They talked to

699
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
And it was a younger gentleman

700
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:50,528
Okay and that ended up getting them a bunch of mainstream

701
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,064
Coverage

702
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,416
Really not quite you know CNN

703
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Still likes

704
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
Foreign news outlets

705
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Yeah alright

706
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,792
So recently you got it you was on

707
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,352
Don't talk shows all over the world

708
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,656
In some cases in Australia that was

709
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,704
You was over here in the UK on on the

710
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,008
Magazines and newspapers

711
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Was pretty impressive

712
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
Yahoo search

713
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
Surprise Daddy

714
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:19,200
BR the reception of one of those interviews we did with a man named Noah

715
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,016
Who claimed to be a time traveler from the year 2030

716
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:27,392
And it was actually him that went on a lot of those talk shows and everything I did I did go on a couple but

717
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
I'll miss it's amazing the reach

718
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,000
Into the mainstream news that this is God in because

719
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,048
Ironic thing is that the p

720
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:38,144
People we've interviewed say they've tried to contact the mainstream news and they haven't

721
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,192
I've been receptive.

722
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,240
To them and they haven't taken up their stories

723
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,848
And then buy us taking up their stories and it actually reaches the mainstream news that's a

724
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,432
I'm really surprised me and it really gave me hope

725
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,248
The dirty mainstream news and there

726
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Covering up

727
00:32:54,272 --> 00:33:00,416
Got this is just another attack on the beach

728
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,768
Time travel buddy is a bad year

729
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
That is way too

730
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
Oh yeah that is only like 10

731
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,680
Embellish a bunch of stuff if you

732
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
Is 20/30 I would have gone with it

733
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
What year would you choose

734
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,592
I don't know 7582

735
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,640
82 makeup everything

736
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,456
Right so far in the future that like

737
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,736
Like an hour

738
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,296
I just I don't we don't even breathe anymore

739
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
Kirby Ross evolve out of breathing because atmosphere will be destroyed then why do you look like

740
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:39,840
Well because it we also technology to revert ourselves back we could digivolve

741
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
Airtight

742
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:46,496
So one of Apex TV's biggest claim to fame was their work they did with the person

743
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,544
Play Noah who was said to be like you said

744
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
Set a time traveler

745
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,360
From the year 2030

746
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,384
Search for mankind

747
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,200
No I've been recruited

748
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,736
Into a time travel program

749
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
2020

750
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
P5 where is job would be to go back in time to help

751
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,112
Compile a compendium of all history

752
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
So Noah travel back to our time

753
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,512
Euro 2017

754
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
The time that he showed up in

755
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,352
Would be a mysterious time for the people in 2030

756
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:17,728
You think they'd be more interested in figuring out what was going on in ancient times of checking out that Jesus characters

757
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
Or something like that

758
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,056
You could make a good argument that the 26th

759
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,104
The election may be historically relevant for

760
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,224
Galatians but I would suggest that they will not be wanting for information about it

761
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,552
Been pretty well-documented the things that are happening in the present

762
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
But maybe would have

763
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
They lost the internet

764
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
And games

765
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,976
Just do the one the one don't know if you know this is still out of books

766
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,816
Publix

767
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,656
Things in stone

768
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
Sentient

769
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Sure

770
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
So anyway Noah came back to our time

771
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:58,432
But ended up getting fired from his job but this future time travel organization after he got into a bar fight

772
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
South America

773
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
This trapped no in the present

774
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Today which was his

775
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,856
We had to create a new persona and trying to do the best I could

776
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,440
If you consider for one second

777
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,584
The story that's being told here you have to pause and ask you. Follow up

778
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:21,984
The first is what kind of secret time travel program is just going to recruit someone who will then know all their secrets

779
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
And fire them for something as trivial as getting into a bar fight

780
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
Automotive

781
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
Throw up

782
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:37,088
I used to work at a movie theater and one of my co-workers showed up for a shift with a black eye and a big cut bragging about getting into a bar fight tonight

783
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,160
Before and they didn't even take it tell him to take the day off

784
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,232
Seems unlikely that a time travel program book

785
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,560
Consider this termination worthy as an offense

786
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
This kind of moral Behavior

787
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
Reflect poorly back on the

788
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:53,728
But even if that's the case why strand the dude who knows all your secrets in the past week

789
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
Control it then

790
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,360
Budget any half-decent secret time travel Outfitters going to kill this guy

791
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,200
Very least bring it back to 2030 and lock him up there

792
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,248
Or lock him up here find a guy who

793
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
How do you think

794
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,832
Wonder how much time travel detritus

795
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
This is left behind by these

796
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:16,768
So anyway that glittering time carbon if I were the person doing an interview with this guy

797
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,536
Rubio

798
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,632
In the story explanation for

799
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
Yeah

800
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,448
So no I had some fun stories

801
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,984
Tell about what life was like in

802
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
10-20-30

803
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,848
41 informed the world that m.l.k. Jr Martin Luther King

804
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,664
King Jr his granddaughter Yolanda Renee King

805
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
Will become

806
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,528
In that year that's one problem is that Yolanda was born in

807
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
2008

808
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,880
So Riker 21 years old 130 when you lower

809
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
21 years old to run

810
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,744
What's lower than the minimum age to become president

811
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
Understand now right there we go

812
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:53,888
No explain to buy that point of law will be passed that allows younger people to be

813
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
The president

814
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:01,056
He doesn't seem to understand that this would require a full-on Amendment since the presidential age limit is Article 2

815
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,592
Section 1 of the Constitution

816
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,176
I feel like if we get to the point where two-thirds of

817
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,760
The House and Senate pass an amendment lowering age required to be president

818
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,320
And then three-quarters of the states ratify it

819
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:16,160
I think the fact that 21 year olds can be president is not the headline

820
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,464
The big story here would have to be the

821
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,512
Massive political realignment

822
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,816
That would have to happen in the next 10 years

823
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,608
Get us to the point where these stuff

824
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,960
PS Washington political class or tried to get youth into the White House

825
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
Headlight 2025

826
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,824
What the f*** is going on

827
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,176
Like really from a political science perspective what could bring that about

828
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Like really think about it

829
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,576
One possibility would be that we see a trend of high levels at like we already are

830
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,416
High levels of political engagement

831
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,208
In the you for sure you don't have to

832
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,000
Continue to the point where they be

833
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,560
Become the only political relevant voting Bloc in

834
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:00,448
As more and more people cannot control the vote they could vote in younger senators and representatives

835
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,240
Boogy event incline to push

836
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
About a month

837
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,032
I guess

838
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,592
But this younger voting Bloc wouldn't

839
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:11,456
Be single-issue voters just based on lowering the age you have to be to run for president

840
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
Derby ripple effect

841
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,088
But polling shows that the user pretty overwhelmingly in favor of Subs

842
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
Pretty left

843
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
Position

844
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,952
Particularly ones related to civil rights issues and climate change

845
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
Is a pig

846
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:27,072
Their Wills to the point where they got that kind of Constitutional Amendment passed

847
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,864
You have to assume their presents

848
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
To be felt in so many other places

849
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:35,776
Like this amendment will be a side note to the bigger news that fossil fuels have been outlawed

850
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:41,664
Right I mean I feel like it would be a side note to the bigger news that everyone over 40 died

851
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:48,320
See that's the other category or a plague the dislikes

852
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,368
Illness

853
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,928
The older population

854
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:58,304
Do you know everyone's got a grow up real fast

855
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,704
F-35 there can be no President Dan something like that is possible in that case

856
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
It's not due

857
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,824
So he says that Yolanda king is president

858
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
2030

859
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,152
She says that she's elected at the age of 21

860
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
There's another problem

861
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,760
And that is a 20-30 is not a presidential election

862
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:28,000
Of course he's a little wiggling washing about her actually being elected in 2030 but he does say that she's elected at

863
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:32,608
21 which you would be in 2030 if she was elected in 2028

864
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,632
She would be 90

865
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
Being at that point

866
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,496
This makes any sense and is honestly completely disqualify

867
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
Anybody who'd

868
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
Consider this s*** for a second

869
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,336
Idiot or the running app

870
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,640
Right so this is

871
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,664
This is the sort of

872
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
Work that apextv is doing

873
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,992
Clearly

874
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
Not good

875
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,832
Otherwise known as the Lord who cares

876
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
They're having fun

877
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,672
To the best of our knowledge there having fun

878
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:03,072
I'm not going to be grumpy Uncle Dan over here being like you internet kid

879
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
Play All Around the World

880
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,752
It's clearly part of some corner of the internet that I'm not a part of it I don't fully understand

881
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
So I'm not going

882
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Steak

883
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
My effort on being like

884
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,152
Shaking my fist

885
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:22,784
At the same time if you look at it it is still like a guy trying to present him

886
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,808
Himself as

887
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,624
Like where do you know you can't decide whether this is

888
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,464
Real or not but why don't you help people decide a little bit by asking the f****** question

889
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
Betty White

890
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:38,400
You put also Noah predicted that multiple US cities would be completely destroyed by snow storms in February 29th

891
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,680
Which I don't

892
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
Think happened

893
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Pretty sure

894
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
What year is it now

895
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,360
2019 that's travel that's that's not going well

896
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:51,712
So he revealed this information in a video where he was holding a piece of paper purporting to

897
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
To be a page

898
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,272
My book that lays out our future history

899
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,344
This page is labeled 2019

900
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
2020

901
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,928
Re-edit just has six entries on it

902
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:07,328
Boy this is apocalypse written all over it seems a little minimalist

903
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,984
It's just a crumpled up piece of computer paper that's been slightly distress to look weather

904
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,800
Looks like something a Junior High student would make if they're trying to come up with

905
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
With a prop

906
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,152
It's hard for me to really put this in this into words

907
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
It's

908
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:29,856
Accept paper and tea and then baked it for a little bit and I got a little parchment feel it's good stuff

909
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
Know what made the rounds on

910
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Talk shows and got a bunch

911
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,464
Felicity which was largely filtered back

912
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,488
Apextv

913
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Sent to you as a

914
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,792
Appearing with his face obscured

915
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
Depicts

916
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,632
Dang it and it made the altered his voice

917
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,424
They made it pretty much

918
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,728
If you don't even know the other name to him

919
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
Sheriff

920
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:50,336
In one interview I solve his it was a split screen with the news anchors

921
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
Inside

922
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,895
His chest on the other

923
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,199
On his torso he was wearing a wellframe

924
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Apex

925
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
Eevee hoodie

926
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,575
So you was wearing their logo it's all free.

927
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,927
This is one of the more low-rent lazy scams I've seen in my time looking

928
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,951
Paranormal

929
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,231
Wellspace grifter world

930
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
It's remarkable.

931
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,839
To me to imagine that anyone would look at this s*** and even give it a sec

932
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
Quite honestly

933
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:17,727
It's even more insane because apextv would promote their story that's so

934
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
Clearly full of

935
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,311
Basically unless they don't care

936
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,871
Hey did you like this is all just vulture who cares

937
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
Get it out the door will get the money

938
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,199
Then on top of that

939
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
Bananas

940
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,247
The Kevin Moore would have such

941
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,271
Chabot standards

942
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,343
But he's doing a softball interview with the guy who's promoting this

943
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,903
Clearly full of s*** nonsense

944
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,487
But that's what it exactly what's happening all right so

945
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,535
The guy that we're talk

946
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,351
Yes they Kevin Morris to us

947
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
Guy

948
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,679
I'm probably just going to refer to as Apex

949
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,471
Apextv dude

950
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,775
He is obscured

951
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
But his voice is not alter

952
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:59,967
Yeah now Noah is both of Steward and his voice is also yes pixelated over the face

953
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
Now

954
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,271
If I'm Apex guy

955
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,319
Why am I not both guys

956
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
You have to be both guys

957
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
It's definitely not

958
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,463
It's definitely not we'll get to that later okay

959
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,999
But yeah.

960
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,303
I thought about that as well why not

961
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,607
Yeah yeah I mean if you're already Apex

962
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,655
What course you're going to jump into

963
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,679
The time-travel why not

964
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:23,263
You got nothing to lose Nick you got to be worried about the possibility of

965
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
Like raw footage

966
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,591
Someone

967
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,895
Getting her hands on that I don't know

968
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,967
I don't know exactly why you wouldn't do it it seems like you'd have

969
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
One less loose string

970
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,295
Yeah well they only thing I was thinking

971
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
Is because

972
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
More asking

973
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
He says

974
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:43,231
You went on TV all did all these interviews all around the world and then he goes like

975
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
No I did

976
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
Some

977
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,631
But it was this other guy making me think that more knows that it was all him

978
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,471
Kevin

979
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,567
I should I should start from that operating position always

980
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Fair enough

981
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:02,943
So in this next clip we get to find out the Apex

982
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,759
Talk to a lot

983
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,647
Eventually we got contacted by this man claiming to be a time traveler from the year

984
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,463
2026 I think knows our first interview

985
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:18,303
In which we actually sat down with somebody in person

986
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:22,911
And he told us an amazing story I think he really believed what he was saying

987
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
Whether or not he was telling the truth is another story

988
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,519
But it was a really interesting

989
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,543
Really

990
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,079
Nursing interview and I

991
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,639
I think of yours thought so as well to reach

992
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,663
To that was

993
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,687
Incredible

994
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
And

995
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,991
Ever since then that like

996
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
In my inbox

997
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:42,111
In the last in the last week I've maybe 20 people claim to be Time Travelers

998
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,671
From various years

999
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
So it's it's getting hard to

1000
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,815
To interview all these people and be going through each one one by one

1001
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,095
It's a

1002
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
What's a challenge

1003
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
Right right

1004
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:58,751
If you thought any of them were actual time travelers you make the time

1005
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,335
Also 20 is not that many

1006
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
It's a lot of knock

1007
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,943
Vet 20 Time Travelers

1008
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,807
Is in a good two or three hours how do you write a time traveler

1009
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,623
How what do you do

1010
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,671
Sure did it pop up

1011
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,743
Yeah but if you're back in time you could make a Facebook page

1012
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
Sure very easy

1013
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
Okay

1014
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:28,191
All you needs an email address other information

1015
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:32,543
M20 showing up in 2017 and their Facebook post from 2015 that does

1016
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,079
State of Decay 2 problem

1017
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,639
See what I'm saying like I was not going to be the case for all of them

1018
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,199
We're going to be using aliases

1019
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:45,599
Don't say you got 20 I say in the first 10 minutes you can knock out at least 45

1020
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,439
Yeah so now you got 15 and you got a whole day to go through

1021
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
I bet you could

1022
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,511
Maybe no problem

1023
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,303
You're under estimating

1024
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
The workload

1025
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
Would bring up

1026
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,423
I think that you probably imagined just everything

1027
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,007
I mean time traveling

1028
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:09,407
Specific for Real where I can prove somebody

1029
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
Traveler in 10 min

1030
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,735
Alright listeners

1031
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:16,319
Pretend to be a time traveler email Jordan

1032
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:20,671
20 if you just wanted to knock it out in 5 minutes

1033
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,999
You know that now you can just say none of them are

1034
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,583
You probably should

1035
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
Anyway

1036
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,727
We got an indication earlier that there is this the sort of like

1037
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,335
Yeah this guy is coming on Kevin show cuz he's one of his more popular

1038
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Sky Burger

1039
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,175
The sorts of it interest

1040
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,479
Silly sort of like motivation

1041
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Come up a bit

1042
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,551
Well I'll just set minutes

1043
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,599
You know I mean

1044
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,647
I can beat this out but I mean you'll making some

1045
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,183
Some serious money from this chat

1046
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
As well

1047
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,559
And I think the figures are quite right on socialblade cuz the right for my

1048
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,607
So evil

1049
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,143
I stayed congratulation

1050
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:08,287
I understand we're employing people to transcribe all the videos

1051
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
I'll putting them in.

1052
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,615
Text form so we can put them out on her website

1053
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:16,479
I'm we're making the videos into formats will be acceptable for Instagram Facebook

1054
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:21,087
Already translating the video sound other languages including Korean Espanol

1055
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,367
Spanish

1056
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,207
Couple other languages IO

1057
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
Hindi

1058
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,999
We've actually got the

1059
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
Those channels launch

1060
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,839
I already sold out of the money is most of the money

1061
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,863
Going right back in a peck

1062
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,887
Text Steven by-nd

1063
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Into

1064
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,703
Employ more people to

1065
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:40,543
To spread these people's messages in our goal is just to make an environment in which p

1066
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
People aren't afraid

1067
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,103
To tell their stories

1068
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,455
So make a lot of money but are just going back into running the business

1069
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,759
There's a lot of deflection errything

1070
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
Like that

1071
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,319
Entire

1072
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,343
Theme of like

1073
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Where did you know AIDS

1074
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:01,023
Stop saying this is true or not not saying this to make it place where things are comfortable for people to come forward with

1075
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,559
Weather

1076
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,887
So I guess fine kind of enabling in

1077
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,447
Is but it's a really wild

1078
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,727
Space weirdo

1079
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,031
If you already at the gate their break

1080
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,055
Working a lot of rules

1081
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,615
Talking Bunny

1082
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,943
Yeah it's weird you said like hey I know basic

1083
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,551
Typically how much money you're making because of how much money I'm making you congratulations

1084
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:27,903
That is a lot. OK Google

1085
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,927
Not good

1086
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,511
Very good job

1087
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
No

1088
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,863
I guess I'm the one hand you could look at it as like

1089
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
We're just talking about it in terms of

1090
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:42,239
The financials but we're really actually talk about underneath is like

1091
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
How many people have seen the message

1092
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,591
But that's even

1093
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
Anybody

1094
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:51,711
I'm sure that would be kind of the the way that they were trying

1095
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,247
It does seem like that money

1096
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Promotion

1097
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,319
Is much more

1098
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,879
The currency that they're they're trafficking

1099
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
I don't know I just

1100
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,023
Is very weird and also just that

1101
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
Constant refrain

1102
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,327
Of

1103
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
Like I wanted to

1104
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,887
Put it back there they're out

1105
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:14,751
Their stories out here I don't know. I don't know if it's true

1106
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,287
That is so can

1107
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,335
I just weird

1108
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,871
Heroically bringing what

1109
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:24,735
Maybe truth to the people and the mainstream media ignores they can't do it right there too afraid

1110
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
Without me

1111
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,319
No I would have never been on television

1112
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,391
Fine then again neither would be 20 other guys who were lying

1113
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,767
So Kevin gets around to talking about how like

1114
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
Weird

1115
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
No Time Travelers talk to

1116
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,143
Oh my God

1117
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,447
I don't get these people come

1118
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Coming to me

1119
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,495
Right I've never had

1120
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
Well maybe one

1121
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,079
Maybe Wonka

1122
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,663
And it was it was about what the real story of the John

1123
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,711
Cheetah story with old about

1124
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
And it was jumping

1125
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,063
So crazy pan out there that actually did almost did sign

1126
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,343
That was some truth in

1127
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:10,047
It was a love story mixed in with it as well I don't good over-the-counter

1128
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:11,839
Yeah

1129
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,887
Yeah yeah

1130
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:17,215
I'm never really talked about this I went all the way down to London

1131
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,263
To interview this lady who would met

1132
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
This person

1133
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
Many years is

1134
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
Kia.

1135
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871
Edit

1136
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,919
Destroyer in some ways because she fell in love

1137
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,687
But this guy

1138
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
Random

1139
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,319
And the whole

1140
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,623
The story is not what we think

1141
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,159
It's actually very different

1142
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
What they at 2

1143
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
Stories that sound

1144
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
So I want to come across that one

1145
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,887
Why didn't you do anything with it when I was looking at that is like I've never

1146
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,191
Seen or read The Time Traveler's Wife

1147
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,239
Sounds like it could be the time travelers

1148
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:56,639
You might right if you've never seen it it was her the title

1149
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
Yeah

1150
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
Yeah

1151
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
John

1152
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
Peter is the classic

1153
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,295
You know that is wrong

1154
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:07,647
I don't want to get too in-depth on it I think we'll probably end up covering it

1155
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
If we keep going with coasttocoastam

1156
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,719
I'm just going to be huge thing and

1157
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:16,095
I don't know I'm just terrible with me he's a guy who claimed to be time traveler

1158
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
And made a bunch of s***

1159
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:21,471
And then other people have claimed to be the real John

1160
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:25,567
If we talked we talked about him the last time we talked about a little bit

1161
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
But I just

1162
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,615
Do not remember.

1163
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:32,223
It's we haven't gone in-depth on it because it's it's a gigantic

1164
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:36,575
Body of work online

1165
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,855
Time travel Theory

1166
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,135
There's like

1167
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,719
Pretenders there's the original fake

1168
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,047
But yeah I found that that

1169
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:50,655
Cuz I don't know what he's actually talking about

1170
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,447
I think there's a time traveler

1171
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,239
Or did he talked to a lady who got

1172
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:59,615
Conned by someone who said they were Time Travelers actually in Mexico

1173
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
The fuk you stalking

1174
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,431
I know somebody didn't make any money off

1175
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,967
Alphabets and somebody definitely lost

1176
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:09,599
That's all I haven't decided not to do anything with it might be an indication of good judge

1177
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,879
He could be both

1178
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
So

1179
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,719
I don't think that if our

1180
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,255
Listeners email you

1181
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,303
And try and make you

1182
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,607
I don't think you're going to do a Time

1183
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,679
Like I said you'll just ignore all didn't say none of them

1184
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,263
I look at the positive approach

1185
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,311
That would be your approach

1186
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,871
Sure now we get to hear a little bit about Apex

1187
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,663
Approach

1188
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,735
How do you how can you vent

1189
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,087
That's the best the issue is with

1190
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,415
Like we've had a few who we go through as soon as

1191
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,463
So you see we don't go if we don't go

1192
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,303
Straight to do an in-person interview for a software you a couple Skype interviews

1193
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,839
We ask them if they have any conclusive

1194
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,119
Approved for anyting

1195
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:59,263
And if what they're showing us seems to be holding up we we sometimes do goes far as meeting them in person

1196
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,591
What we've done it a variety of time traveled all over the world

1197
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,895
Actually had some the best experiences of my life

1198
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:09,503
Example we went to Armenia on several occasions other European countries

1199
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,039
Through interviews with

1200
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
These people

1201
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,623
So yeah that's that's a major issue it's like

1202
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
How how do we know

1203
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,487
Yeah end it end

1204
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,023
What we're trying to do is

1205
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
Green environment in which

1206
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,351
People aren't afraid to tell

1207
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,887
Their story so I think

1208
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,423
Almost

1209
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,239
The last wedding the better but if someone's obviously

1210
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,519
Trying to pull your leg

1211
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:37,663
Like we had we had that many times like we we going with interview with somebody and they're wearing

1212
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,431
Ski mask

1213
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,223
And they'd

1214
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:46,111
They they seem to be making a joke out of the whole thing he looks like he's five years older something we've had that a couple times

1215
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,415
Here's that you know someone's trying to pull your leg

1216
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,463
They tell you there are time traveler

1217
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,743
REI

1218
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,863
So what's the lion-man use the two things that we learned

1219
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
For that clip

1220
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,959
The first is that the answer is how do you let these people at we do

1221
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,263
Yes that's the that's the number one thing

1222
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,407
I believe you but you don't want to do too much we talked to him a couple times see if they're just yelling at me

1223
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,711
That's just not going to be good for the brain

1224
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
5 years old

1225
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,039
Is there

1226
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:18,879
Clearly just mentally ill

1227
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
Walking to work for us

1228
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,511
So we do a couple Skype interviews to make sure that they could coherently say a couple lines

1229
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,071
And then we move forward with it

1230
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,351
So that's the vetting process

1231
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,655
It's just an audition almost

1232
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,935
Right which is great

1233
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:38,335
I love the second thing we learn is there making enough money to travel to f****** Europe repeatedly

1234
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,383
That's good really not like

1235
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,711
So this is work at you are f******

1236
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
Bumming me out

1237
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,831
Happy Halloween

1238
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,855
Bonita's

1239
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
Also

1240
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,391
We're broke

1241
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:57,791
And they are flying around and having the best time of their lives

1242
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,351
Sam play the critically disc

1243
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
Them

1244
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,191
But they're not irrelevant

1245
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,239
They are

1246
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:10,079
Massively popular in the world that we're not apart of

1247
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,151
Yes it's still have punching down even if this is

1248
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,431
Profoundly stupid stuff

1249
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,199
I am

1250
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:21,343
Not Furious more Furious that we are punching up at the

1251
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,671
FedEx Express

1252
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,975
We don't need no Vedic

1253
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,743
Maybe

1254
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,791
Visitor to do is better

1255
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:35,167
We're doing it wrong apparently

1256
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,727
Some people end up being out of his liar

1257
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,543
And we've had some people actually come out as being fake

1258
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,615
For example we did an interview with Michael Phillips

1259
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,895
Who claims to have been

1260
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,687
From I forget what year

1261
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,247
But he talked about a third World War end

1262
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:54,367
Kid here she came out a couple weeks ago he posted a video on his channel saying it was all

1263
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,903
It was all fake

1264
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,927
To see if we would take his

1265
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
Story and everything

1266
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
And

1267
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,511
I think that

1268
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
Deb soompi

1269
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,095
People might see that as

1270
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,143
I don't know but

1271
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:12,543
I think it serves us good in the sense that they can see that we're not part of these people we're not

1272
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,823
We're not telling them what

1273
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,127
To stay there during the ones coming to us

1274
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:22,527
And I saw in the comments section A lot of people are asking him did apextv pay you because that's that's what everybody's saying online

1275
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,551
And

1276
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,343
He responded to all the comments

1277
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,367
Say no I I was

1278
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,159
Just trying to see if I apextv would

1279
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,439
Good takeout by story

1280
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
So

1281
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,487
You know that might be

1282
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,279
Be the case with many of these people but

1283
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,119
If just one person is telling the truth that it proves that

1284
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:41,983
It proves that things are going on that the public doesn't know about behind closed doors

1285
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,799
But what if no one's telling the truth

1286
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
Brabus

1287
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Correct

1288
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:50,175
There is one time traveler

1289
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,455
11

1290
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,247
Then the whole game is up

1291
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,551
You know there's just the whole thing

1292
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,831
It's all over

1293
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:02,463
Right now we start from zero year zero if there's one time travel

1294
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:06,047
However

1295
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,887
Proven that there is one

1296
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,655
Is

1297
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,191
It should be easy

1298
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
It's berries

1299
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,775
It kind of a kind of should be

1300
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,079
So it turns out Jordan

1301
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,103
Michael Phillips

1302
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,943
The guy that he's talking about

1303
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:29,343
Let's Phelps he's not the only time traveler who's been promoted by apextv there's come out and said that what they did was fake

1304
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,439
So this video that he's doing this interview is taking place in

1305
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
2018

1306
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:41,119
Remember that guy Noah that we talked about well in July 2019

1307
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,215
Video revealing that the person claiming to be Noah the time traveler got all this means

1308
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,239
Stream news coverage

1309
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,055
Was actually just a guy named Jason who faked the whole thing

1310
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
Right

1311
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,127
In the video put out by Apex

1312
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Jason

1313
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,919
Claims that he was an egg

1314
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:57,759
Animated kid lonely and bullied who stumbled into Apex

1315
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
He really

1316
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,319
Got into the whole thing

1317
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,879
Decided to contact them claiming to be a time traveler

1318
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,183
The entire message feels very

1319
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,207
Curated though

1320
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,487
With lions like quote

1321
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:12,863
Just because I lied it doesn't mean that other people aren't telling the truth

1322
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:17,215
The video feels like it was created in order to address the fact that this story was bulshit

1323
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,775
But also maintain the perception that everything else is

1324
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,055
Probably isn't

1325
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,127
It also feels like it serves a very specific purpose

1326
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,455
Namely to put the blame for the lie on Jason

1327
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,503
He was socially isolated in a

1328
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
Insecure so we can

1329
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
Did this plot

1330
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,855
Apextv was just a media outlet for a

1331
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,623
Tell is why

1332
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,671
And they did everything in their power to

1333
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,695
Check is Dory they

1334
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,231
Detector test

1335
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,023
So what more do you want from these people

1336
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
This feels

1337
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,607
A lot like media relations

1338
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,143
Not like an update to the

1339
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:46,911
The story

1340
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:51,263
Another thing that seems weird is that all the Noah videos are still up on the Apex

1341
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,287
Channel oh yeah

1342
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,079
None of their titles have been changed

1343
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:57,151
Just something like a guy lies to us about time travel

1344
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
Stillgoode content

1345
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:03,039
And just cuz it's not true doesn't mean it's not good contest and should be at like parentheses

1346
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,111
Debunk

1347
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,391
The guardian now this is

1348
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:13,791
Apextv debunked yourself they still have titles like quote time traveler from 2030 reveals future

1349
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,559
The Philippines

1350
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,119
And quote time traveler meets his future

1351
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,703
No disclaimers

1352
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:29,151
Jason revealed secrets of 2030 also that video where he meets his future self who apparently is comeback

1353
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,175
Back to 2017

1354
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:36,063
Theme from 2070 that's the pets how it goes right

1355
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:41,439
20-17 70 version his comeback 2017

1356
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,487
They're going to start a band he was big

1357
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:48,863
Tunnel problems now that we know that it's all a lie

1358
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,887
How did that happen

1359
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:55,775
So you have no align completely separate person who decided to

1360
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,311
You know the why

1361
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:01,919
Apex TV set up a meeting between the two haha this is supposed to be true

1362
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,455
How can this even work with the story

1363
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:07,807
I thought Noah got fired from the time-traveling job and gets stranded in 27

1364
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,367
This guy from 2070 would have to be like

1365
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,903
60 years older than him

1366
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,927
He's clearly not

1367
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,207
The keys just

1368
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
How old

1369
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,743
He would be a

1370
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,023
From 2030

1371
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:21,375
1227 you wouldn't have the additional 13 years

1372
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,655
The knowing

1373
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,959
20/30 is no longer in the future

1374
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,287
That's the time that he comes back

1375
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
2017

1376
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,359
So that version of himself shouldn't exist

1377
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,943
It's just embarrassing showing but you know Apex

1378
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,223
Is there still people

1379
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:36,991
Stories

1380
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:40,319
It's not their fault that the stories that they're telling our lies

1381
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:44,415
They fell victim to an elaborate fraud carried out by a socially isolated

1382
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:48,255
15 and a forty-year-old guy who wanted to pretend to be his future self

1383
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:54,655
It could happen to anyone

1384
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,215
The salon we all play a go and

1385
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,239
We talked about this

1386
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
It's

1387
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,359
Weird

1388
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:12,063
Considering the logistics of how this would end up happening yeah it doesn't seem like it would end up here

1389
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
Happening except

1390
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
Bye

1391
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
A guiding

1392
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,951
He is he was at

1393
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:22,559
Absolutely right when he said it's a good idea not to do too much wedding like the same way

1394
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,631
It's a good idea not to worry too much about whether or not your story make

1395
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:29,983
Yeah otherwise if you start putting that effort into it then

1396
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,263
People are going to recognize

1397
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,031
The Craft

1398
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,567
Where is if you have no f

1399
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:34,847
People are just going to be

1400
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,615
Think you're lying

1401
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,175
And some people are going to think you're telling the truth doesn't need

1402
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,247
So you know

1403
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:44,319
They're talking about this and like I said Michael Phillips

1404
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
No he was

1405
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:48,159
True true

1406
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,439
Kevin

1407
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,975
An interesting question in that is like

1408
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,535
Have you ever been talking to one of these people and just be like

1409
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,559
I don't know about

1410
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,583
No I have not

1411
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,631
Is that X in an interview but you

1412
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
Just think

1413
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,703
This is just a load of rubbish or this

1414
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,727
I just caught

1415
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
This isn't

1416
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,311
It's something I can't swallow do you know what I mean this is

1417
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,847
I can't go down but

1418
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,871
This direction but

1419
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
You know

1420
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:13,759
During the eighth mermaid interview I remember when he

1421
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,295
When I asked him if he could

1422
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,855
Speak mermaid and he started making those sounds

1423
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:22,463
That was that was on the hardest I've ever try not to laugh during an interview I don't want to be disrespectful

1424
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,023
Respectful of this man really believe he was a mermaid

1425
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,303
But

1426
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,119
Yeah there aren't there are times like that

1427
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:32,191
I mean looking out I do with little shows that way

1428
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,215
With people that channel

1429
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,031
You could say the same thing for them

1430
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:36,799
Do you know what I mean

1431
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
Ian so

1432
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,383
I mean I never

1433
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
I'm heading back out to the

1434
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:43,967
The state soon

1435
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,759
Finish that document real cool

1436
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,831
Butts

1437
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,927
Come on we can't be

1438
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:56,255
We can't have both of you commiserating on Alexa

1439
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,559
I know some people just lie to your face

1440
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:03,423
Right well I mean it's really interesting cuz here what's going on is Kevin is ask

1441
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,287
What's the most laughable thing I've ever seen is a quiet guy pretending to do a mermaid voice

1442
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:14,687
You know that's kind of like whenever I talk to Chandlers put two and two together a soft and they're both they're both

1443
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455
Moving on

1444
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,247
Just moving on yeah I know it

1445
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,271
Isn't it weird that some

1446
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,295
People lie

1447
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,087
But oh well

1448
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,391
The most liked one

1449
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,719
Interpretation you can take of that is the Kevin Moore is saying like

1450
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:30,047
Oh that's very similar to

1451
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:34,911
The b******* that I deal with these ridiculous

1452
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
The other read

1453
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,703
Meaning of it

1454
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:42,335
Could take is Kevin Morris believing that the Chandlers weird voices are sincere and genuine

1455
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,407
And that being like what you know maybe that guy was talking about

1456
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,687
Yeah

1457
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:47,967
Anyway

1458
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,527
They don't talk about it much but he interviewed Geico claims

1459
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,087
I believe the

1460
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
Direct quote

1461
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,159
Begin with during the mermaid up

1462
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,951
Which is something that I

1463
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,999
I don't hear often enough

1464
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,839
That was not something I decided to look into for this episode

1465
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:07,167
Leave that one well enough alone

1466
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,263
In 10 minutes I can debunk whether or not you're a mermaid

1467
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,567
Send me an email through your water

1468
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:16,383
Computer I love the idea that maybe you're going to get a bucket on it

1469
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
Emails from the

1470
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,967
I'm so he also Apex

1471
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,759
Stevie have another interview that's

1472
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
Coming up

1473
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,551
This is a context

1474
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,879
Conversation where Kevin's trying to ask him about like do any of them have

1475
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,647
Technology

1476
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,439
I bought some of them say they have

1477
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,231
Good good sign

1478
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,767
One of them

1479
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
Has a top

1480
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
Spinning top

1481
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,887
And I did actually go watch this video

1482
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,655
It is just a

1483
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,191
Any claims

1484
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:44,287
They tied it something to do with like it connects to his brain and endorphins or something

1485
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,359
I know that you won't

1486
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,175
Your technology but people in the future who look back

1487
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455
Can see this video

1488
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,247
They will know that I was a time

1489
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,015
Who cares

1490
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,319
Okay anyway that's the least of bored

1491
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,879
Something about this guy there's another

1492
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,903
Indication that I get

1493
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:00,927
Something might be up

1494
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:05,023
Send a couple days where we're going to do the interview with him and he's going to show it to us

1495
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,559
That's on Skype

1496
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,839
And I'm excited

1497
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,119
To see what he has to say

1498
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,655
Sound like an Australian man

1499
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
Who said

1500
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,495
You said some Empire never win

1501
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,799
Dang I forgot the Empire but he said

1502
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,591
One of them Neverwinter

1503
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,871
Got overtaken

1504
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,151
And they

1505
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,431
The Ottoman Empire

1506
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,967
He said they never fell

1507
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,503
So they've asked

1508
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,039
She existed throughout time

1509
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:31,647
What we have here is possibly a slight indication of some bigotry creeping into the

1510
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
Proceedings

1511
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:37,791
It's entirely possible that this guy who you talkin to his just a weirdo resume historical views and so

1512
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,815
Revisionism

1513
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:45,471
But generally when you hear someone in the present-day talking about the Ottoman Empire and how it never really went away you're listening to a rang

1514
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,495
Bank islamophobe

1515
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:51,359
The Ottoman Empire is one of the largest historical examples of a widespread Islamic

1516
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,175
And it existed until relatively recently

1517
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,479
Only being dissolved after World War 1

1518
01:05:56,991 --> 01:06:03,135
In modern anti-muslim circles it's not super uncommon your references to the Ottoman Empire is what the Muslims want

1519
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,415
Create

1520
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:11,071
I know that I've definitely heard people express the idea that the Empire never fell and is actually still alive today in what they

1521
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,631
They were described as expansionist Islam

1522
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,423
All this really

1523
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:18,495
Is deserve it serves to reinforce the perception

1524
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,775
In the turmoil in the world is

1525
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,847
Is easily understandable as a civilization level conflict

1526
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,383
Between Christians and Muslims

1527
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,687
It could just be with this dude is

1528
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:31,295
Still writing some sort of benign historical fiction

1529
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,831
But little things exact

1530
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,879
I kind of hinted at possible underbelly

1531
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:41,279
Things that you could accidentally give a platform to when you have literally zero editorial oversight or quality can

1532
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,095
Control in what you put out and what you allow these

1533
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,399
Supposed Time Travelers.

1534
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:49,727
Could accidentally give a platform somebody who has like

1535
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,775
Crypto f*****-up message

1536
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,335
Yeah well I mean I imagine that it is

1537
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,151
At the very least

1538
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,431
We represent

1539
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,711
The percentage

1540
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,527
Are the ratio of out-and-out bigots

1541
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
Versus

1542
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,063
Non

1543
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,855
In the space weirdo Community as

1544
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
Is it is for the pop

1545
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,927
Large baby higher if not higher

1546
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
Do you know

1547
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,279
So I say that puts us at what

1548
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,839
The 30% chance

1549
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:19,935
Any one of those space weirdos has some weird racial mean

1550
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:24,287
I don't want to try in like a

1551
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:27,103
I don't want to try and give a specific number cuz I think that's where we getting

1552
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,127
The trouble but

1553
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,943
But yeah you know there is some segments of the population

1554
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,991
Of this population

1555
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
That

1556
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,087
Is your sublimating their regular racism through space

1557
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,183
When you have no

1558
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,743
Wedding when you have no standards

1559
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,815
Of what you put for because you want everybody to be able to

1560
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,583
Come forward

1561
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:51,423
You kind of got to expect that some people might

1562
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,751
Subconsciously or even consciously

1563
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,543
Try to Trojan Horse those sorts

1564
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:57,823
Messages through

1565
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,407
And if you're doing no oversight no editorial process

1566
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,455
You'll end up just airing

1567
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,991
S*** that could

1568
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,015
Possibly be

1569
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,039
Space white Nash

1570
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,063
Easily

1571
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:12,415
So now we get to another

1572
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,951
Boxer shift

1573
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,999
And we could do a very familiar topic

1574
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,535
In paranormal

1575
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,559
Talk

1576
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,583
And that is of course

1577
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
The Mandela effect

1578
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,703
With the

1579
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,519
Swapping these subjects a little bit but the Mandela Rafi

1580
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,543
Something that you

1581
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,823
Covet on your way

1582
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,103
Channel as well

1583
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,383
Coronavirus

1584
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,711
Dot-dot-dot Madara fight the little people are talking about

1585
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
Not on YouTube

1586
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,039
Explain to us what that is

1587
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,135
Yeah the Mandela effect is

1588
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:43,903
Is where

1589
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:48,255
You think something happened in a certain way and it's it's more so where

1590
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,023
A mass of

1591
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,351
Will think something happened in a certain way for example at the

1592
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:57,215
End of the Star Wars movie Darth Vader says Luke I am your father

1593
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:01,567
It turns out he never said that at all and you can you can look this up on YouTube

1594
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,127
I forget what he actually said

1595
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:10,271
But but it wasn't that and there's been a variety of examples within mainstream media

1596
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,295
Did you know that Jordan

1597
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
What freak out

1598
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,367
You didn't say Luke I'm your father

1599
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,671
Okay

1600
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:20,255
Hello most disappointing freakout ever

1601
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:26,911
So this is one of the lamest examples ever of the Mandela effect but it's one that everybody trots out because although

1602
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
Almost everybody has seen

1603
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,727
Star Wars search your feelings

1604
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,495
You know it to be

1605
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,519
Be true

1606
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,799
I am your father

1607
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,079
No

1608
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,127
Is that it

1609
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:40,991
No okay people tend to remember the line at the end of Empire Strikes Back is Luke

1610
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,783
I am your father but in reality

1611
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:43,807
Quite the line

1612
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,927
In the movie Luke's as a Darth Vader you killed my father and later replies know I am

1613
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:53,791
It's really easy to see how this could be quoted as Luke I'm your father to the point

1614
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,095
They're people just accept that that's how the line must

1615
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:56,863
Have been

1616
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,143
Discussing

1617
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,423
Out of context

1618
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,703
You're quoting the movie

1619
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:04,287
No I am your father Luke

1620
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:06,591
Have your father he never said Play It Again Sam

1621
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:07,615
Let's move on

1622
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:10,687
That's how it is pretty much all of these things

1623
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,735
Music it cited as examples of the Mandela effect

1624
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,807
They're all just things that are slightly off for what actual

1625
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:20,415
We happened because what actually happened to slightly offer what your brain would naturally assume

1626
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,975
The Berenstain Bears is remembered as barren

1627
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,743
Einstein bears

1628
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,303
Because Stein is a much more common Suffolk

1629
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,839
The last name

1630
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,703
Spain is just not as common all the people that are in Stein

1631
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,727
Forbearance

1632
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,007
And they don't have any

1633
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,055
Stains or any

1634
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:41,919
That would make you go like absolutely triggering your mind the demonic

1635
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,687
Or whatever the

1636
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:45,503
Associative device or in Reverse if they were barons

1637
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:48,319
16 bears but they had they were covered in stains

1638
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,343
Spend you remember this

1639
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,623
Very confused

1640
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,951
I've looked at a bunch of examples of the Mandela effect

1641
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,999
And pretty much all of them are somewhere in between

1642
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,303
Completely uninteresting and

1643
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,375
Mandela effect shift is good and fun

1644
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:05,983
And honestly if I think it's kind of neat to look at it as like a catalog in a little ways that we

1645
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,263
We miss Incorporated

1646
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,567
Information Network elective cultural memory

1647
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,591
Almost like it's

1648
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,895
The databases of times that we veered off

1649
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
From integrating

1650
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,943
Bison formation

1651
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,711
Referring

1652
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
Simplicity

1653
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,807
But it becomes really serious bulshit

1654
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,343
Seriously

1655
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:24,159
I tried to presented as a paranormal phenomenon

1656
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:24,927
Aldi

1657
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,951
Please grifters do

1658
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,743
It makes sense why they would

1659
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,791
The Mandela effect

1660
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
Its core is pointing out errors in

1661
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
Cultural memory

1662
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,935
And by definition we're all engaged with cultural memory

1663
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:40,031
Everyone is part of the culture takes some takes on some relation to it

1664
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,311
We draw

1665
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:46,943
If we didn't we have a much more difficult time relating to each other without shared reference

1666
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,223
Touchstone's

1667
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
And

1668
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,783
Easy ways to make metaphors

1669
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,111
Because we're all interacting with this Collective

1670
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,439
Did memory pointing out times when it was just slightly off

1671
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,999
Is compelling to a large number of people

1672
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:04,095
Almost every single person you'll ever ask about the Berenstein Bears

1673
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,887
Will think it's feldstein

1674
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,935
Because that's the way our culture ended up room

1675
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
Remembering the name

1676
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,775
Whenever you point out these little quirk

1677
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,311
You will get a response

1678
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,591
Out of most people

1679
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,639
Ranging from that's weird

1680
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,687
F****** way man

1681
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,223
And it's that response

1682
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,247
But you need in order to

1683
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,551
Injector Colonel and of doubt in them

1684
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,599
That reality Is Not What It Seems

1685
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,367
To beat

1686
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:30,975
You can take that visceral experience of learning that Darth Vader doesn't say Luke I am

1687
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,743
Your father

1688
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,767
And use it to say

1689
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,327
You were certain that he said Luke I'm your father

1690
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,911
So what else are you certain of that you might be wrong about

1691
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:44,287
In this way the Mandela effect it is a really useful entry point for paranormal grifters

1692
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,335
Do use to open their audiences mind

1693
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:50,175
Possibility that other complete horseshit they're trying to sell them might actually

1694
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:50,943
Maybe real even though

1695
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:55,807
That's why it's such a Mainstay of these weirdo grifters count

1696
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,623
So I'm not surprised to see both Kevin and Apex

1697
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
Stevie you're interested

1698
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,719
Yeah of course it's almost it's near Universal

1699
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,535
And I'm not saying that everybody talks about it is by default

1700
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,351
Engaging in some kind of Griff

1701
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,143
This is a strange thing

1702
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,423
You see it

1703
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,703
But the people who are

1704
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,471
Kind of really

1705
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,775
Those are the people you got to really look out for

1706
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:18,079
It is it is kind of an interesting

1707
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,383
Collective neurological

1708
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,711
You know it's like that that video where you see all those p

1709
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,991
People bouncing the ball around in

1710
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,271
Then there's the gorilla going through the

1711
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,039
Back through it

1712
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,343
And you're like why is it that my brain just

1713
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,111
Cut that out

1714
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,391
Why do I miss that

1715
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
And the same thing is

1716
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:35,231
Drew this on a macro scale like

1717
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,791
I'm I'm rewriting reality for my

1718
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,607
And then whenever you showed me that it's not

1719
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,887
I my discomfort

1720
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,655
Express

1721
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,983
Stop in a weird mood memory aren't things that

1722
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,263
Catalog things

1723
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,823
Directly in concrete ladies

1724
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,151
That is true on an individual level and it

1725
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,943
It's true on a cultural level

1726
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,271
And that

1727
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,807
Most of what explain

1728
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,415
I just

1729
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:07,743
Would you look at it on that level whether or not

1730
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
I do think

1731
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:09,791
Intentionally

1732
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,559
Deployed

1733
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,839
And weaponized in

1734
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,119
In some ways by the

1735
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
These folks

1736
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,703
For sure I do think that it is a

1737
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
Recruiting

1738
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,495
Kind of strata

1739
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,055
Did the space

1740
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,079
I think

1741
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,359
I think it's weaponized

1742
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,383
In the same way that

1743
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,943
So many games are are optimized

1744
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,015
Keep giving you that

1745
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,807
Yeah like when you're playing Candy Crush

1746
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,855
Like that they have psychologist

1747
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,415
Who spent their careers figuring out ways to

1748
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
Make you spend

1749
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,231
$0.20 every time you need to

1750
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,255
Press the button

1751
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,047
They give you that feedback loop

1752
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,583
True of this

1753
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,655
Blade

1754
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:52,287
The money they're going to find so many other things to the parallels of

1755
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,591
Bike stuff in Alex Jones is

1756
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,407
And the right-wing media strategies

1757
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,431
Used to like with him

1758
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,479
You can get a lot of people to like

1759
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:04,575
Freak out by then like agent of the Federal Reserve is private

1760
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:09,695
Like those sorts of entity called Federal level

1761
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:15,583
Mima type-6 aren't they serve to open you up to the Grandeur and larger

1762
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:16,863
Less

1763
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,167
Believable

1764
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:21,471
Right conclusion to they want to walk you

1765
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,751
And you can go just

1766
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
Just a little bit of

1767
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,591
Oh I thought I was certain it was spelled

1768
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359
Berenstein

1769
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,127
Bears

1770
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:31,199
Well if my memory is wrong about that

1771
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,991
What else could it be wrong of

1772
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,807
Sure that's one of the things

1773
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,879
That I actually I think is good and bad about

1774
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
It is really

1775
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,975
To think about these things that's fun to talk about

1776
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,767
The ways in which our memories

1777
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,047
To a certain extent

1778
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,327
Right

1779
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:48,863
I don't know

1780
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
That's my field

1781
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:53,471
Even more critical stance if you want to talk about it

1782
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
Honestly

1783
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,031
Yeah you can't talk about it

1784
01:15:56,287 --> 01:16:02,175
It's probably parallel Dimensions shifting you're probably

1785
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,199
Pull up

1786
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:03,967
Kazaam

1787
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,527
So in this next week we talked a little bit more about

1788
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
Is your Mandela

1789
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:13,951
I think they called the Mandela effect because they heard that Nelson Mandela had died

1790
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,487
Previous to when he acts

1791
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:19,071
Previously when he actually did and then a mass of people remembering

1792
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,863
He died on a certain day when he didn't

1793
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,935
And yes she lived for a while past then

1794
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:30,847
So there's a the end of the interesting thing is that if you go on Google and you go on Google Trends and search Nelson Mandela

1795
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,895
You can see it you see a big

1796
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
Spike

1797
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:37,247
I forget what it was but it was way previous times actual.

1798
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,527
I wasn't as big as a

1799
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,295
Despite obvious

1800
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,831
20 actually died

1801
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:44,671
But the spike was pretty sizable and it makes you wonder why that happened

1802
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
Wonder why

1803
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:48,255
So I consulted the Google Trends

1804
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,047
What you see is a relatively

1805
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
Wii flat gray

1806
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:51,839
With a giant

1807
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,119
Spike in December

1808
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:53,887
2013

1809
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,983
Which makes sense since Nelson Mandela died on December 5th 2013

1810
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,519
Oh yeah that be

1811
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,567
What makes slightly less

1812
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,103
Is it there's another Spike

1813
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,919
Smaller than the December one but it's still very

1814
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,711
June 23rd

1815
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:12,063
Now apextv was saying it was a long time before he died

1816
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,159
Sponging things a little bit

1817
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,695
There is still another Spike

1818
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:21,535
In cases like this it's important to consider possible explanations

1819
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,071
For jumping to conclusion

1820
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:23,839
Thickness

1821
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:26,399
Nelson Mandela died in June and then again in

1822
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,447
December

1823
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,007
Reply possibly alternate timeline

1824
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,823
Google Transit only reflects what people are searching

1825
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:37,151
So if they were searching for Nelson Mandela death

1826
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,455
It's entirely possible they were searching for those terms

1827
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,991
In order to find out if

1828
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
He was dead

1829
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,551
In 2013

1830
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,855
Nelson Mandela was 94 years old

1831
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,671
In an early June he was admitted to a hospital in

1832
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,975
Pretoria with a recurrence of a chronic lung infections

1833
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,535
The doctors initially put his condition

1834
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,327
Serious but stable

1835
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,351
But after a few weeks

1836
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,655
In the hospital he was downgraded to being in critical

1837
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,423
Condition

1838
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,447
South

1839
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:05,311
Can citizens held vigils outside the hospital and it became a really big deal with the media question

1840
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:09,151
You think of President Obama was going to be able to visit him while he was receiving treatment

1841
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:14,527
The South African press was reporting urgent meetings to quote discuss delicate matters

1842
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:17,855
Which painting interpreted as signs of them preparing for his Eminem

1843
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,135
Pass

1844
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,415
Outside

1845
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:22,207
December when he actually died

1846
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:26,303
June 2013 was the month when the most speculation about is

1847
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,583
Passing was done in

1848
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,351
In the Press

1849
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,887
Google Trends reflected

1850
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:30,911
Research Drive

1851
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,471
For people for his death

1852
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,007
Airtime that makes complete sense

1853
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:37,567
Unless you're willfully obtuse and wanama sleep

1854
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,591
Yeah yeah

1855
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,943
He was admitted to a hospital with a serious condition in June 2013

1856
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,015
Other spike is and then he died

1857
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,551
Fairly recently after that

1858
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,135
Use for it and then

1859
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,159
Unlike

1860
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,207
And then it just pasta

1861
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,231
To die down because

1862
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,767
Still alive

1863
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,559
So that big pushes everybody

1864
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,351
Getting all he's gonna die soon

1865
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:05,983
Right hand people writing articles about the possibility little passenger

1866
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:10,335
His legacy there's a lot of media attention on it when

1867
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:13,151
Heroic figure is 9

1868
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:19,551
94 years old it is hospitalized in serious but stable condition you've got to recognize that serious but stable at 9

1869
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:22,111
84 is back

1870
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,647
That's too bad

1871
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:24,927
Serious but stable

1872
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:30,303
We're hoping for 94 and a half you could make it to like

1873
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:33,119
Serious but stable at 94 is

1874
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,399
Not

1875
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,423
It's not a good product

1876
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:38,239
You're still you still could die at any point

1877
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:42,079
So people searching for you know Nelson Mandela death

1878
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
Makes total sense

1879
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,895
Trying to use that as some kind of a

1880
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,455
A piece of information that helps

1881
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,503
The Mandela effect look real

1882
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,039
Is just ludicrous

1883
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,087
Yeah that's responsible

1884
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,647
He said that it was called the Mandela effect

1885
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,671
People thought he died

1886
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,231
I got that

1887
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,255
Never understood

1888
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,047
This was why

1889
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,423
Not good because I sat from my memory

1890
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,447
I don't remember this is

1891
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,215
Exactly right

1892
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,007
But it's my son

1893
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:13,311
The people thought that he died while he was

1894
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,384
Oh it wouldn't have been a couple month

1895
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
Really

1896
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:23,296
President of South Africa after he was in prison

1897
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,344
None of it makes sense realized

1898
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
Nevermind

1899
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,928
When I last looked into it

1900
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,464
It was my

1901
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,744
Feeling

1902
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,280
That people were theorizing

1903
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
Figured I'd

1904
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:34,816
Years

1905
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,608
Oh okay this

1906
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,632
This couple months

1907
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,936
Before on the Google Trends

1908
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,496
That's not even in line with

1909
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,032
The furies

1910
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,800
That's wild

1911
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,080
I don't I don't know

1912
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:52,480
Could be that there was some dissident leader that died in prison don't go around that and then

1913
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,784
I don't I don't care to

1914
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,880
Bully try and figure out what these people are miserable

1915
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,696
Mandela was dead

1916
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:04,256
Delta do I apply for

1917
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,048
Universal negative

1918
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,120
So at this point Kevin

1919
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,400
I think he's doing a terrible

1920
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:11,680
And

1921
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,960
Rightfully

1922
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,008
He starts to get a little bit self-conscious

1923
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:15,776
The people will think this

1924
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,056
This is a softball interview

1925
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:22,944
S*** at it to my friends if they were watching this would be like being so soft in this interview is like

1926
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:23,968
Is old

1927
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:27,040
Cabinet also really difficult questions

1928
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:27,808
You know

1929
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,088
But the thing is

1930
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,112
Well

1931
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,952
It's not my pot phone to do that

1932
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,744
Do you know what I mean I'm what

1933
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,512
No I mean

1934
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,560
This is what you doing and end

1935
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:41,888
Whichever way this works out in the future is a fun interview right now

1936
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,424
Now

1937
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,472
What do I totally believe it

1938
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,520
No

1939
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:51,104
But then again I've come across so crazy

1940
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,176
You stuff so I can't say no totally yet you know what I mean

1941
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,992
I've had a UFO exist

1942
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,528
I can't prove that too

1943
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,832
Anybody give me to

1944
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,672
So this is just

1945
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,696
Sloppy

1946
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,976
This dude is a f******

1947
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:07,744
Psychopath

1948
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,792
That is the crazy s***

1949
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,584
You know it's not my

1950
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,352
What channel to do

1951
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,424
No it's your channel it's yours

1952
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:21,056
I do it when you translate that to I don't feel like being critical right now it didn't work

1953
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,616
And like you have a YouTube channel Where You Are

1954
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:26,432
Have demonstrated the capability of getting Millions

1955
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,456
Maybe

1956
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,992
That's it son of your days

1957
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:29,760
You're not

1958
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:30,528
Maybe you're not

1959
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,832
Averaging A million hits or whatever

1960
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,648
I mean if you go to their Channel they still have over a million

1961
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
Stripers

1962
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,720
Recognizes

1963
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,744
That very is a

1964
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,280
The possibility of

1965
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,328
I'm kind of advancement

1966
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,864
For his game

1967
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:48,448
That goes away if he starts being hyper

1968
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,216
Critical to him

1969
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,312
Channeling

1970
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,336
Somebody who was

1971
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:55,872
Traveler right

1972
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:56,896
Hold on

1973
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,576
Yeah it turns out as the mermaid

1974
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:10,464
Channel to do whatever he wishes to do today

1975
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,000
To do with it is not

1976
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:16,096
Critical it's not it's not take any position then

1977
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,424
What the f*** are you talking about

1978
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,728
This video is it for children

1979
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,080
Scampy's off kids yes

1980
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,664
It does feel like the type of interview

1981
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688
Be aware those two dudes

1982
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
Are like

1983
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
Whereabouts

1984
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,760
You're making money I'm making

1985
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,576
Weirdo

1986
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,880
You stealing people's money

1987
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:45,280
Yeah you run a psychic hotline does not it's not help

1988
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:49,120
You know you don't help disabuse yourself of that perception

1989
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,888
I am

1990
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:53,216
And I know Facebook is a

1991
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:56,544
Is a growing market for content

1992
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
Creators

1993
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:02,176
Free sample I posted a video on there are either our first interview with no I posted on there

1994
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,456
With no

1995
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,480
Nope

1996
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,808
Promotive in whatsoever that video somehow got six million views

1997
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:10,624
Within like the first week just on just on Facebook

1998
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,672
So I've been working a lot trying to

1999
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:17,792
I'll transcribe videos cuz of the vast majority of people watch Facebook videos watch them without sound

2000
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,608
So you're the one captions on it and everything

2001
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,144
But yeah I remember Noah mention

2002
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,424
YouTube will exist

2003
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,216
He's from the year 2030

2004
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,568
But I never I've never asked anybody

2005
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,104
From farther into

2006
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,152
Future if if YouTube's will still exist

2007
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,712
Yes it is it's amazing isn't it

2008
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,992
The Facebook just whooped

2009
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:37,760
What they doing

2010
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,552
Experiment

2011
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,368
Yeah yeah

2012
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,136
Yeah

2013
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,720
But you almost see this

2014
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,768
This way to monitor riser

2015
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:49,792
I think there is four

2016
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,072
Some yeah

2017
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,120
I don't know how that works.

2018
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
Saying amount

2019
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:00,032
Followers or likes on your Facebook page be able to monetize hidden day and they only to certain people

2020
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,056
But

2021
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:05,408
Yeah that's how and YouTube and yeah that's that's the main attraction to YouTube and

2022
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,968
Mostly like YouTube way more than Facebook

2023
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,272
Obviously way better platform overall

2024
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:14,368
Having a little bit of a business meeting about

2025
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,392
Bananas

2026
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
It's crazy

2027
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:20,768
You can't do this do this

2028
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:25,632
I don't even know what this is it's showing the cards a little

2029
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,912
Ridiculous

2030
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:30,496
Oh you do put that on Facebook

2031
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,288
That's what's that

2032
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,336
It does seem like a really good way

2033
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:37,920
Drive traffic to spiritualist

2034
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,456
Fortune tellers in the night

2035
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,784
Twenties in a goddamn feeder telling everybody exactly

2036
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,576
How they f****** lie to him

2037
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:51,232
I mean without the admitting were lying

2038
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:59,680
People watch them on mute cuz they autoscroll by then we got to have got to have subtitles on their good

2039
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,872
It's weird when you have like an hour to talk to a guy who knows Time Travelers

2040
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:11,968
It's significant amount of the time is spent like talking shop

2041
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,296
Just being a YouTube video make

2042
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,832
I mean

2043
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,904
I'm not going to blow this out of proportion

2044
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,208
Is really true

2045
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:27,584
If there was a real time traveler the world would f****** X

2046
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,352
Explode

2047
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,888
It is over

2048
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:32,192
Right it seems like it's a better use of time to

2049
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,216
To discuss that

2050
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:33,984
Stop

2051
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,008
Over

2052
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,288
How to

2053
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,312
No use social media

2054
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,848
It kind of feels

2055
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,128
Like that is a toy

2056
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:43,456
Tacit admission that what this guy does is Buzz

2057
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:46,016
As opposed to

2058
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,320
Yeah so I know this guy who

2059
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,856
The collapse of five dementia

2060
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,624
Single-spaced

2061
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,440
How do I monitor

2062
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,464
What's this song

2063
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
And again

2064
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,072
That's fine

2065
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,352
For him

2066
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,912
Do you know if that's what the game is

2067
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,704
I feel like Kevin Moore would like to

2068
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,752
To pretend that that's not what his game is

2069
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,288
But at the same time

2070
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,568
It takes on a different

2071
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,592
Feeling

2072
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:16,992
If you know it's not just a guy who's like hey here's a video some guy sent me claim to be a time traveler

2073
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,296
If he's involved

2074
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,368
In it it takes on a different feeling for me

2075
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,160
I'm not sure why

2076
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,232
I think that's important

2077
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,768
And this next clip

2078
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,048
Kind of bummed

2079
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,120
I deeply feel sorry for Noah because I

2080
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,912
We needed a light at

2081
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,240
With him in the lie detector said he was telling the truth

2082
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,264
On the

2083
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,824
When when he said he was a time traveler end

2084
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,664
If you telling the truth or not

2085
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,200
It's clear he's in a lot of

2086
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:50,528
It's clear he's very depressed season that he's in a lot of stress

2087
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:51,808
And

2088
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,624
I feel really bad for

2089
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:58,208
Well then in that nothing is behind the family is

2090
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
The

2091
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,024
Loved one in a woman

2092
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:04,864
He took it serious

2093
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
At this

2094
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:11,520
Point do like the ever come out with a video saying it like this guy's lying

2095
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:14,848
Okay check the weather video that recorded

2096
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,128
He's saying that

2097
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,688
This guy misses his family

2098
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,992
Well that's the from the future

2099
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,272
This guy

2100
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:26,880
Is coming around to being like well if he's telling the truth you know

2101
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:31,744
Whatever and if he's lying no matter what I feel bad for him alright

2102
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,072
Kevin is the one who comes in with the

2103
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,096
Assuming that it's

2104
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:39,168
They're separated from their

2105
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:47,872
Jcvd didn't love being away from his love or whatever it was this is not a critical look at any

2106
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:51,712
Kevin pretending to be doing an interview but honestly

2107
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,992
Just kind of hoping for some

2108
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,552
Clicks he doesn't have to work too hard for

2109
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,856
104 still going on

2110
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:01,440
Spell it's also interesting that Apex feel sad for Noah

2111
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,976
Even if Noah is running

2112
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,000
Monument

2113
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:04,768
This whole thing up

2114
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:05,536
It's clear that

2115
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,328
He's in a tough spot

2116
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,120
What an

2117
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,144
In person

2118
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,704
At this kind of thing you here and you just

2119
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,240
Help but think that he would

2120
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,008
Steer you wrong

2121
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,336
See him in such a bad spot and if he

2122
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,872
Telling me the truth or not

2123
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
I still want to

2124
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,176
Exploit his story

2125
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:29,344
Remember I told you earlier that this guy Jason came out and admitted that he was lying and pretending to be no other time trap

2126
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,904
Yes and how that video was put out by Apex

2127
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,696
Stevie but also kind of felt weird

2128
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,464
Yeah

2129
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:41,888
That video where Apex announces that Jason had lied to them and made it all up was uploaded on July

2130
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:43,168
23rd 29th

2131
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,216
When Mandela died

2132
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:47,264
The primary function of its

2133
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,824
Need to be to put all the responsibility for this scam

2134
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,848
I'm on this guy Jace

2135
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,896
He was one who made the stuff up

2136
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:56,480
But Apex was just passing along as information for you to decide what you think

2137
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,272
Think about I got to somebody getting sued

2138
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:01,088
I mean really when you get right down to it.

2139
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,624
Fact that they put out that video

2140
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,696
Is clear proof that Apex is willing to own up to its own mistakes

2141
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,976
And that it will even

2142
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,256
Themselves

2143
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,536
If they've stepped in

2144
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,888
In a completely bizarre and almost certainly unrelated Quentin

2145
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,704
10 days prior on July 13th

2146
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,824
Another person named Dennis Bell had posted a video where he revealed that he was Noah

2147
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,104
He was sick of playing

2148
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,664
The character no f****** s***

2149
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,480
He was scared the people would discern his identity and Docs

2150
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:32,576
So he decided the best way to minimize the threat was to address the issue head-on

2151
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,928
According to Dennis cute when he was 14 years old he was a kid make

2152
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,208
Comedy YouTube videos

2153
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:40,000
Posting a pretty much daily

2154
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:45,632
Who is channel he ended up meeting apextv who enlisted him to play the role of Noah

2155
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,472
He claimed that Apex pressured him to sign a non-disclosure agreement

2156
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,752
Which is kind of funny.

2157
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,288
Even if they ever took

2158
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:57,920
Come to court to enforce the NBA the obvious question of why they have an NDA active with a fourteen-year-old

2159
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:00,480
Who looks a lot like their time traveler would probably

2160
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
Like I'm up

2161
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:03,808
It really only useful as an intimidation

2162
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:04,576
Syntactic

2163
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,856
Against a 40

2164
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,136
15 year old

2165
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,160
Ridiculous

2166
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,976
Dennis alleges that he was paid by 8

2167
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,304
And they when they recorded the videos Everyone was just laughing

2168
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,584
Because of how stupid it was

2169
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:21,216
It'll be really easy to just take this as a guy was trying to get into the scam and involve himself

2170
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:23,264
Accepted his video includes

2171
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:29,664
Clips of the original Apex TV videos on additives

2172
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:36,064
Without his face blurred without his voice change

2173
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,344
Walking sound exactly like Jason

2174
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,880
The video of Jason

2175
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:42,208
He was no I did not look anything like that

2176
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,000
The unedited version

2177
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,584
Put out what does look a lot like

2178
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:50,912
Includes clips that Apex didn't release

2179
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:51,680
Initially

2180
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:53,472
It definitely indicate coach

2181
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,568
One of the more damning ones is probably a clip of Noah about to shake

2182
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,360
With his older self

2183
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,640
It begins with an R

2184
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,664
Camera voice saying

2185
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,432
Action

2186
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:08,320
It's kind of impossible for me to say like weather

2187
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:14,720
Whether or not this Dennis guy is 100% the kid in the original videos but they look very very similar

2188
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:17,024
Voice and manner is

2189
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:18,816
Personally

2190
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,608
Looks to me a lot like this kid selling the

2191
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,144
And those receipts

2192
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,192
Are pretty tough to explain otherwise

2193
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,216
Although that you can

2194
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,240
Okay

2195
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:28,544
Your shot Recreation videos of it

2196
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,592
I find that very unlikely

2197
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:31,872
How many ghosts

2198
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,152
Let's just be thing

2199
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:36,480
I'm still not sure I care about you

2200
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:42,112
Is there a big difference between soliciting independently created videos where people are pretending to be

2201
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,136
Time Travelers

2202
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,672
And creating videos your

2203
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,976
South where people pretend to be Time Travelers

2204
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:50,048
I'm not sure Hozier I'm not sure

2205
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,144
In the first case you're just posting b******* and profiting off it and in the process

2206
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,192
Probably enabling some Monteleone

2207
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:56,960
Unwell people

2208
01:32:57,216 --> 01:33:00,032
It down this road validating this

2209
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,080
In the second case

2210
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,104
You're perpetuating

2211
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,176
A fraud but it's also kind of in the realm of performance

2212
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:08,224
I'm fine with it

2213
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,016
I don't really know

2214
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,808
I think the big issue is present

2215
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:15,904
The fact that the channel portrays itself is just reporting on things

2216
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,696
You know like I was passing this along

2217
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,976
Welder in fact

2218
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,768
Apparently orchestrating those things

2219
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,048
Themselves

2220
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,840
Intrinsically dishonest and manipulative

2221
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:30,496
It'd be kind of like if we created a right-wing talk show host to say things that we wanted them to say so that we could cover the

2222
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,800
Right kind of a betrayal of the format

2223
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:35,872
Right whatever you're doing right I mean

2224
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,432
I feel like this is

2225
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,712
Ethical question

2226
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,016
Yeah about

2227
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:42,784
What is

2228
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:45,088
Already demonstrable

2229
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,368
Untrue

2230
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,464
And in ethical I think from a very fundamental standpoint

2231
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,488
A little bit

2232
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:54,048
Weight of a gray area

2233
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,840
In some ways

2234
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,864
Seems like it there's some

2235
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,168
It seems like what we're really dealing with

2236
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:02,240
Is an in at the collector in a game of

2237
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,008
4f

2238
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,312
You know where it's like

2239
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,336
Your you're

2240
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,616
Too far

2241
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,408
Yeah I'm fine with your

2242
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:13,504
I would say it's an unethical actor inside a game apps

2243
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:19,136
Cuz that's a good way around online

2244
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,976
Whimsically in ethical or unethical

2245
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:23,744
It's just

2246
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:25,792
Is what it is

2247
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:26,816
Your

2248
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:30,400
Doing it right you're making me feel bad that's what it is

2249
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:33,728
I think that there are added considerations when

2250
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,496
The appearance

2251
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,800
They are that you're actually running a hoax

2252
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:39,360
As opposed to just being bulshit

2253
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:40,384
Yeah

2254
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:44,224
I don't know what I don't know what the internet difference but I'm

2255
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:44,992
And it's there

2256
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:49,344
Yeah I don't think I don't think Immanuel Kant

2257
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,624
Never had to deal with this

2258
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,904
Exact question

2259
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,184
It's okay

2260
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,464
This guy dentist

2261
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
She comes out with these

2262
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:58,048
Claims that he's making and the video in

2263
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,840
Including the the footage

2264
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,960
Which some of them are you could say our recreate

2265
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,264
A video of him standing

2266
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
Like

2267
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,080
In front of line of trees

2268
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:16,480
Saying something version and then the unpixelated version

2269
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:19,040
But you could say I call maybe you just went out and shot.

2270
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:23,648
Really tough to get around is the one of him like

2271
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:24,928
Meeting his older self

2272
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,464
But because that

2273
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:30,304
Matches the video that apextv put out

2274
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,912
Okay you put out the one with his face unblurred

2275
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,472
Okay

2276
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,264
It's tough to get around

2277
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,360
And so he puts this out and then just a little bit later

2278
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,408
Apex puts out there version

2279
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:48,224
With a guy claiming I'm no I was lying

2280
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,248
I suspect

2281
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:52,576
Why they put that video out

2282
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,880
It feels like damage control

2283
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:55,904
Probably was

2284
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,720
Cuz it's not that big a deal to the presentation

2285
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,000
Show me the Channel with one of their source

2286
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,280
Turns out to be a liar

2287
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:04,352
No one perfect and we're all going to fall for something at one point in our life

2288
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,424
It's a much bigger deal for their presentation if

2289
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:12,032
The impression is that there just creating bulshit on their own and passing it off as if it could be

2290
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,312
It's the difference

2291
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,360
Gina you would pay and trusting

2292
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,640
People and a hook

2293
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:20,224
Exposes naive might hurt your reputation a little

2294
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:24,064
But being a hoax or really destroys any possibility of future credibility

2295
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,088
But again

2296
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,368
I don't care that much

2297
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,928
But the idea that like

2298
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,976
A 14 15 year old is being put in this

2299
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
Kind of position

2300
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,768
Makes me pretty on

2301
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,048
How old is he

2302
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,608
When you made that video so I guess that's cool

2303
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,400
Oh man

2304
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,680
Yeah

2305
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:43,008
This still kind of falls under the heading of like this is what lame grifter

2306
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,032
On YouTube do

2307
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,568
Yeah kind of the Wild West

2308
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,640
It's not that interesting

2309
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,408
Big picture

2310
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:52,736
It is interesting to me that Kevin Moore is interested in talking

2311
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:55,552
This guy giving it an ounce of this could be real

2312
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,320
To him

2313
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,368
That indicates a complete inability

2314
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:01,184
Or unwillingness to critically engage with the subject

2315
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:01,952
Discovering

2316
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,488
And In fairness to him

2317
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:07,840
The stuff about Noah being fake hadn't come out by the time he made this video there were list

2318
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,608
Me too

2319
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:10,400
But the stuff about the Swedish insurance

2320
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,424
Commercial hat

2321
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:13,984
There were plenty of red flags that would suggest

2322
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,520
But maybe this operation isn't

2323
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:21,152
Open up even by the almost non-existent standards of the Paranormal YouTube to me

2324
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:22,944
Kevin Moore

2325
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,224
Is not a critical voice

2326
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,784
There's something else going on with his beef

2327
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,344
I'm not sure what it is

2328
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,392
But I need to figure it out

2329
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:36,768
I don't know if we'll ever have been able to get to the bottom of it right but there's something rotten in Denmark

2330
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:39,584
Thanks

2331
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,376
There's nothing rotten there it's an insurance

2332
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:49,312
If there's one thing that we've learned or I've learned from

2333
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:51,616
We listen to a couple of his

2334
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,432
As long as he has a personal connect

2335
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,968
He will let

2336
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:56,736
Anything Goes

2337
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,064
Maybe I mean that is or or better yet

2338
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:02,112
As long as he doesn't have a personal Vendetta

2339
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:05,184
Or the door if he has a reason to

2340
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,000
To think that this could be an Avenue for greater exposure

2341
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:10,048
I know that does also

2342
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,608
Is this behavior that he's doing here he doesn't know this

2343
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,400
Not friends with him

2344
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,216
Beer

2345
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:22,592
What it comes down to for me is I think that this episode like when I said that it's beneath us

2346
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:25,920
I think because this apextv s*** is super lame

2347
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:29,760
The revelation of it being fake

2348
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:32,832
First of all is assumed

2349
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:34,624
And the fact that it's a hoax

2350
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,392
Is likewise

2351
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,416
Expect that

2352
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:40,000
I don't know how much more unethical it makes it

2353
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,280
Then then what

2354
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,560
Did it originally is

2355
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,864
Hoax video is

2356
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,888
I think the hoax

2357
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,680
Taking over the truth

2358
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,728
That's the part that I think

2359
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:50,496
He's genuinely

2360
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,264
Morally

2361
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:56,384
Bad that's when that's when we've crossed the the gray area into

2362
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,920
You guys know what you're doing and

2363
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,456
When you're trying to steal this

2364
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,224
This story

2365
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,248
You're creating a hoax

2366
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:07,648
At your own hope I could I could yeah I definitely see that it like cover

2367
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,696
Drop is worse than the car

2368
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:11,232
Definitely intent behind

2369
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:14,304
And I definitely don't think that it's not worth

2370
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,864
Considering the idea that I can't

2371
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,168
Dennis guy is

2372
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,192
Telling the truth

2373
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:26,592
Then what's going on is really inappropriate behavior with a minor

2374
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:29,664
Uncomfortable he was as it went along and

2375
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,944
He started to get harassed

2376
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,712
Messages

2377
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:36,064
People started to try and figure out who

2378
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,344
Equation

2379
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,136
Is probably legally action

2380
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:45,792
I don't know if it is but it's definitely not something that someone with good intent would do for sure while I mean

2381
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,328
It's a line past which you

2382
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,864
You should not venture

2383
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,888
Kind of what kind

2384
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:51,936
Guardianship do we have going on there too

2385
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:56,544
Did the guardian sign s*** did you know

2386
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,848
Nmda as well that's traveled

2387
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,384
You got to assume but like

2388
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,152
If your apparel

2389
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,176
A decent

2390
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,200
Perine and like

2391
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,272
Video

2392
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:09,088
Yeah you're not

2393
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,368
Go off at that

2394
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,416
Batman technology just move too fast

2395
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,464
You have no f******

2396
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,768
Conclude I want to send her this

2397
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:22,912
Mad when I was a kid all you had to worry about a fourteen-year-old boy doing

2398
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,936
Was jacking off in the back

2399
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,472
And now

2400
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:29,824
Now now he's creating space hoaxes

2401
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:33,920
I want to I want to refocus this because all that stuff

2402
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,688
Is

2403
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,712
Nebulous

2404
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:37,504
I don't

2405
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:41,856
Apextv is not something that I care to be on my radar

2406
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,136
Except as

2407
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:44,416
Away with

2408
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,440
Which weekend

2409
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:47,744
Kevin Moore more clearly

2410
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,512
And that's

2411
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,536
Really what I'm interest

2412
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,072
I'm interested in

2413
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,096
This

2414
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:55,168
We are b*******

2415
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,496
But it's not only that

2416
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,288
Like Kevin Moore

2417
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:03,872
To Safeway Richard Belzer was not a passive

2418
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:07,712
Actors on the day of the Boston bombing when he was a guest on Alex Jones Show

2419
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,736
He was a participant

2420
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:13,088
Kevin Morris trying to become a little bit of a participant in this charade

2421
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,624
What if you stumbled across

2422
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,904
Excellent care that's not what it says

2423
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:16,928
To be but it's

2424
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:19,488
Yeah that

2425
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,048
I don't know like

2426
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:24,352
What would you say for example

2427
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,216
I don't know well it's it's

2428
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:34,080
What's that movie where they that they the people become the host of

2429
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:34,848
Simon Cowell

2430
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:38,688
The guest

2431
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:39,712
Is that the movie

2432
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,480
Thinking of

2433
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,016
I don't know why

2434
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,808
Okay that's putting out loud

2435
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,344
But the idea that

2436
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,624
You know

2437
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:51,744
Yeah that that people have taken over by high for other reason

2438
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,608
You know that major and again as you say

2439
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,168
Yes possible right I mean

2440
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,192
I'm trying to get

2441
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:02,240
Yeah makes sense

2442
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,032
I can make sense of it

2443
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,616
He's trying to apply fake maybe it's demons

2444
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:10,688
Play some other dimensional

2445
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:15,296
Play Space little things that go in your ear Josh Hartnett was involved I guess meth kills them I'm not sure

2446
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:18,112
Don't try any yes

2447
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:21,952
You care about the credibility of your community

2448
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,488
Your space weirdo community

2449
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:25,280
You want to be like you know

2450
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:28,864
Settling people we want to be we demand to be taken seriously

2451
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:32,704
It kind of behooves you to not be like I maybe these folks

2452
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,240
Right right right

2453
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,032
I think your people are making this up

2454
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:36,800
No

2455
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,080
Very much like a

2456
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,664
In in his own way it's like if your

2457
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,712
Doing an interview on

2458
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,736
Stalking Fox News

2459
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,784
You answer one of the questions

2460
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,576
And then you return it back with them

2461
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:51,392
Oh well how do you think it's possible for us to

2462
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:53,440
Isn't that he just comes up with a

2463
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:55,744
The anchor comes up with a reason that

2464
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,512
That your ship May

2465
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,048
For you

2466
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:00,352
That's that you f****** everybody over

2467
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:03,168
If you are participating your escalator

2468
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,192
Exactly

2469
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,728
And enabling

2470
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,544
Is absolutely

2471
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,080
In this next clip Apex

2472
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:13,152
Is talking about how people think that they're involved

2473
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:17,248
With the people that they feature in their videos which they very well may be

2474
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,296
Apparently that's a criticism

2475
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,368
It some people have

2476
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,392
I can't imagine why

2477
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:26,208
And so he addresses that

2478
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,232
And again

2479
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,512
Kevin is enabling

2480
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,608
It's been a lot of misunderstanding though people thinking we're in on these videos

2481
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,632
And

2482
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,472
I am planning on making a video soon explaining to people because

2483
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:41,568
I don't think people get that we're not affiliated with these people that were interviewing

2484
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,360
And there's been a lot of people

2485
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:47,968
Who who don't really get it and I should make a video soon talking about

2486
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:52,320
How we don't know these people and just explain things put things in your car

2487
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:55,136
Where you can see how people would think that cuz I would think will these

2488
01:43:55,392 --> 01:44:00,512
The friends of yours you know these are people or actors that uniform other countries that you paid and

2489
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,584
You know this makeup involvement

2490
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,352
Everything cows

2491
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,144
You know you don't revealing yourself

2492
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:08,192
Can you can understand why they thinking

2493
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:09,728
People but

2494
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,592
Well I guess you already thinking along those lines

2495
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,128
Volvo putting some account back

2496
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:21,504
Real wishy-washy

2497
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:23,552
A wishy-washy

2498
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,320
You can see

2499
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,856
Easy as nobody would think

2500
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:26,624
Fat butt

2501
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:31,744
I think you've already got that one under

2502
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,328
The controller that's such a I got nothing

2503
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,400
I don't have the nerve to say

2504
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,680
Clear that's what

2505
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:40,704
Your phone

2506
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:42,752
The fact that you

2507
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,288
Like he does bring the

2508
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
A couple time

2509
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,592
This interview it does

2510
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:50,432
Indicating singularly focused with pushing back on that

2511
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:56,320
Yeah in the same way that when they put out there video with Jason revealing that he had lied to them

2512
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:58,880
Was also to serve the purpose of like

2513
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:02,208
We were the ones who were lied to we had nothing to do with this

2514
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,768
You push back on that

2515
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:05,536
Maybe it's

2516
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:06,560
Because you're

2517
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:07,328
Self-conscious

2518
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:11,168
It's about the fact that you're doing that

2519
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,448
Yeah it's part of your

2520
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,776
And also part of your

2521
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,312
Layer of

2522
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,592
Protection

2523
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:21,152
The moment you're involved in making them

2524
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:23,456
Alright guys get out of

2525
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,736
Get the f***

2526
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:28,320
It's easier to write off it's like if we actually had stay

2527
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,344
Kubrick

2528
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,880
Filming the moon landing

2529
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:31,904
Then it's

2530
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,696
We're all like okay get the f*** out of here

2531
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,768
We know you're all

2532
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:40,096
I don't know if it extends that far but I give you a call

2533
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:44,448
So why we get to the end of this interview and we get to see that

2534
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,472
Kevin Moore

2535
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,496
Great judge of care

2536
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:50,336
You seem to be a really nice guy right

2537
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,872
Uh Manoa

2538
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:55,456
You know you just easy to speak to you know you're you're

2539
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:57,504
Did you get it all together and

2540
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:02,880
It's fun right you having a little fun right now

2541
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,928
This Is How We Do I would say

2542
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,208
No

2543
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:07,232
But I know very little.

2544
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,768
Is probably a full-time job

2545
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:10,560
Miss going

2546
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,352
Yeah yeah

2547
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:14,400
Making a lot of those bucks

2548
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:21,312
So I mean that's cool I don't begrudge anyone making a living doing what they love to do haven't a lot of fun

2549
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,360
Are people listening

2550
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:24,640
People watching

2551
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,408
Video

2552
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,432
What do you mean

2553
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:28,224
People actually watch that video

2554
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:31,296
The video of Kevin interview

2555
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:35,392
Not as many as watching the time traveler video stores like

2556
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,672
Anybody watch that

2557
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,696
Wasn't

2558
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:41,280
Trying to find out more about SEO and f******

2559
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:45,376
Viewers like this I don't know how this is a non-business

2560
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,656
Video at all

2561
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:49,472
This gets back to my point that I made at the beginning of this

2562
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,240
Which is like

2563
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:52,288
I don't really care to attack this

2564
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:57,664
Online immersive entertainment kind of thing too much because I'm not fully convinced

2565
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,712
That most of the people taking in

2566
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:01,504
The time traveler videos

2567
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,528
Actually think

2568
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,832
But it's real so I'm

2569
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,624
Super interested in

2570
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:07,648
End

2571
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:10,720
Like the idea that someone would watch this video Kevin talking

2572
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:12,000
Dammit somehow like

2573
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,024
Debunked

2574
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:19,424
The time traveler videos cuz like

2575
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,704
I don't feel like that's

2576
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,752
Even a concern

2577
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:26,080
It's more about Kevin I know I agree

2578
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:28,384
I mean more like I don't understand

2579
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,408
Kevin

2580
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:30,944
Has no idea what

2581
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,736
What an entertaining interview

2582
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:35,296
No like no clue

2583
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:40,672
Which might explain his lack of

2584
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,976
Much more focused on hard-hitting question

2585
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,000
About these

2586
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:45,792
Even

2587
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:48,352
Let's hard-hitting questions about the time traveler

2588
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:52,192
Wild speculations and enjoying and having a fun time

2589
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:53,728
Like on Project Camelot

2590
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:54,752
Cary's great

2591
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:56,544
Skill as an interviewer is

2592
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,872
Ben Wilde along with everybody else

2593
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:03,712
Not like being okay Eddie page

2594
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:04,992
What's your hit count

2595
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:07,296
On an average Twitter post

2596
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:10,624
Right right

2597
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,904
Would be less energy

2598
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:15,232
To say that Carrie is very entertaining.

2599
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
So yeah

2600
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,328
I don't know I'm going to skip this clip

2601
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,352
Got a sad

2602
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:23,424
It's just that Kevin talking about how Apex TV has a

2603
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,960
How can you trust them

2604
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:25,984
Repeat

2605
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,008
I have to work alone

2606
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:30,336
Really hate Kevin I really hate it

2607
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,384
Out of deep and abiding level he

2608
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:34,176
I don't

2609
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:38,272
Yeah I mean there's there is a pastor this to him

2610
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:41,088
A real slipperiness

2611
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:42,112
But I also think

2612
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,392
I think there is just a huge

2613
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,928
He's not very good at this

2614
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:46,976
Right he wants to do this

2615
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,256
And I think

2616
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,024
Mickey's dumb

2617
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,584
Yeah I think that there are those elements of it

2618
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,656
Lot of it lot of that

2619
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:56,192
Could explain some of the stuff

2620
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:58,496
Comes off as slippery today

2621
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:00,288
There could be a lot less

2622
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,568
Evil intention

2623
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,128
They could be explained by incompetence

2624
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,688
And kind of being gullible and dumb

2625
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:07,968
I don't know

2626
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:09,504
I I think though

2627
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,784
Even with those qualities

2628
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:13,088
It's very clear there's also a naked

2629
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:20,256
So yeah One Last Cry. It's just how they sort of

2630
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:23,328
And things but listen I really appreciate what you doing

2631
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,608
I think it's fascinating

2632
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,376
And stuff

2633
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:27,936
You know

2634
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:30,496
Are good on you for doing it that's all I'll say

2635
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:34,848
Good on you while I appreciate what you doing good on you

2636
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:37,920
Talking and everything is like

2637
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:40,992
Yeah there's a lot

2638
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:41,760
Well I mean

2639
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:44,576
That's part of not preparing at all

2640
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,344
That's fair

2641
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,624
I would say

2642
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,184
That is a terrible showing

2643
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:53,536
The identity answer with like I appreciate what you're doing good on you for what you're doing.

2644
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,584
In this

2645
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:59,680
F****** interview that he talked to a guy who claimed to be a mermaid

2646
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:05,312
Some of the people who are Time Travelers are clearly lying to him

2647
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:07,360
I don't understand

2648
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,640
If you want

2649
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:10,688
To just be like we are doing

2650
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,712
A large

2651
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,480
Scale

2652
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:14,272
Immersive

2653
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,552
Entertainment thing

2654
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:18,624
Where people lie to us and then we pass it off as truth

2655
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:21,440
I'm not all that mad at that

2656
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:23,488
Kevin's trying to

2657
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:24,768
Play that game

2658
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:25,536
Yeah

2659
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,560
So he shouldn't

2660
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:28,864
Taking somebody who appears to be

2661
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:29,632
Be doing

2662
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:31,936
LARPing

2663
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:38,336
Yeah bulshit I was just I was just saying it's almost like a

2664
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,104
Channel vet

2665
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,152
Should exist in an alternate universe

2666
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:45,248
You know what I'm saying like where where this s*** is

2667
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:47,040
True that's where they're LARPing

2668
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,576
It's Unbecoming

2669
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:49,344
For Kevin

2670
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,624
To be this

2671
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:51,648
Uncritical

2672
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,000
Whatever judge

2673
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,280
I'm at the side that I have

2674
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,816
For whatever Apex

2675
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,632
I have strong judgment for Kevin

2676
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,912
Because like you can

2677
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,704
Can't do both

2678
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,520
Trying to take down Mark Richards

2679
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:10,080
Because he's an affront to the community

2680
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:12,384
Appreciate and applaud

2681
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,664
What are fake

2682
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:20,064
Time travel bulshit clickbait nonsense

2683
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,856
It leads me to believe

2684
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:23,648
B something is in

2685
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:24,416
Sincere

2686
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:27,488
And based on everything else I have all the other info

2687
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,256
Information of Kevin

2688
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,024
Between

2689
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,096
His weirdo channeling video

2690
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:38,496
Other videos that I've watched it his where he is woefully uncritical of other people

2691
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:41,312
Is the being critical of Mark Richards and carry

2692
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,616
Because

2693
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:45,152
We have a long-standing

2694
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:46,432
Interaction

2695
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:49,760
Project Camelot

2696
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:55,904
I feel like I'm the only person

2697
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,000
So Jordan

2698
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:02,304
I would like to Wenatchee right now

2699
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:06,400
I am going to make a documentary about Kevin Bull

2700
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:10,240
I'm not going to do that

2701
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,776
You are absolutely right

2702
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:14,592
I'm not going to do that but I'm going to look into this

2703
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:18,176
Much further

2704
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:19,200
Who is

2705
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:20,224
Fukkit

2706
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:24,832
Deep In The Weeds enough to really get to the bottom of this Feud

2707
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,368
The only person who has

2708
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,160
Any kind of grasp on reality

2709
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:34,560
Terry her friends are too busy trying to say that this guy is working for the spider leadership in the Illuminati

2710
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:37,888
That my friend is a non-starter

2711
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:40,192
We'll talk to a time traveler maybe he'll figure

2712
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,240
I can't go down that road

2713
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,264
That's not going to happen

2714
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:45,056
Let's not going to be good

2715
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:46,592
So this

2716
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,128
It is

2717
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:50,176
Something that I need to get to

2718
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:51,968
I'm going to get into this

2719
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:57,088
I'm going to try and solve this mystery of why Kevin Moore care so much

2720
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,880
About this

2721
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,928
I think that's the fun part of this

2722
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,976
Far more than any

2723
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:03,744
Kind of

2724
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,048
Proof of them lying or like

2725
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:07,328
Carrie's b******* about

2726
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:10,400
Getting to the bottom of this weird

2727
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:12,704
Personal or professional fight

2728
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:13,728
The two of them

2729
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:16,544
Has a far greater likelihood of like puncturing there

2730
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,360
Their Mystique bubbles of space we're done

2731
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:21,408
If you just go down to it you're like

2732
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:22,176
Oh his

2733
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:22,944
Mom

2734
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:29,344
It's her dad like it's their stepdad and montagues and capulets

2735
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:31,904
That's

2736
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:32,672
Real

2737
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:35,744
Reinvigorating my entry

2738
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,816
Things a little bit because it actually is something that like

2739
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:41,376
Maybe you could get to the bottom of what the f***** going on here

2740
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:44,960
I'm never going to be able to tell you whether spider aliens are real or not we can

2741
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:46,496
Safely say

2742
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:48,544
No evidence for that right but

2743
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,336
This is this.

2744
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,104
Seem like something I

2745
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:51,872
I can maybe Dig Inn

2746
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:53,920
Yeah I do feel reinvigorated

2747
01:53:54,432 --> 01:54:00,576
About the Project Camelot / Kevin war world I do not about the Project Camelot Studios

2748
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:04,160
Very distant

2749
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:10,304
I'm a goddamn Hercule Poirot mustache

2750
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:13,632
So that's something else I'll be engaging in

2751
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:16,704
I hope you all have enjoyed this

2752
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,728

01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:21,568

Mermaid

2756
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,432
Yeah

2757
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:28,224

2758
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:28,992

01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:39,744
Trying to channel

01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:44,096
Person who asks a follow-up question

2764
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:44,864
That would be good

2765
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,400
All you can go with Dan Rather

01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:47,424
