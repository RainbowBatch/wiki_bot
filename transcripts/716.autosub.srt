1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,632
Hey everybody this is an hello I just wanted to drop in

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,168
And give a little bit of a note

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,472
I'll before this episode begin

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,776
And the reason for that is because

5
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:18,176
I kind of screwed up a little bit on the recording of this episode and so some of the levels are a little bit

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,200
Eufy

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,088
I'm open using a technology the chance be named less I be shifting

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
Some some business but a remote recording and it seems like everything was totally fine as

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
We were recording

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:36,864
And our guests actually very generously offered to record on their end

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,168
Because I had so much confidence

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,960
Then they suck this deck

13
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,312
I thought like that there's no need to this is worked just fine at the past

14
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:50,688
I'm and unfortunately some of the audio is a little bit over

15
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:56,320
Total bit distorted but it still sounds fine it's just a little bit

16
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,136
It's it said it could be a little cleaner

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,000
Anyway this is a rambling long-winded way for me to just give you a heads-up about that

18
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,560
I have to take responsibility

19
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,376
The sounds of a messed up a little bit

20
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
Anyway we'll be back on Wednesday with a normal episode with Jordan back but for now please

21
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,104

We are here and we have just had a week of a break

31
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,248
And if truth be told

32
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,832
I was under the impression that Jordan would be getting back over the weekend

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
And that we could get back to work

34
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,440
And do our job as normal but

35
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
This is not the case

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Jordan will not be back until

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Til Tuesday

38
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,328
It's an order to get an episode out I had to

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Dig deep

40
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,936
And find someone who's capable of

41
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Of Jordan

42
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752

We can go trios

50
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,184
I like that Jordan is a great or do you mean

51
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,816
If we like the way that we got it set up was pretty smooth and eat like so I feel like we're like

52
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
There's a

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
There's a synergy

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
Yeah definitely

55
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,752
I know that over the course of the time doing your podcast

56
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
You've touched on some

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,640
Of the I don't know maybe some things that are connected to my world

58
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,224
Do you know like the Jade Helm episode

59
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
Cliven Bundy

60
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Perhaps

61
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
Yep our God

62
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160

63
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208

Syria

66
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,888
I was wondering how much connection do you have to Alex Jones

67
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,728
What's a Whataburger Olivia the show 0

68
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752

00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Tons

70
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,592
Yeah close to Alex

71
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,784
Dave and Alex are really good for a lot of people say that they get Dave and Alex confused

72
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
I think their personalities would match amazed

73
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,160
World

74
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
We just

75
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
I would call it vibe

76
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
We Vibe

77
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,583
And we have we have a lot of the same sort of philosophy

78
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
Sophie's and just outlook on life

79
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
And protein powder

80
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
Climate change real

81
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
Let's hear one

82
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
That's me

83
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
Lizards

84
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
Do you got

85
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
I don't think we real

86
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
We've not no it's not really gotten

87
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
Into Alex

88
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,063
Ever if anything it would be

89
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Yeah maybe just mine early

90
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,183
On the show yeah little avoided I've always

91
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Avoided him

92
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
Completely black I really know about him

93
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
Is listening to your podcast yeah

94
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,375
I'll pop interview with all this he was going out to Jonesboro

95
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
But I

96
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
For the most part I don't really pay

97
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
And it seems like he's had a quiet couple weeks

98
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
Yeah it's been it's been real time

99
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
He has

100
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
I think

101
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,479
Abandoned Trump again

102
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,343
So that took it that's a good sign for the

103
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
FBI rate

104
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
I know someone who

105
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
Who punched him and knocked him

106
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767

108
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Texas

109
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
Exist

110
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
No this is a guy named Charlie

111
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
I'm a conversation we're having fun

112
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
Sidelines right now

113
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
Is it space Hitler no Charlie Sheen

114
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
Now Charlie is a guy who is

115
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Associated with

116
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
The Fest

117
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Someone Austin

118
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
South Bay

119
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Southwest

120
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
Oh wow he punched him huh

121
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
88fuck

122
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Could knock them down

123
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,095
They were working at Radio

124
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
I believe

125
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
They got into one

126
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Tribeca

127
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Charlie to this days

128
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
Still gets free beers

129
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
In Austin

130
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
You get you get local hero status

131
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
Ambulance

132
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,759
That's that's pretty

133
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
That's pretty awesome I guess

134
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,647
I mean I'm not thrilled with violent citipointe but

135
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
If it's violence 20 years ago and it

136
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
It's funny like I said I would

137
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
I would like

138
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
I would like to say that I am

139
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,143
Just if I did have another just paid him

140
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,727
Yeah I think that might be the same guy

141
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,311
Cuz there was a dude who would like troll him on his Public Access show

142
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,639
And the and they ended up getting into a fight in the parking lot

143
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
I think

144
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
I think the space Hitler

145
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Was there

146
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
And

147
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
That was the same night in

148
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Into guys

149
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
I hit

150
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,463
Can I just sit there was also involved

151
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
Different guy though

152
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:01,631
Oh yeah how much that sounds like it would be something on Infowars what just was said

153
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,287
I think I think space Hitler was there but there were two guys in the parking lot.

154
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,103
Infowars.com

155
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:16,479
Hitler was on the grassy knoll

156
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,855
Cena's didn't even like even before like present-day so did you

157
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,951
You didn't have any kind of like impression of Alex Jones as a figure like

158
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,791
Oh yeah it was somebody who existed

159
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,447
No we just never talked about him on the show really but yeah obviously I mean I it's hard to even remember

160
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
When

161
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
You first heard about him but

162
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
Yeah I mean obviously been following

163
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
His lunacy for

164
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
The better part of a decade

165
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,991
Yeah but I purposely got them away not too

166
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
Washington I just don't

167
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,855
Watch anything with him or like when I see clips of them online

168
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,695
But I've heard about him for a long time now and I've definitely read

169
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
A couple articles about him

170
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
And then your

171
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,583
I listened to both the documentary episodes

172
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Which were long but

173
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Crazy

174
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,215
Yeah that they got me soap tweeted by the director

175
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Really

176
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
I got white

177
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,431
It to her right is not yeah yeah yeah she said she did a terrible

178
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,831
There's a lot going on with Alex in the in the present day

179
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,855
Like you mentioned

180
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Slow week

181
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
He's going through a lot of things

182
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
He's having

183
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Tantrums

184
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
But I felt like

185
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,399
Getting into all that might be too much might be throwing you guys into the deep end

186
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,727
And I didn't want to put you through that that's all

187
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,311
That's what I wanted to do is I wanted to do something a little bit special for

188
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
And

189
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,127
Yeah a lot of X listener

190
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
We'll get in touch with us and asked us to do an episode about their birthday

191
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,783
Like what happened on my birthday on

192
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
On Infowars

193
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
Answer what I figured I would do

194
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Is I would take us back

195
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Due April 25th

196
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
2014

197
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,583
The day you guys put out your first episode of the dollop

198
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,167
Was doing

199
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
This is around I mean Jade Helm was starting to kick up

200
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
That was a veteran that heat was a little bit more in the 15

201
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
You know right wasn't it wasn't okay

202
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
I believe so

203
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
Is the Bundy I mean our first episodes the Bundy

204
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,783
I was right in the Bundy rage

205
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
Yeah he was there already was into that

206
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,927
See ya this that there's a lot of news going on at that point

207
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
In 2014

208
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
He knows there's plenty going on

209
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
And

210
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,143
I think will be disappointed to learn about what most of this episode ends up being about butts

211
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,471
Let's let us dive in here at the beginning

212
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
This is how Alex is starting off the show

213
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,615
Ukrainian helicopter hit by grenade taking off

214
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
Ukraine helicopter

215
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,991
Hasn't crippled in a grenade attack in Kiev warned Moscow has engineering

216
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
Taquan Telegraph headline

217
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
That is

218
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,023
By the way home for their bikes El Presidente

219
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
Miniature ready to fight

220
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
Is the headline from the associated

221
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Depressed

222
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,751
Together we have we go back into the past and receive something

223
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
Pretty reminiscent of recent news

224
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Wow

225
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
Yeah

226
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Who took

227
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
That that's one of the problems

228
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,575
Them is that sometimes he sounds like that and then other times he's

229
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
Well here's the problem that's just him reading Headley

230
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:43,327
Eez to sound fairly rational when you're just like

231
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
Cold reading

232
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
Here is a things that happened

233
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Yeah

234
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:53,311
But then you get into the the analysis of it and it might be a little bit a little bit silly are here

235
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,175
And that is in blaming essentially the West

236
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,735
Is what caused the 2014

237
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
Outbreak of hostilities between

238
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Ukraine

239
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,207
When in three months ago when Ukraine voted to not

240
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
Enemies

241
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
The Russian spider

242
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
Cyborg

243
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Spider

244
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
10 times bigger

245
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
More evil

246
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
Happy to be in power and control

247
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,439
A larger ruski population

248
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
Pens attacking anything

249
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:57,823
I see I see you're trying to make make sense of this day if you're weird you're tracking

250
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
I've trying to track this out

251
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
And it's

252
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
Very hard to track but I will say

253
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,575
I do like the idea of calling the EU a spider

254
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
Moscato Webb

255
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,743
It's going to suck you dry I like the sucking dry spider it's almost like

256
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
I mean you know how it is like when you do a podcast you'll say

257
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,887
Stop your bike doesn't make sense and you kind of let it die

258
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,727
Quadrupling down on the spider talk

259
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,359
Yeah because he's so insane you couldn't you're like you towards the end

260
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
I think he might ask

261
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,687
We think this is spiders that are doing that

262
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,015
Yeah yeah just watch Wild Wild West the night before

263
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
He was Uncle cough syrup

264
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
Kevin Kline is behind the spiders

265
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,975
Recline was just elected to the UN Council

266
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
So yeah you have you have this

267
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,447
Worldview in this presentation that is fairly consistent throughout time that is

268
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,823
You know it's anything that involves Russia ends up being everybody else's fault

269
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,383
Right that's not to say that he is like

270
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
You know obviously

271
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,479
Is not on the Russian payroll or anything like that

272
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
But he is

273
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,319
Deeply into making excuses

274
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
For everything that involves Russia

275
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,951
He's also saying Russia is collapsing at the same time

276
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
True

277
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
But it's in a sympathetic way

278
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,375
It's okay so there's a big victim sort of

279
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,167
Yeah the victim spider

280
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
Yeah there's a victim spider

281
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,799
Put them spider situation

282
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
Yeah it's it's um

283
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,807
Soaking with the taking of chromia and that bad kind of actions that were happening

284
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,647
This like they're collapsing is kind of an excuse for why they would take the

285
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
He's like oil-rich areas

286
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
Write these resources

287
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,047
I need to breed more Russia

288
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,351
Yeah regular Fighters yeah

289
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
But Reese mobile

290
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,959
Literally no one's ever said that they need to breathe

291
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,775
Battery better by humane

292
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,687
May not be the best like prognosticators on the

293
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
Do you think

294
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
That Alex thing

295
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
The outbreak

296
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
Between Ukraine and Russia is real

297
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,207
The guest 2014 Fighter the one today

298
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
2014

299
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,631
No no God no it's something they've shot down right

300
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
If it ain't shot down out of the sky then to Alex is not real

301
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,335
Like a a spider spider

302
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,663
It's too similar to Black Hawk Down

303
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
Well here we go let's see

304
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,855
But we've always known that a large global war and was supposed to bring in the final world governor

305
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Now it looks like you're trying to do it

306
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,511
Awesome backgrounds

307
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Well there we are

308
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,031
Mdlp between Ukraine and Russia or between

309
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
The spider eat you

310
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,431
Which spiders though there's three spiders involved a zipper spider

311
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,503
McKay's uninspired you fly

312
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
Yeah

313
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Okay

314
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,903
Russia and the EU were working together

315
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:31,327
Yeah he's saying the possibilities are that it's a real violent outbreak or

316
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,423
There's backroom deal between the EU and Putin to split Ukraine in half

317
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
It's just great because it's like

318
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,543
Heat the way that don't with the way that he's able to like

319
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,663
You know bring that up and be like I mean my gutters that's not what's going on it's like dude it's

320
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
That

321
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,247
If you're not rational Olivia like

322
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,831
But that's what that might be what's going on I'm open to that possibility obviously

323
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:59,743
Yeah that you do be like someone being like that you know there's a lot of signs that's a alien invasion is right around the corner my gut

324
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,071
It says it's not possible

325
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
It's highly possible

326
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:10,239
It seems like you only are talkin about that distinct possibility that you don't think it's correct

327
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
You know it's going to be great

328
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:18,175
What's going to be great one day is when he's just doing his show and he's going to collapse on the Infowars desk in his belly's judge

329
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
Just going to open up and you're going to find out that he was just a master egg for spiders and they're all going to crawl out of it

330
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
Yeah it was never a metaphor

331
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:33,023
Yeah yeah he was living like the Vincent D'Onofrio in Men In Black

332
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
His whole life

333
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
So you might

334
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,655
Think based on what we've heard so far

335
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,495
That this was going to be an episode that was largely about Russia and Ukraine

336
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
It is not

337
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
Things take a turn

338
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,479
Alex's discussing have one of his reporters David Knight

339
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
He has been taken

340
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Some time off

341
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,855
And because of that he's ended up listening to

342
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Doesn't talk radio

343
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
And this

344
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
This is some real chaos

345
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,655
Is that one apartment into a house while he still try to buy a house

346
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,055
Our local affiliate 590 a.m. last

347
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Because

348
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383

Broadcast

Driving up here right now to be on the next track

356
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
This is an emergency

357
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
Glenn Beck is talking some s***

358
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,271
Here we go so he's calling in the guy who's

359
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
Taking time off to move

00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
Into a house cuz he's buying a different house

361
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,207
He's having that guy come to the

Studio artist days off

363
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071
Because Glenn Beck said some s***

364
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
Yep dude nailed it

365
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,519
A lot of a lot of people are thinking there's not even a second house a lot of people to thinking that the second I was just kind of a false house

366
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,127
Spiders nest

367
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,991
I mean the amount of detail like you could just be like coming up next weekend to talk about Glenn back

368
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:35,391
But it said he likes toys moving from one house he's listening to 590 but he's also he's leaving his apartment he's got these low

369
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
Load up to U-Haul

370
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
He's on the way

371
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:43,583
Beyond the way his death part of his magic is that he throws in details about stuff that

372
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
Don't doesn't need details of it

373
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
Makes it sound like he knows more than he really does

374
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,615
Truth about this guy moving and being inconvenience

375
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
Yeah for sure Grill

376
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:04,575
The Accidental trucheck I am starting to think this guy might be moving that's all I buy

377
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,927
And it sounds like Alex is a shity boss

378
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
Yeah totally

379
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,071
He's taking three days to move

380
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
It's just got a f****** ridiculous

381
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
And also the guy apparently doesn't listen the only excuse he has to listen to radio that he's moving other than that

382
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,919
Motivate yourself on your move and see if they're on a little am talk radio to just kind of get

383
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
Set the gears in motion

384
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,783
Did this story actually shifts a little bit as the episode goes on

385
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,183
Later we find out that David nights brother lives in another city and he saw Glenn Beck and Tori

386
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
Call David Knight to listen to a

387
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
But there are some wrinkles

388
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,839
Entirely sure what's true

389
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
One thing that sucks is that

390
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
He's coming in

391
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
Because of Glenn Beck talkingshit

392
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Not because

393
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Russia and Ukraine

394
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
A ramping up hostility

395
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
You know that

396
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,991
This is the kind of news organization that's like Glenn Beck

397
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
You got to come in

398
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Yeah

399
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:15,999
World War 3 might be happening but Glenn Beck as an iff 590 a.m. show

400
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
We got to get into this

401
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
Betsy the problem is basic

402
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,655
Sickly The Glenn Beck is just jealous

403
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,703
Alex which I think we all

404
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Could be,

405
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:32,127
Yeah he went offline for him and he went off and went online

406
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,663
Operation there and he's

407
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
Never going to be a successful

408
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Alex

409
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,831
Well that's true but the blaze has so many cool people working now

410
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
So many greats like

411
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,439
I guess Steven Crowder

412
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,511
Is there right guy

413
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
I think you might have yet to its

414
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
It's f****** two failed comedians

415
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,703
Well I mean that's most of the right-wing right now

416
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
But let's be honest

417
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,943
So anyway Alex believes the Glenn Beck is jealous

418
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,135
Notifications are on Carey

419
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Program director

420
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Premier

421
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Yeah

422
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Wow

423
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
Is beating Rush Limbaugh

424
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:06,592
Well yeah

425
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,784
Mildly delusional but

426
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
And again Blake notes letting him know like

427
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
I put in the thinking of dropping a nuke hold on a second

428
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,768
The rush is actually also intimidated by Joe Reardon

429
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,584
We have a strategy we're like

430
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,168
A drug dealer and I put my show on your Sunday night so you get a taste

431
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,800
People are moving if you want to move in this New Rochelle put us on

432
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
We are we are Healers

433
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,248
Brag about a Sunday night slot

434
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:49,088
It's like the worst baseball

435
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,904
Alright

436
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,256
Are we fighting Infowars or is this like a kiss

437
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,816
When do we go back to fight again for Wars

438
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
I think that this is

439
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,888
Something it's kind of

440
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,936
MIT like maybe underknown

441
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,544
Publicly is how much of his show ends up being kind of like this

442
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
Where I had no idea

443
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
Why does anyone lie

444
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,640
Who cares

445
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
That was one of the things about the

446
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
The trial that was

447
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
So exceptional was

448
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,576
To actually have someone there

449
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
What are you talkin about

450
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:27,488
Boston to be able to do that like to pull that move because

451
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
We just need yes or no

452
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:34,656
Yeah he's not in his depositions the best moments are they like

453
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Mr. Jones

454
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
Do you know what question you're answering

455
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:46,432
Almost invariably the answer is no he has no idea where the sentence started

456
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:54,368
A back to webspace Nazi and Charlie

457
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,928
That night

458
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:02,560
Back there in the radio Sean he was a failed radio guy he it still

459
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,632
The radio guy still nosdam it's still

460
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
A deep-seated

461
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:12,288
Thing he wants to be king of f****** radio that's that's what he's talking about like

462
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,104
Is bracket things better than

463
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,272
Yeah yeah there's a bit of projection possibly

464
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,320
I thinking that I'm picking up on some of that too

465
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,440
And yeah he has a chip on his shoulder that's something that

466
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
It's also sort of

467
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
Ubiquitous

468
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
Throughout his career

469
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
Where is this this like

470
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
I'm the best but also everyone

471
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
Is jealous of me

472
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
And

473
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
That's why I

474
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,752
That's why

475
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,848
Trying to kick me off these stations could Glenn Beck is jealous of me and he's talking s***

476
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,408
That kind of vibe

477
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,784
Guys have always talked s*** about each other they can't not do it

478
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
Now that is very true

479
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,392
It's such a it's such a community

480
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,952
You know it's such a forgotten

481
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Community

482
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah it was like

483
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,816
They were the rock stars in the 50s

484
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
Yeah

485
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
Oh yeah Wolfman

486
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Yeah

487
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
And now

488
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
Brought low

489
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,432
So Alex is going to bring up some of the accusations

490
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,504
That's the Glenn Beck is made about him

491
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Important

492
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,064
The devil down in the

493
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
They important

494
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
I mean this is

495
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
Definitely the top story

496
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,560
She heard back say last night

497
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:42,144
Then I guess we're going to dig through the video audio

498
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Although yesterday

499
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,920
We're basically covering up the racism we were out there

500
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:59,296
We all now know this was Saturday night by report

501
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,576
At work we reported on

502
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
I mean

503
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
And

504
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,984
Everyone in the house now I'm around here a minute it's

505
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:22,080
Literally up middle of nowhere

506
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
So

507
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
Yeah so you might just be a fossil

508
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
Elisa is not race

509
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,856
Is it possible he's not wrong

510
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
It's really

511
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,464
Odd to listen to Alex Jones

512
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
Alex Jones

513
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Like

514
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:48,448
Talking about himself and his little orbit in the way that he does about everything else

515
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,312
Nothing if not like self-obsessed

516
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
But what's it like

517
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,480
But the way that you're like talking about posting audio files at like

518
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,064
Like honestly nobody just

519
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
Nobody cares what are you

520
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
What's actually important

521
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:13,792
Well what's actually important is the Glenn Beck has said that Alex wants to overthrow the government which

522
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
Kind of does

523
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Yeah I may be

524
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
Pretty clearly

525
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
Is 10

526
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,936
Super against the federal government

527
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
For twenty years

528
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,288
MN he's covering up racism

529
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,568
Bye

530
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
Collingwood

531
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
Cliven Bundy said racist

532
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,224
Which I don't know if you remember but it's basically him saying that

533
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,552
Hey maybe black people were better off under slavery

534
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:40,672
Play A1 in his house he's not opposed to having a black person in his house which is

535
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,208
In the Bundy family

536
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
Considered Progressive

537
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:48,608
Basically though everything that Glenn Beck appears to be saying about Alex

538
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
Transfair

539
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,472
But bye-bye he's doing that thing where

540
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
If you're going

541
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,080
God damn it now I agree with Glenn Beck you a******

542
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,736
Yeah that is that is the battle

543
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Sometimes

544
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
It's like oh no

545
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:12,416
You made a good point about Alex Jones

546
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
Yes yes

547
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,256
Cliven Bundy

548
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,560
That was your guy's first episode right

549
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,656
That was our first episode I was before Dave thought he was going to have me on the show permit

550
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
We were just going to his garage

551
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
Talk about the Bundys

552
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
It was magic

553
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
In a bottle

554
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,616
And the same day you put out that episode this was happening on Alex's show

555
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,176
Talking about

556
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,992
And how he is he's just old-fashioned man

557
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,856
Understand Papa say the n word

558
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,744
Parkwatcher

559
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,584
Yeah no

560
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:58,240
Right

561
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
It sounds

562
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,184
Really weird to Modern trendy to Metrotech

563
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:23,584
One thing I will say that is the bunnies were against gentleman Square

564
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,752
Put like the more the backhoe zodd the more it's like Jesus Christ

565
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,520
What is

566
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Is he mad living

567
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:38,944
He left he loses the thread quite a bit

568
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,784
He's like a guy who starts running downhill and he can't stop

569
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,904
Let's start a GoFundMe to get him running down the hill

570
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,304
I would love to see that but reality shows because you get to watch the word

571
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
Literally be

572
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,376
Taking out back at abused

573
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:02,240
He's quoting there is they are literally from The Time Machine

574
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,456
I think one of the problems that liked it with that entire

575
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,784
Like roll downhill in the momentum of it was that there was some

576
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,088
Like there was something true to it like

577
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,136
Essentially from a time machine

578
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,928
But they're coming from a racist time

579
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
Yo

580
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:29,632
So you're you're making an excuse for this by being like no no no no no their minds are back from slavery

581
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:34,496
Yeah exactly that's a problem because I feel their time traveler

582
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
Okay yeah well in our time we're not cool with that

583
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,896
If they are Time Travelers

584
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,712
Then we need to teach them about the modern world

585
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:49,344
No not that the whole space-time Continuum that you're jumping in the middle of the ripple effect you'd understand what you're doing to the universe

586
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,184
Open you open up the weather spiders

587
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Time spider

588
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,424
So we have a little bit more Russia and Ukraine news

589
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
Is the comes up

590
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,752
Glenn Beck

591
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,312
They're either murmurs

592
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Of this

593
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,872
And the Council on Foreign Relations

594
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:18,784
Anti so we get to the possibility of nuclear war coming up but only after

595
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,368
Like in incessant amount of time talking about Glenn

596
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,232
Preservation

597
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
Family Auto United States right now

598
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,912
That means we're going to have a nuclear war

599
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Percent chance

600
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,728
Warm

601
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,800
Get your family out of major targets

602
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,688
Percent chance of robbers were coming to kill you

603
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
Would you get out of your house at night

604
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,600
Change a tire

605
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,440
We're going to Clearwater

606
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,536
19 years

607
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
He always talks like that

608
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:12,032
Very regular

609
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,616
He also does frequently say you know I don't talk like that so

610
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,176
If you didn't listen to a bunch of a show you wouldn't know that

611
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
Right

612
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,760
You seem to have maybe a bone to pick

613
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Protects

614
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,600
I just made me laugh. Hehehe

615
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,184
He put like the main targets

616
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,512
Alright yeah sure

617
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
Oh yeah the great threat of Central Texas

618
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,656
Cuz yeah I'll hit them right where the economy's heart

619
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:43,264
Pulses crop of Texas

620
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,360
We've long known that the Kremlin wants to take out Bevo

621
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:54,784
University of Austin then they will be putty in our hands

622
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:00,160
You see the Red Dawn we have to take out the football capitals first

623
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,512
Did flight Texas NM is where these

624
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,048
Ascribed

625
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
David Knight

626
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
The guy who was not

627
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,472
Guy with moving he shows up

628
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,288
And he wants to come in and talk about

629
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,336
How Glenn Beck has been talking this s***

630
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
And this leads Alex to make

631
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
Quite a bold pronounce

632
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,712
About Glenn Beck

633
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
I knew from the beginning

634
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464
A red flag

635
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,704
Anything that you were constantly pushing for revolution

636
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Not

637
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,264
What happened there

638
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,544
Is exactly what

639
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,848
Planes he wants to see how

640
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,736
With loaded guns in their face like tenement Square

641
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,344
I didn't see anybody down there with a gun on them but

642
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,744
Well actually there was a couple of guys that were holding rifles

643
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,536
Showing that picture from multiple lines

644
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Okay

645
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,752
The black comment

646
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:30,272
He was making those comments last Saturday

647
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,416
People

648
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,560
My right arm

649
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,376
Glenn Beck

650
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:51,776
Oh my God it's like beautiful it's like

651
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,104
Jazz nonsense

652
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,664
I mean it is

653
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,944
There's so

654
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,504
Much phenomenal stuff in there

655
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,368
It's also amazing that okay

656
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
You have

657
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,208
The audio of Glenn Beck saying this

658
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,280
But in order to preserve the illusion of news

659
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,632
You're bringing in the guy who just listen to the a.m. radio

660
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,192
First-person account

661
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,008
Of listening to the a.m. radio station

662
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,592
Yep

663
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,664
What is the clip wouldn't be as fun

664
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,480
Glenn Beck is there

665
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,552
Evansville have the balls to be like

666
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:40,928
Anna what should we lay underneath that still a little Joe Cocker Help from My Friends

667
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:46,304
Glenn Beck is beyond

668
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,520
Board important question

669
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,616
Do you think that Alex knew he was going to make that accusation when the sentence started

670
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,432
Hello

671
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
You know I

672
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,040
I again everywhere outside re

673
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
But

674
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,624
Is it is there's just there's

675
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
You know the difference

676
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
Connection Pointe

677
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,512
And as he starts to advance and run down the hill

678
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,096
It's sort of like you don't never Plinko on The Price is Right

679
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,216
We're just wanted drops and lands in a sort of like that his mind is Plinko in

680
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:31,872
He's a regular and then spider false flag and then it drops in the air

681
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
FB Inc

682
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,176
BFDI

683
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504
Yeah but he's going to stick with this

684
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,112
For now but I should say in the present-day Glenn Beck likes Alex

685
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
So Alex likes going back now

686
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,488
In 2022

687
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,072
He must have been wrong about the FBI thing cuz he still has his right arm

688
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
So

689
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
Well yeah and

690
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,680
You know

691
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,728
One of the great things about Alex is it

692
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,776
Every episode is a bottle at

693
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
You know nothing really

694
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
Fluoride

695
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,920
You don't have to hold yourself to any of these predictions like

696
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Nuclear war

697
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,992
Write the FBI

698
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,808
It all just washes away tomorrow

699
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
It said it's awesome

700
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,648
How many

701
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
Groundhog Day cast

702
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
Conspiracy man

703
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,768
No continuity

704
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,096
I wonder how many times he's like predicted like

705
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
You know something like

706
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
Nuclear war like

707
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
If you could go back in town

708
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,264
It would be incredible over 20 years like

709
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,056
On our show

710
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,104
I would say at least 50 times

711
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
I've heard it so good

712
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,968
Yeah intelica is often the target

713
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
That he brings up

714
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,576
I'm very frightened by his false

715
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,928
Now that David is David Knight still with Glenn Beck

716
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,720
I know he's got his own radio show on

717
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
IHeart or whatever

718
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
David Knight

719
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,072
Used to work for Infowars

720
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
But

721
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
He

722
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
Got fired

723
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,936
Maybe like a year ago

724
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,984
He got into a fight with this guy named Steve

725
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
Chanoc

726
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,848
Steve pieczenik is this b******* artist would lie to Alex about stuff

727
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,712
And that he was saying that all the ballots in the 2020 election were watermarked

728
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
And they all were like

729
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,296
Track my blockchain

730
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,624
And so Trump was going to reveal the election was stolen

731
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,952
And David I was telling Alex not to believe this nonsense

732
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
David

733
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:30,656
You never say that to never say don't believe anything to Alex Jones

734
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
Yeah fired

735
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,496
Yeah he was there he was a long

736
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:38,080
But standing employee he had had a heart attack not too long before this

737
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:42,176
He'd come in on his day off to talk about Glenn Beck years in the past

738
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,016
No consideration given

739
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,416
I've always kind of been a little bit fascinated by Infowars as a work

740
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,184
Place

741
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,256
That's what you know cuz like weather.on are obviously something

742
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Yeah

743
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
Yeah

744
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,424
I bet I bet they're exactly the same I bet they're just sitting on the water coolers

745
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,776
Talking about the same ship they talked about on here I bet it's no f****** different

746
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:14,432
Do you think that they actually believe the stuff around the water cooler or it's like Comics pitching jokes to each other

747
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
Going back

748
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,552
You think there's something here

749
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,392
Yeah I think they believe I think you're the kind of guys that just

750
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,184
Endlessly

751
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
Talk nonsense

752
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:33,120
Is it goes back to when the Bundys took over the Wildlife Place in Oregon

753
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:38,496
At one point there were eight guys sitting in a circle talking about their military histories

754
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,312
And then when a documentary on

755
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,872
Invested in the none of his bed in the military

756
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:47,968
But they're watching once it's just like that like I think once it got started

757
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:52,320
Every talkin and they're all your sanding and they all

758
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:57,440
They on some level know it's not true but they're also so f****** deranged that they

759
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,488
Be inherently believe it

760
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,584
Yeah and I think that is what makes like the

761
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,352
Like the

762
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,168
The grifting of today more dangerous cuz I think

763
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,520
Like it's like if you put them on a lie detector

764
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,568
Detector Atwood they pass

765
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:18,176
I don't know but I know if they're around each other they're not going to admit

766
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,456
That it is

767
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
Bulshit

768
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,760
They are

769
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Because

770
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
You know they

771
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
You don't want

772
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
That's what a grifting is

773
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:31,232
Not okay but if you believe it hard enough

774
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,280
Then potentially it is true

775
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,328
And that's really like our

776
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
Entire

777
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
Structure of

778
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Government

779
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,680
And

780
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,960
You know half of the sea

781
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Successful

782
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,520
People who give commentary on it

783
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,824
Are just finding their footing

784
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,872
For their own personal benefit

785
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
And

786
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,712
And you know and find fight when you find an audience

787
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,504
Of course you're going to keep believing it

788
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
Yeah

789
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,600
AMV first person to like

790
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,136
Break kayfabe

791
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
And that sat in that environment

792
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,976
Is going to get eaten by the other group

793
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
Spiders

794
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,768
Write a note

795
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,888
Right and it'll only reinforce the the kayfabe and play Kono you were the one who wasn't

796
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,728
Real the day when Alex Jones just goes

797
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
I've been like

798
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
I know I like

799
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,688
Is that'll take some serious

800
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,456
AA meeting

801
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
Things I think she get there

802
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,088
It turns out there's one rule

803
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
Any info wars

804
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,648
There's only one rule

805
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,440
You won't believe what it is

806
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,560
Driving directions and I'll talk about

807
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
No

808
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:47,008
350i

809
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,592
Tell the truth I guess abstractly and

810
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,384
Leave

811
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:00,319
You don't want to attack our other allied with fighting against the globalist

812
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:03,391
Think about it

813
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,183
It's the only bucket rule

814
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:10,559
Realonerev Infowars donut at Glenn Beck real number two

815
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,095
Donut at Clayton back

816
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,375
And that's it

817
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,751
I'd love to moment of our there any other directive

818
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,151
Watch it I I think I'm supposed to

819
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
To say no but that's a

820
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,223
Crazy answer

821
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,551
I thought I walked these golden me to say no

822
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:37,951
Now that's it you can punch me

823
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,255
Has around are you can feel

824
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,535
Just leave

825
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,095
The f*** a lot did not hurt that

826
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
So one of the things that I find

827
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:52,543
The most fun and these episodes is when people bring out quotes

828
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,847
Because they're often wrong

829
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:01,247
Sometimes it's a little silly like this tight with David nights at UB with this one a little bit

830
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:07,903
I don't know if it was his original expression

831
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:14,815
Easy to mix up

832
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:20,191
Came up with the Supra

833
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,847
Oh my God

834
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,151
To live in an environment where that is

835
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
Not

836
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Like

837
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,759
But that is just a passing moment

838
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:39,135
Ventura and Gandhi again

839
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,767
Fun fact it's actually not even a Gandhi quote

840
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,423
It did sound a little like aggressive for a Gandhi quote

841
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:58,335
Don't shoot until you see the whites of your eyes that was gone yeah yeah from my cold dead hands

842
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,151
That was still Cold Steve Austin

843
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,455
You're getting about f***** up my air

844
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
Gandhi

845
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,271
Dundee 3:16

846
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
Jiraiya

847
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
Dang it they have a

848
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,047
Brought relationship with quotes

849
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,351
Infowars

850
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
Like it

851
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:24,191
We covered his documentary endgame

852
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,007
And I was fascinated because every quote

853
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,311
Like it was just like

854
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,871
Wall-to-wall Jefferson quotes

855
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,943
That weren't real couple of Hitler quotes that were fake

856
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,735
It was just it was wild

857
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,527
It's I don't understand

858
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
How you can

859
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,087
Like

860
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,367
Take such stock

861
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
It needs quotes

862
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,951
And just be like well that that's actually just remind me

863
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,743
I didn't know it's not real

864
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,791
What are stilts very pretty good meme

865
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,119
It's always good to get meme it's very good meme

866
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:57,471
Yammy what you see it in writing then you know all bets are off

867
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,495
It's a thing

868
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:02,335
So in this next clip we have Alex

869
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,431
This is all be honest with you I'm not sure if there's much of a point to

870
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,503
Like I'm playing it because

871
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,527
I want you to

872
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,807
Feel what it's like

873
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,111
Like to have some Rambo

874
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
In your life

875
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,927
Like it's it's really just

876
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Aimless

877
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
I know why

878
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,775
Vermeer World Order

879
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,799
I knew

880
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
Add appointment into

881
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
Getting into

882
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
What just

883
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,671
Narcissist

884
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,791
Now that I know is real

885
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,799
And I want to believe another libertarian talk show host

886
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,407
These people I want a better world

887
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,735
I want to hold my family name

888
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:19,391
I want to look at the facts and try to give you the most reason historical morally base

889
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,671
Analysis I can

890
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,463
A myself

891
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,583
I'm not perfect from my horse

892
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
I'm not here lecture

893
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:34,495
There are long stretches of his show that just are like that

894
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,543
It's clear he's talking to himself

895
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
Right here

896
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
Chest

897
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,383
Rambling nonsense

898
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,223
Well and it actually reminds me a lot of the Hulk Hogan

899
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,503
Valdosta

900
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,527
Protest too much

901
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
That was actually check

902
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
Oh sorry

903
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,231
Dammit

904
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,767
Either way the points 10

905
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:05,215
It's it's kind of fascinating to go in like listen to as much of the show's you do because there are these moments of life

906
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,751
You basically just

907
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,055
Someone who doesn't go to therapy

908
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
Talking to yourself

909
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,895
Talking about yourself and you in your feelings

910
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
On air

911
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,735
And it can feel a little pointless

912
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,527
You know you're in a good

913
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
Rhythm

914
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
When

915
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,111
You're saying I'm not a

916
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,951
Things are going pretty well

917
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,511
Generally means you've been accused of that

918
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:34,911
But even for him because it's sort of like the unwinding of his own mind he's accusing

919
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,959
Himself and defending himself against

920
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
Themself a little bit

921
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,799
Well you know it's it's a self-soothing behavior

922
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,455
He's expressing this idea to this like

923
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
Yo yo you

924
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,295
You get the flak when you're above the target

925
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
And that

926
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,623
His way of justifying like

927
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:58,463
Every negative consequence that comes his way is actually a sign of his

928
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,999
Right here

929
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:04,095
Every attack is just because I'm so right about everything yeah

930
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
And it's yeah

931
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
Pretty sad

932
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
It's a it's a bummer

933
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,239
Sometimes you're just a dick

934
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,775
And it's it's

935
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,847
Been so effective that it is it is like

936
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,223
It is it's what I mean even then like he wouldn't you know he was

937
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
He's such a

938
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,039
Powerful figure at that time

939
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
But to think that that

940
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,855
Cuz even grown

941
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,623
2

942
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:30,207
You know I'm grown out of that is is so depressing

943
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
Because it's why

944
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:36,863
It's been so a fan I mean people like

945
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,191
My friend's mom was like my watch Fox 2 News cuz it

946
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,471
Is it fair and balanced

947
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
And I was like

948
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,031
What they're saying

949
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,431
It's that simple to hack are dumb little brain

950
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,271
Catchphrases man they work

951
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
Yeah

952
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,903
So what are things that actually is fun

953
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Sort of

954
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,719
About Alex's show is that

955
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,535
He will come in from brakes with music sometimes

956
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,095
And he like really gets to feeling

957
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,959
One of the best that we've heard is Glen fries you belong to

958
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,727
To the city

959
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,311
Do you get rocks out over that and it is amazing

960
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,127
This is a little bit

961
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:23,455
Weaker than that but still a pretty good example

962
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,735
Of him about Viber

963
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,551
We are Marching my friend

964
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
Call Spectrum

965
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:46,495
Lead

966
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,079
Nuclear war

967
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:53,407
Supersonic

968
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:02,111
Wrestle up off the coast of the United States

969
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,647
So it's a little dramatic

970
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,999
That being like that could be like

971
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
You know

972
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
Eater some Gorillaz

973
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,839
Music behind that even got a f******

974
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,143
It is

975
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,423
Is it is a mash-up

976
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,191
But it's like

977
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,543
It's the terrible remix

978
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:59,455
There is something to be said before Alex talking over music that unfortunately I think I'd buy it

979
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
An album of it

980
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,063
It would be an interesting late-career pivot

981
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,135
Trimmed

982
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
Duets

983
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,255
It's sort of just cease bringing his

984
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,047
Is spice to the classic

985
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,887
Great American Songbook

986
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,959
Yeah it's mr. music while he's just

987
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
The reptilians

988
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,335
Yeah it's real with William Shatner

989
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:30,431
On his album right yeah it really is a little angrier

990
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
Maybe

991
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,223
Yeah yeah

992
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:37,343
Talking about Russian nuclear subs off the coast ready to Launch

993
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,623
Haha yeah

994
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,695
I don't I don't I don't think that's responsible

995
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,975
Probably

996
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:48,095
Now but I mean that version is going to be stuck in my head all day

997
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,679
So we get back to Glenn Beck

998
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
Because like I said

999
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:59,871
This is the this is the top story of the day break of nuclear war plus that guy heard Glenn Beck while he was moving

1000
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
Wait

1001
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,943
And it involves Alex

1002
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
XOXO

1003
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,247
Very important

1004
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:09,087
Foxit told Alex something

1005
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,671
Inserting their about

1006
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
Level people

1007
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,559
I mean repeat Atlanta

1008
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,263
Reviewing

1009
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
Whatever to do I am singing in

1010
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
That big of a deal but

1011
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,895
People

1012
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,967
Don't you know don't want you in their lives

1013
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,623
And I'm like what do you mean

1014
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,231
Wow

1015
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
I'm not going to

1016
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,279
Okay

1017
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,375
He's not going to name names slow

1018
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,399
Is the government

1019
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
Yeah no look

1020
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:59,775
Would naming names really help his case cuz it's quite a claim for sure

1021
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,079
But Alexander going to do that

1022
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
No he's above his class

1023
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,663
Yeah he's a classic classic

1024
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,223
He was actually on The View

1025
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,551
He was yeah he was on talking about Charlie Sheen

1026
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,207
Charlie Sheen

1027
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,023
Had that meltdown on Alex's show

1028
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:27,423
That was where it all like happened

1029
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,959
He got invited on The View

1030
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,519
And just yelled infowars.com a bit

1031
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,711
It's pretty surreal though to see him sitting there on that side

1032
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:46,111
Green screen I also like the Glenn Beck is climbing the walls like Spiderman

1033
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
So

1034
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,671
Glenn Beck

1035
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,439
Glenn Beck

1036
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,463
Is both

1037
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,743
Freaking out

1038
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,535
Over the existence of Alec

1039
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
Love Jones

1040
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,095
And the infringement upon

1041
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
Glenn Beck

1042
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
Orbit at some of these

1043
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,191
Cable news operators

1044
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:04,543
And at the same time is so powerful that he's the governor

1045
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,127
Upgraded from the FBI to the whole

1046
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:12,991
Yeah she's pretty impressive-looking hour

1047
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,295
Yeah

1048
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,319
Spider-verse

1049
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:22,719
If ever you ever seen Glenn Glenn Beck's Christmas show

1050
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,535
His one-man show

1051
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,095
About Randall the boy

1052
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
In the bicycle of ever seeing it

1053
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:33,471
I have not I cannot recommend enough

1054
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,239
The man is

1055
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,031
Adams f****** mind

1056
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,055
And it's it

1057
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,871
We watched in the theater me and Josh Olson

1058
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,943
And people got mad at us for laughing

1059
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,503
Yeah like the

1060
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,831
The right way people are very and like they were decked out in their

1061
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,879
Are you don't fool flag and all that s***

1062
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:54,719
Environment

1063
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,279
Like that it is a it is a deep

1064
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,095
Did the jury into the mighty Glenn Beck and his

1065
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,143
F****** outstanding

1066
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,215
I know I've heard some great reviews of his book

1067
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,543
I've never read a book

1068
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
If that means his

1069
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
Buckeye broadband

1070
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,919
I've Heard naked and previews of his books

1071
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,015
Alex MB

1072
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,551
Name names

1073
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
Nope

1074
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,599
That is a

1075
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,135
The policy that he has

1076
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:27,487
Yeah I made it so in a way it shows you that

1077
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
You know

1078
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,863
He is Honorable when it comes to not outing these sources

1079
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,167
Sure but it's also

1080
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
Goddamn would it really help some of this

1081
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:41,055
Stop just to really become elevated

1082
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:47,455
F****** hell did you give us a damn specific please one maybe maybe name a name just so we can be like

1083
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,527
Okay yes that name was right now you don't need to anymore

1084
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,063
Maybe he will

1085
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,111
Maybe he will

1086
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,927
You wanted buddy son

1087
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,887

You were spouting White House Coffee

1089
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,103
Point

1090
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,431
It came out

1091

When I realize your little baked over there

00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,143
This quite a threat

1096
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,983
Dciaa FBI

1097
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,519
Substation

CIA FBI

Substation from which

00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,527
He runs

1103
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,087
The federal government government

1104
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,671
Because

1105
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:05,023
He had the same Turkey Point did Media Matters did

1106
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,559
3 days later

1107
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,631
Cooter motherfuker

1108
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,167
It's all good

1109
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:17,567
And I I should also say that we only know that this three-day thing is happening because Alex is saying it

1110
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,103
And he's iffy on dates

1111
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:25,759
But again once you get the dossier compiled which I'm sure they were and put

1112
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,599
I'm sure that that was validating a

1113
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,623
Corroborated

1114
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,903
Wellshire

1115
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,511
Yeah and going back went away cuz he was shamed out of the public

1116
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,327
Nobody was the government and that's over

1117
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:43,167
Yeah and then the post I guess cuz he's no longer the government

1118
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
Nope

1119
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:48,031
Nobody still runs the FDIC a substation

1120
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,823
We got your ass

1121
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,407
Kind of implies that it's in between a couple stations

1122
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
You know like

1123
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
Chicken quesadilla

1124
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,991
People need to camp out there

1125
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
For a mission

1126
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
Or

1127
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,879
It's actually a station on a sub

1128
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,415
Think about what

1129
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,951
In the middle of Texas

1130
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,743
Operate out of town

1131
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:13,631
Maybe that's Bhai leveled but the nuke was going to hit operator

1132
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
Navigate me to Jade Helm are we

1133
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,471
Wow

1134
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,239
Yeah

1135
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:23,871
Just got to figure out how the spiders play into this and we are onto something

1136
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,431
Man he must

1137
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
Hema

1138
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
I mean

1139
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:29,759
Idaho

1140
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,319
I mean what is the level of

1141
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
Drugs to

1142
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,623
To keep this up

1143
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:41,279
Is it get I mean we're thinking like what is the belief on him is it is it adderal is it

1144
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,071
Is it booze is it

1145
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,095
The cocktail

1146
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,631
He's definitely a drunk

1147
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,399
For sure

1148
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,215
He's he doesn't show drunk sometimes

1149
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:54,335
Less So lately but in the past he would you'd be very clearly drunk like

1150
00:58:54,591 --> 00:59:00,735
One Christmas Eve Eve was so drunk he threw a hatchet it one of his cameras but he wasn't

1151
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,783
Who is madness

1152
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,647
Oh my God also

1153
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,207
He played 70 have a hatchet

1154
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:15,583
Why wouldn't the other half because I'm dummy

1155
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:24,799
Sometimes he has big knives in the studio sometimes he has like a Barrett 40-cal by like Cannon

1156
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,359
God

1157
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,759
Where is there's a cereality to to some of that but yeah that was a good day

1158
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:38,879
Rogan has said that Alex told him that he has a problem with adderal

1159
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:43,231
And so there is some kind of a stimulant

1160
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,791
Keeps like the words running

1161
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Yeah

1162
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,863
I am just like I think

1163
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:53,471
Piano from performing and doing so as you know it can be exhausting even though it doesn't

1164
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,007
Look like it's exhausting

1165
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,031
Yam

1166
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,079
He does is pretty high intensity

1167
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,895
Not have some kind of supplement

1168
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:04,991
If you will get started selling that as the

1169
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:10,367
The ad adderal booze combo is pretty f****** ridiculously

1170
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,415
In the way that adderal can

1171
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,439
Heap

1172
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Gears

1173
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
Going

1174
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:18,047
No matter what you're throwing at it if you take a dump

1175
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:18,815
Is pretty remarkable

1176
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,119
I've certainly had some friends

1177
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,143
Tell me

1178
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,423
That if you're drinking

1179
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,007
Pretty late like maybe you're at 3 4 a.m. bar here in Chicago

1180
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,311
And someone gives you some cocaine

1181
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,871
It might hit balances out a little

1182
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:35,199
You know that a fact

1183
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,735
Brendan cell

1184
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:42,367
But yes yeah and I know from having done cocaine at 3 or 4 in the morning

1185
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,671
But it is at but

1186
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,975
You bald-headed a lot of times it will be the

1187
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
Appearance

1188
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:52,351
That you're in control but your memories will not be

1189
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,631
They're too really

1190
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,911
Back that up

1191
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,471
Tell you both seem fine

1192
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,263
But you are out of your mind

1193
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,359
This is how Alex gets away with your getting that Glenn Beck is the government

1194
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,127
Right

1195
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,175
Is holding its memory

1196
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,199
Sure

1197
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:11,807
But looks he's going to put together these dossiers right on Glenn Beck staff

1198
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,623
And to do that he's going to need some help

1199
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,671
Until he calls out

1200
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
He puts it out into the universe

1201
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
Obi-Wan

1202
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,535
Kind of thing

1203
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:25,887
What is this one f****** day of a f****** show this is one day

1204
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,959
Crazy

Davis

1206
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,311
Honestly this is one of the less

1207
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
Crazy

1208
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:37,407
I was worried that some of these clips would be very boring

1209
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,687
A while

1210
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,527
Here is Alex calling for some help

1211
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,087
Anonymous is going to do about this

1212
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,183
Bring Me Down

1213
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:54,559

Set anyone I wondered like Anna's because if there's no real information but it's just evolving it is like

1219
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,191
Psychosis

1220
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,983
The point now where is like

1221
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:39,871
Look Anonymous you're the crosshairs now you're you're just as exposed as I am here

1222
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,943
You know Glenn Beck because he's the government

1226
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,535
Goodbye Brothers

1227
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,327
Do we even know

1228
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,399
Wait have we heard what Glenn Beck said about him yet

1229
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:09,055
He said that the a Wars wants a revolution and that he didn't want to get involved with the Bundys

1230
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,383
Involved

1231
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,991
He just made a very nearly

1232
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,527
Offhand comment

1233
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,807
And this is what

1234
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,159
Alex was excusing the racism of private Monday

1235
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:30,559
Please comment wasn't but again when you're dealing with races Time Travelers you have to be open to the races

1236
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,327
Cuz I'm a little bit

1237
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,167
Right you'd be time tribalist if you didn't

1238
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:38,239
It's just gotten so crazy people to

01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,263
Balls

1288
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,335
The up again I mean it's like

1289
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:56,735
If you're just surround yourself with people who will let you get away with things this is how you get to the point

1290
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,015
You're doing like

1291
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,039
Pretty much

1292
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,343
One-on-one public prayers

1293
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
With God

1294
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:08,255
It said there was just busy religion was really the only thing separating him from Jim Jones

1295
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
And then

1296
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,559
Boom

1297
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:13,887
He preys on are more than you think

1298
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,935
And it's suspicious

1299
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:18,239
How often the prayers

1300
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,287
Seem to be a foreman

1301
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,335
LOL

1302
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:27,967
There's a little bit of a he's talking about Glenn Beck in this prayer very clearly

1303
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,295
He see some praying back

1304
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,743
If that wasn't too much

1305
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,511
To take in

1306
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:43,583
This lexcorp might give you whiplash

1307
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
Jarring

1308
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,167
Because this is immediately after he prays

1309
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
This is what he says

1310
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,007
Broadcast

1311
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,287
And pray

1312
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,079
That reveal

1313
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,967
Religious

1314
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:03,551
Gia frontman the FBI frontman

1315
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,575
Obama

1316
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,599
This one.

1317
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
Wow

1318
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,183
And I just prayed that happen

1319
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:19,679
But I am very humbled and honored presence

1320
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,031
Yeah when Alex does it it's classy

1321
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,431
Yeah yeah yeah

1322
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:35,551
I'm looking down on Glenn Beck for evoking God and bringing God up after

1323
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:40,671
You just prayed about

1324
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,999
Mad

1325
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,279
You know how to rap

1326
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,095
It would be it would just make so much sense

1327
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:52,703
If the set of Infowars was just like multiplicity where there were five of him

1328
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:56,799
And they just kind of swapping in and out you've got the religious Jones books

1329
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,335
Conspiratorial Jones

1330
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,639
The musician Jones

1331
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,663
Sure

1332
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:09,087
You terrified of spiders Jones not just reading headlines Jones which is the one where like this one's not

1333
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,111
The best copy

1334
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,951
Is the Spider Guy we should let him out there too often

1335
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:17,535
Be very red Alex Jones from that picture

1336
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,351
Before and after pictures

1337
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:27,007
Man I mean lambrou Jones

1338
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:32,127
It's not the act like a Florida Alex Jones

1339
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,687
Board shorts and Hawaiian shirt

1340
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,967
I added

1341
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,735
It's

1342
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,015
It's really

1343
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,039
It's really

1344
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,063
Remarkable

1345
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,343
2

1346
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,159
It's fake that nothing is Jade

1347
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,023
No

1348
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:49,791
In this

1349
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,327
2 hour.

1350
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:57,727
Nothing changed except for potentially the level of intoxication or something or just like

1351
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,543
The ratings are whatever just save the fact that he's

1352
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,311
Just going

1353
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:06,431
I don't think he's drunk to be Fey I can usually tell like these you have little Tails

1354
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,479
And he seems pretty sober

1355
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,503
But here's the thing

1356
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,063
Every episode is essentially in adventure

1357
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,159
You know his front door when he starts

1358
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,695
The show it who knows

1359
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:21,023
Philadelphia in Mordor

1360
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,095
You could end up just the other side of the Shire who knows

1361
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,631
It's Madness

1362
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
Deepika

1363
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,471
Is this

1364
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,751
Cabeza

1365
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,799
We have we have learned

1366
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,847
Just mentally

1367
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,175
We have more to learn about Glenn Beck

1368
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,479
Good cuz we've learned he's the FBI

1369
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:44,831
Hold on

1370
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
Maybe not

1371
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,391
Oh maybe

1372
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,927
He's above Obama

1373
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,231
Marshalltown

1374
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,767
I'm so tired of Dishonor

1375
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,095
Believe

1376
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,943

What if you're wrong

1384
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,471
Bragging

1385
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,287
No nobody's talking to me about this stuff

1386
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:17,759
I'm just riffing this s*** out at the later that I am coming up with this

1387
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,063
Gilligan's like if your

1388
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:20,831
Glenn Beck

1389
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:24,415
You're like okay so how do I

1390
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:31,071
Yeah well your people you're going and you're going to hate just so you know I guess Alex heard some of the things

1391
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:36,447
You said that what you saying he's pretty pissed off I mean whatever you know that this is Media this can happen

1392
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:41,311
When you have a second we haven't know someone told me about the Alex Jones no no it's

1393
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,615
It's gotten a little bit more out of

1394
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,663
What what do you mean

1395
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:50,527
Yeah yeah the last 15 minutes he kind of I guess now his pitches that you

1396
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,551
Are pretty much

1397
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,343
Inside the government working for the government

1398
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,879
Well that's crazy

1399
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,927
Do you have a sub

1400
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,975
FBI CIA station

1401
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
Hey Glen

1402
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:02,815
Glad you have sorry I know you're trying to get some work done

1403
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:07,679
Yeah there's a new update

1404
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,215
So

1405
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:13,567
It seems now that he is suggesting that you're sort of coming up with the talking

1406
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,615
Key points for the government

1407
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,895
And

1408
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,175
That that

1409
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:22,783
You're no longer part of the government your maybe our are the government

1410
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,623
And he better as right arm on the fact that you are he'll cut his arm off if you're

1411
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:31,231
I guess sometimes I just think about how I wanted to be a stand-up

1412
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:34,303
Hey Glenn sorry I know it's only been eight minutes

1413
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,327
Yeah

1414
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,655
You're above Obama now you might be Obama

1415
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,679
How is that

1416
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,727
How am I supposed to

1417
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,007
Say anything

1418
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,311
The shows got another two hours

1419
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,151
He's been running for 17 minutes

1420
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
Yeah

1421
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:50,943
Yeah

1422
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,735
So we'll keep you posted

1423
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,087
Can I get back on can I get back in with Samantha Bee to talk

1424
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,903
Aerobatic apologize for something

1425
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,719
Can I talk to him

1426
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:10,911
This is definitely a heavy day

1427
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,471
For Alex in terms of like Escalade

1428
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,007
Yeah

1429
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,543
It doesn't always

1430
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,079
Snowball quite like

1431
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:24,479
Like this it feels druggie it feels like he's pot he's been popping pills as this has been going on

1432
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:30,879
Or maybe they just have a fog machine in the studio but it just releases adderal

1433
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,439
Vaporize adderal

1434
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:35,487
That's right there a rock something here

1435
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:42,399
I don't know I mean like is anger a drug I'm a kind of his for some folks

1436
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,447
Is the Devil Type

1437
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,495
It isn't a way to where it's like

1438
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,055
He is you know it's not even

1439
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:52,127
Shouting in Uno at his friends at a bar

1440
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,431
He recognizes the

1441
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,479
Pedo people are listening to this s***

1442
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,015
And if they're eating up the

1443
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
The trash

1444
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,087
That makes him want to throw more trash

1445
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:05,183
And as the day goes on the trash piles have to get bigger and crazier

1446
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,975
And so now he's just sort of

1447
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,255
Slamming around in the

1448
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
Bile

1449
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:13,887
That's one of the problems with like this style of broadcasting

1450
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:18,751
Yeah but hit medium and I've had friends that have gone completely insane cuz they're just

1451
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,567
In a in a room talking himself on YouTube like

1452
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:27,455
That's a bad it's a bad medium if you're alone and no one is going hey

1453
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,247
Check yourself a little bit here

1454
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:34,623
If you don't have a boss and like a lot of the stuff that you're talking about his kind of extreme

1455
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,647
Then

1456
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,207
People respond to the extreme stuff

1457
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,767
Yeah man you kind of lean into that

1458
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:45,119
And how do you get a how are you exciting if like you're used to

1459
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,143
Saying extreme

1460
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,191
It's like it's panda

1461
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,727
And tomorrow

1462
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,031
You need to say some crazy as yet

1463
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,615
You have your going to be tomorrow

1464
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:03,295
Zubsolv ready to Nuke America and Glenn Beck is above Obama

1465
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:06,879

1467
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:10,207
Would be what's Glenn Beck going to be tomorrow

1468
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,863
Eminem Jordans

1469
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,399
Teepublic

1470
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:24,543
Yeah I never coming back around and then being friends with this guy

1471
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:29,407
After Debbie like me being present Jen Kirkman it's not something that can happen

1472
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,687
I think it'll happen

1473
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:36,831
To be fair I think Alex has said way worse things about Glenn Beck than this

1474
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,879
This could be argued to be a compliment

1475
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:44,255
It's a scary compliment but in a way it is

1476
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,559
You are higher than Obama

1477
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:50,143
Yeah you know it's higher than Obama Alex Jones

1478
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,471
Where is Halifax

1479
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,799
Definitely

1480
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,823
An insult

1481
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,639
Or an accusation that involves competence

1482
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:04,991
Yeah you are so competent that you are above the

1483
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,039
Anonymous let's go

1484
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,599
Yeah I need a giant

1485
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,391
Team of faceless hackers

1486
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,927
In order to take you down

1487
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,255
Nationalize that is being a positive

1488
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:18,047
Yeah I know I will

1489
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,351
It's a scary compliment but it's a compliment

1490
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:26,751
This was from 2014 so did it on his come to help him I can't remember about the grave

1491
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,567
Yeah Glenn Beck on Master time

1492
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,847
Okay

1493
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,407
Obama's birth certificate

1494
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,199
Yazbek

1495
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,783
Actually Alex doesn't believe the birth certificate stuff

1496
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,831
Didn't

1497
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,111
What online

1498
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:45,951
You didn't initially believed it

1499
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,999
But then he realized that it was a

1500
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:51,583
Trick because the people that your mom has put it out

1501
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:54,911
Knowing that people like Alex in the right-wing Community were racist

1502
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:57,471
And so they would jump on top of it and

1503
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,751
Like take the bait

1504
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,287
It's a false flag.

1505
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,311
You bet

1506
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:05,151
You bet in reality Obama's dad is Frank Marshall Davis

1507
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,503
He's a communist guy I don't know

1508
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,575
I don't realize

1509
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,879
Taking this line too much further than that

1510
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,183
He made a documentary about it at some point

1511
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:22,047
Is the documentary about it called Dreams of My real father

1512
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,351
Oh my Lord what a title

1513
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:30,751
To be honest with the different time Dan

1514
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:34,591
Alex is a time traveler that time for God's sake

1515
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,663
So at this point

1516
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,223
We've entered the sort of homestretch

1517
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:40,991
To the show

1518
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:45,343
And Alex brings on Joseph Farah the guy who runs WorldNetDaily

1519
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,903
Ayyaantuu the program God

1520
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,975
Wrecking to listen to it will just one clip of it because

1521
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:55,839
It's a it's pretty boring it's mostly about how The clintons Wanted

1522
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,607
To take him out

1523
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,911
And I don't know how that's relevant

1524
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,191
Takeout

1525
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,727
Alex are the world

1526
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,775
Back in the 90s

1527
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,055
Yeah yeah yeah

1528
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,847
It's an hour in 2014

1529
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,407
Started getting credibility

1530
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,687
Today

1531
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,455
Murder images

1532
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,807
If he got murdered in this is a

1533
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:20,415
Quotes because he was asking too many questions about Vince Foster

1534
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:23,999
Where's the buzz name

1535
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,791
OG

1536
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,887
Sarah it one of his big point

1537
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,167
Is that like

1538
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,703
We got it we got a stick

1539
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:36,543
Together there's not many of us who are you know in this

1540
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:39,359
And he accidentally included the Glenn Beck

1541
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:43,199
PS4

1542
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,111
I wonder why nobody else

1543
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,999
Degree of success here

1544
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,607
After

1545
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,679
Infowars

1546
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,919
Make sure

1547
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,503
Hairs with them

1548
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,295
United front

1549
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:38,495
But I'm erasers covering up for Monday

1550
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:44,127
I mean here

1551
01:19:54,367 --> 01:20:00,511
Go to iron my interviews but really every lunch I have anybody I understand, and I'm glad you're not a coward

1552
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,791
That's always how I end things

1553
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,631
I do it after someone orders

1554
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:10,495
Glad you're not a coward you have a friend that a potato salad

1555
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,592
I mean it really is amazing to

1556
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,408
Have said all the things you said

1557
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:25,088
A guy drop Glide Becca be like will look to be honest I'm not a huge going back fan it's like

1558
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,624
Obama

1559
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,184
Yeah there's a dissonance

1560
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:35,840
How do you not say to that guy he says that let them back in Hugo you know he has a substation any runs yesterday I didn't see it like it's chill

1561
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,680
I think this question answers itself

1562
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,704
And that is

1563
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,496
But Jose Parra is not a coward

1564
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,032
Right

1565
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:47,360
Would inevitably lead to some pushback

1566
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:50,944
And I think that's probably why just go along

1567
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,248
To get along this means anything anyway

1568
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:59,392
But it's just so it's so clear there that that's

1569
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,208
The case because he's just eat uses in the wrap-up

1570
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:08,608
Well to be honest I'm not huge but back fat he says Civil War but anyway you know potato potahto great Avion

1571
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,192
Myself

1572
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:18,592
I got myself a little bitty might be in charge of the globalist Death Star we're not sure anyway

Yeah it it's it's it's silly

1576

Things don't make sense

1577
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,136
And that's just part of the infowar

1579
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
Man

1580
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,488
Wow

1581
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:41,888
In this a third hour of his show he was interviewing Joseph Farah and then the premise was basically that you was going to take call

1582
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,680
What time

1583
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,960
Essentially Runs Out

1584
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,240
And

1585
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,800
Too much time complaining about Glenn Beck

1586
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,592
And so there's no calls

1587
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,872
And Alex's

1588
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,640
Alex's

1589
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,176
Feeling a little bit like

1590
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,456
You know

1591
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,248
I'm cool I'm a cool guy

1592
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,296
That's kind of the vibe he wants to go out

1593
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,392
I'm out of time

1594
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,232
Creepy

1595
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,280

1596
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:13,376

The credit card

1601
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,672
Now you just have to talk me about

1602
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:17,120
I always find that to be like really sincere and convince

1603
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,656
When people

1604
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:25,824
I was just at a community pool hot tub

1605

01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:42,208

Getting him up at just

1615
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:13,696
What color does Alex Jones turn in a hot tub

Well here's the thing you guys don't listen to a ton of this you wouldn't know but a lot of Alex's stories take place in hot tub

1619
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:28,800
Okay

1620
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:32,384
He has a famous story about being in a hot tub

1621
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,480
And a couple of globalist caveman and

1622
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:40,320
Where can I get you there like threatening him in the hot tub

1623
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,880
I meant another time he was at Hot Springs

1624
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:51,328

At least everything's gone so much better since then

1639
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,320
Yeah

1640
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,344

01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,048
But

1646
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,096
It's almost like

1647
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,936
I guess you think of him when you don't know as much

1648
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:02,496
As as you you all do

1649
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,848
You know that he is his damn it is dangerous it's only ways but it's also

1650
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,896
This is the mind of a child

1651
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,432
Yeah

1652
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:12,480
It's just a child's mind

1653
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,504
And it's just

1654
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,064
Pretty simple what's going on and it's

1655
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,880
I guess very effective for those who are in

1656
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,160
But

1657
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,720
There's really not much

1658
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,048
Just trying to keep this bucking

1659
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,144
You do keep the Train Running just keep the words coming out

1660
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,168
Create

1661
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,192
Strawman

1662
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:36,800
Is it always got his terms they're very effective had to what you were saying like

1663
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,336
He walks out his door at

1664
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,408
Irene

1665
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:44,736
At all everydays a Pixar movie for of you

1666
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:50,112
I'm certain he has essentially no preparation for anything

1667
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,416
Just B just seat of his pants

1668
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:56,512
These ridiculous things like an entire show

1669
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:59,328
Where he's escalating the accusing Glenn Beck of stuff

1670
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,888
Lisak well I have

1671
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,936
Nothing else really to talk about

1672
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:06,752
I've already made people scared about this nuclear war thing

1673
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:10,336
I got nowhere else to go with that Tammy

1674
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,408
What can I say in between Hocking survival item

1675
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,736
But he really is like

1676
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,272
When people like

1677
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:25,696
But you have a friend that did something and then you just in your head you like all I'm going to say this to him in this Tim that it kind of spirals out

1678
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,232
But then you're just thinking about the 7th

1679
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:32,608
But he's definitely doesn't show like it's it's the kind of bocce Avenue it's just Frankie

1680
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,888
I just I can call him

1681
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,472
But he just goes for hours

1682
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:42,336
It's a guy spiraling out for f****** hours

1683
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:45,152
If this was so hugely important

1684
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:52,064
It probably should have gotten on his radar in another way than a guy work for him was moving

1685
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:58,720
Again like I said the guy who is moving brother heard it and told the guy who is moving

1686
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,744
Rihanna

1687
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,072
God Hill good

1688
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:08,448
You even his sources and what he does it's got to work for me brother has brother

1689
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,544
One of his big sources of information in the present-day is his wife

1690
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,568
Tennis partner

1691
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:17,408
It's a lot of deep until from her

1692
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,760
What's your stupid

1693
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,112
Soap2day

1694
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,648
Is he

1695
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:34,048
It just over completely on something else or does he continue on will he continue on with something like this or really just dropped

1696
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:39,424
It changes I'm not sure I haven't listened to the next day's episode so I couldn't say for sure

1697
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,984
Sometimes it becomes a little bit of a crusade

1698
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,544
I meant something to get to fry and buy

1699
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:50,176
Sure or a Mikey went on Piers Morgan show and yelled at him but guns

1700
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,480
Alex

1701
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:55,040
Started a petition to get beers Morgan deported

1702
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:59,136
Man

1703
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:03,744
Yeah and then he got he went on Piers Morgan showed started yelling at him about how like

1704
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:07,072
You guys tried to take our guns in 1776

1705
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,376
Answered

1706
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:15,008
That became like two weeks of his show

1707
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,336
What tell Alex that

1708
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:23,456
Gazebos for weeks

1709
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:27,552
That's what I'm glad that's actually what the word many fences about

1710
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,088
Yeah it was good complication

1711
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:30,880
Oh my God

01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:33,440

Fair enough

1727
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,288
Check me out on Twitter I'm yelling at people

1728
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,848
Trt1 get into Davis Twitter bar

1729
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:33,088
Jay-Z Twitter ends with me having blocked everybody on Twitter just yelling at myself

1730
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:36,416
I think it ends when you realize you can block yourself

1731
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:45,888
If you do end up blocking everybody in your just yelling at yourself eventually this episode of Alex is going to be
