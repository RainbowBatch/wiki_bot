I know there's a reason that you're out of butter

19
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,328
I remember that being no no I didn't butter sandwich

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
I panicked

00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:47,264
The corner store I bought a bag of chips

24
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616

Like if I think about this more I will be here for an hour almost always

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,568
You're always dealing with the cereal aisle conundrum

32
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
I want to go get a candy

33
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,176
From the grocery store

34
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,992

00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
Facebook group called Oklahoma

79
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,447
Also I'd like to give a little bit of a shout-out I guess

80
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,751
To the behind the bastards podcast

81
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,407
Nice of them to

82
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,319
I wish they would have gotten in touch with us

83
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
Quite frankly

84
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,647
Because there are little things that could have really

85
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
Help put things into

86
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Contacts like

87
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,791
Sprint

88
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,351
Listen to the latest episode

89
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
And they mentioned that the

90
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,471
They mentioned the Human Resources Director of Infowars

91
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
But don't mention that it's Alex Jones's dad

92
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,127
They don't mention that it's right

93
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
Throughout

94
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
That's true. You know

95
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Not notice that oh my God

96
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,207
Hey this is stuff like that I think they did a fine job but it's

97
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
The same time I think

98
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
We could have really

99
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Beefed-up summer

100
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
But oh well

101
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Such as life anyway

102
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
Thanks for the shout-out weepers

103
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911

What are those details

106
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:44,735
How could you expect even if you are reading over it and you're like

107
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:50,111
Why would you think that it's his dad

108
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:56,767
Louisiana

109
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,607

112
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,079
Does that own Castle Dental

113
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,663

What are rainbow colors

121
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
Very very charismatic

122
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
Although as

Crazy lineup

135
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
Also

136
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,295
Redman might only appear in the video I think Method Man the only one actually rapping

137
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,367
That's the best part of Space Jam

138
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:32,767
I pissed off at everyone like that are Kelly song cuz monstars Anthem is better

139

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,447
That's another issue

141
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
They make

142
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239

Blade Runner

151
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
2047

152
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
We talked about on the last episode from 2009 we talked about Alex Jones

153
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,591
Which was that avian flu released

154
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
85in

155
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:25,759
Brett Alex made a big deal out of this

156
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Actually mainstream Czechoslovakian

157
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
Sorry Czech Republic news

158
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,927
And we predicted very strong

159
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
You going to keep talking about this

160
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,327
For a long time

161
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
The way he was describing his

162
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,447
It reaction to the news I thought he had the flu

163
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
I was pretty sure about that

164
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
So

165
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,871
I was not surprised at all when I opened up a March

166
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Episode

167
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
Jason bermas was hosting

168
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,759
Alex had to take a sick day

169
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,111
I'm almost certain type of flu

170
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
You talkin about

171
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,279
Sweating room spinning he was upset his stomach

172
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,863
He doesn't show up for work the next day obviously of the bug

173
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,191
Well it's nice to have confirmation

174
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
Nothing but circumstantial evidence

175
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Awesome

176
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
March 8th comes around

177
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,527
It's the Sunday as well Friday off.

178
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Saturday off

179
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Absolutely

180
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
They reached

181
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,511
Until we get to the 8th

182
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Is in a very

183
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Strange

184
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Play

185
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
He may have he wants to talk a lot about guns

186
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,567
To talk about them

187
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
Plus the oppressive

188
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Why is that

189
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
From

190
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
Do you think it's only goes on to places like Boston

191
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,047
The Massachusetts store out in places like Connecticut

192
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,399
Those are your people

193
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,751
And a half

194
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,311
There's no law but they still go to prison

195
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,687
Now you're saying how does that happen well people going to prison all the time

196
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,927
GameStop

197
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,703
You can watch the court case, not

198
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Chucky men there

199
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
I tried to put him in prison and the jury said not guilty

200
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,967
They said it was on their own

201
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,319
Video footage around the country that their freedom is Terrorism

202
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,135
I'm not joking when I say

203
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:16,767
So that we already talked about a little bit that idea

204
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
Founding fathers were terrorists

205
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
If you look at it objectively mean

206
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,103
I wanted to reinforce

207
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Talk about that

208
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,479
He has this you get arrested with an arsenal of guns in your car

209
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Victoria's going to

210
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Come up later

211
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,551
We use that as a

212
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
The jump-off talked about you get arrested

213
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
For not taking vaccine

214
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Then he tries to pull a specific

215
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Example of that

216
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Come up with this

217
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Kelly Russia

218
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
Who got arrested for handing out copies of Alec

219
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,935
Spell was the DVD

220
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Material the crime

221
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,871
Or some other crime may have occurred

222
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
Arrested for him to go to Infowars

223
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
If you was discharged

224
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
Good terrorism arrested for that

225
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,855
In reality I'm going to reach you from the Kentucky police

226
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Press release

227
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,023
Investigators with the Kentucky State Police are attempting to deal with a flood of calls coming in to post

228
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
After Kentucky State Police in vest

229
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,887
Navigation was discussed

230
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,959
On December 15th 2003

231
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,495
.

232
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,335
Arrested fifty-three-year-old Kelly rushing of Fredonia Kentucky

233
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,895
On charges of menacing and terroristic threat

234
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,527
Russians accused of placing anti-government propaganda in the mailbox.

235
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,599
Radio talk show host Alex Jones discussed the Russian caisson

236
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
Radio show which aired on today's date

237
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,975
After the show was over post one received more than 50

238
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Recalls for people airing

239
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Their concerns with

240
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,191
The calls ended up tying up emergency dispatch personnel and phone lines that are normally used for regular police

241
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,263
Most of the calls were from people living in the Midwest

242
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Amber Westco

243
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
So

244
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
He ended up inconveniencing

245
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
The emergency response system

246
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
In Kentucky

247
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,343
Alex Jones directly responsible for that lying about the situation

248
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
This guy

249
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,927
With meddling with people's mailboxes

250
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,767
Federal mailboxes

251
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,911
Really you know that.

252
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
No

253
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
No it's just the Box

254
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,407
Mailbox is technically considered property of the federal government

255
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Or whatever

256
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,247
So you can't interfere with the like

257
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
Distribution

258
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Collection of

259
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
Because

260
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Just leave a bomb in

261
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,951
Mailbox

262
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,767
There are reasons for these laws being in place

263
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
So this Trooper

264
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
Did Kelly Russian guy leave

265
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,423
This propaganda

266
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
Which is a crime

267
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
That's it's not like he's standing out

268
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
The middle of Lake public spaces

269
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
Okay it's a crime

270
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:17,759
Now that Alex wanted to say it shouldn't be a crime to put things in someone's mailbox that they don't want in their mailbox

271
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Have that conversation

272
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
It's a different conversation

273
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
You can have it

274
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
Except

275
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
You're damn right

276
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,335
Also I don't believe Alex actually

277
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
Possibly pretty illegal

278
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,943
Advanced that sparked a communication and it works

279
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
It could be seen as trying

280
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Call him at home

281
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
No

282
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,671
I don't think you should do that

283
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Intimidation

284
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Then that's illegal

285
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,023
If it ex-parte communication it could

286
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Influence

287
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
The judge

288
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
To go against

289
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Kelly Rush

290
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,911
And the case is like

291
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
These people are trying to

292
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
The metal with the case

293
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
Probably on his behalf

294
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
So it is

295
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
I don't think

296
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
He did it but if you did it's one of the stupidest

297
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Things you could do in a

298
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,503
Alex is gone

299
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,831
And a bunch of people who are nowhere near

300
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
Fredonia

301
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
Kentucky

302
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,439
Call Mike 911 over and over and over again

303
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Called Airline

304
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
Hey this is evil right and then like a cup

305
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
For the people

306
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Maybe

307
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
I don't know the stats on that

308
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:44,543
Beginning of that clip he's bringing up this idea if you get arrested again Arsenal in your car and what have you

309
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
11 Arsenal are going

310
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
I think that's okay

311
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
2D

312
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
Introduction of that

313
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
Exactly talk about it already

314
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Here's a

315
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,391
Police Arsenal found

316
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
Ahead of a wedding

317
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
Police pulling over

318
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
4 rifles and they freaked out and flipped out and

319
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,543
They were all legal

320
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,615
Charging

321
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,223
So that's

322
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Details before I get into the specifics

323
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
I would let Alex hang himself a little more in

324
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
Text Clara

325
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,207
Yeah I don't know if you had a thought

326
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
I don't like

327
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
Shooting rifles ahead of a

328
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
The wedding is like

329
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,703
His ex-girlfriend

330
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
You got to suck it up a little bit

331
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,383
In terms of that cuz it's not

332
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Anything wrong with that

333
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
If it makes you uncomfortable

334
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,159
Timmy is a weird thing to do

335
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
Here it is next web

336
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,767
You're right to be a little bit.

337
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
Your you're

338
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
You're sort of the vibe

339
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
Sensor is going off

340
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,447
Getting a bad vibe

341
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Wayward Son

342
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,847
Can I see the stories everyday when normally is preceded by

343
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,527
Insurance salesman

344
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,927
I thought you were going to go with

345
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,847
The police

346
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,551
Ohio

347
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
Person up over and over again why my producers these people

348
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
It's got the point I don't even call

349
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
People up anymore

350
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
But you know what let's do it again

351
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
The gentleman

352
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
Luke

353
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
Who's Inga

354
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,607
I was on his way to a wedding in May

355
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,983
Semi-automatic shotgun

356
00:19:54,239 --> 00:20:00,127
Why he had some knives all my gosh I don't like animatronics shows the pocket knives

357
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
He was going

358
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,503
So Alex is going to reach out and help us

359
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
Huisinga

360
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,623
This is another bad case for Alex to be rallying behind

361
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
Yeah Alex tell if his innocent kid with four semiotic rifles is getting pulled over by police

362
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
No reason to pull over

363
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,911
And if you're pulled over because of the Cross Lanes

364
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
Just Behavior

365
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
When the police

366
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
Responses to questions

367
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,383
And being that it was 12:20 in the morning

368
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
That could be an indication of impairment or worse

369
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,807
They haven't get out of the truck and patted him turned up bullets

370
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
So they searched his truck

371
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
They did not find for

372
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,975
They got a rifle with a night scope at Edwards 12

373
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:53,375
12-gauge shotgun high-capacity magazines

374
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,703
5 knives brass knuckles in a bulletproof vest

375
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
With armor plate

376
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:09,759
His mother was quoted in the paper as saying that he was quote a sportsman miliar with guns

377
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:16,159
Perhaps a little too much that's what his mama said

378
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
So

379
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,792
What position of most Firearms is not illegal magazines

380
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
It's usually a really bad

381
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
Knuckles are super useful against

382
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,936
The deer we all learn from

383
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,240
Generally okay

384
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,544
And we all learn from the case of OD

385
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
Illegal to have a bulletproof vest

386
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Because

387
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,944
You know it implies that you may find your way into us

388
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
Situation

389
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Lake

390
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Go shoot some people

391
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,368
Oh and also he was transporting these guns across state line

392
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,952
So even if they're perfectly legal now they're not

393
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Right

394
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,304
The kids from Danbury

395
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
He got arrested in Mass

396
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
Massachusetts

397
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
So you were across multiple state lines

398
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,728
With all of these gun even if they're registered

399
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Connecticut

400
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,312
You can't carry on Arsenal across state lines

401
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,592
Without a good reason

402
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,664
Shooting with your buddies before wedding is not a good reason

403
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
Pennywise

404
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
It's easy to hear a story like this

405
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
Have some empathy

406
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
He's 18 years old

407
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,880
This could easily be a misunderstanding on the part of the kid

408
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,976
Who Loved too much it doesn't realize that he's headed down and anti-social pass

409
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
You think maybe this run-in with the cops

410
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
We'll set him straight

411
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
It didn't

412
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,472
Ingo was arrested after his live-in girlfriend told police he quote assaulted her

413
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,312
Including shaving her up against her will and engaging in bondage type sex

414
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,872
His friend Joshua McGuire told police to be

415
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
Be careful when they went to arrest

416
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,432
Because he's always armed

417
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,248
McGuire

418
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
Who may want to go down in a blazer

419
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,088
Glory according to the arrest affidavit

420
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
Oh yeah

421
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Always

422
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Always

423
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Always

424
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:05,472
The investigation of the woman's claim in late August LED police to serve a warrant on his inga's home

425
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
We're just followed by search warrants

426
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
For the property in his vehicle

427
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,384
The emergency response team was called to the home that night finding what they can

428
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
Considered items used

429
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:18,016
For the manufacturing of firearms and bombs

430
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,064
The home turned out to hold a trove of weapon

431
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Gun parts

432
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,904
Pounds of black powder and milk crate

433
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Containers

434
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,232
And a bin that helps thousands of rounds of ammunition

435
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
Along with you along with the items

436
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
Police say they found a sounds

437
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
Suppressor

438
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,448
Silencer made from the metal body of a Maglite flashlight

439
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,776
That's right it onto the end of a 22 caliber gun barrel

440
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
So he made his own site

441
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,640
Yep from a flashlight that's not a good sign

442
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
That's not a good sign

443
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,760
Sound 8%

444
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
Which service frame

445
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,088
The guns other parts

446
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,440
There was a few mechanical alterations in additional Parts could be made it to work in firearms

447
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
In some cases those types of

448
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
The receiver is sometimes referred to as blank

449
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,864
Don't hold serial numbers they're used to track their ownership

450
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
Be purchased online

451
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,448
Why they don't have those

452
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,776
Is that why they don't

453
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
I so they can

454
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,336
All the parts

455
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
Which is not over

456
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,664
And then make their own gun

457
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,992
Which are unregistered and untraceable and then you sell those

458
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:27,392
To somebody who just wants to go hunting damn they're all good citizen

459
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,488
His girlfriend told police that Luke had an unpredictable temper

460
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,888
2011

461
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:44,288
2011 just two years after the episode

462
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
Walking to the wall above her head

463
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,896
After they had a kid loopty not mellow and become a good dad

464
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:54,016
When their child was 24 months old he would spank her to stop her from crying leaving bruises on her thighs

465
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,320
She also told police that he saw him

466
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
Cover their child's mouth

467
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
The quieter

468
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
Just super f***** up

469
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,952
That is really not the way to do it

470
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
U b a

471
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,376
Luke would also slap choke and tie up his girlfriend

472
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Did not want him to do

473
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,496
Made a lot of money off selling unregistered

474
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Sergun

475
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,848
So maybe the police weren't out of line pulling this guy over

476
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:23,712
Maybe they were incredibly perceptive

477
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
When you heard the beginning of the story

478
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
This guy is

479
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
A bad dude

480
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
I don't I don't

481
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
She is a good

482
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
From what I understand

483
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
From that he was work

484
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,816
Thing is like a construction

485
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Dad

486
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,960
Cool and selling guns

487
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
Look it's a gig economy

488
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
Right

489
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:56,224
You got to come on I sell my blood unregistered gun

490
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Again

491
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Used

492
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
Curaleaf

493
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,112
So now we have Kelly rushing

494
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
It does not match

495
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
Reality

496
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
Later on

497
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
In the radio show

498
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,792
Historian that apologized

499
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,168
You know it's not a truth

500
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,288
Of the actual

501
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,384
We live in the future we know what this guy is all about

502
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
He's an abuser

503
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
Violin

504
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,016
Gun arms dealer

505
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,576
These are not good example

506
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,976
A hundred percent

507
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
Stuff

508
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
The one time

509
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
I myself and Doug

510
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,008
Rodger wrestler

511
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,056
And his brother Alex wrestler

512
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:58,176
We're driving by the way he was valedictorian of his class now has like a top

513
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
Not an important detail

514
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
No criminal record

515
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,880
And we're driving to go to the shooting range

516
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,928
And we got rifles in the back

517
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,952
Pennsylvania

518
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,608
State Police pull us over

519
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
It is down

520
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
You know why the cops were concerned

521
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,624
You were driving around with a bunch of guns and a minor in your car

522
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
An unrelated minor

523
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,816
There's literally no way for this Rodger wrestler to be over 18

524
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:51,936
He says he's a few years younger than him but also says he would later go to UT

525
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,520
So you clearly talkin about a time when biscuit was in high school

526
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:05,248
I don't either I don't like being around other people who are named Alex

527
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,320
At least five or six guns in the car

528
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
That that's why the cops

529
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
A concern

530
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,928
I think that's probably a good thing

531
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
If

532
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,840
Definition of when a country goes down the toilet is

533
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,656
I can't ride around at 18

534
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,984
With 427 guns in the backseat

535
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,568
And a minor in the car with no

536
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,968
When I can't do that I know this country has gone down the toilet

537
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
Yeah

538
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
Ideal World

539
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,888
The time no no no

540
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Clint Eastwood

541
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,472
You're dumb

542
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Because

543
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:05,152
Once everybody has a gun no one will ever shoot anybody because the other person has a gun

544
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:11,552
Which also kind of indicates kind of indicates like

545
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Learn anything from

546
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,720
Like a

547
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,608
Yeah I think that's I think this is a little bit of a Nuance of that

548
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Just thinks that like

549
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,936
Hey it'll be a good deterrent

550
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
It'll just wait anybody

551
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,008
Computing another person cuz they know they got a gun

552
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,640
You know how no country goes to war with each other because they all have bomb

553
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,200
Oh my God these people are trying to get us all killed

554
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
Missouri dump

555
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
So I believe that story

556
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,256
Or something like that

557
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,560
Probably did have the right paperwork whatever the

558
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,864
So who gives a s***

559
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
12 guns

560
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:13,504
So this next clip Alec tells a story Viva vegan

561
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,856
What's a real Sandra Bullock

562
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,136
Do you notice right now

563
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,376
Real quick this is after complaining about how like

564
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Make everyone think

565
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
Youfit owning guns

566
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,032
Everyone watches the show scared of guns

567
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080
So you got a shotgun up on his wall and

568
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
Carpet cleaners Oscar

569
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
Beck Bryant children

570
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,016
In my broadcast shotgun ride up on the wall

571
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,808
Had a gun safe right next to it

572
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
Got a shotgun

573
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:54,208
And that guy started freaking out about it I'm not going to clean this room that guns illegal

574
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:00,864
And I was just like what I don't know

575
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,448
On the cover of the metro state

576
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,712
Can I call the car

577
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
You understand the country

578
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,648
We live in

579
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
I believe anything

580
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,512
I'll believe everybody called him yes mister

581
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:34,656
Maybe your mean-spirited service capacity someone

582
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
Maybe

583
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
A train

584
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
So black under scary

585
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,480
What is a little bit of

586
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
How to say

587
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,696
It's worse because I don't believe the story extraneous details

588
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
Clearly fabricated story

589
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:06,400
Allegheny carpet cleaner be like oh my God you a shotgun on your wall a decorative gun I'm not going to have

590
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Philly

591
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
Well I mean the shotgun was

592
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
Connected to a

593
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:18,432
Series of a home alone style trap Goldberg

594
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,040
You would be shocked by that guy

595
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,344
He doesn't have a job

596
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,416
You might as well break up

597
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,256
The other storytellers is like he put a bunch of guns in his car cuz

598
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Who's going to go online

599
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,072
Or something like that

600
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,864
When he was a younger man

601
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,192
The police came while he was away

602
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
Because a neighbor called

603
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,800
He's like oh my God isn't this just

604
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
Just tearing it

605
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:51,968
Does hack stand up material

606
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,040
Your business that's kind of like

607
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
What's a trope

608
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,904
A bad television stand-up just the idea of like

609
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,928
Nosey neighbor

610
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:11,680
Feel like I was being a nosy neighbor if I walked by and my neighbor was loading a s*** ton of guns

611
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,496
I think that would just be responsible

612
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
I'll be like hey what's going on here

613
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
I'm going to camp

614
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
I'm not going to ask

615
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:26,528
Unloading Six-Guns have some

616
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
Familiarity

617
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,136
Rapport

618
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,208
Maybe I don't understand the multiple gun

619
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,768
Like

620
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Trustee

621
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
You know

622
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,216
You might be going with multiple people also you might want to use dip

623
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
You know like if you're up in

624
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
Tree stand you might want one gun

625
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,640
If you're out shooting rabbits you might want a different gun

626
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,688
So if you're going out I understand

627
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
Disorder

628
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:07,744
Synonymous for killing every animal in this area that I am going

629
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,584
At this point I was jumped off the gun

630
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,216
Do which is talking more about this Baxter

631
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,496
International

632
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
Flash biotab

633
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,824
Yeah mix up that happen

634
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
But again wasn't Baxter's fault

635
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,200
The Czech Republic

636
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,760
You get back to that narrative if you Vols a little bit

637
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,160
I regret we have to talk about

638
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
But we do

639
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,768
What happened is Baxter Pharmaceuticals based in the US

640
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,608
Mailed in Europe

641
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,448
With the orders to mix

642
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
Hn

643
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:56,896
H 5 n 1 avian flu virus

644
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
Your lungs fill up with water you.

645
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,576
It doesn't feel right with young children

646
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
And old people

647
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,976
The regular flu vaccine

648
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
Nope

649
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,728
French German check

650
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,080
Historically written up on infowars.com

651
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:32,480
911 blogger

652
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,112
The bird flu

653
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
It was super Airborne flu

654
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
So

655
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,536
The only real evolution of the narrative is now.

656
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,096
Places with selection of the places

657
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,888
They got things from this lab

658
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:56,288
In the Czech Republic only three of them were named in the original articles

659
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,336
Multiple places

660
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,712
Or Australia or Slovenian

661
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,736
The samples from

662
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,064
18 number I'm not super I got in wanted

663
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
Dig more into this narrative

664
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,928
I know what the truth is of the bigger picture

665
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,280
Absolutely that's possible but they were all placed

666
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
The got things from Biotest

667
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,984
Is just like okay

668
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,800
News

669
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:36,480
You have 911 blogger being misrepresented by Paul Joseph Watson

670
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
My prediction is correct

671
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
You talking about in the Box

672
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,344
I don't have a bunch of it in because he

673
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Brings it up

674
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,208
It's just their truck

675
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
Create this pandemic

676
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
Yeah

677
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,536
The globalists are awesome

678
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
The chain

679
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,328
Whoopty Doo

680
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
Well the things that

681
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
It's really insane

682
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
Sidious is immediately

683
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
Just saying fire tattoo

684
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,520
Weather

685
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,568
Which is based in the US

686
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
In the US

687
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Sent the samples

688
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
Right

689
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,528
Laboratory

690
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
In the check

691
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,088
Republic

692
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,440
That's the impression that if you read the 9/11

693
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:23,840
Coming from the globalist

694
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:32,032
I looked into a little more and I found it the 911 blogger isn't like a person

695
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
It's a site where a bunch of people can

696
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
Can contribute blog post

697
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:39,200
Oh so this post was actually put up just by some guy

698
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:43,040
Bloggers who might have

699
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
Credible

700
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,160
Standing I don't think 9/11 blogger would at 2

701
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
Like online

702
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
Anonymous contributor

703
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,000
2911

704
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,560
Another level of

705
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
Like nonsense

706
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
Which is both because it least

707
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,424
911

708
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
Saudi Arabia

709
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,544
The globalist

710
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
Bill Clinton

711
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Larry Nichols

712
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
Yeah for sure

713
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
Damon Dash

714
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,808
Roc-A-Fella Records

715
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,904
Absolutely their Luminati related

716
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,232
911

717
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:27,072
Jumpsuit Jay-Z could make a state of mind

718
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:33,728
That was after 9/11 not empire songs

719
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,776
My bad

720
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:42,176
Indeed that's the victim of a terrorist attack

721
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,736
Scrabble

722
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:50,112
And Jay-Z got together to make Empire State of Mind

723
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
Hold on

724
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,696
But the best thing to come out of that song

725
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
Was whenever it

726
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,768
Was combined with the Bacon pancake song

727
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,864
From Adventure Time I don't know what are you saying

728
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
Adventure Time

729
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:08,800
The metaphorical Saudi Arabia

730
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,408
So Jordans

731
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:18,272
Because he's got weak s*** about the avian flu

732
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
To do

733
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Needs to related

734
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
Other narratives

735
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
But he has

736
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
He pitches out

737
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
And so each

738
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,280
That's particularly ugly and dark

739
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
To talk about but I

740
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
It's very important to interns

741
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,656
Understanding

742
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,264
Alex Jones does his dirty work in a rating scale

743
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
Is going to go is this

744
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
6 Guns

00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,432
Your car.

746
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
Situation

747
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,248
I thought I would go back

748
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,344
You can just Google

749
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,416
In the Google you'll get hundreds of news articles

750
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,720
MSNBC pieces where they admit

751
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
Bear the big

752
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Apparent

753
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,376
A bunch of cameras

754
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,960
4 years

755
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,496
Was on going until 2000

756
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
Factor 8

757
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,528
The media was called to the vaccine it really isn't

758
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
No they don't

759
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
Hot salsa

760
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,488
Who was the older adult

761
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,048
Baxter Pharmaceuticals

762
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:38,656
Now what year is a mainstream Europe

763
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,032
The cause of pandemic

764
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Because

765
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,896
Baxter separately trying to get approval for a bird flu

766
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
Vaccine

767
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,016
So that's that's mainstream news in Europe

768
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,064
No it is 911 blogger

769
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,112
Editorial

770
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
As check media

771
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
Now what

772
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,560
Smell real quick Baxter was

773
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,120
Going to working on a h 5 n 1 vaccine

774
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,448
Approval for it until October

775
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
2009

776
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,520
Saudi

777
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,592
Lady who lost her medical license

778
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
For being crazy

779
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:24,736
Years Breyer piles of this flu vaccine

780
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
It doesn't fly because

781
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,088
They didn't get approval until October

782
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
Now the idea that they did

783
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,160
To get approval

784
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
For the vaccine

785
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,512
Because like I said

786
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
This all happened

787
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:42,656
At the beginning of February Alex's reporting on it a month later they wouldn't get approval for another 6 months

788
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,240
So the idea that they're trying to fast-track that somehow doesn't

789
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,312
Like they were already in the process of

790
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
Getting it through they've gotten

791
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:56,223
Preliminary approval for speed up the process at all

792
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,271
If anything it probably called them to

793
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
Lower staff

794
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,135
Because as we learned from the investigation from the office

795
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Nuclear

796
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
The Czech Republic

797
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,559
Navy ravir Greenhills

798
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
Wasn't

799
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,119
Applying pressure to Biotest

800
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
To make things move

801
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,679
Faster for there

802
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,471
Okay

803
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,287
2000s

804
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,079
Conclusions that they found probably let the

805
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,615
Them to have to slow things down to live

806
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
Leading to them getting brutal

807
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
In October

808
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,527
Write to all that doesn't really make sense

809
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,575
It's just been spiritual really like what is

810
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
Kind of stuff

811
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
I got you

812
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
Well

813
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,839
Here's the Big B are those the only virus

814
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,167
No but this is where things are going to get real bad

815
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,495
Part of the reason is that Alex is talking about a real thing

816
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
Really being

817
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Unfair about

818
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,383
The early 1980s there's an outbreak of cases of AIDs that

819
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
It appeared to be directly related

820
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,199
To the use of blood products

821
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
Particularly Factor

822
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,063
To the clotting Factor drug used by humans celiacs to make

823
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,927
Clotting Factor

824
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,975
Usually two to three times a week

825
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
Or else they'll end up with an

826
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,279
Internal bleeding

827
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:18,655
I get a cut it won't stop bleeding

828
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:26,591
Intense process that sucks I watched a documentary about

829
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
Some of this stuff

830
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,895
Batman also just

831
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
The life of

832
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
Hemophiliac

833
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
Right

834
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,247
There's a couple that are

835
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Hemophiliac children

836
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,599
Anywhere showing like their cabinets

837
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,647
Full of gauze and syringes

838
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
Wow

839
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,487
Do like really adjust

840
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,047
And learn how to find a vein

841
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
As a parent is

842
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
It really

843
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,983
It got me a little emotional because also

844
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,775
The dad was talking about how like

845
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,311
It's a real tree

846
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,335
To raise these kids

847
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,383
And like even with all of the

848
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
Very

849
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
Logistical trouble

850
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,247
In this documentary

851
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
Those kids will grow up in

852
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
That like

853
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,319
It's just very movie

854
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,255
The inbreeding of the Royals in Europe

855
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,303
I don't know if that's necessarily wear

856
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,839
You could trace it all back 20

857
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
It certainly was

858
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
First cases

859
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,191
That reported but it's possible that a lot of people

860
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
Before that habitats

861
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
Cuz I mean

862
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
Tubi

863
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,919
They never would have found the

864
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:43,647
That's the case with all of Alex's like medical Woo which is that idea that like

865
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,815
We just didn't know what it was

866
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,119
So drugs

867
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,423
Such as this factor 8 clotting drug

868
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,983
Blood product

869
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Plasma

870
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:05,151
In the late 1970s and early 80s

871
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,711
The plasma in blood collected in that time.

872
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,527
Could not be scream for something that doctors did not know to look

873
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,087
Company looking to make the most profit

874
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,367
But naturally cut corners

875
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Resort

876
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:21,535
Collecting plasma from impoverished communities which has the highest incidence of being IV drug user

877
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,815
Some cases

878
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,375
You also have a very high rate

879
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
Correctly

880
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Bear

881
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,591
In order not just not just bear

882
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
Japanese

883
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Would you

884
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,943
Take blood from prisoners

885
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,735
I'm sure was voluntary but yeah

886
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,807
Compensated

887
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:47,647
General population

888
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,463
I sell my blood

889
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:55,071
For plasma now I know from doing this as much as I have

890
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,119
They still Target the impoverished

891
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:00,703
So that part hasn't

892
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,239
Standards and practice

893
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:09,919
Blood products being collected in the late seventies early eighties with contaminated with the as-yet on

894
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
Unidentified

895
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,503
Many hemophiliacs contracted AIDS

896
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
From the clotting injection

897
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,087
And overall there's no way to talk about

898
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,623
It's about being straightforward and

899
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,647
Absolute

900
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:24,255
What's proper testing was available in October 1984

901
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,535
What is reporting its

902
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
34% of

903
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,095
Hemophiliacs treated with the old version

904
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
In the factory

905
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
I tested positive

906
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:33,215
It's a crazy high amount

907
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,775
Where does become compounded

908
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,335
Is the cutter biological a unit of Bayer

909
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,127
Continue telling that version

910
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,175
The factory even though

911
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,199
Heat-treated version

912
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,479
Had become available

913
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,551
They introduced this new version The Factory in February 9th

914
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
1884

915
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:51,903
I did not fully stop selling the oil dangerous version until July

916
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,999
Alex has been continued through 2000

917
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,023
And that is not

918
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,815
Correct

919
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,863
Got to make that last little bit of money

920
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:07,007
Where can I get rid of all this old factory

921
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,335
Text I'm going to go over there might be a little

922
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,895
And I want to stay up front I am not

923
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,687
The foremost scholar on the 8th

924
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
Anything like

925
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,015
I read a bunch of reports for

926
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
From the national anthem

927
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:19,807
Help

928
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
Some contemporary reports

929
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
It's all

930
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,927
Some of the darkest

931
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,487
Sadist

932
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,511
But

933
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,791
And Reagan made it so much

934
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,863
Part of what I'm talking

935
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,911
Alex

936
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
Expectorate

937
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
There's a number of important

938
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,031
Finally leaving out with your big parts of the

939
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
The context

940
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:46,175
The first is that companies of which bear is particularly its International

941
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,759
These potentially tainted blood products out with foreknowledge

942
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,831
But I was playing fast and loose about what they might have had

943
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,111
Had foreknowledge of

944
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:58,207
One of the things that has to be understood is that the time. Alex is discussing

945
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,487
When blood products

946
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,279
From people with HIV was being used to me

947
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Make factor 8

948
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,327
Was when Reagan wasn't on

949
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,679
He was President for pretty much the entire 1980s which is when the AIDS crisis

950
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
This was at its most tragic

951
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,751
Add one of the things that made it worse

952
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,799
Was it Reagan was someone who stasha Lee opposed

953
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
Any governmental regulation

954
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,383
Including ones related to public

955
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
So

956
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,199
He was resistant to

957
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,479
Putting things in place

958
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
That would have

959
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
Help

960
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,575
Mitigate the damage that was being done

961
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,415
Brochure

962
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,207
Even if everything was done perp

963
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,023
Some of these people would still have been in fact

964
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
Quit because of the

965
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,399
Mandan

966
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
Maybe naive

967
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,959
On the part of

968
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,775
People before they knew what the problem was

969
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
So

970
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
Further it should be noted that the cause of AIDS was

971
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,871
Not knowing

972
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,175
4 years after the medical community began

973
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:53,503
From a June 24th 1983 publication

974
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
From the national anthem

975
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
Streets of hell

976
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,087
Call the cause of Ages unknown

977
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,903
Most likely to be caused by a native transmitted by

978
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
Intimate sexual contact

979
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:06,047
Contaminated needles or less

980
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,583
Infected blood or blood products

981
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,703
83 looks like this

982
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,007
Yeah so that is

983
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,031
Because that means

984
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,311
There is not a consensus

985
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:21,151
That means that there were people holding out and I don't know if we prove

986
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,431
That right

987
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,967
It's not like we have today

988
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
Where there's the denier

989
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
Large sex

990
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,903
Legitimate medical community are still not

991
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,719
Convince will they weren't convinced that women had orgasms

992
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
Nicole

993
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,607
Even wants the medical community figured out that this was

994
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,631
Is the primary means for

995
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
Mission

996
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,703
Even in the National Institute of Health

997
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,751
May 10th 1985 release

998
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,031
They highlight another issue

999
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,079
Because the time from

1000
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,871
Tuan said maybe several years

1001
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,407
Persons exposed to the virus through

1002
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,223
Hurt before

1003
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,783
Institution of the self differential guidelines

1004
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,807
For blood donors in

1005
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,599
3 screening of blood

1006
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
Antibody in 19

1007
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,159
Maybe five May remain at risk of

1008
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:08,255
Before 1983 there were no standards in place regarding blood don't

1009
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,047
It was a further two years

1010
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,327
After that the donations

1011
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,143
Screen extract

1012
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,959
3 what they ended up doing this like voluntary question

1013
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Alaska

1014
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
People

1015
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,055
Are you in high-risk population

1016
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:27,455
Two years after that before they started screening their actual donors

1017
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,991
He's giving them small amounts of money

1018
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:35,391
Forever love you on those those questions

1019
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,047
And that's why now they don't let me know juice still ask you a question

1020
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,583
In case there were red flag

1021
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,655
Right or something like that but

1022
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,935
They also test

1023
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,263
Exactly

1024
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,127
What are the main reasons that society-at-large didn't take this crisis seriously is that initially

1025
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
It was only sex

1026
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:00,223
With the time or much more marginalized than they are today

1027
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:04,063
Early on the disease with called related immunodeficiency

1028
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,135
And as late as June 1982.

1029
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
Speculating

1030
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,439
Behavioral elements

1031
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
To the homosexual life

1032
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,743
Style where the cause

1033
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,791
Even suggesting the disease might be

1034
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,327
Because by use of amyl

1035
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
Or Papa

1036
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,655
Hemophiliacs and others

1037
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
Receive blood tree

1038
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,751
Transfusions is 20 months of age

1039
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,311
Some doctors started to make that connection

1040
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,615
Others felt that because the number of France

1041
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,455
Infusion-related escapism

1042
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,783
Fusion it was more likely that these cases were caused by

1043
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,319
Unrelated

1044
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,367
Depression related to their existing

1045
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,183
Right

1046
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:47,583
No no no you make me mixed up a little bit

1047
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,351
183

1048
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,423
CDC health department meeting to discuss opportunities to limited effect

1049
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:55,519
They discussed her blood bank should ask donors questions about their sexual behavior

1050
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
A run the blood

1051
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,311
Your test for things

1052
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,127
Since there was no test

1053
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
And they are

1054
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,455
To be a correlation

1055
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,479
Between hepatitis A

1056
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:08,063
They felt like it would be a good screen

1057
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,111
4 something

1058
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
You bet

1059
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
These donations

1060
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:19,583
And that's one of the reasons that the blood bank

1061
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,679
Association was like that's probably not a good idea that will make us have no

1062
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,703
Donors

1063
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,263
Right so we're not convinced

1064
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
Bloodborne

1065
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
And resisted these suggest

1066
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:35,455
Additionally, director of the fda's division of Blood In Blood products

1067
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
Inactivated virus

1068
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
Blood products was

1069
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
Underway

1070
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,903
Donahue was hoping to find a virus in blood products

1071
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,439
As opposed to

1072
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,975
Bang the existing blood supply

1073
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
Free of viruses

1074
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,791
Is the definition of backwards

1075
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,887
But it is something that they ended up with

1076
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:59,519
Result was saying that we're going to make this better in

1077
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
In the future but

1078
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,823
All the stuff we already got

1079
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:07,199
No

1080
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,735
It's not quite that way

1081
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,527
They were able to do

1082
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,551
On new

1083
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,623
They couldn't do it with the stuff that it already been

1084
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,951
You have to do the heat treatment on the Vic

1085
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
Constituent parts

1086
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,767
The

1087
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:21,791
Ingredients

1088
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,095
Since the factory

1089
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,375
Once it's already come by

1090
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,935
So they did find

1091
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,263
They did find that that was waived

1092
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
You get around the fact

1093
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,335
Test

1094
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,199
Keep out right

1095
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,479
In the short-term

1096
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,759
But then once they're worth

1097
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,855
Anyway in early 1980s

1098
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
Discovered and hypothesized

1099
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
Does the causal agent of a

1100
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,743
By the middle of 1985 all Blood Bank in plasma center

1101
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,791
Implemented early screen

1102
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
However in October nights

1103
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,607
80 for the sea

1104
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
CDC announcement

1105
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,911
Laboratory experiment showed

1106
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,935
The heat treatment process

1107
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:00,959
Inactivated

1108
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,751
So

1109
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
Solution

1110
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,383
People knew and they didn't

1111
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:15,039
So in 2003 and their subsidiary cutter biological

1112
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Dollars worth

1113
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,575
The clotting Factor

1114
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,623
To Asia and Latin America

1115
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,815
Owl selling a newer safer product in the West

1116
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,631
This gets super complicated

1117
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:36,543
Speaking on behalf of Qatar commented to the New York Times quote continue to sell the old medicine

1118
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,615
Because some customers doubted the new drug

1119
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Effectiveness

1120
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,943
And because some countries were slow to approve its tail

1121
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,759
The company also said that a shortage of plasma

1122
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
Used

1123
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,111
I kept her from manufacturing more of the new product

1124
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:53,951
Court decisions made nearly two decades ago

1125
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,231
Nevada time

1126
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,023
And were consistent with the regulations

1127
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,631
Relates to regulations that's probably a fair point

1128
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,447
And appointed fears about the effectiveness about

1129
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,751
Is absolutely something that's backed up by history

1130
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,799
From an article in the Irish Times

1131
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,335
Fractions

1132
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,615
Blood product

1133
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,383
Manufacturers

1134
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,687
We're more fearful of 1984 side effects

1135
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,479
It's caused by a heat treatment process

1136
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,503
The killed HIV

1137
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
None of the virus itself

1138
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
Senior British fracture

1139
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:26,207
Doctor James Mitchell

1140
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,231
Heat-treated product

1141
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,791
Call genetic reaction

1142
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,351
This position gradually changed

1143
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
From Midnight teenage

1144
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:33,887
84

1145
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,423
But

1146
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,471
Thrombogenic

1147
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,007
I remained a major

1148
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,799
Consideration into 1985

1149
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,847
So much so that British fractionator

1150
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,127
Even delay the release of

1151
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
Heat-treated cons

1152
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,919
Concentrate

1153
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,991
So there is

1154
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,527
Reason to believe

1155
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,063
To some extent

1156
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,343
Yeah people

1157
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,111
Hesitant

1158
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,415
Adopt this new safer

1159
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,439
Version

1160
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
Now

1161
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,743
I don't care

1162
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,047
Necessarily about that argument

1163
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
Because the document

1164
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
When did it come out of

1165
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,887
Qatar is internal

1166
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
Working

1167
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,959
Do show a bit of a

1168
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
The callousness

1169
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
Do the idea

1170
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
I was like

1171
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,287
Let's see if we can

1172
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,055
Find markets

1173
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
Because

1174
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,199
Never an intentional attempt to infect

1175
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
People with AIDS

1176
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,991
The largest

1177
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,039
The story is unregulated capitalism

1178
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
With a background of a

1179
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,855
Tragic Public Health crisis

1180
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,391
Being worsened by Republic

1181
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,183
Ministration

1182
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
Implement regular

1183
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,487
This is a

1184
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,511
Human tragedy

1185
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,559
That really really really really

1186
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,119
Bumped me out reading about

1187
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
And

1188
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
There

1189
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:44,031
I stopped short of calling it evil but it's pretty easy

1190
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,615
It's pretty evil but the beginnings of it aren't

1191
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:52,223
No pretty women Salvador ignorance and then once you know about it you have

1192
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,783
To change your behavior

1193
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,879
Just sold the new that he would exhibit some of it

1194
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,903
Not only

1195
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,439
Could cause a

1196
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,863
I'm not I'm not defending that all places and then they sold the stuff that wouldn't cause HIV

1197
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,679
I'm not I'm not defending that at all and I'm not saying that

1198
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:15,519
Settlement

1199
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,543
People which still isn't

1200
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,823
Nearly enough I believe

1201
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
A b d d

1202
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,151
I think they should be punished

1203
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,199
White Horse Lake

1204
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,759
Isaac just based on us being

1205
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,599
Interested in finding out where Alex is lying

1206
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,623
The truth is

1207
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,695
I think it's pretty important to recognize

1208
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,719
Is that

1209
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,767
There was plausible deniability

1210
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,791
To a certain extent

1211
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,071
All medical exam

1212
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
Yeah

1213
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:44,447
Did the idea of July 1985

1214
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,983
Is f***** up

1215
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,055
But there is an argument to be made that they could

1216
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,079
Find scientist

1217
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
Some doctors

1218
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,127
Who were crazy

1219
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,687
Who disputed the idea that their blood products

1220
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:57,503
Could cause HIV

1221
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,551
You know what I don't I don't know what

1222
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,087
To do with it except to say

1223
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,879
This is the reality of this

1224
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,671
Situation this is what happened

1225
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,975
It's awful

1226
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,791
Hurt and killed a lot of people

1227
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,839
The reason it wasn't taken more seriously

1228
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,631
Is the marginalization of

1229
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
Sexual community

1230
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
And

1231
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,447
The bottom line

1232
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Dollars

1233
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,287
And do like a regulation

1234
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,567
That's all that.

1235
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,615
Base of the story

1236
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
To be like justifying

1237
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,967
His idea that the globalist

1238
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,759
Set off a bio-weapon because

1239
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,783
They gave all these

1240
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
People AIDS

1241
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,855
Yeah it's not fair

1242
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
This is a tragedy

1243
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,743
Disrespectful to the people

1244
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
Who

1245
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,535
Hurt the most

1246
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
Yeah

1247
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:45,119
I don't know I just I deeply resent Alex's

1248
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,399
This

1249
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,007
When you look into it you're the

1250
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
People talk about

1251
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:57,919
Documentary

1252
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
Call Blood Brother

1253
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,479
He's with someone

1254
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,247
The doctor

1255
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,575
The phds in automatic

1256
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,623
Call.

1257
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,647
Hemophiliac

1258
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,415
Who ended up

1259
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,463
From

1260
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,255
Is injection

1261
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
Alicia

1262
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:17,887
And he has a quote

1263
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,471
We believe that he really acts of the canaries in the coal mine

1264
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
The blood supply

1265
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:26,079
As soon as something goes wrong with the blood supply to the first ones who will show evidence

1266
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
We are warning system

1267
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,895
For the American people

1268
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,919
As soon as they see

1269
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Thing happen in the

1270
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,759
They better be aware that it's going to happen

1271
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
Tire America

1272
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,623
So I think that's probably the best way

1273
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,391
Look at this

1274
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,927
In terms of

1275
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,463
This was

1276
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,999
Unforeseen

1277
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:47,839
Tragedy

1278
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,375
That was born out of

1279
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,655
People not

1280
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,679
Yeah

1281
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,727
And then resisting knowing

1282
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,751
Much longer than

1283
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,591
This is so important

1284
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,639
It's not letting them out these companies off the hook

1285
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,431
They're absolutely responsible

1286
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,223
But we are looking at this

1287
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
From a 28

1288
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
18 viewpoint

1289
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,807
Yeah we're looking at it through this

1290
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,575
Pacific knowledge

1291
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,111
Being raised

1292
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:13,439
Largely in a. Of time where we understood

1293
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,231
And when you have

1294
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,255
Situation like

1295
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,791
You had in the early 80s

1296
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
You

1297
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,399
There's a lot of up and down about it

1298
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,447
If that's okay if that's not okay to say

1299
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,519
There's a lot of things that

1300
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,055
I am I don't I don't

1301
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
This is where

1302
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,919
These companies acted in good faith

1303
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:37,503
Like I don't think that they did I think they wanted to sell off these

1304
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,551
Supplies of things

1305
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,831
They knew

1306
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,903
I didn't want to have to write off a huge Warehouse

1307
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,695
But at the same time

1308
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,719
Have the science

1309
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,279
Really

1310
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,095
Understood as it is now

1311
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,143
I don't think that they would have acted

1312
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,215
You know what I'm I think they would walk

1313
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,495
But I don't think they would

1314
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:03,103
Because they're also regulations in place.

1315
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,735
Probably

1316
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,527
That goes to

1317
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:14,367
You know a car that has a defect that'll cause x amount of death

1318
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,391
Yeah

1319
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,927
Equations

1320
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,487
How much will a recall cost how much will

1321
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
Settling case

1322
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,047
Yeah exactly

1323
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,119
No I think there's a lot of businesses went allowed to

1324
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,959
This is another example of it but it's just

1325
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,727
Much

1326
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
Much

1327
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,287
Much more depressed

1328
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Awful

1329
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,663
Family

1330
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,735
Like I was reading about that

1331
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,271
Threw a bunch

1332
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,575
HIV

1333
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,159
And in the culture

1334
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,999
Forgetting this disease breakup fam

1335
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
Like the parents

1336
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,351
So these people who got it with

1337
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,119
Something wrong with

1338
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,655
Their kid

1339
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,191
It's just such a

1340
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:00,959
Tragedy

1341
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,751
So that was a really dark

1342
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,031
Bit of research

1343
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,799
That I did

1344
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,151
Stuff a lot

1345
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,711
And his narrative is wrong

1346
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,735
Stories

1347
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
Is

1348
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,575
That's always an unfortunate

1349
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,111
A place to come with Alex

1350
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,415
Where you have to be like

1351
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,183
But

1352
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,975
You're not looking at

1353
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:28,351
The picture you're not you're only looking at what you want to look at

1354
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,399
City on a hill

1355
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:33,983
I don't want to talk more about this narrative

1356
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,031
Ignore it

1357
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,055
Alex

1358
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,079
Fit Factory

1359
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,871
Was tainted was still being shipped until 2

1360
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,895
2000

1361
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
They stopped in July

1362
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
Nineteen85

1363
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:49,855
You have nothing to back that up just an assertion that he's making he's reading this article and he's saying that

1364
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,647
This is an article in the New York Times

1365
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,183
The came out in 1996

1366
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:58,559
So he has a problem with that is it came out 1996

1367
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,351
Doing it for 4 years after that

1368
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
I don't think so

1369
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,703
So you just make sure it up

1370
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,031
It's crazy he says that most cancer is viral

1371
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
True

1372
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,615
Rooted in

1373
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,151
I didn't know that

1374
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,455
HPV

1375
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
You can cause cervical

1376
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,343
That's the accepted

1377
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
As far as I can fly

1378
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,951
Almost all

1379
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:28,511
Is that the dirty I don't know why that would be dirty

1380
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,351
Since you don't know that wouldn't just be a regular

1381
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,911
Where's the dirty secret because that's why they wanted

1382
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
Give you the vaccines

1383
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:40,543
Viruses

1384
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
That would be a dirty

1385
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:49,503
I apologize for everyone that we

1386
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,575
Episode

1387
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,647
Hour-long interview

1388
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:56,927
With

1389
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:03,327
Pastor to the stars now

1390
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:07,679
Cornell

1391
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:13,055
Because of that says no this is good

1392
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:16,895
There's a real-life sort of roller coaster that his appearance goes on

1393
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,919
Good again he just

1394
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,223
Everybody

1395
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,551
W believe everything Alex Jones says

1396
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:27,135
Buttering up Alec

1397
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:29,951
Begin

1398
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:37,887
But I guess as a result of you knowing that for the past 35 years

1399
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,239
8 months ago

1400
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,943
And it has happened exactly like they said it

1401
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,223
He had perfect

1402
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,015
Predictions cuz they all come from the elite

1403
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,551
Now what he says

1404
01:04:55,807 --> 01:05:00,671
It's important to point this out if you read John Birch Society stop in

1405
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,439
Conspiracy

1406
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
The elite

1407
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,487
Insiders

1408
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,535
Are the terms

1409
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,071
And they use for the globe

1410
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:13,215
The globalist is kind of a later permutation of the term

1411
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,311
Incontact

1412
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:22,175
And they told him how everything is going to play out for the next year

1413
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:27,295
Why would this next clip is a little bit long

1414
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,087
But I beg of you.

1415
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,975
Listen to every word okay alright this is so funny because

1416
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:39,071
To me this clip explains why these Elites are still talking

1417
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,119
But also is

1418
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,399
Nowhere close

1419
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,727
Everything that I've ever been told by them

1420
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:52,127
I told it to the world and a few times I've been contacted and they've said that when you saying too much and you going to have fun

1421
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:57,759
If you don't take action

1422
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:02,111
This is the second time this has happened in 35 years

1423
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,439
This gentleman I have not seen for about 25 years

1424
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,719
I know who he is

1425
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:11,327
He's 82 years of age now but what you become apart of them you never get away from it

1426
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,215
Trouble

1427
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:22,079
Quit

1428
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,359
Your video

1429
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:27,199
When is viral is loose change

1430
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,063
With millions of views a day

1431
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,439
Sensation

1432
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,863
So they call you up

1433
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:52,799
What you said was not too Pleasant and I remember very well that

1434
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:59,199
Change over the currency and do away with the Federal Reserve

1435
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,759
Well shot

1436
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Real quick

1437
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:15,583
Just just pause for a second he has more to say but what you have here is Lindsey Williams

1438
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,607
Give me a call

1439
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:21,215
From the global you need to calm down

1440
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,239
So

1441
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,263
He does

1442
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:30,175
He goes along with what the globalist tell him to do if Alex Jones is like the truth-teller who's bald

1443
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:30,943
The goblets

1444
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,479
I don't know if he really wants to be

1445
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:40,415
You bet I'll take down my video and sorry about that

1446
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,439
R-Truth

1447
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,303
He's a fighter for truth

1448
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:52,703
Do you know is that discretion is the better part of valor true true

1449
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,727
Always another video.

1450
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:56,287
Lowercase t

1451
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
Redo it

1452
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:01,151
Agreed to shut down my website which you won't find it there any longer

1453
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:07,807
That's not the important thing I can do in helping you

1454
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,831
Program today

1455
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:14,719
Do everything

1456
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:26,495
Don't let that boy I asked him

1457
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,543
How's your family

1458
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,127
Your wife has been living since I saw you 25 years ago

1459
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,735
Any question

1460
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:40,575
And for 45 minutes time he talked with me on the phone now

1461
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,879
If you can imagine

1462
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:53,887
He was talking with me on the phone

1463
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:01,823
That was one crude oil 147.

1464
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:08,479
Workout

1465
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,503
$2 a barrel

1466
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:14,623
He said the price of gasoline at the gas pump is going to a dollar in $52 a gallon

1467
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:19,743
He said

1468
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:22,303
Bankrupting OPEC

1469
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:26,911
OK Google

1470
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,447
It opens

1471
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,983
Getting a phone call

1472
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,031
Hey you better shut up or we're going to kill you

1473
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,079
Because he's

1474
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:34,847
Polite

1475
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,039
Yeah

1476
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:49,439
Yeah let me Williams is a crafting the manipulator of globalist

1477
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:01,215
Royal in bankruptcy

1478
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
I could

1479
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:07,359
Do you like someone who was friendly with like an oil executive having a conversation with

1480
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:12,223
There's no way this price is going to hold this going to go down to 50 apparel

1481
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,015
But that's just a prediction of Market

1482
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:18,111
We're going to make it go do

1483
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:24,511
Kind of believe like if he wasn't just such an outright liar I could kind of believe that he had a conversation with someone and it went like

1484
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,071
Editorializing

1485
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:31,679
Econo-pak Williams creation of this

1486
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,447
It's like this

1487
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,751
He's going to fall out the bottom falling out

1488
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:39,359
Cuz that's an outrageously inflated price

1489
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,663
I believe that

1490
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:43,711
Horseshit

1491
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,015
That's that's like a like a

1492
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,551
But it's

1493
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,599
The telling of the telling of a tall tale

1494
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,623
Foreshore

1495
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,903
I called this guy

1496
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,183
He threatened me

1497
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,975
I had them by the family

1498
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,999
And then he was like

1499
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,303
Was down and then I found out everything

1500
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,863
Going to happen for the next year yeah I can tell you

1501
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,679
Isn't that like going to get you another phone call

1502
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:09,055
Review the Monera that you done bamboozled

1503
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,895
Maybe they aren't going to give you a chance next time Monday

1504
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,967
Part of your consideration

1505
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:20,319
If you're like oh JFK got killed for going up against them but I'm going to

1506
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,343
Information

1507
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,439
On the Alex Jones Show

1508
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:31,839
You just

1509
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,911
If it allows bond to formulate a plan

1510
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:38,239
Except bandhan say how's your family

1511
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,519
Their cups

1512
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,823
Real-time

1513
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,103
So

1514
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,407
Let's pretend

1515
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,711
From Russia with Love

1516
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,575
So let's pretend that he's not lying

1517
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
Which is very hard to do

1518
01:11:56,415 --> 01:12:01,279
Now let's see what his prediction is let's see what the globalist told him

1519
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:03,071
Disney's daughter prediction

1520
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:08,447
This is him saying what globalist told him they were going to do

1521
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,495
It's not random happens

1522
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,775
It's this is

1523
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,543
Is the plan

1524
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
So is this is wrong

1525
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,871
He's making s*** up

1526
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,663
Let's see if he's wrong

1527
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:24,575
Mark my words you are going to see 6 months 9 months maximum one year from now

1528
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:30,975
Complete collapse of the United States

1529
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,767
I was told by one of these

1530
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,655
No

1531
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,727
Actually already

1532
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,335
And we're in a recovery because of the

1533
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,615
Alex

1534
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
So

1535
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,991
But that makes sense actually for him to be against the things that would fix the problem

1536
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,039
Because that doesn't help him sell gold

1537
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,879
Flanigan's

1538
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,439
That's bad prediction

1539
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,255
Blenders wrong

1540
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
But didn't happen

1541
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,191
Or

1542
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:12,959
Which sounds like

1543
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,495
If I was the globalist

1544
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
What am I

1545
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
I don't

1546
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:31,391
I will call Lindsey Williams and I will be hilarious

1547
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,463
Disseminate through that that hole

1548
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,743
Network

1549
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,791
I want to scare Alex Jones

1550
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,815
Can't do it Direct

1551
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,607
Call the champ

1552
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,471
Text wife

1553
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:46,751
Alex

1554
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:00,319
Exactly right

1555
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:04,159
Bought back because the only thing to fear

1556
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
Okay

1557
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:13,887
Alex Going to the Country the only type of program

1558
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,423
Globalist only fear

1559
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
You waking p

1560
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,983
You are the best

1561
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,031
One more clip

1562
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
And it's the

1563
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,079
The perfect punchline

1564
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,103
To all of this

1565
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,127
See what

1566
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,151
Lindsey Williams

1567
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,175
Is really about

1568
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:31,295
You want to comment on stage biological weapons

1569
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:41,791
What album is entitled vaccinations and deals with the gift called in about again

1570
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,839
800

1571
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,119
321

1572
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,911
2900

1573
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:51,519
One of the DVDs on my big 8-pack concerns that

1574
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
Okay

1575
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:58,175
That reminds me of a Rapaport

1576
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:01,247
He sells like 10 DVD sets

1577
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,783
Text just too much over

1578
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:09,439
Just burning them

1579
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:12,767
That ain't

1580
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,047
The 8 DVD sets

1581
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
Propaganda

1582
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,631
The other thing about that is like because he's

1583
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:21,727
About the like I know about what the next year is going to bring there's an immediate

1584
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
He's really trying to push these

1585
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,031
DVD app

1586
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:28,127
Williams is on selling his hot b******* and all of it is

1587
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,431
Prelude to his you need to buy this

1588
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:33,759
Alex

1589
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:36,575
Flu / factor 8

1590
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,343
Meredith

1591
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,903
Weaving perfectly because

1592
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,671
Lindsey Williams

1593
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,719
One of those

1594
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,767
Selling it

1595
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,071
Beer through line

1596
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,375
Episode

1597
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,911
Boggles my mind

1598
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:55,007
Whenever they do wind up saying something that is true

1599
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,287
In the opposite

1600
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,103
Play the only thing these people

1601
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,127
Call Tiara is

1602
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
The populist

1603
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:01,919
Rising up

1604
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,687
Waking up

1605
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:05,759
They do when the list

1606
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:12,415
I really hate these were allowed to rise and take over

1607
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,695
Everybody's fine

1608
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:18,815
Not everybody would be most afraid of every time

1609
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,839
Liquid

1610
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,143
What are we see the Cubs doing their monitoring

1611
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:31,103
Right to the left and right

1612
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:37,503
That is the case is that the power structure doesn't real

1613
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,551
Really care about the ideas like stash

1614
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,599
Biggest fascist

1615
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,623
Love power

1616
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,183
So the whole game is really the same it's just

1617
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:48,767
How awful is it going to be

1618
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,535
Citizenry

1619
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:56,447
America at why the f***

1620
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:03,359
Jumping

1621
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,175
Why would my water be raised

1622
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,967
Juke

1623
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:16,159
If people wake up the way that they think that they're supposed to the way that Alex

1624
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,975
But they're supposed to all it does is lead to fascism

1625
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:25,631
I mean I mean cuz Alex's people rising up legitimately means militias coming into

1626
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:29,215
Into effect for Oklahoma City Bombing type event

1627
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:33,055
Which leads to a Crackdown and militarization of police

1628
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:36,895
The mentality to the world

1629
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,687
Actually precipitate

1630
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,967
His rhetoric is again

1631
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,783
Exactly

1632
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,319
He says the elites

1633
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,695
Because that's what he imagined

1634
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,511
Division is head of

1635
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
Leftist

1636
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,327
Communist

1637
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
Socialist

1638
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,447
No

1639
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,775
Authoritarian

1640
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,591
Is complete

1641
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:07,871
What he's helping

1642
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,639
Create

1643
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:15,039
And has helped create congratulations Alex your career career is come to fruition accidentally

1644
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,367
I think

1645
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,135
Maybe so,

1646
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,159
Lee Atwater

1647
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:27,071
How do I join this band of this episode a little bit shorter but I think they're one of the reasons is because I had to read a lot

1648
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,119
NIH documents

1649
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,167
And stuff like that and it was really emotional

1650
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:34,495
Exhausting so I cut it off here

1651
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
To get through

1652
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,287
But

1653
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,615
This March

1654
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
2009

1655
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,663
. for Alex's

1656
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,711
Of the worst stuff I've heard

1657
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,015
You know we're dealing with a lot of like

1658
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,295
Real weird stuff

1659
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,879
Text me that you're we are you still not talking about the

1660
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,903
Tea party at all

1661
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,183
He's really not

1662
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:53,951
He's

1663
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,975
Kind of dropped

1664
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,255
The Tenth Amendment narrative

1665
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,303
He was going on through almost all the February

1666
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,351
He hasn't brought that up in a couple hours

1667
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,119
Episode

1668
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,167
So it's interesting to see you like

1669
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,471
These establish that 10th Amendment

1670
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,775
To the point where now he can bring it back at any point

1671
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,079
And that what he's doing is he's laying the groundwork of

1672
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,127
Is avian flu

1673
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,687
They're trying to kill you in the vaccines narrative

1674
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,991
Embassy

1675
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:21,087
Whenever he wants down the road

1676
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,879
To see the structure of this sort of

1677
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,903
Propaganda

1678
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:24,927
And how it works

1679
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,535
I have no f****** idea what's

1680
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,327
Lincoln 2009

1681
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,119
I have no idea where he's going

1682
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,655
SMS

1683
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:39,519
So we'll find out where a lot of narratives in advance

1684
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,103
The host of singled out

1685
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,383
Coming out as gay

1686
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,199
Just in case

1687
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,503
You don't remember

1688
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,063
Night I forgot that Jenny McCarthy was ago

1689
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,599
Yes I remembered like

1690
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,647
Carmen Electra was but I forgot

1691
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,183
Oh yeah

1692
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,767
Anyway Jordan Springer episode but we have a website

1693
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:07,167
Dollartree.com

1694
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,191
You can go to Facebook

1695
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,495
It will group called

1696
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:12,799
Were there

1697
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:17,152
You leave a review overnight also or just a blanket apology if I if I

1698
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,432
If anyone feels like I gave

1699
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
Short shrift

1700
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,480
HIV

1701
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,016
I apologize

1702
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,624
The big picture but

1703
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,648
I think some of that is

1704
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,184
Because it doesn't fit

1705
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,976
All of it into

1706
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:35,840
The Narrative that were talking about but I want to make sure people understand if I

1707
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,400
If you felt that way I apologize

1708
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,216
Talk about good service

1709
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:41,984

1710
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,264
Bad a lot of

1711
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
Policies of the

1712
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,128
Republican

1713
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:51,712
That will never affect them in a negative way

1714
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,736
Probably not

1715
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:59,648
