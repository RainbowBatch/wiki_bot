1
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:10,752
Alex

2
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:15,360

00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:21,760
Drones unit is Dan Dan little robotic there from me until

4
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,528
Is this late

5
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,320
On a school night

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:30,720
Well dear Friday

7
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:37,120
Possibly getting furloughed from the government so that

8
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:43,520
Tomorrow that's a good point

9
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:49,920
Ignore other letters

10
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
People

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,760
A larger amount of people than we have any right to expect

12
00:00:54,016 --> 00:01:00,160
Right at 10:30 on Thursday

13
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,560
Alex Jones

14
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,912
Biscuits

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,008
Taste pretty good biscuits

16
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
I've never eaten a hibiscus flower

17
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
Local flower today I want to I don't know what I want to do

18
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
Start with something

19
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,160
I really did I really had something

20
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
F*** you know what you know what I

21
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
I got so distracted by the Hibiscus I have a terrible time that I

22
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,592
Successful stand-up comedy making in the tens of dollars

23
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,944
That was worth Kodak to

24
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
So Jordan today we're going to be going over the February 8th 2018 episode of the Alex

25
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
Thursday

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
Of this week

27
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
And I will say this

28
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Please give me a lot of fun

29
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Until it's not

30
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
Intros now I'm dreading what's going to happen

31
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
That's why we're having some

32
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
By the time the booze kicks in will be alright

33
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Where we're going here than Adipex

34
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
A lot of unpacking to bummer

35
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
What's a bummer when it's a lot of like trying to get to the bottom of what he's even trying to say

36
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
Out of context drop from

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Today's episode

38
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,336
Sounds believable

39
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
People you don't have to scream we're not lying. Generally when someone yells at you about what they're doing or not doing

40
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:05,344
It's best to take Ty with a very large Salt Lake

41
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,928
Look

42
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
I don't know about body language Stillwell

43
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,352
I've got questions about that so today there's a lot to go over and then the shows

44
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Dog sheds very stupid

45
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:23,520
Going to have to point out that like I just don't have Clips around them cuz

46
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
Boys gotta prioritize

47
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,992
Full day quite frankly Alex with a shout-out to

48
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
We got to the bottom of some stuff about Alex Jones is

49
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,208
New website fortified supply.com

50
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:47,584
And actually we should put a pin in that just cuz it's going to come up on the show

51
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
But I probably put in a sick

52
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
16 hour day

53
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,032
Ammo

54
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
14 right now so let's

55
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
I've been working on a ton of Alex Jones between that that right up the endgame documentary

56
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
That will be putting out in the very near future this episode has or worth just

57
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
Mentioning in passing

58
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
But at the same time like

59
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,959
Who gives a s*** I just been Googling

60
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,823
How to make a citizen's arrest all day don't think I qualify for

61
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
Standing to sue in either it's like I don't know I don't even know the legal process of what to do

62
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
Very confused

63
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,671
That sounds like standing so here's the first

64
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
Nice transition Donald

65
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:52,607
Drop if your name come up

66
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:58,495
With this idea that he's going to he's going to have this military parade, and I just hilarious

67
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,639
With it no I love it but here's one of the problems that I didn't foresee

68
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
Alex Jones you got the idea

69
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
Some might say

70
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,551
North Korean regime

71
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:17,951
Just a little spoiler alert the last time America had a full-on military parade 1943

72
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Kings of military

73
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:30,495
Pageantry on like Veterans Day holidays

74
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,335
But the last one was a 1991 we pulled out of the Gulf War

75
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,895
To give some context it's been

76
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
What

77
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
27 years also

78
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,319
That's not the time to

79
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,903
I'm sorry where did he go

80
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,767
We're going to pretend this was a w mission accomplished

81
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679
But

82
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,263
Interrupt

83
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,711
Was going to call for a military parade

84
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
I really hate Trump

85
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,831
Because last year pushed

86
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
Did you get a letter to Trump

87
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
He's gone

88
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
Sheriff Joe

89
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,383
Arpaio you're nasty

90
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
They are you hate that kind of access

91
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
That

92
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
If I had a perfect world

93
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,055
We would remove Joe Arpaio Street tomorrow

94
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
He would just have no feet

95
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
Yeah

96
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,479
There be no wheelchairs anywhere near him no prosthetics

97
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
He was just a man

98
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
With no fee

99
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,599
Just want to Wally

100
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,743
I feel I feel like a nice down here. Probably be generous

101
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
Results for amps for a long time until

102
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,239
Sure is a good way to

103
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:44,639
To get information out of people because it's been proven that it's a terrible idea

104
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:51,039
The information you know

105
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,415
So I like the idea of the drudges for a fact

106
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
Responsible for this military parade I don't

107
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
I don't care to unpack that I don't care if it's true cuz

108
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
If it is

109
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
That's f***** up images.

110
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:09,727
Why does drudge look bad on

111
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,799
Realistically the only like

112
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,127
I don't know I ate stuff to WarGames things when people are kind of

113
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
Crazy but like

114
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
I don't really see

115
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,831
A reasonable motive for having them like a huge field

116
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:30,719
Dial French

117
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
You know what

118
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:38,655
You win some you lose some

119
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:44,287
Nationalism

120
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:50,687
Want to talk about how like Russia has Victory Day

121
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:57,087
Is there celebrate

122
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,695
USSR

123
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
Probably important

124
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
The end of WWII

125
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,351
Heavy f****** lost 11 million yeah it's insane

126
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,495
Compared to other countries all other casualties combined I think is the statistic

127
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:20,895
Russians is probably accurate the all others combined

128
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,455
Counting Japan

129
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
China in which case

130
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,599
Anyways militaristic Victory Day Parade

131
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,951
Totally on in line with like yeah that's the piece of history that makes sense

132
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,047
To celebrate in that way

133
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,911
But I think one of the chief complaints the people are making when I looked into it and read some articles

134
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Are the people are complaining about

135
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
Putin's Victory Day celebration

136
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
The last few years

137
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
It's been getting very Soviet

138
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Really

139
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
A lot of Soviet imagery is creeping back up in terms of like Soviet

140
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183
Uniforms being worn by some of the soldiers a little bit of Stalin revisionism

141
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:11,583
That's not good stuff going on in Pittsburgh

142
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,143
Is there a solid history joke

143
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,215
And f*** you I'm not saying it's not I just

144
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Went over my head

145
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,591
Whenever Sally would kill one of his buddies

146
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:27,455
If you wasn't if this buddy was in a picture with him removed from the picture

147
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:32,575
It's like one of those creeps who takes out the eyes

148
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
Do you know what else is about

149
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
Removing Joe Arpaio

150
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
Noel one day

151
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
But for now it's about making

152
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
Fun of Alex Jones

153
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
Brazen attempt

154
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Make money

155
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,727
And so at 8

156
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
But I'm going to

157
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775

186
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:41,855
Like that's like one of those no no no we haven't we have historical evidence

187
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,695
Male Vitality pairs with Asperger's

188
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:52,095
You can actually have it with Suites

189
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,495
Do you like the better about it

190
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Okay

191
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
So in between

192
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,455
Race-baiting

193
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
They're also like guys

194
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
You want Infowars

195
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
To teach you how to

196
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
That's what you get, Sutra

197
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,415
It's just

198
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
It's just to put Recon a Kundalini kind of stuff

199
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
The how of it it's

200
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,215
The Y

201
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,567
Dutchbros like you halfway expect the commercial to fill

202
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
And with like

203
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
Hey

204
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
You need to lay some pipe

205
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,575
Plumber like it like that. Kind of birth

206
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
Commercial for like

207
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
Fly

208
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,023
I don't know Funky Cold Medina

209
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,351
What's what's

210
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:01,983
I don't know good

211
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
We should call Tone Loke

212
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,359
He's a great couple episodes of Newsradio

213
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:18,111
I don't want to talk very clearly want a regular Cold Medina

214
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
I just want to remember

215
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Surf Ninjas

216
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
The greatest movie of all time

217
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
I'm trying to think of another star can't

218
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
Leslie Nielsen

219
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:35,519
He wasn't one of the principles of the main villain man

220
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919
Four on the call sheet and then I'm probably that kid

221
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,223
Subway Surf Ninja

222
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Confused

223
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
Alex has a distinct

224
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
Full complaint you want

225
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
To make about the last

226
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
College campuses across

227
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
This country

228
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:03,679
First started

229
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
Alright

230
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Are you cool

231
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,359
Yeah show me start this over

232
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:16,991
I'm going to take that as an ambassador for the left

233
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
Yes

234
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:23,903
We're proud to have banned the end I don't think you guys still somehow

235
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
And we don't stop you

236
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
Non-band anyting

237
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
No anyway let's start this from the top

238
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
College campuses

239
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
This country

240
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
It's crazy how days are really quick

241
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,711
Bears like mentioning

242
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,367
Like first of all they didn't say what the college a lot of people through that around

243
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,719
Is there hey now but like at the same time

244
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
He's saying it

245
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,303
I understand that comes from this weird libertarian

246
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
In place

247
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
Of Lights marriage

248
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,495
Specific rights activist and you're not racist you just like I don't want to restrict

249
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
That sort of stuff

250
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:18,431
But it's very weird it's obviously race it's it's very weird for someone to be like

251
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
I am against

252
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
Efforts to get white people

253
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
To not say the n-word so much

254
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
It's very weird furthermore

255
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
You lead up to that one

256
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
If you're coming out the gate with the left band the n-word as a bad thing

257
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,143
Where to go get your already wrong in a month

258
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,471
Quite frankly like Michael Richards

259
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Can't have a career

260
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
He's still a f****** millionaire

261
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,479
Work was he doing after Seinfeld

262
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,807
Wellington weather

263
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:05,023
F****** the same thing anyway I'm going to start it from the top and honor of Alex Jones

264
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
It is the left

265
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
College campus

266
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
This country

267
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:21,919
That was fast

268
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,967
All God's Children

269
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
Black white yellow

270
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
Red and brown

271
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
Where's the trans where's the

272
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:41,887
So I looked into this and actually what it's about is a college

273
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,983
College college a a student group that got together

274
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,591
And there's a mural a painted mural off wall of the building

275
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,687
Yeah that has a Martin Luther King speech on it and they were arguing they should

276
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
Replace it with the new mural

277
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,647
To say f*** you in the Martin Luther King right to reflect the fact that the civil rights movement has come along way races still in

278
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
Incredibly important at a big piece of it

279
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
What is expanded

280
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,511
From there into all sorts

281
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
Moline group

282
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
And disenfranchised population

283
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,655
Answer it was more like an update more than anything else

284
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:19,519
And if you look into it this colleges had that this mural of Martin Luther King sense like

285
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Something like that

286
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:28,223
But before that it had another mural was Woodrow Wilson

287
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
So it was it was good but liberal band

288
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,743
Who founded the university and it was something

289
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:46,143
Good and then it's time when we don't know if

290
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:52,031
I'm at 9 now they like

291
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:58,687
Having a conversation about Martin Luther King

292
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
Conservatism

293
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
And

294
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,063
Oftentimes probably the least defensive like

295
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
Maybe like

296
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
Maybe the most justifiable

297
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Fear of change

298
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:15,583
Like there's a lot of parking back to

299
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,655
A bygone time of picket fences

300
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,031
Kids it's a good idea

301
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:29,663
Because if you are if you were just like Innovation for Innovation let's change everything then

302
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,479
You you may wind up throwing away what should

303
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,271
He built upon instead of

304
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
What should be

305
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,087
Alex

306
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,903
The n-word should not be built upon

307
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
It should be back

308
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
Place to start an argument

309
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
Right I'm getting I'm getting from the chatroom the trans isn't the race and yes of course not

310
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,263
That for now

311
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
Because

312
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
It's going to get way worse

313
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,895
Also

314
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
Through in terms of what Alex is saying

315
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
Is because

316
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
The trans Community is a part of the modern civil rights

317
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Picture

318
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,111
As opposed to

319
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
I guess

320
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,207
Still was in the sixties but it wasn't nearly as big of a

321
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,095
Like it didn't even at even at the time

322
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Most

323
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,471
You know if you want to go anywhere though

324
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,751
January

325
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,103
Trans people gay people all of that s***

326
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,663
Punishable by you know whatever it is you on

327
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Do you know

328
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:40,063
There was that there was no except me the Civil Rights Movement should expand

329
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
Everybody who's not straight

330
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,927
Because that's everybody who's being oppressed

331
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
And

332
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,255
Everybody's not straighten Bridge

333
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
And then we prioritize

334
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
Black women the most

335
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
Okay I don't know why I don't know why it is

336
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,895
Civil rights

337
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,455
Jordan

338
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,271
Prioritize your voice

339
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
It makes sense in the context of what Alex

340
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Just he's

341
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,816
Next clip

342
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
YouTube

343
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,752
Throughout the first like 15 minutes or so the show

344
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
He's rambling about

345
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
Gentleman Square

346
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:39,456
Cuz there's a military parade coming up and there's a liberal professor

347
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
Went out inside

348
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,784
He's going to stand in front of the tank

349
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,648
It's a little green Sandy Maybe

350
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:53,024
But it's pissed off about this he's developed a theory where in

351
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Liberals

352
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,144
Did the Chinese in the tank

353
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
That makes

354
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
And the ball.

355
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Are the guy

356
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
Sure

357
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
It makes sense of you

358
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,432
Just let him explain

359
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Coffee on my head

360
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,120
Violence is good against the right-wing

361
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,960
That's referencing was a troll

362
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Who got on CNN

363
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
Communist Chinese

364
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,528
Free speech

365
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,856
Conservative Trump supporters

366
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,720
So I want to say one thing really quick cuz this is part of the

367
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,304
Things Clips couldn't quite make it and turn on timing

368
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,096
E-Z-Go

369
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,752
Can write like five times on the Shelf

370
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:12,128
Borders I want like it's totally fine to fart into a mic

371
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:18,528
Wait what there's a video of this guy maybe guy in his 50s

372
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,368
O'Reilly in there talking

373
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,440
Millie Weaver

374
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,536
I think it's my life

375
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
It's as funny

376
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:36,448
Little girl flipping off Owen Shroyer

377
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,896
That's something that you shouldn't even mention if you're out

378
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,968
Excuses let that one go because that's objectively

379
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,528
It's adolescent as hell but man

380
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
So funny

381
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,648
Himself walked in here and farted into one of our mics

382
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:02,048
All would be forgotten for the 30 seconds that we would laugh and we would hate on him again

383
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:08,448
F****** hilarious version of Infowars

384
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:14,848
Rally in the alley

385
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:19,968
You would call it a classic if you're if you're in Thibodaux

386
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,320
Alright

387
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
Anyway

388
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,072
AK-47s in Austin and won't let me

389
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
A woman

390
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,216
Who was killed by illegal aliens

391
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
We go to a vigil

392
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:48,384
Children and pushing

393
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,784
Look on calls for killing cops and cops

394
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,880
Old is weatherman Style

395
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,976
On CNN MSNBC

396
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,280
Earlier

397
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Fascist

398
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:15,776
So again I think that liberal Professor that he played I have no idea who this guy is introverted

399
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
Before

400
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
Let's really think that

401
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,968
I think that he might be a little early

402
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,528
But I think he's a little more dramatic than

403
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
Maybe is

404
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,344
Required

405
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
I mean that is one of the most

406
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,256
Line-by-line examples of I know you are but what am I

407
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,560
What am I I think we've heard in a long time

408
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
Think of it

409
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,424
Just go just go f******

410
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:48,800
Word-for-word what it is he is saying don't let that the left has done

411
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,592
And then just go to Charlottesville

412
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:57,248
Well there's that that is exactly what the Nazis.

413
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:02,368
Supremacist have been interviewed on CNN or New York Times

414
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,952
Or the how many times are we going to listen to what

415
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
White supremacist have to

416
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,304
To say and then it's the same and then he's like

417
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,144
Will they let leftist on here saying that white supremacy is bad

418
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
Please

419
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,264
There's an even greater irony that you're not quite capturing

420
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,664
That is anytime the truck people on the Patriots want to get together antiques

421
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,736
And the only example he comes up with

422
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:35,136
Explicitly white supremacist rally like I watched a video of Owen Shroyer trying to get into that right

423
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,952
Rally and the rally is not

424
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:44,352
It's not a vigil for Katie steinle the girl who was accidentally killed by a stray bullet that ricocheted off the

425
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
The grounded misfired

426
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,704
Yes undocumented immigrants

427
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,752
Yes all those facts are

428
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,312
Actually have Eric's

429
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:57,920
Absolutely but the rally wasn't a vigil for her as much as it was

430
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
Collection and sounding off

431
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,576
A gathering of people who are really mad about immigrant

432
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,392
And it was it was an anti-immigration

433
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
Anti

434
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
Who knows

435
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,280
Bruno's the depths of what the

436
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
What was really

437
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
In the heart of it

438
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,728
But that's what it was threatened with anymore

439
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,056
Anybody is threatening everybody at open carry rally

440
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,848
It's the exact same thing

441
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
You can't have it both ways but

442
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
Again

443
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
F****** stupid pointless Trust

444
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
To bring up the Apocrypha

445
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,992
So

446
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,576
Now this is fun

447
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,720
Alex Jones gets into symbology a little bit

448
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,792
So enjoy this very weird

449
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
Very

450
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
Pseudo-spiritual

451
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,656
What kind of

452
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Okay

453
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,800
Pentacle

454
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
Powerful powerful symbol

455
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,064
Is about the upside down and deciphering the energy

456
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,928
Dark energy

457
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
Destruction

458
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,280
People

459
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,096
Go in

460
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,544
Warming her hands to the fire of evil

461
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,440
Sponsored

462
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,560
Sponsor of Hazard sub company that helps fund the operation

463
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Shopping cart

464
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:04,896
So it's made a very crucial error in that last bit there and that's what launched my investigation

465
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,944
Are not in Earnest today

466
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:15,392
Supply exactly is the first time I've heard him since he unveiled the 425 Supply on

467
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,696
Summerfest 2017

468
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
That's what got my brain

469
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,536
Thinking again

470
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Is very damn

471
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
And that is

472
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
Giggling roundabout

473
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,216
A problem for him

474
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,896
I recommend all of you listening

475
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,968
Go to knowledge flight.com I have an extensive write-up

476
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,320
Patience screenshots of Alex Jones

477
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,928
And legal documents he is operating

478
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
What I believe and I

479
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,304
Queer although I don't want to say this

480
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
You know as an accusation because

481
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,448
If I'm wrong in some weird technicality

482
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,776
For slander or something like that very much appears that

483
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
He is operating

484
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,360
Fortified Supply as an illegal

485
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,664
Elia for his company

486
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,736
Class A misdemeanor in Texas

487
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,296
If he is doing this as a

488
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,928
You could face up to a year in prison

489
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
At least that's

490
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,256
Redwood be awesome

491
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,168
But he said on the show like him admitting

492
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,960
This Is Us

493
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:38,336
That is our website

494
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,896
Getting alcapone on tax evasion charge

495
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,528
For all the crimes that we have

496
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,952
Seen him commit borderline Christ versus like ride

497
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,048
I mean if I were just like

498
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,328
Talkin about

499
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,120
Any other human

500
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,264
I still think that about Alex

501
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
I also hate them

502
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,824
So

503
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,968
Prosecute to the full extent of the law I guess this kind of selective and philosophically problematic for us

504
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,272
We do run a business

505
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,672
Even more

506
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
1

507
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
Exactly

508
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,680
How much power do the does the left get from

509
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
The Pentagon

510
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,752
Spell Jewel

511
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,544
5 joule

512
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,384
It's a national forest

513
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:49,248
You think of what a reasonable number would be

514
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,064
Salata Jewels jewels

515
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,184
Do you think there any scientist to like try to start a cover band called run the jewels but Jou

516
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
Yeah

517
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
Probably they did

518
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,584
No

519
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,888
That's what that's a hot Halloween costume

520
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
Alright

521
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:11,776
No

522
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Alright

523
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:18,688
Clearly what he just said was that the reason that he set up the Fortified Supply situation

524
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,992
Probably the reason that we're in

525
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,296
Nation where we are with him

526
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
Lack of

527
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
Registration in the light

528
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,928
Is to get around Google

529
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
Block

530
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,256
Google is not allowing his

531
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,792
Advertisements because

532
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,560
Of course

533
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:39,680
Well I don't know but I don't don't have it on with the Infowars

534
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
You can put it up

535
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:45,056
Through Google and it won't give them the alerts I don't know if

536
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
The

537
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:53,248
It's a little bit complicated in terms of how you file a doing business as a Leah

538
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,088
Yeah and that sort of thing is having this conversation right now

539
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:01,440
Will be a little bit difficult for me to explain all of that

540
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,000
And then six hours from now will get into end-game

541
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
If you have a business

542
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:10,144
Is like a LLC or any other sort of business a corporation or anything like that

543
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,448
You file your corporation

544
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,240
Like if I started the corporation OB

545
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,800
Knowledge fight LLC or whatever

546
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,128
Now if I wanted to start another show called

547
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
Freezing point

548
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:26,016
Good's whatever

549
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
I don't know

550
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,368
Art pencil drawing

551
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
Drawings

552
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,328
Cell

553
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,120
Is freezing point good

554
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,192
Or whatever with the company that I've started

555
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,592
Without creating a business as name with the secretary of state

556
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,408
The clerk of the counties that you're doing business in

557
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,688
And wherever you have an office

558
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,712
So

559
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
I would need

560
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
To do that

561
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,320
Exactly the same

562
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
Now

563
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,232
In doing that in filing that paperwork I don't know if it would trigger Google or anything like that

564
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,560
That is a way to get around the Google block

565
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,704
So that part of it is not explained by the explanation he gives there

566
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:21,824
But that is the case

567
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,128
I'm saying that that's what he's implying

568
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:31,040
Well but at the last time he talked about it in December you imply that the reason was to get around map agreements minimum advertised

569
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
Prices

570
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:37,696
Right by sign with his suppliers so his story is even change

571
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,536
In terms of what his motivation for doing this

572
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,632
So I don't know it's it's one of the most suspicious things

573
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,680
I think I've encountered in terms of

574
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,496
He's done a lot of special yeah

575
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:55,616
But this one's really big and I I really hope you will pay attention and get the word out about this but

576
00:34:55,872 --> 00:35:01,504
She may have a money laundering website

577
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,576
Well that's where it comes into like

578
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,392
Where in where in the round rampant speculation

579
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:13,280
At that point it does have the potential to

580
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:20,192
That's one of the big reasons why it said off pretty serious red flags when I started looking in

581
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:24,800
Into the nature of it and that is the potential for

582
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,872
Taking in dark money under the table

583
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,176
The money-laundering capability

584
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
Or just

585
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Hiding acid

586
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,808
That sort of thing could be done very easily with

587
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:38,368
And a non-existent business

588
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
But you're running that has no

589
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,976
Tax identification that has no

590
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,512
To your normal LLC

591
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:50,656
And to me that's either sloppiness or a really desperate move and I don't know which it is and it might be a third option

592
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,448
I don't know I mean

593
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
How many

594
00:35:53,984 --> 00:36:00,128
Someone has to find out though how much money has been run through your your boys like

595
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,504
It's not necessarily A desperation move it could be just

596
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
A mass

597
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:10,368
Revenue stream label it as a desperation thing is

598
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,952
Because the history that Alex Jones has of being on the up-and-up with

599
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,720
Episode of paperwork

600
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,560
Because you do over and over again

601
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
Like

602
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,888
The various business names that are used

603
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,936
Prison Planet Infowars

604
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,544
The Jones report even filed 14 that's not even really a thing

605
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Anymore there's a while back

606
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,920
Do you have all that history of knowing what to do and doing the right thing

607
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,712
And I think now it might just be

608
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,808
I don't know

609
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,624
Either laziness

610
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
And or just

611
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:50,048
Lack of oversight sloppiness could be desperation

612
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
You know whatever it is he try to avoid

613
00:36:53,888 --> 00:37:00,032
And he's he's got somebody who is going to really throw a lot of money torrent

614
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:05,408
The avarice I'm not entirely sure the capabilities of it but it's possible that

615
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
Through this sort of thing

616
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
We could hide money from

617
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,320
He does owe a massive amount in Southold

618
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:18,720
Sports Authority thing where you trying to create a workaround I don't know

619
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
Maybe his wife has standing

620
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
She text wife

621
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:27,424
She actually does to some extent I don't zactly I don't think with this but

622
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
With some of her other business

623
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,520
I believe she is listed as a

624
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,544
But you might have

625
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
Like

626
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:40,480
She might have liked relinquish that in the divorce

627
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:45,600
Situation all over again

628
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
When I was looking over these records

629
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,280
Like the searching for various

630
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,840
No Alex Jones related record

631
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:00,448
County Clerk's Office

632
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Tons of stuff

633
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
Can find like I found his marriage license

634
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
From his first marriage

635
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
Text to Kelly

636
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,616
They found that marriage license

637
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Public

638
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,456
Alright from 2,000

639
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
He's married again

640
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,296
I couldn't no married

641
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,464
I don't know if that means if they're not legally married or what or maybe they got a license somewhere else I don't live

642
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
I think you still have to have the license

643
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,352
And where you have it

644
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,192
I don't know how it works but I don't even believe

645
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,032
Common law common law marriage

646
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:42,432
Anyway it is next class says that you're okay with marriage

647
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:48,832
On this but just because it's something I've been really looking into bit and extensively today

648
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,672
But the bottom line is something

649
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,720
Something is up with Alex's businesses

650
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
Someone

651
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Smarter

652
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,048
With more access than us

653
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
Really needs to look at that

654
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
Borax

655
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
Exactly

656
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
More

657
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,288
Call only sponsored post

658
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,336
Chances are he was married in international

659
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,384
National Waters

660
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,480
Admiralty admiralty comeback to admiralty law

661
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,784
Alex

662
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
Of this show

663
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
He was pretty

664
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,904
Staunchly in favor of the military parade

665
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,232
You know why

666
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,888
Because at this point in the day Grandpa would come out and say that hey

667
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:39,008
Well I will support the military parade

668
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,056
If Trump brings everyone home from Afghan

669
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,848
Beyond the word

670
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
Nice

671
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:48,736
So Alex now is a little bit that's a little bit like the liberal professor

672
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
With

673
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
Like

674
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
Your little grandson

675
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:58,976
Grandpa's principles supposedly is for

676
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,768
And so Alex I think is real

677
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:07,168
Much like the Ghost of Christmas Past is reminded of the principles he once had

678
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,192
Bootlicker for

679
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
Aspiring authoritarian

680
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
Music

681
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:14,592
Should I got to get wishy-washy about this

682
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,296
You Force bases around the world

683
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,112
Cut the

684
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,192
But

685
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,640
Also known

686
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:52,736
What is a military parade

687
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,944
Did you hear what the name of his new product is

688
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,040
Icarus

689
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:32,416
Creator of the labyrinth

690
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:38,816
Play The Minotaur

691
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
Dungeons &

692
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,872
Extend past just dungeon dragon

693
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:58,527
I've heard that it's not appealing for a pill

694
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,087
Let me give the image in my mind of Icarus

695
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,903
That's the thing that comes chiefly to mind and of course

696
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,695
Icarus son of Daedalus

697
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
The Dallas created waxwing

698
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,303
In order to to fly

699
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,911
Is Alex's next product

700
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
Waxwing

701
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,335
Valentine's Day

702
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,919
Only sponsored post is killing

703
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,991
Tonight

704
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,599
The point is is a terribly named product

705
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,671
Very terrible very terrible

706
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:43,327
So I want to make a run down of before we get into the rest of the episode of some of the

707
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,119
Narratives that we will be missing

708
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
Just because

709
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,727
Nice little what got cut segment

710
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
Yeah Borderlands

711
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,335
Discuss the Victory Day celebration that stuff

712
00:42:54,591 --> 00:43:00,735
Joseph McCarthy was right we aren't that on this episode and it's based on Russian

713
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
Files

714
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783
That have come out

715
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:08,671
Russian files McCarthy

716
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:14,559
Alex gets really defensive because the Dow Jones went down another thousand points today

717
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
Sure

718
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,215
Sure

719
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,007
That's fun

720
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:27,103
He gets really mad about Elon Musk shooting that car into space

721
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
I mean

722
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,735
That's a legitimate grievance all because at the Staunton bulshit what have you

723
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:39,135
Gil Scott-Heron whatever whatever elonmusk did that

724
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:48,863
Elon Musk sent a f****** car into space

725
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,167
Butt acne

726
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,215
Not as good but Alex

727
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,263
His take on it is like

728
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:00,127
This is a ritual

729
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,943
This is evocative of that movie

730
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:09,599
He and I robbed you created like a little Special Report where they at

731
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,671
They point out that there's references to heavy metal

732
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,463
And as they're discussing that

733
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
The car

734
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
I turned

735
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,815
Beyond the Blackboard

736
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,887
Which is a reference to

737
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:28,287
Alex

738
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,567
Reference

739
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,103
Aren't those really dumb

740
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
That's that's

741
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:38,271
You stupid just one thing to say on the parade and I wrote about this today but

742
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,319
I am off

743
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,879
Thanks for this parade

744
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:47,231
And I don't want anywhere you say everything I would I just want everybody to watch this parade

745
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
Because

746
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,303
In America we will all be like

747
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
This is

748
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
Dentist

749
00:44:54,399 --> 00:45:00,543
Sad at the lake parade that they had with all the empty bleachers

750
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:06,943
Imagine imagine being really terrible

751
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:13,599
Pomp and Circumstance

752
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,927
Some of the people who are just like I don't support him but sport threat

753
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:21,023
You get you get those little girl singers in the American flag

754
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:25,631
Stuff I got screwed

755
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:30,495
And so let's leave

756
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,799
This one guy

757
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
Matter

758
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,127
I looked into it it's nonsense

759
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,943
This guy testified

760
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,783
Not under oath and a without a transcript

761
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,111
Great that Hillary in the uranium

762
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:52,511
Sirius Fox News The Daily Caller and all that s***

763
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:56,351
Rose's doing s*** all up in the

764
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,727
Adam Schiff

765
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,311
The other that is Senator was they there

766
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,871
Said they talked to the Department of Justice

767
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,711
Like this guy is not credible

768
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:17,599
So it's man from the Iraq War

769
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:24,255
Also not trustworthy

770
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:30,655
Or the serial killer Kuklinski

771
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,847
Is a reserving judgment on this guy who gave testimony

772
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
The granted it's not under oath has no penalty for lying

773
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:49,599
Doesn't really matter who said it but 99% of success is just showing up a hell yeah

774
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,367
Hell yeah

775
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:56,511
It looks like a bud best donkey

776
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:03,167
He's just that put into the chat room I'm getting paid right now looks like the furlough is happening

777
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:08,287
Cheers cheers to that

778
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
What are we talkin about

779
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:13,919
I don't know that's what I'm taking it anyway

780
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,199
Because

781
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,479
This is fun

782
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,575
Alex Jones does not know anything about Bitcoin

783
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
True

784
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,695
Consistently been like I don't want to

785
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,255
Because

786
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,047
He thinks

787
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,095
The secretive

788
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,631
People behind

789
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,655
Globalist

790
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:41,055
Is there something like that get a lot of weird ideas about what's going on with Bitcoin cuz he's never really looked into a door

791
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
Standard process of mining

792
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
4 Bitcoin or anything like that

793
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,223
I would say you should just leave it alone

794
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,295
I think you shouldn't touch it

795
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:56,159
On the show he had a Bitcoin expert on the show who was

796
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,999
Expert pizzagate weirdo Named Dave Seaman

797
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:06,399
Expert rebranded himself

798
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,799
February 4th

799
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,383
But be that as it may guy named Rodger

800
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
On

801
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
Where does East

802
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,735
Something about Rodger ver

803
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:24,575
Is David Dum is very dumb ber

804
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,391
He comes on to talk about Bitcoin

805
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,951
And his own saying it's called Bitcoin cash

806
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,743
Dammit

807
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,535
Right

808
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,559
Version of this dump

809
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,375
Because you got to make your own thing ma'am

810
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,167
I don't respect that

811
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,447
But entrepreneurs

812
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:46,079
One thing that you should know about this dude is that he renounced his citizenship

813
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,407
While back and now lives in Japan

814
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:53,759
That's one thing you need to know

815
00:48:54,015 --> 00:49:00,159
And that's why the Skype doesn't work until I can play almost any of this interview

816
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,719
Beginning back

817
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,791
Go to break fix up some Skype issues

818
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,071
And they come back with some

819
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
Calls

820
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
And these calls

821
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
Are not good

822
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
And Alex

823
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
Because he knows nothing about Bitcoin

824
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,055
Handle any of it

825
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:21,407
This is very complex

826
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:25,247
Systems

827
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,295
Flying

828
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,135
Summit blind

829
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,975
California you're only here worldwide with Rodger ver

830
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,279
Alex big fan

831
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,583
Just want to say hi

832
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
And it's a scam

833
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,471
Chinese damn coin that this guy Rodger has been arrest

834
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,519
Supersonic aircraft

835
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,591
He's trying to push his own agenda and actually take down

836
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Bitcoin

837
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,903
He was arrested for stealing it closer

838
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,927
I'm his

839
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,951
Bkash

840
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
Just a fork of the original

841
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,047
Bitcoin

842
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:50,751
I hope to say one day in reference to misal explosives on the internet

843
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:57,151
That is operative

844
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:06,111
You did 11 months in prison for 11 months

845
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:10,719
Zout is illegal fireworks

846
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:17,119
I have a little bit of a little

847
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:23,263
Play songs like cartoon bombs out of it

848
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,823
And a big skull on the front

849
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,663
Office quit but it goes on much longer of him

850
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:36,063
Just being like everybody else

851
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,159
Marion and I was against the gun lobby

852
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:47,839
The police

853
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:51,679
It's all victim s**** all

854
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,727
But Alex

855
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:57,311
I love that hit this Bitcoin expert is like

856
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
Yes

857
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,151
I did sell explosives on the internet

858
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:06,527
You can trust me with this fake currency that I've invented right and the other part that I love is Alex's

859
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,743
I do not know that Google my guest

860
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:21,119
So how does it go from there

861
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,703
It should be basic knowledge of this guy before

862
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,727
If you do

863
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,799
Any reading of your gas price

864
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,223
What is it the third sentence on his did 11 months in the Pokey foretelling bombs

865
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,623
So Alex doesn't know what to do at this point cuz he don't know anything about a Bitcoin

866
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,183
This caller is made a point that

867
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,487
You know Rodger isn't really

868
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:51,839
Disputing that no one is prepared to deal with Alex's take on it

869
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,655
Rodriguez

870
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,703
I don't know what to believe

871
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,727
Okay

872
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,007
No he just said it

873
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,055
What do you mean

874
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
Both of them agreed

875
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:09,503
And I think that's more in reference to the like you being a scammer operation being

876
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:15,135
Damn right I don't know I don't know what to do

877
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
You both sound White

878
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791
Alex Box up and takes us.

879
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
Call

880
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,095
Oh no

881
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,399
Greenwood Indiana

882
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
First I want to say it

883
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Well-known

884
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,847
Community that Rodger ver is a stammer and this is his way to scam

885
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,807
And I do have a question for him

886
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,111
Everyone that Craig Wright is

887
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,159
Nakamoto the creator of Bitcoin

888
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,951
But it can be easily proven

889
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:01,983
I've cut out his Rodger versus response to this cuz it's like cuz I've never said that in public

890
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,615
Got nothing to say

891
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,639
More interesting

892
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,455
What Alex out of his death

893
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,991
He has no idea what

894
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,783
Do this degenesis block mean

895
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:21,183
He has no idea what a Bitcoin even is

896
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,815
Hello Rodger ver is

897
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
This response is really funny

898
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,655
Which means

899
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,959
Proving that he minded the first Bitcoin

900
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,055
You cannot do that but Rodger continue telling people

901
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,359
That this guy is Satoshi Nakamoto

902
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,663
Wichita

903
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,455
Cybertron

904
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,039
Will you release the core

905
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,583
Are you Megatron

906
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
So

00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,847
You said words

912

How about you guys both seem to understand what you're talkin about it most of the shower I'm not in for it so

00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:23,647
Megatron Megatron

914
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,927
Rodger ver

915
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,231
I am not Megatron

916
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
Beautiful

917
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,911
There's a certain Joy coming from

918
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
That's great that we could have this time

919
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
Goddamn

920
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,847
Are you about to take the

921
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:46,687
I'm not it's just what we're about to get into is

922
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,455
Bike

00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,951
Tire leak

928
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:01,791
Clear like what's going on is in his head but it's something that's unhealthy

929
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,839
I'm not entirely sure what it is

930
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,375
We'll discuss it

931
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:10,751
But one more thing that I want to bring up is that Alex Jones is very dismissive

932
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
Charges

933
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,103
Ex-Wives of

934
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:20,479
Oh no I don't know I don't know I didn't want to hear him talk about this

935
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,295
Record

936
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:27,135
Just wanted everyone to know that I'm the show Alex Assange

937
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:37,631
Oh well you do not know I get you

938
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:43,007
The Alex would say that

939
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
Cambia tu

940
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
I get what you're saying

941
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,359
I just misunderstood you for a second

942
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,175
Business plan

943
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,967
Is incredibly bizarre

944
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,015
Totally bizarre

945
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,551
But still

946
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,087
Not terrible

947
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,903
The last

948
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,951
16 minutes of this episode

949
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
Are going to be

950
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:09,631
Just know that right now enjoy this while you can know

951
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:16,031
16 minutes of Alex Audio 48 minutes

952
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:21,407
7/2 hour Walmart

953
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,527
First of all the beginning of it makes me laugh a lot

954
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,575
And then the second

955
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:31,135
No the second part just makes me understand how I

956
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:35,231
It's Jones that interfaces of the world super fascinating

957
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,815
I mean it just reinforces stuff that

958
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,095
Play we've been saying for

959
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:40,863
For a f****** year

960
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,655
Yeah

961
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,471
Thinks he's bragging but he's actually revealing

962
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,519
He's dumb

963
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
I'm going to split this one have

964
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,591
But enjoy the beginning

965
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,855
How much brakes

966
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,719
How much brakes

967
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,511
The show

968
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,815
By the time I'm 3 hours ahead

969
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,607
Not really tired

970
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
I'm more relaxed

971
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:22,079
Remember the topic I was going to cover and don't feel the same outrage

972
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,223
The real quick that's the first

973
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:28,991
Part of that

974
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:35,391
Alex is straight-up admitting that like Five by the middle of the show I was kind of lazy I'm in a Groove

975
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
I was feeling relaxed

976
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:40,255
And I just can't fake the anger that I can the beginning of the show

977
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:44,351
I want to scream about these topics but by the time

978
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:51,519
I didn't interview his Bitcoin guy I was

979
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,543
I'm sleepy

980
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,639
I have this I wanted to talk about it look I'm mad about it don't get me wrong

981
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,431
I'm f****** mad about it

982
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,967
I just can't get it up

983
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991
I can't fake it

984
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,599
That's what he say that's a hundred percent

985
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:10,719
He's a great actor is performative you saying all of this is like

986
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
Oscillating

987
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,351
Michelle which I strongly disagree with

988
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:21,215
I find that most of the time when he's Faking It the hardest hits in the third hour

989
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,287
That's because he doesn't

990
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
That's

991
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:29,919
Crying that's when the spirit gets good to him right so anyway

992
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,455
The rest of this

993
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
Nelly

994
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,319
So much fun

995
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:46,559
So I know what the media's response is going to be

996
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,375
About me

997
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,167
When I cover these topics it's that

998
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
Get that

999
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,591
No this is

1000
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,735
None of this is going to make sense and that's fine

1001
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,527
Italo

1002
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:12,159
Only time this show is the only time you can say that

1003
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:18,303
Are you speaking in tremendous vagaries and it's not really going to come together for a while but you'll get it

1004
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,327
You'll get it eventually

1005
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,567
Absolutely

1006
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,895
Programs understand

1007
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
The book

1008
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,135
Weather alert

1009
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:43,903
I have

1010
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,303
Totally different person

1011
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,119
You lied

1012
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,263
Children books when I was about 7 years old

1013
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,311
Started reading

1014
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
Adult books

1015
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:06,175
That's not good not the way to go about it

1016
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:10,527
Years old is probably first grade

1017
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,343
Maybe Ron about her second grade

1018
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,647
There's no way

1019
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:19,487
Vivian 95% of humans have

1020
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,535
Even

1021
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:26,655
Higher than that 98% humans

1022
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,679
Genetic learning

1023
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,007
Erase memory erase memory know I don't add

1024
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:37,407
Four ways to learn like the cognitive development that it's required to even really understand.

1025
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,455
You know

1026
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,271
Complex dialogue complex narrative

1027
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,831
It's almost impossible at age 7

1028
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:50,207
Was just about to start reading Brian Jax's Redwolf

1029
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:56,863
Right by the Lesser works of

1030
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:03,263
Know you know why you don't stay in The Dubliners is a huge

1031
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,823
Difficult thing to read

1032
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,687
He will never understand Dublin The Dubliners is a hit with the elementary set

1033
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,479
The problem is

1034
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:18,879
You cancel actually elementary kids might understand Finnegans Wake alot better than some of the English Majors I knew

1035
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,671
But that's more about them

1036
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:24,511
The problem is that like you can physically read anything

1037
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,559
You just can't understand

1038
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,095
You can't understand that

1039
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,423
Back the textural deepness has of Fame can understand

1040
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,959
Subjects you can understand

1041
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,239
Rhetoric

1042
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,263
Those sorts of things

1043
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,799
And you really can't

1044
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,567
Until

1045
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
No

1046
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:43,455
Something like for a lot of this complicated probably into your teens

1047
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,991
Oh I mean

1048
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:48,063
A lot of people still don't understand the first

1049
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,367
Sentence of Pride and Prejudice

1050
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:54,975
I know I do is going

1051
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,815
Because my dad loved.

1052
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,567
My dad would buy me any books I want

1053
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,479
A school rap

1054
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,271
Book the occult

1055
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,879
Vietnam

1056
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,927
Time Life

1057
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
Looks

1058
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,231
Lake magazine

1059
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,327
Are they is like the village serialized books

1060
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:36,703
I think I saw a like an infomercial for those

1061
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:40,543
Earliest commercial of it I don't know I don't know what they are

1062
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,847
You kind of do even though you don't

1063
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
My books

1064
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:48,479
Project other super science projects

1065
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,271
And I would

1066
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,623
But there was just my dad's a big book

1067
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,959
20 volume set World War

1068
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,079
Idea

1069
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,671
Shares rise and fall of the Third Reich

1070
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:32,767
Tabulator so bad

1071
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,471
I just get around

1072
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:57,599
This gets to the heart of the matter and that is that Alex Jones read all these things that he cites

1073
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,879
Before he had cognition

1074
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,159
Understanding

1075
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,463
And they created a framework in it

1076
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,255
His brain when he was 7

1077
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:08,607
10 years old but isn't mature

1078
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,447
If he is telling the truth no I believe that he

1079
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,007
Through those books or the process of reading

1080
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,055
Be honest like

1081
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,103
Technotronic era is

1082
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,895
It's a difficult book to read

1083
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:24,991
It's engageable as a thirty-year-old or if you're in college

1084
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,295
It's about it's about right

1085
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,855
Your ten-year-old even reading that

1086
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,159
It's going to take you

1087
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:35,743
Couple months probably cuz every

1088
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,047
What does this mean or you won't

1089
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,863
Right I mean if you like

1090
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
End

1091
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:48,287
I mean if you are reading WWII books at 8 years old

1092
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,871
If you're reading books about World War at 8 years old

1093
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:56,991
I think it's entirely reasonable for an eight-year-old to be like

1094
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,551
Hitler was a strong dude

1095
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:05,695
Oh yeah

1096
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:12,351
And that time.

1097
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:15,423
Play Kenny framework of the world

1098
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:20,799
Sing like that

1099
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,127
He's a great character

1100
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,663
He's the monster though

1101
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:29,247
You know like when you're when you go back and read that

1102
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:33,087
In reality you go oh look at all of this other stuff

1103
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,391
That'll hurt f****** monster is

1104
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:38,975
And if you are from that very young age

1105
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,559
Inclined to believe that the strongest

1106
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,351
Or the the most

1107
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,119
Ruthless

1108
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,423
Is then

1109
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,959
You get your Alex Jones

1110
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,239
If you're reading

1111
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,311
Like all of these WWII

1112
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,847
Please read 200 books

1113
01:06:55,103 --> 01:07:00,223
I mean you know presenting that is being over the course of his life right but it is you

1114
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,575
I don't think he's right under the book

1115
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:10,719
But if you if you're if you're like reading a Lion's Share of that bulk of it when you're

1116
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
Younger

1117
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
Then

1118
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
11

1119
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
Right

1120
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,119
I just I just don't think

1121
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,935
That you're going to be able to critically analyze

1122
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,495
The Viewpoint of the writer

1123
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,775
I think that's

1124
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,055
There's a decent chance

1125
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,639
He might have read some like

1126
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,431
Even possibly

1127
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,199
Row

1128
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
Nazi

1129
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,039
Well

1130
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:35,807
Or at least

1131
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,087
Dubiously

1132
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,623
1/3

1133
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:42,463
Book being the best of the best evidence for his

1134
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,999
Inability to

1135
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,815
Again if this is true

1136
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,583
Which

1137
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,119
I have a healthy

1138
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,143
Suspicion about

1139
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:54,495
You can you can see from his vocabulary

1140
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:57,055
That he is unable to comprehend

1141
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,151
If he had read Calvin and Hobbes when he was a child

1142
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,967
He would have a better vocabulary than if you would read

1143
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,527
World War

1144
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:11,391
I'm not certain I understand

1145
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:17,791
Built into it it's a great great, guy recommended for hands

1146
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:18,815
I also

1147
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:22,655
Plagued him throughout his life

1148
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,447
He functions in the world

1149
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,751
With that childhood cognition

1150
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,775
Adult

1151
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,055
Everybody

1152
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:32,383
He exists as this really Furious

1153
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,943
I like you don't understand the book

1154
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,247
Because I can go to all of them

1155
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:41,343
And I have I mean I haven't read everything that he claims

1156
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,903
Do many of the things that you

1157
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,671
Cited

1158
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,439
Specifically

1159
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:50,559
I need don't say what he's saying right like a lot of times he pretends that they're prescriptive

1160
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,607
Like they're saying this to happen

1161
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,887
Or something like that

1162
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,423
When they're just descriptive

1163
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,471
They're just explaining the

1164
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,007
Situation or they're explaining

1165
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,543
The world as it is

1166
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,591
And not offering a solution

1167
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,663
And because he's a child in his brain

1168
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
He's like

1169
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,735
What they're secretly saying is

1170
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,271
I mean

1171
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,599
Hellscape we should

1172
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:19,743
This is a reasonable thing if you are capable of growing out of it like it's like

1173
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,767
Like that

1174
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,535
Shittyboyz

1175
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:25,119
When I was when I was like 13 I read that

1176
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,911
And I thought it was a shity book

1177
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:30,239
And then I reread it and you know later on in life

1178
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,287
And I understood the depth

1179
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,103
And the point of views that are are built into it

1180
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,663
It's a shity book but it's still 88

1181
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:40,991
Much more meaningful now that I'm capable of understanding

1182
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
What that guy was f***

1183
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:48,671
Talking about because I don't I didn't really understand the mindset of chill

1184
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:55,071
There's a lot of stuff that you

1185
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,143
Right right

1186
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:04,031
That's one of the interesting things about as your perception

1187
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,591
You'll find that the book itself

1188
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,919
Absofuckinglutly yeah the only thing

1189
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:14,015
Steppenwolf the best book of all time

1190
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:17,343
Even in my life

1191
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,951
Are you okay

1192
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,487
Just thinking about

1193
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:30,399
The other book I was going to do an audiobook up

1194
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:34,495
Automatic LS3 lean is

1195
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:43,199
Boyfriend wants to look into it

1196
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,271
So terrible but next clip

1197
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,551
Alex

1198
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:52,159
Makes a weird Claim about Hollywood

1199
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,695
That's a good enough

1200
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
People

1201
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:12,127
And none of them live in Hollywood and I don't want to be anywhere near it and they try

1202
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,015
Everything they do is a hit

1203
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,767
Christian conservative Patriot

1204
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,095
That's what America wants

1205
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,191
That's very cool

1206
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:36,959
Convenient

1207
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:39,007
That's convenient

1208
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,335
You know for somebody who loves to give example

1209
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:49,759
No course not cuz it's a nonsense thing

1210
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:55,903
Hollywood Patriots hoodie talks about there's always

1211
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,183
Is Jay Leno

1212
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,487
Tim Allen

1213
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,279
Tim Allen

1214
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:06,143
He brings up

1215
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:11,775
A large group of secret

1216
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,055
Conservatives in Hollywood

1217
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:17,151
I don't really care about that cuz I don't care

1218
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:23,551
Cuz there's a lot of very powerful conservatives who are out and doesn't really seem to be that much of a stigma

1219
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:27,647
Rock already revelar

1220
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,183
Revelation

1221
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,047
But even just on a on a very specific level

1222
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,095
It doesn't change how I feel

1223
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:36,863
Think about the Rock

1224
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,143
I don't think

1225
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,167
Anyone cares

1226
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,959
Unless

1227
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,519
You are let's say

1228
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:51,455
White supremacist

1229
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
Right

1230
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,575
I don't believe that this this this Mythic

1231
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,135
Secret society of conservatives in Hollywood exist

1232
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,183
I'll believe that Alex has talked to them

1233
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:04,511
But it's so fun it's this game against the play where is

1234
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:11,423
I have this secret knowledge of these secret conservative and guess what they're the most successful

1235
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,799
Left Behind series is bigger than Harry Potter

1236
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:27,551
I'm still want this f****** wizard b******* you know that the Lord has said that you should

1237
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,319
Witches

1238
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,367
Totally absurd

1239
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,671
How many he does actually have

1240
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,951
One Pivot Point

1241
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:35,999
Hinge

1242
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,303
To his a Hollywood ramblings

1243
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,095
In this episode that I

1244
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,631
Agree with him on and

1245
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,167
I'm not going to

1246
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:43,935
Dispute

1247
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:47,007
And that is the one guy is a piece of s***

1248
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,103
Not going to reveal who that person is

1249
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:54,431
Because it's more fun it's going to be who it should

1250
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,759
This clip is going to lay out who it is

1251
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:01,343
Galax forever to get to

1252
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:03,391
Free beer things I've ever heard

1253
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:10,047
I don't know what Alex is talking about in this clip and we're going to have to analyze this a bit but the

1254
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,327
Conclusion I will be taking

1255
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,095
Extensive

1256
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,399
The conclusion of who doesn't like

1257
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,423
I agree

1258
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:28,735
Check your pregnant miscarriage and have it done at your place with your people

1259
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,527
But everybody can say that

1260
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,647
Decision

1261
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,951
16 years ago

1262
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,791
I'm not normally a vengeful person number for the undecided

1263
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
So hold on

1264
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,167
Hold on

1265
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:54,079
What was 16 years ago. I think he's accusing someone of kicking

1266
01:14:54,335 --> 01:15:00,479
His wife down the revealing that he kicked his wife downstairs I don't know what's going on

1267
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,039
It's one of the most terrifying

1268
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:07,647
W2002

1269
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,719
When I first heard this I was like

1270
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,511
Well I mean it was right after work

1271
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,583
Right is a tough time for everybody

1272
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:22,495
I thought could easily end up getting threatening towards somebody at the end of the clip and I thought like

1273
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:29,151
2002 is probably right around when he might have still been working with linklaters

1274
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:32,479
That's possible

1275
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,527
Spoiler alert it's not like later

1276
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,807
The f****** thing

1277
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:42,207
Is he literally talking about someone kicking his wife down the stairs and causing a miscarriage to try and frame him

1278
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,487
What the

1279
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,535
F*** is he talking about

1280
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:51,935
His Burrows was Juanita we don't want you to scroll down scroll back a tiny bit so you can do that again

1281
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,215
Because that's so weird

1282
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,591
Decision

1283
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,639
16 years ago

1284
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:06,271
I'm not normally a vengeful person I'm a forward I decided just now

1285
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,511
Walking Track

1286
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,679
We'll see how you do when I drag your ass out the light

1287
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,007
Because you're never going to get away with what you've done

1288
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,543
Engaged

1289
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,359
I think

1290
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,383
Piece of crap

1291
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,687
What is worshipped in Hollywood

1292
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:42,623
Because he's a degenerate

1293
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,415
Filthy scumbag

1294
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,767
And I think it's time

1295
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
We have

1296
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,327
People on

1297
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,911
Tarantino

1298
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,679
Oh yeah

1299
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,287
So I guess that

1300
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:06,943
You did a note just came out

1301
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:10,783
The audio is revealed of him being like

1302
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:17,439
That girl votes

1303
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,863
Nothing yeah

1304
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,911
Monster

1305
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,727
Surprised by that either

1306
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,359
We didn't know

1307
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,151
Yeah that sounds right

1308
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,711
For us

1309
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,247
And people who work

1310
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,319
In the business you know what I mean like for us

1311
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:51,487
No...

1312
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:54,047
Yep yep yeah it's about that

1313
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:59,679
Like we have no idea what people personal lives are monstrous

1314
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,703
People

1315
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,983
In character

1316
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:07,615
You know who are actually awesome right you can take a long list of like

1317
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,919
Professional wrestlers wear the classic heels

1318
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,735
Who Behind the Scenes were the sweetest people in the world you know

1319
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:15,039
Their whole public perception Persona is like

1320
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:19,903
I cheat and brutalize people and beat them to beat them down

1321
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:26,303
The opposite is true is like traveling around doing doing enough shows with Queen

1322
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,095
Comics

1323
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,631
Total end your life

1324
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:33,471
You're a f****** monster in real the time the time

1325
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,775
It's so there's there is that like

1326
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
That

1327
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,567
Sensitive like

1328
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,639
You don't really know from the outside

1329
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:46,783
That's how I felt about Quentin Tarantino for a long time

1330
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,575
I'd heard something

1331
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,367
Really been thrilled with him

1332
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,903
Suck it

1333
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,695
I like some of his movies

1334
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,743
I think some of them are sophistic garbage

1335
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,535
I think Alex's

1336
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,583
Film criticism is even

1337
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:02,399
Knock knock who's there it's it's

1338
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,447
It's within the realm of okay

1339
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:07,519
We agree with Alex bring the troops

1340
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:14,175
I'm more concerned about the idea that Quentin Tarantino

1341
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:16,479
Kicked his wife

1342
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:22,879
Alex's wife

1343
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,695
And if that's the case

1344
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:29,023
I want no way more about that

1345
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,815
Yeah

1346
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,863
Nothing about it

1347
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,143
Say 60

1348
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,423
Years ago

1349
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,447
If you weren't

1350
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,471
Referencing

1351
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,031
A specific time

1352
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:43,359
Your wife was kicked on the stairs you know I think

1353
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,639
Most likely

1354
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,919
I mean if it's

1355
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:49,759
McKay's the Quentin Tarantino kicked Alex

1356
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,527
Which

1357
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,551
Ladies and gentlemen

1358
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:57,183
You heard it here first by the way I told you earlier in the show I found their marriage license they were married in

1359
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,207
2007

1360
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:00,255
5 years after 16 years ago

1361
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:06,911
Was common law married admiralty law

1362
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:11,007
But if that's the case then

1363
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:13,055
I feel very sad for Alex

1364
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,360
Text wife

1365
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,944
Yeah that's all I need to know more about it

1366
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,784
Realistic realistic

1367
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,064
Occam's razor

1368
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:28,416
He was riffing on globalist and what they want to do to you

1369
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,696
And then he was like

1370
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,976
Oh wait I was wrong

1371
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,096
I need probably referencing 16 years ago human Quentin Tarantino like onto a fight

1372
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,632
They got into an argument

1373
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,936
Tarantino has roots in Austin and

1374
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,704
Texas

1375
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:47,104
Or Alex was with

1376
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,176
Party for Mike Judge

1377
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:54,784
Or my judge yeah yeah there's no doubt that like Alex is an ant

1378
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,112
Another a****** mixes in with an a******

1379
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,000
And then they have a fight and no one

1380
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:08,096
That's probably the most collateral damage of

1381
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,984
The cake downstairs that's probably just

1382
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,056
It's probably not

1383
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,592
I don't know

1384
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:22,944
Got it no wife at 16 years

1385
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:25,248
And this is why I want to be friends with Alex

1386
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:29,856
Even though I want to destroy him

1387
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:33,184
I want us to be like a jocular enemies

1388
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,976
So I can have it

1389
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:41,376
Right so I can hit him up on Twitter be like Alex you were getting weird what the f*** were you talkin about

1390
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:48,032
I like all know that was just me and Mike were pretty liquored up

1391
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,312
You want to know

1392
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:54,944
The day Alex without the trappings or we can wait till next week

1393
01:21:55,456 --> 01:22:01,600
And see what comes out next week is going to start taking it out you know what quite frankly if you just

1394
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,160
Text Quentin Tarantino down on the Merritt

1395
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:07,232
I'm all for it I'm not really going to fight

1396
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:10,048
Baby

1397
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,632
As long as you're not lying and exaggerating for no reason

1398
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:16,192
I'm cool

1399
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
That Alex

1400
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,008
Assumes that

1401
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:23,360
Many of his critics have a dog in the fight right

1402
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,944
Oh you guys are going to defend Quentin Tarantino

1403
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:32,576
Well I get watch you both

1404
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:37,440
Light each other of fire I like you loves the idea of

1405
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:40,512
Uniformity of what he's supposed to

1406
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:43,840
Yeah

1407
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,632
Be super mad about feminism

1408
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:52,288
But there's a large portion of feminism that's trans-exclusionary

1409
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,824
Kinda be into that

1410
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,432
Or whatever you know that there are different segments

1411
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:04,320
All of the groups that he's against it's not unipolar right like this even look at our podcast

1412
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,368
We're not unipolar

1413
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,416
No you and I have different

1414
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:11,232
Like philosophical principle beliefs

1415
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:16,608
Like if Alex was just like knowledge fight is one thing that's against milk

1416
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,424
Realistically me and Jordan both

1417
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,216
Hate you but

1418
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:21,984
But there's

1419
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,288
Nuanced there's differences

1420
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:28,896
Best thing about people with black-and-white worldviews is that they will always

1421
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,944
Project that onto everybody

1422
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:37,344
Definitely so if you have a dichotomy you all you will always projected that everyone

1423
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,208
Else has a dichotomy as well break

1424
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,256
F*** that guy f*** you

1425
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:49,632
Whatever reason with whatever it is I'm criticizing cert

1426
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,400
Things about

1427
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,680
F*** you on the merits

1428
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:56,544
Unfortunately that works both ways two-edged sword

1429
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:00,128
Who gives a who gives a s***

1430
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:06,528
Kill Bill but I'm not going to like Inglorious

1431
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,320
I mean

1432
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,928
Now is not the time to get into divorcing the art from the artists

1433
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:18,816
People who are way worse

1434
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,888
Hookah hookah

1435
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:28,288
Not art. Are we what we must do now we have one

1436
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,568
Segment left

1437
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,616
To do of the Goodwin

1438
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:36,736
We're done with the good

1439
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:40,320
We're getting we're going to get into the blitz but before we do

1440
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,600
I must take

1441
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:45,184
Quick intermission I apologize cuz this is a late night show

1442
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,488
But you got to pee

1443
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
And I got to be focused

1444
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:55,168
For the rest of this about minutes

1445
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:04,640
I apologize the reality is we have

1446
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,688
Wanted to keep my keep my

1447
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,736
Focus on point

1448
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:12,064
Like Alex Jones

1449
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:17,440
You didn't want to bring up the the fake energy to be like

1450
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:20,256
Sometimes when the body is

1451
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,280
Doing things

1452
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:25,120
You end up rushing through something lose track of the

1453
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,424
Which is disgusting things

1454
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
Contact us

1455
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:29,984
Should be discussed

1456
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,264
And I don't want to do that

1457
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,288
So

1458
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,824
Or you could say you had to

1459
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
I had to pay

1460
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,920
Jordan

1461
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,736
The last

1462
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,528
Hour or so

1463
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,320
Alex Jones Show

1464
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:49,440
Turns into I started with that clip or he's like most

1465
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:55,072
My anger and everything I weird cuz it was like run out of gas

1466
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,376
But Bitcoin guessed it not go well

1467
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,656
And he's like

1468
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,192
I sometimes

1469
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,472
Yes

1470
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:04,544
I did go to jail for selling explosive

1471
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,080
Fair enough

1472
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:09,408
Isaac I can't fake it sometimes

1473
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,968
This late in the show blah blah

1474
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:15,808
Read lots of books.

1475
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,600
Come to me and say I haven't

1476
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,904
I got a little defensive about that right

1477
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,928
Not bragging but his

1478
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,952
Historians are stupid

1479
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:26,560
Compare to me don't stop all that I'm at the king best not miss

1480
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:31,424
If you remember when he was getting into that he was talking about like if this is the key

1481
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:38,592
But you never got to it have the keys which in my notes I wrote keys to?

1482
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,872
What do they have

1483
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,920
Keys to what I told you

1484
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,224
This isn't going to make sense and don't worry about it

1485
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,504
I know

1486
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,600
Here's where we where we get to it

1487
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:53,184
We got a long long clip

1488
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,488
Pausing throughout

1489
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,304
That is really no edit points throughout these are

1490
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:02,912
Boy this is this is a lot of trouble

1491
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,704
Let's jump this is where

1492
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,752
Is this clip starts with Alex Jones

1493
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,824
Paul Revere

1494
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,664
It's weird it's very weird

1495
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,272
Know what that's a release aliens

1496
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,296
Comparison

1497
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,832
Has Paul Revere

1498
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:27,232
Historically is far more celebrated than the female counterpart

1499
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:36,192
Cuz I'm a piece of s*** damn it I hate my

1500
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:39,264
I called you out on it but I don't know

1501
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,056
I think it's a valid

1502
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,848
Criticism and I apologize

1503
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
I do too

1504
01:27:56,672 --> 01:28:02,816
Well you are supposed to say the trees somewhere that's what he was looking for

1505
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:07,680
Historical diatribe Forest talkabouttd

1506
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:10,496
That's not how that goes

1507
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,568
Give me evidentiary information out

1508
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,336
Nope

1509
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,896
Instead of just being Paul Revere

1510
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,272
And

1511
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,952
I was there and I saw him landing and they were on their horses

1512
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,680
He said the arms arms

1513
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,264
Redcoats Atlantic

1514
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,664
Why can't I just say that

1515
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
Well

1516
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,272
A lot of reasons

1517
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,320
Because

1518
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:58,368
What I say

1519
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,184
Mercedes upfront at the North

1520
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,304
They don't want you to

1521
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,352
So I just want to be clear

1522
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:11,168
I am keeping everything in

1523
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:14,496
Including Alex saying people who are going to cover this

1524
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:19,104
Are going to take it out of context rehnquist it I promise you Alex

1525
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,664
I hate you

1526
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,968
And I respect you enough not to do that

1527
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,272
To begin

1528
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,808
Here is what he has said

1529
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,880
Instead of giving specific

1530
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,928
Historical evidence

1531
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,976
Diatribe

1532
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,768
Bibleman

1533
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,304
Well that's actually kind of

1534
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,072
I mean

1535
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,352
That's exactly what

1536
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:44,704
That is like a self-assessment

1537
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,568
Verifiable

1538
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,848
Which he's going to

1539
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:53,920
Continue to do but in a very ugly ugly

1540
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:54,944
Is very ugly

1541
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,480
I can't stress this enough

1542
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:00,576
We'll have some fun with it I put this is so ugly

1543
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:13,376
It's in the white papers attend attacks now they're staying at the news

1544
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:19,520
In the fifties and sixties

1545
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:23,616
They're going to adopt in the water

1546
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:28,224
More manageable

1547
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:32,064
Do science of Obama

1548
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,368
Holdren 1974

1549
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:39,744
Alex is not read this whole book

1550
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,328
I have read most of it and I've read the relevant passages

1551
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,608
Do you talkin about

1552
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,144
In great detail at read this

1553
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:46,912
Surrounding

1554
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:47,936
Text to the

1555
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:48,960
Contextual

1556
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,240
Pieces of it

1557
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,520
This is a textbook

1558
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,056
About ecoscience

1559
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,592
They don't act

1560
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,616
84

1561
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:59,712
Putting anything in the water they don't talk about that advocates for

1562
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,248
Eugenics

1563
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,528
Not really

1564
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:05,856
Not not in any extreme way especially

1565
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,392
You know

1566
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:09,696
1874 Style

1567
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:13,024
Eugenics wasn't really even all that popular in 1944

1568
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:19,680
He's describing the 50s and 60s

1569
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:24,288
If you going to talk about

1570
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:28,128
The deal it was a little bit different than our understanding of

1571
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:28,896
Still

1572
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:36,320
Much much different than Larry inversion

1573
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,088
And like

1574
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,112
Strictly

1575
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,904
Scientific

1576
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:46,560
Neither is great but there's a thin line there's a there's a conversation to be had but it's important to note again

1577
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:52,960
That Hitler's Eugenics was begun and American

1578
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:58,336
There's a lot of that I've read most of beholder

1579
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,616
Eco Science Tech

1580
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:01,920
Thousand something pages long and

1581
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:04,480
I f****** love it I think it's great

1582
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:08,576
It taught me a lot about geology taught me a lot about water distribution

1583
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,344
Patterns

1584
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,440
Okay there's a lot of really great

1585
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:19,328
It's not a white paper in some way it was

1586
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,376
About ecological science

1587
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,472
And the parts that Albert was written on was base

1588
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,520
Alex is taking so much of this.

1589
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:31,872
Will get into much greater detail about this in the endgame

1590
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:33,408
Documentary

1591
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,688
He brings that up

1592
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,504
We'll get into it

1593
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,552
Completely lying about that

1594
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,088
This idea of

1595
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,880
Depopulation

1596
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,904
Is based on

1597
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,696
Cool bunch of

1598
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:50,048
Kissinger road back in the 70s

1599
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
The difference between

1600
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,632
Prescriptive

1601
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:54,656
Descriptive language

1602
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,704
There's this

1603
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,776
Kissinger

1604
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,312
Right you know

1605
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:04,896
Criticize Kissinger

1606
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:11,296
On his own merits you don't need to put him in a weird

1607
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,832
Situation

1608
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:18,464
Beyond what the b******* like I don't want to be defending George Soros

1609
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,256
See the f****** billionaire

1610
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:25,888
Nazi collaborator

1611
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:29,728
In the same way

1612
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,800
But the advocate

1613
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,336
Eighty percent of the population

1614
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,360
Killed

1615
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:41,760
Absolutely not true breeding of things that he wrote Alex is still reading on AC

1616
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:44,064
Braids for 7 year olds

1617
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:50,464
Which is weird because you might actually be able to make a good argument for Kissinger

1618
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:53,024
Being a Nazi collaborator

1619
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:59,680
Like that's probably driver them Soros

1620
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,960
The Kissinger had his hands in

1621
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,240
Yeah

1622
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:16,576
Clearly Utah

1623
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,624
It's sold

1624
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,416
Angelone

1625
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:27,840
Kona the big island in Hawaii beautiful Island

1626
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,568
Coronavirus video

1627
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:40,896
I grew up in Hawaii

1628
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,456
I looked on a wahoo

1629
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,248
City of Honolulu

1630
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,296
Spent a lot of time on the island

1631
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,064
What's a good time

1632
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:51,136
How you doing

1633
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:53,440
The Big Island

1634
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:56,512
This entire episode has been you waiting

1635
01:34:56,768 --> 01:35:01,632
To say that no actually when I was

1636
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:06,496
But it's fun because this is an example of Alex like he started the clip about being a

1637
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,032
I get into like

1638
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,616
Talk about like

1639
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:16,736
Historical evidence and all the minutiae and Paul Revere

1640
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,272
Yelling the British are coming

1641
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:23,904
And now he's getting into the weeds but it's not historical evidence or any factual truth

1642
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,440
It's just him a rambling

1643
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:29,280
It's just him saying things

1644
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:33,376
Wait

1645
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:40,032
What the f*** we just go to alii Lani high school elementary school also how old

1646
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,848
30 I'm 33 did we go to elementary school together

1647
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:44,640
It's getting weird go back to the cliff

1648
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:47,456
M a Pacifica

1649
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:54,624
20th century and the 21st century

1650
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,672
I flew here

1651
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:01,280
Largest ocean of 70

1652
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:04,864
Check percent of our land mass covered by saltwater 1%

1653
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,680
Freshwater not a 2% below ground

1654
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:28,672
It's rambling on science and you just listing off numbers and s*** like that but like also

To Rattle off

1675
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:22,432
That's most important

1676
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,992
Thin small area

This is going to be triggered by various words

1693

1696
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,072

The red

1707
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:25,056
Red Sun of Krypton

1708

1710
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,392

01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,024
Comic book

1712
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:53,216
You're right. The bigger point is that you rattling off

1713
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:57,056
All of these reasons why having a family is right

1714
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:00,640
Super Bowl

Bulshit examples

1717
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,880
He's giving our literal like

1718
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,648
Counterexample

1719
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,512
Break for having children

1720
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,048
It doesn't work

1721
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,584
Some of the examples

1722
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,608
Along the way

1723
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,376
RV

1724
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,192
And clearly trying to spell

1725
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:26,240
And some of the other ones are like

1726
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,008
Nope

1727
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,800
Yeah okay I got confirmation

1728
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,360
I can move on now

1729
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,664
With your life

1730
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,968
I don't

1731
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:41,856
I'm going to scroll this back cuz I don't think you heard the context they're back at work

1732
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:44,160
To the

1733
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,000
2

1734
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,912
Don't believe it

1735
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,240
You're not

1736
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,640
Why would I join

1737
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:21,536
The SEC has 178 words are not supposed to sound radio

1738
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,560
Carla

1739
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:27,680
I what

1740
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:31,520
Did you let Alex once interviewed

1741
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,056
Bet

1742
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:33,824
Beck

1743
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:39,200
Tell me tell me that you have

1744
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,504
He didn't he didn't interview

1745
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:47,648
One of his reporters went to a book signing and try to get

1746
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:54,304
You did not spray Matt the correct what he says

1747
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,352
So there's 07 words

1748
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,144
Not supposed to say the n word

1749
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:58,912
True

1750
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,704
And then now Nazis are bad

1751
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:04,032
There there

1752
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:06,080
Apparently

1753
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:10,432
Frustratingly not bad

1754
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,480
Most people

1755
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:13,504
Really cool with you

1756
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:16,576
Really all it is

1757
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:19,136
TV broadcast

1758
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,416
Who always

1759
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,976
The word

1760
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,536
Which

1761
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,072
What created

1762
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:29,888
Twenty-something Years Ago by people in the community

1763
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:46,784
Suicide big problem

1764
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:52,928
Might as well just take a break there

1765
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,232
I mean

1766
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,000
No

1767
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:57,024
If therefore

1768
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,304
For their life

1769
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,864
Definitely has nothing

1770
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:04,192
It was used against

1771
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,472
The gay community

1772
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,080
Your fault

1773
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:15,200
I mean look if you want to

1774
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,224
I'm in the list

1775
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:16,992
As long as

1776
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:18,528
Words

1777
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,808
Gated communities

1778
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,088
Have been

1779
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,880
Co-opted

1780
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,648
This Liars

1781
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,416
Exactly

1782
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:26,208
Whose fault is that

1783
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,488
Yeah

1784
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,256
Probably

1785
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:30,560
Very open-minded people like Alex

1786
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:44,896
Riesbeck's in d.c.

1787
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,160
Facebook

1788
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:59,488
So Alex is claiming here is the vice president

1789
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,280
Vice president

1790
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,048
The Facebook

1791
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,328
Called him

1792
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:05,632
You recorded the call

1793
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:09,728
And the guy said he's going to explain

1794
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,080
T words

1795
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
You can say

1796
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,920
Baby but what band you if you say that

1797
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:18,944
Keyword

1798
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:23,040
I don't believe it for a second

1799
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:26,112
I have not

1800
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
4

1801
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,184
Nigh on a year now

1802
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,720
And it has been a delight

1803
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,768
A lot of people post

1804
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:35,584
That word but yeah I've seen a lot of people post

1805
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:42,496
That was definitely there

1806
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,800
Categorical nonsense

1807
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:51,200
Do you know what you know what is RuPaul uses that word on her Facebook page like

1808
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:55,552
Right that's a different conversation

1809
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,904
Do not have standing

1810
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,976
No

1811
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:05,536
Is that like

1812
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:08,096
I have a standing position

1813
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,888
That whatever Alex

1814
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,424
Footage of something

1815
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,472
And he doesn't produce it I don't believe

1816
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,288
He does this all the time

1817
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,896
He said he had hours of footage of Megyn Kelly sucking up to him

1818
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:23,456
And all of this is proof that she's a liar

1819
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:26,528
Emily soon as the interview came out and it wasn't that damaging

1820
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:29,856
Never going to happen never really saw that footage

1821
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:31,136
Never needed to talk about

1822
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,160
He has

1823
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:32,928
Hecox

1824
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:39,072
Hours and hours of footage of antifa beating up with rally

1825
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,864
And all the Deep laser these

1826
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:43,936
Wildly innocuous videos of someone

1827
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:47,008
Maybe pushing a Mike out of their face

1828
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:47,776
You're like

1829
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:50,336
Hey girl you didn't need to hit that Mike but you did

1830
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:52,128
Certainly not in the salt

1831
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,920
Certainly not extreme

1832
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:56,224
Please like we got hours and hours of this photo

1833
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,504
Never produce

1834
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,088
Vice president of Facebook

1835
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,112
Hold him

1836
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:04,160
He recorded the call

1837
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,696
It's not

1838
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:08,000
True it's not absolutely not true

1839
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,280
Until proven otherwise

1840
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,328
That is

1841
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,888
Indicative of one of my

1842
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:14,912
Largest

1843
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,680
Issues

1844
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:17,728
With so much of media attention

1845
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,776
Is that

1846
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:23,104
I have checked proven

1847
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,896
Consistent Liars

1848
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:26,432
It's not that

1849
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:29,760
They shouldn't exist or that they like

1850
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:34,624
Like once you become our

1851
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:37,440
What you becoming untrustworthy source

1852
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,256
You should not be consulted

1853
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:48,704
Devalue people in the mainstream

1854
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,984
Paul Ryan

1855
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,032
Everybody should just be like no

1856
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:54,848
You're not trustworthy or Peter.

1857
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,128
Oh absolutely

1858
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:57,920
Does anyone think

1859
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:59,712
Who's that guy was on 30 Rock

1860
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:08,160
Like I was real phone on 30 Rock that news anchor lied about

1861
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:17,376
She's boring is it now

1862
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,472
I'm not

1863
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,264
Because he does not

1864
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,616
Credibility is still intact as far as I know

1865
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,176
There's so many times

1866
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:30,944
Keep seeing

1867
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:33,504
People who have been

1868
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:39,904
Documented lying to us and they're still allowed to go on at like if you're up

1869
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:45,024
King liar that we proved to have lied multiple times

1870
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:49,376
Let me know what you'd listen to you

1871
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:51,168
Yeah believe it comes down to

1872
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:51,936
Two-Face

1873
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:53,216
If you are a good

1874
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,008
Liar

1875
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:58,080
Like someone who has lied in good faith

1876
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:01,152
Like you accidentally reported a story that wasn't

1877
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:06,272
Truth like you're in anchor and there's a story that comes up and you reported

1878
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,808
Turns out it's not true

1879
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:14,208
And then there's a correction that released it all then

1880
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:15,232
Add Face line

1881
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,512
Yeah that is

1882
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:19,328
Hint that that is really what it comes down to

1883
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:25,728
Yeah you know I'm saying like that and that's what Alex does that's what cernovich does that's what all these assholes

1884
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,288
It's bad to say it comes down to this

1885
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,568
Conti and idea

1886
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:32,384
Of the only thing that's good in life is a Goodwill

1887
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:35,200
And they have a bad will you wish

1888
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,736
They wish bad

1889
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,760
Anytime

1890
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:39,296
Anytime

1891
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:42,368
If an oil

1892
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:44,672
Lobbyist show up on a

1893
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:45,952
Can show to talk about

1894
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:46,720
Climate change

1895
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:47,744
It's like no

1896
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,024
You're not allowed here

1897
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,584
Right because you are a liar it's been proven

1898
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,352
You're done

1899
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:58,752
There's no both sides

1900
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:04,384
Science Guy

1901
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,408
Turns out he's

1902
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,200
He works for an organization

1903
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:09,760
Tons of money from Exxon

1904
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:16,416
Google search search

1905
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,440
To be fair

1906
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:24,096
Had to find the organization he works for it I mean like

1907
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:28,448
What it really comes down to attending this is something we talked about

1908
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,728
Vaguely

1909
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,496
All the time

1910
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:33,056
I think it's really spiritually what we're talking

1911
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:33,824
About

1912
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,104
And that is that like

1913
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:40,480
Lot of people are going to lie to you or lie to you accidentally

1914
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,272
And it's your Civic

1915
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:43,296
Responsibility

1916
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:44,576
To understand what

1917
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,344
Your hearing

1918
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,928
Right but we unfortunately live in an era now or theirs

1919
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:51,488
Is enough people with bad wheel in bad faith

1920
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,560
Who are operating running around pretending

1921
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:59,680
Because the Internet is is Dutch that you can create a real good official-looking website

1922
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:03,520
Yeah or you can be someone who has enough

1923
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:10,688
Juice on Twitter or something like that and you can get invited on CNN or

1924
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:16,320
It's no longer a place where you can trust the public discourse has

1925
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,600
Routing and reality

1926
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,648
You have to do you have to look

1927
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,928
I don't have to check

1928
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:24,000
I don't think that that is a phenomena

1929
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:29,376
I think the

1930
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:30,400
Now

1931
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:32,192
And it's got a farther reach

1932
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,984
But if you go back through history like

1933
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,520
Liars about

1934
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:39,360
Meijer's abounded but generally speaking

1935
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:40,128
I think

1936
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:41,664
Things were a little

1937
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:43,712
Before disagree

1938
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:44,992
Maybe

1939
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:47,040
Back then there were other problem

1940
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:47,808
Dogs with like

1941
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:54,720
You know we'll just never tell

1942
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:58,048
Cover

1943
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,352
Something very important

1944
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:03,424
Or you have your like

1945
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:08,544
We won't allow the like when lvj refuse to

1946
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:11,360
Because of political reason

1947
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:13,664
What was the quote like

1948
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:17,504
We can't put this out because it would undermine people's face

1949
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,296
In the government so much

1950
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:21,344
That it would be destruct

1951
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:25,696
Like all of these different lines or Nixon

1952
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:27,744
The Vietnam War going

1953
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:29,536
F******

1954
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,120
Negotiating secret anti

1955
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:37,728
In order to make sure that he could be re-elected

1956
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:42,080
Thousands upon thousands of people died

1957
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:43,872
Justin Nixon could get

1958
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:44,640
Re-elected

1959
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,200
Michelle lately

1960
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:50,016
I haven't heard from him in a really long time I wonder if he's dead

1961
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,088
Morbid thought

1962
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,880
I know but he still

1963
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:56,416
Metro

1964
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,696
He certainly doesn't seem

1965
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:58,464
Healthy even

1966
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:05,888
Is this

1967
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:07,424
Timer of life

1968
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,960
Is Abe Vigoda dead

1969
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:15,616
If there is a fish if there's the fish of a knowledge fight it's f****** Larry Nichols

1970
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,152
We should call it

1971
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:18,176
Not now

1972
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:18,944
It's never too late

1973
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:19,712
Now call

1974
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:22,784
Shout

1975
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:26,880
We've had four beers Now's the Time to call Larry Nichols

1976
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:32,256
They should listen you can stay on

1977
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:37,120
But there's one

1978
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:39,424
And I training

1979
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:51,712
Facebook and Twitter judge in 2017

1980
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:55,296
But you can't say that

1981
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,624
The n-word is still

1982
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,672
What is

1983
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,208
Secure

1984
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:04,768
Here's the problem that I have

1985
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:07,328
What do you mean why did they choose that

1986
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:13,728
I don't care to me is less interesting than the flaw and Alex's logic is like

1987
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,056
Why not

1988
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:21,920
If you if you are like no it's a free speech issue

1989
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,712
Quote the n-word exact

1990
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:26,784
Yeah exactly what is your f****** problem

1991
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:27,552
You say

1992
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,368
Right

1993
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:31,392
You know

1994
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:39,328
Doesn't give a s*** about them your audience isn't going to be offended by that they think they're weird

1995
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:43,168
Yeah but he's going to get a lot of press from saying that

1996
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:47,776
There was an article in rightwingwatch but it only covered

1997
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,544
A slight

1998
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:52,384
Portion of the day

1999
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,664
We'll get to it but

2000
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,480
No I mean it's the old John Mulaney joke

2001
01:53:56,736 --> 01:54:00,064
Writing for an award show

2002
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:00,832
And they're like

2003
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:01,856
Okay

2004
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,136
You can't

2005
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,416
Say

2006
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:05,440
Midget

2007
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,464
It's

2008
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,232
The n word

2009
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,256
He's like

2010
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:09,024
Well

2011
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,840
One word we're saying

2012
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:15,936
And the other word were not right so it's not as bad

2013
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:17,216
You know like that kind of thing

2014
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,240
And it's not

2015
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:24,640
Like I'm not endorsing hair and work

2016
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:28,480
These words are acceptable or good label

2017
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:29,504
Let me throw this out

2018
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,784
Yeah all of them aren't good

2019
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:34,368
It's not good maybe don't think about it

2020
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,160
I really really like

2021
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:36,928
I don't

2022
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:38,208
Understand where it

2023
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:39,488
Comes into like

2024
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:44,608
This is this is this become such a problem for me and it's not just because I'm a

2025
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:45,376
Supporter

2026
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:46,144
Trans rights

2027
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,448
That that that that's secondary to

2028
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,728
Does the idea of like

2029
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,264
This is a free

2030
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,800
Speech issue

2031
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:55,872
Why can't I say things

2032
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:58,432
He called

2033
01:54:58,944 --> 01:54:59,456
I was like

2034
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:02,784
You know like

2035
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:05,344
If you if I didn't know you

2036
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:12,000
I just screamed at you on the street right probably generally don't like being called a s*******

2037
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,816
Cancel for saying that

2038
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:15,840
Yes

2039
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:19,936
Take any of those identifiers out of it

2040
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:20,960
And it's all just

2041
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:29,408
So much just so much of these conversations can be boiled down to

2042
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:31,200
Don't be a dick

2043
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,480
You know

2044
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:37,088
According to

2045
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,624
They're song

2046
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:45,024
All right.

2047
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,792
Just like beer

2048
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:48,352
A f****** courteous human being

2049
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,888
Hearing what people say

2050
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,680
I know Alex

2051
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:53,472
You are hearing it

2052
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:59,872
Inward and don't drop a hard-r on that you know that you're funding

2053
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,408
And all of it isn't going to

2054
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,176
To dry up

2055
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:03,456
If you drop it in bham

2056
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:05,248
On the show you know that

2057
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,040
Right you know that your funding doesn't

2058
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:07,808
Depend on that

2059
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:09,600
You really gave a s*** you just

2060
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,880
Be throwing the N word around like

2061
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:12,672
And that to me memes

2062
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:14,464
That your principal is flawed

2063
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,768
Your idea is stupid

2064
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,304
But

2065
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,328
Keep digging

2066
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:20,864
Because

2067
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,168
It's trans

2068
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:28,800
Men that want to be with a man and

2069
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:32,128
Once they get you

2070
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:37,248
Daily Caller

2071
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,552
This is an article about

2072
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,344
Radio thing where there's

2073
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:43,648
Offended

2074
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,696
I don't really

2075
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:49,024
I don't I don't I don't think that's necessarily the appropriate response

2076
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,560
But also I

2077
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:53,376
I think it's student radio especially in college

2078
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:57,216
Is a q territory in terms of SEC laws

2079
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:59,264
I don't know don't have a dog

2080
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:03,104
Don't care

2081
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,920
That he just said that I think is one of the most

2082
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:07,200
Important things

2083
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,480
2

2084
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,784
Tackle in regards videos

2085
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:14,112
In regards to the most important

2086
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,648
The idea of

2087
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:16,928
Trans people

2088
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,464
Want to be

2089
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:23,328
Iron Man trailer

2090
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:24,096
The case

2091
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:26,912
That gay people

2092
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,704
Want to be gay

2093
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,520
And it is not it is not a

2094
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:36,128
What connotation of like

2095
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,920
I am choosing this

2096
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:40,224
Because I desire it

2097
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,016
And not because this is

2098
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:47,136
Part of my identity this is worth who I am

2099
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:49,184
I want to be straight

2100
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:54,560
I have no desire towards that that is just part of

2101
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:57,632
Did your orientation

2102
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:58,400
Sidered

2103
01:57:59,168 --> 01:57:59,680
I mean

2104
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:07,872
I was waiting I was waiting for that

2105
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:13,760
Cast

2106
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:17,600
Cigarettes

2107
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,904
Yep stupid foot

2108
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,696
Down right there boy

2109
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:22,464
Great

2110
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,768
Goodbye goodbye

2111
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:31,168
Yeah no totally totally the idea of your desires in your orientation

2112
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:33,984
Beating the equivalent Earth are very

2113
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,032
Very different because I mean

2114
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:37,824
You shown study

2115
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:39,616
The idea of trying

2116
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:40,640
Change

2117
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:41,664
Your orientation

2118
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,712
Road

2119
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:45,504
Peril the road the

2120
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:49,344
Never really does anything but more shame

2121
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:52,160
Usually more internal anguish

2122
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,952
Any idea

2123
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:57,024
If you want to take this

2124
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,816
Cuz I was going to eventually

2125
01:58:59,072 --> 01:58:59,840
I don't think he doesn't

2126
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:01,376
This episode but he always does

2127
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:02,144
Do that

2128
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,912
The dumb

2129
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,192
I think actually do

2130
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:05,472
I'm going to hold off on this

2131
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:11,360
Cuz I think he gets into the biological stuff later

2132
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:14,176
To me it is

2133
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,456
It is

2134
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:17,248
The fundamental

2135
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,272
Issue with

2136
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,040
With

2137
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,064
That kind of

2138
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:21,344
Acceptance of

2139
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,112
Difference

2140
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,648
Ideas

2141
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,440
Exes

2142
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,256
You are like me

2143
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:32,096
So if you are not acting like me

2144
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:34,144
Then you are

2145
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:37,216
Desiring something that I find to be morally

2146
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:37,984
Objective

2147
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,264
Or quails

2148
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,592
Yeah and so it is not something that you can accept as

2149
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:43,616
You are not like

2150
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:44,896
And so

2151
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,176
You are you

2152
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:48,224
It's a very it's a

2153
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,248
Projection

2154
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,832
That I use is such at the heart of all of this

2155
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:54,368
Prejudice in all of this

2156
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:56,416
Hey where's all this stupid

2157
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:00,256
It's like it's like it's like saying

2158
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:01,280
You know what

2159
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:02,816
These black people

2160
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:04,864
Just don't want to be white

2161
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,400
They want to be black

2162
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:08,960
Instead of it being something that is

2163
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,240
Part of a

2164
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:11,264
Who You Are

2165
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,032
Brave

2166
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:16,384
Desire yourself out of

2167
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,944
Something that you are

2168
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:20,736
Which I think is b*******

2169
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:21,760
Totally

2170
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:25,344
And there's there's a secondary aspect to this that Alex

2171
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:28,416
Really the core of what he's talking about is it

2172
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:34,048
The ability

2173
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:34,816
If men and women

2174
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,400
He's going to dig into

2175
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,424
That a little bit

2176
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:42,496
And one of the things that is never charged me about that argument

2177
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:43,776
Is that like

2178
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:48,384
Look at the reality is that no one is ever really shot

2179
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,152
Down

2180
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:49,920
Language

2181
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,712
They're expanding

2182
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:55,296
The reality of

2183
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:56,576
Piano

2184
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,368
Back in the day

2185
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,160
When America was great

2186
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:01,952
I know right

2187
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:02,720
In the fifth

2188
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,768
Don't even like it

2189
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:06,560
Straight people in the queer

2190
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:08,608
Bright

2191
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:15,008
Right I don't scrape I'm going to let you continue being satirical I get it but

2192
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:18,592
You had you had Tata me back

2193
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:20,640
A bunch of people

2194
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:22,176
Fit into that dichotomy

2195
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:24,224
And they were limited

2196
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,248
But

2197
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:28,832
Major provision

2198
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,600
Give us yet

2199
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:31,904
Right and eventually those people

2200
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,184
Forced to conversation

2201
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,488
The language of God expanded

2202
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:40,608
Do larger portion population that are heterosexual

2203
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:43,168
Cisgender

2204
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:45,984
Designation

2205
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,520
I don't hurt them at all

2206
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:48,544
All it does is

2207
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,312
Expand

2208
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:50,080
What

2209
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,360
People

2210
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:52,128
Application

2211
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,176
There was

2212
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:56,480
Heterosexual

2213
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:57,760
The negative

2214
02:01:58,528 --> 02:02:00,320
Everybody else

2215
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:02,368
And it was it was not

2216
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:04,160
Straight Talk

2217
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,952
The back then there were people who were like a plow

2218
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,232
Really

2219
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:11,072
What these people think I am is a queer

2220
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:12,608
I'm bisexual

2221
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:13,888
For I am

2222
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,424
You know there's there's a

2223
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:16,192
Seahorse

2224
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:19,008
And as time went on

2225
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:20,544
The language expanded

2226
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:24,640
Into Alex's arguments about this idea of like a closes off language

2227
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,968
You think exactly the opposite

2228
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:30,784
I think all it does is expand line

2229
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:32,320
And expands

2230
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:33,600
Our understanding

2231
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:34,368
How people

2232
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:35,392
Experience life

2233
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:41,536
Amazing beautiful thing does not

2234
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:43,072
Shutdown

2235
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:44,096
Language

2236
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:45,376
It expensive

2237
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:47,424
Yeah

2238
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,960
It's a tragedy that

2239
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:49,728
Like

2240
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,520
That he has a

2241
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:52,288
Feeling

2242
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:55,360
You know so much

2243
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:58,176
The tragedy is that like

2244
02:02:58,944 --> 02:03:00,736
He believes the thing joke

2245
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:01,760
Counter to

2246
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:04,064
What the people on the other side

2247
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,088
That he's against

2248
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,624
Are actually saying

2249
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,160
And actually believe

2250
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:13,024
Eminently reasonable

2251
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:13,792
You have

2252
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:16,096
To take an illogical and stupid

2253
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:17,376
Approached

2254
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:18,912
Divested

2255
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:20,448
Yes

2256
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:22,240
Who knows what that

2257
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:23,776
But

2258
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:26,336
Find some more f******

2259
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:28,128
Fortified braces Supply

2260
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,736
California

2261
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:39,648
So real quick what he's talkin about there they arrest you in California there's a law

2262
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,672
The book

2263
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:42,208
And it's about

2264
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:43,232
Consistent

2265
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:48,608
Misgender know people

2266
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:51,936
It's just a it's more about harassment in the workplace

2267
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:53,472
Is not about like

2268
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:57,568
Hey you accidentally call someone by the wrong pronoun you're going to the clink

2269
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:59,360
Or anything like that

2270
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:01,152
Absolute nonsense

2271
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:07,040
And you study eugenics

2272
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:18,304
Hitler Hitler

2273
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:25,728
This is what this is

2274
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:28,544
Rampant misrepresentation of all this

2275
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:33,152
A lot of his will be covered in the endgame

2276
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:39,552
Documentary

2277
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:43,904
Although there is a connection between the early Eugenics movement was not

2278
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,696
Westerly racist eugenics

2279
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:47,744
They became a

2280
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:49,024
Humanist movie

2281
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,072
And that is

2282
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,120
Not at all involved in

2283
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:54,912
Gender issues

2284
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:56,448
But because

2285
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:57,216
Prefixes

2286
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:57,984
Does the sands

2287
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:01,568
Alex gets very confusing really everything

2288
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,616
That's what

2289
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:04,896
That's

2290
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:09,504
We got to walk everywhere. Got to walk everywhere

2291
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:20,512
Brothers

2292
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:22,560
Pro-government

2293
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:25,888
Human development through chemicals to biological to culture

2294
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:28,192
Brainwashing

2295
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:36,384
No it's not

2296
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,992
Like this triggers me

2297
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:42,016
To no extent

2298
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:42,784
But

2299
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:48,160
I don't show anger really much at all right

2300
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:49,184
But

2301
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:50,720
I've noticed

2302
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:51,744
Assholes

2303
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,536
When they're talking

2304
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:56,352
In the middle of their sentences to say okay

2305
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:57,888
They do that

2306
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,168
Okay

2307
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:00,448
In the middle of things

2308
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:06,848
As if they like my god do I say that now I'm terrified I would have terrified of all of my tip

2309
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:13,248
I would have punched you by now.

2310
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:18,880
Like I know I'm an ass-whole

2311
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,976
Is like a rhetorical thing

2312
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:23,744
The people who have

2313
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,512
Nothing

2314
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:27,072
In the middle of sentences in order to be like

2315
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,888
Bucking board board

2316
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:32,704
Yeah you are what I'm talking about

2317
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:37,056
I make it a point here and if you're not okay

2318
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,336
It's just

2319
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:40,640
It's one of the weakest things in the world

2320
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:41,664
The one of the best

2321
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,456
Examples of a we talked about this

2322
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:46,016
Press conference

2323
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,040
Alive show

2324
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:48,320
The

2325
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:53,696
The Larry Sinclair press conference

2326
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:57,536
Like trying to explain away his crimes.

2327
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:05,472
Now that I made that connection like Sarah

2328
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:06,240
Huckabee Sanders

2329
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:07,264
Does that

2330
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:11,616
Condescension

2331
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:13,664
Yeah the rhetorical condescension

2332
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:17,760
After we did that last year

2333
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:19,808
Larry Sinclair

2334
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,112
Is big.

2335

He wasn't alive

2338
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,816

2339
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:38,240

No Ted Anderson

2341
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:43,360
Chinese based in Minnesota

2342
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,152
Chance

2343
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:48,224
Anderson

2344
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:49,760
And

2345
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,040
Reverend

2346
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:54,624

2348
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:56,672
Cuz we got a fine

2349
02:07:57,952 --> 02:07:58,976
I don't think you'd ever talk to us

2350
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:01,792
Probably bored

2351
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,072
He's a rich man

2352
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:04,864
Next episode

2353
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:18,688
That's great news sources it's like that

2354
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:19,968
Rice table

2355
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:22,272
It's not true that they're just showing like

2356
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:24,064
Whatever flashes up on the document

2357
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:26,880
Pedia article or

2358
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:27,648

Eventually he's going to get into the Tavistock ride either homepage

2360
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:33,280
It doesn't prove anything

2361
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:44,544
That has to be what transitional

2362
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:47,872

2363
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:52,992
Is the shelter

2364

What you want who you want to be how long do what you want to do

2365
02:08:58,112 --> 02:08:59,904
It is a very human thing

2366
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:02,976
To be a man and say I want to be a woman

2367
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:07,072
I wish I wish that was all he

2368
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:14,752
Human

2369
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:21,152
Touche I want to be something I want to build something

2370

That's true bundle of rats

2378
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:45,472
Yeah

2379
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:48,544
This is sad like this is

2380
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,312
This is like

2381
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:51,872
It's so

2382
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:52,640

There's a lot of

2391

There's a lot of animals that

2392
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,304
Now that I'm thinking about it change their environment Franks

2393
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,608

Where they want to be 50 different

2396
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:39,232
This woman loves her blender

Artificially made or what is it or does it at rides

2411
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:45,792
You're done right

2412
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:47,072
And that's why

2413
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:50,144
This is a critical area

2414
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,704
Mexican women

2415
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:57,312
Once a thief

2416
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:03,456
This is the total

2417
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:09,856
It's not a choice

2418
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:13,696
Sushi

2419
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:15,232
Force directed

2420
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,584
Here's where my issue comes in with Alex

2421
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,352
Is rhetoric

2422
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:21,376
About like I don't

2423
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:22,400
Alright

2424
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:26,752
Budgie specifically to talk about

2425
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:28,032
I don't need them

2426
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:29,568
Not granted

2427
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:32,128
Very similar to chimeras

2428
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:36,224
It's destroying human race

2429
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:42,624
You can't you can't you can't you can't use this rhetoric you can't use this rhetoric

2430
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:43,648
And this

2431
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:44,416
Analogy

2432
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:45,440
You can't use the

2433
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:47,232
This level of analogy game

2434
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:48,512
I came just be like

2435
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:53,120
Now I'm not comparing them to f****** comparing.

2436
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:56,960
It's not okay

2437
02:12:57,472 --> 02:13:03,616
I think the thing that triggered me about

2438
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:04,384
Hold on

2439
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:06,432
It's not that

2440
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:11,808
Well to be fair again we have

2441
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:13,088
Exhaust

2442
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:15,904
To be fair

2443
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:19,232
Killing it in the chat tonight

2444
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:24,608
Vfw's tailpipe it made me so angry

2445
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:31,008
It house veteran of Foreign Wars

2446
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:32,032
Reading disease

2447
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:34,336
How dare you

2448
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:40,480
0 disease is spread

2449
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:45,088
Buy f****** your car

2450
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:46,368
Not taking vaccine

2451
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:52,512
Or by not using a condom

2452
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:56,096
If any

2453
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:57,120
That's what I heard

2454
02:13:57,376 --> 02:13:58,400
It's alright

2455
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:01,216
There could be some out there

2456
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:02,752
Putlocker

2457
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:06,080
It bums me out and I know what's

2458
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:06,848
Succumb

2459
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:10,176
And so I don't want to I don't want to get

2460
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:11,712
We're at we're at like

2461
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:13,248
Two and a half hours

2462
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:16,576
210

2463
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:21,952
And I promise you that

2464
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:23,232
About to get

2465
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,000
Really bad

2466
02:14:26,048 --> 02:14:28,608
You're back

2467
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:32,448
Interstitial hold music

2468
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:35,008
And forgot to plug my phone back in

2469
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:41,408
So there wasn't much going for the people in the chat room I apologize

2470
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:43,712
Appreciate it so much

2471
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:46,272
Eclipse last

2472
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:49,088
Second clip is I promise you Jordan

2473
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:51,648
Yes literally punchline

2474
02:14:51,904 --> 02:14:53,696
Unfortunately

2475
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:54,720
We got this

2476
02:14:58,048 --> 02:15:00,864
We went to we went to commercial

2477
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:02,656
Without saying

2478
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:05,216
Manufactured nonsense

2479
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:09,056
Like the transphobia is strong

2480
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:10,848
It's very strong

2481
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:14,176
Like Anakin Skywalker

2482
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:14,944
Sports

2483
02:15:15,456 --> 02:15:17,760
We've pointed out a number of things that are low

2484
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:24,160
It gets a bit uglier

2485
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:25,440
In this

2486
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,464
Back from commercial

2487
02:15:27,488 --> 02:15:29,792
So this will be a little bit more difficult to deal with

2488
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:30,560
But

2489
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:35,680
Live there is a

2490
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:36,960
Blitzkrieg

2491
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:39,008
Wife Against The Human Condition

2492
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:42,080
Artificial constructs

2493
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:43,616
Control

2494
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:44,896
Forbes

2495
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:46,176
Reverse engineering

2496
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:47,712
And then for extermination

2497
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:51,296
That is the admission to the Goblet Elon Musk

2498
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:55,904
Not true

2499
02:15:56,672 --> 02:15:58,720
Elon Musk just tweeted

2500
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:00,768
About some guy

2501
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:05,376
You're the last

2502
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:06,656
How to do that

2503
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:10,240
She's a dishy common between kind of know each other in

2504
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:11,776
Probably don't like each other

2505
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,384
Again Whitey's on the

2506
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:19,968
Who demands Humanity be exterminated

2507
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:25,088
Do it

2508
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:29,184
The whole trans movement has nothing to do with

2509
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:30,720
Homosexual man

2510
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,792
It has nothing to do with

2511
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:37,120
Trans people

2512
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:43,264
Sexual

2513
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:45,312
The very debate about

2514
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:48,128
Someone's chromosomes and biological

2515
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:49,664
Easy Legal

2516
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:52,224
Only works

2517
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:55,552
So now when he was a gay lad was a gay day

2518
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:57,600
Appropriate

2519
02:16:58,112 --> 02:16:59,392
From homosexual

2520
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:04,512
Just like no one will say

2521
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:07,584
Caucus

2522
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:11,424
Now that's true no one will say Hawkins

2523
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:13,984
Alex seems to have like a

2524
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:17,312
What I would describe as a warped understanding of

2525
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:18,080
Like words

2526
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:21,920
Appropriate language I don't think

2527
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:25,504
But I don't think that's a

2528
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:26,528
George's Tire

2529
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:28,576
Or heterosexual

2530
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:31,136
Sexual he talks about that like me like

2531
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:34,464
Oh I'm going to say homosexual like

2532
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:45,472
Right right but I don't like I don't like

2533
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:46,240
Any

2534
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:51,616
Gay is bad

2535
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:52,384
Kind of way

2536
02:17:53,664 --> 02:17:56,480
It's not enough

2537
02:17:56,736 --> 02:18:00,576
Call Juju

2538
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:06,976
You know like you are a Jew but you can also say you in a way that is like

2539
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:13,376
From Zoe Sunny Always Sunny episodes

2540
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:18,496
I mean like if somebody's bit before it does come down into

2541
02:18:18,752 --> 02:18:22,848
You know like

2542
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:23,616
90 different

2543
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:29,760
Trans movement

2544
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:36,416
Yeah I was not about

2545
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,696
Constricting language

2546
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:38,976
It's about talking people

2547
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:42,048
Which is the second part of what he said

2548
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:45,120
The trans move it is not about gay people and I was like

2549
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:45,888
Yes

2550
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:52,288
You nailed it bro that's a different thing and then he said the trans movement is not about trans people

2551
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:54,848
You do not understand the transmitter

2552
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:00,224
Language

2553
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:03,552
It just comes down

2554
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:04,576
I think

2555
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:06,112
This same libertarian died

2556
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:07,136
Idea about like

2557
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:08,928
I hate the Civil Rights Act

2558
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:10,720
Because I can't say no blacks

2559
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:11,488
Somaya stabbed

2560
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,560
Or something like that

2561
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:18,144
Can't say I don't want to run that business

2562
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:23,520
Look at the language of like

2563
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:24,800
Desegregation

2564
02:19:25,568 --> 02:19:26,336
D integration

2565
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:27,360
We were against

2566
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:28,128
Integration

2567
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:33,760
They use the same language of like I don't hate the people but I don't like the affected

2568
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:36,320
Has on business right or something like that

2569
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:39,136
Couching these beliefs of like

2570
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:43,232
I love the people they're fine they're great they should be able to do whatever they want but

2571
02:19:43,488 --> 02:19:45,792
It can never be said enough

2572
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:47,072
How unfair

2573
02:19:47,328 --> 02:19:47,840
Popular

2574
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:50,656
Martin Luther King jr. was totally

2575
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:51,424
People

2576
02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:58,336
Hated have killed him

2577
02:19:58,592 --> 02:20:02,432
Yeah exactly

2578
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:10,624
Words like the revision of your history is always going to be here oh he was the best

2579
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:12,160
At the time

2580
02:20:12,672 --> 02:20:13,696
Even people

2581
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:16,256
In the civil rights movement or like

2582
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:17,536
You're moving too fast

2583
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:20,096
Yeah like it always going to be the thing

2584
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:22,400
Realistically I think that we have

2585
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:24,192
Probably a more evolved

2586
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:24,960
Populous

2587
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:26,240
Right now then

2588
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:27,520
You did back then

2589
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:29,568
Like if you look at the numbers

2590
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:31,872
In terms of the people who were active

2591
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:33,920
Civil Rights Movement

2592
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:36,480
Are people who were on board with

2593
02:20:36,736 --> 02:20:38,528
A lot of progressive causes now

2594
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:40,064
I think we probably

2595
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:42,112
Probably have a better

2596
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:47,744
Bulk better percentage of

2597
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,512
Which is

2598

02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:06,944
Feel like it's all right number what it was so I'm not going to speak on it

2602
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:11,808
It's for the show but I can't remember where the Warriors

2603
02:21:13,856 --> 02:21:14,368

I want to change

2605
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:23,584
Modelo beer

You can't

2610
02:21:31,776 --> 02:21:32,288
Name

2611
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:41,504
Hold on

2612

2615
02:21:49,696 --> 02:21:52,000
If you want t.i.

2616
02:21:52,256 --> 02:21:52,768
The scientific name

2617
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:56,864
Homosapien Sapien Negril has I don't know what it would be in Latin

2618
02:21:57,376 --> 02:21:58,400
Here's what I think it would be

2619
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:00,192
Folks

2620
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:01,984
Sure

2621
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:04,544
People

2622
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:20,416
Middle School

2623
02:22:20,672 --> 02:22:21,184
Wellness

2624
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:23,232
But that's what children

2625
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:24,000
Do

2626
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:25,024
They think

2627
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,560
That Niger sound

2628
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:29,120
The adult

2629
02:22:30,656 --> 02:22:31,168
The adult

2630
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:32,704
Confused

2631
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:34,496
Because they're trying to

2632
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:39,360
Geography geography and they know all the countries

2633
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:43,456
The children are the ones who are like

2634
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:44,992
I have it looks like the n word

2635
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:47,552
Cuz I remember I was a kid

2636
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:49,856
Until Alex is like

2637
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:52,416
He's projecting that

2638
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:53,696
Don't

2639
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:55,744
All of this

2640
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:56,768
Is

2641
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,328
Child

2642
02:22:59,584 --> 02:23:00,096
Thoughts

2643
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:01,376
Alex

2644
02:23:02,656 --> 02:23:03,168
Dial

2645
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:05,216
A great everything in his brain

2646
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:07,008
Is not evolve

2647
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:09,824
Fascinating

2648
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:10,848
How this is

2649
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:11,872
We are lying

2650
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:13,152
This episode

2651
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:17,248
You saying

2652
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:18,784
It all goes back to

2653
02:23:20,832 --> 02:23:22,368
Is the keys to

2654
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:23,904
Right that they have

2655
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:26,720
The key is I love him his b******* about reading

2656
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:30,816
When he was younger and not understanding

2657
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:33,376
He still doesn't actually know how to read

2658
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:35,680
I agree

2659
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:38,240
Psychologist

2660
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:40,032
I want to reduce world population

2661
02:23:41,312 --> 02:23:41,824
Sure

2662
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:45,920
Who doesn't

2663
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:50,016
Again he's confusing the Tavistock entail

2664
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:51,552
Tavistock

2665
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:55,904
The plan for transnation Transworld

2666
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:59,488
And once you say

2667
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:00,768
Two children

2668
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:02,560
In the fifth grade

2669
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:04,352
Starting first grade

2670
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:06,144
You're a girl you can be a boy

2671
02:24:06,912 --> 02:24:07,936
Boys be a girl

2672
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:13,824
You can't say boy or girl for someone else

2673
02:24:14,848 --> 02:24:16,128
I'm out I don't even care

2674
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:20,480
This is

2675
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:21,504
This is

2676
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:24,576
Let's move on I mean the reality is like

2677
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:27,648
If people are giving this sort of

2678
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:28,928
Influence to children

2679
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:30,208
It's not

2680
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:30,976
Hey boy

2681
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:34,048
It's more like

2682
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:40,704
Hey you makes it sound like you're walking home from school and there's a guy in a trench coat any opens up

2683
02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:49,920
The penis is like you want you want one of these slugworth

2684
02:24:50,944 --> 02:24:54,528
None yeah it's nonsense I know a number of people

2685
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:56,320
Who

2686
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,344
Come up Tran

2687
02:24:58,112 --> 02:25:01,440
Human-like that's how I said

2688
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:03,488
Their experience

2689
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:06,048
Very different

2690
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:08,352
Write to this idea of

2691
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:12,448
The idea that people made it okay which is

2692
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:13,216
Perhaps

2693
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:13,984
The best

2694
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,520
Rebuttal to

2695
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:16,544
Alex Jones

2696
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:17,312
Argument

2697
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:18,080
About length

2698
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:19,872
The two of us

2699
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:23,968
We both want

2700
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:24,992
Very much

2701
02:25:25,504 --> 02:25:26,528
Be as inclusive

2702
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:28,832
We want our language to be

2703
02:25:29,088 --> 02:25:29,856
Azan

2704
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:30,624
Inclusivism

2705
02:25:31,392 --> 02:25:32,672
And we still fuk up

2706
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:37,024
Because both of us come from such ingrained backgrounds

2707
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:40,352
That a lot of our instinctively that we're not

2708
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:45,728
Like we're not constantly evaluating that whenever we're doing a show like

2709
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:47,520
We don't have

2710
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:49,312
We're just talkin

2711
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:51,360
That is that is not

2712
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:52,640
To say that we are not

2713
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:54,688
Conscious of it or aware of

2714
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:58,784
It is something we're constantly trying to learn

2715
02:25:59,040 --> 02:25:59,552
More about

2716
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:04,928
Well it's a pencil and so if you do say something like that I don't like the way I said

2717
02:26:05,184 --> 02:26:09,024
Come up transfer it is not because you are

2718
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:10,048
Just how it came out of

2719
02:26:10,304 --> 02:26:11,072
Exactly

2720
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:12,864
It's what it's like

2721
02:26:13,632 --> 02:26:15,168
I'm trying to

2722
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:17,472
To accommodate with my language

2723
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:18,240
As well as I can

2724
02:26:20,032 --> 02:26:23,104
And I'm not going to be good at it framing sentence

2725
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:29,760
Alright

2726
02:26:30,272 --> 02:26:30,784
Friends

2727
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:34,368
And bikes.

2728
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:36,160
No one cares if

2729
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:42,560
If you fuk up cuz it comes

2730
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:45,632
It comes down to the difference between good faith

2731
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:46,912
In Bedford

2732
02:26:47,424 --> 02:26:49,216
People only really get mad

2733
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:50,496
If you have

2734
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:54,592
It's comes down to the exact same thing we're talking about earlier with the

2735
02:26:55,104 --> 02:26:56,128
Jay

2736
02:26:56,384 --> 02:27:01,760
Here's stolen it's always sunny

2737
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:08,160
Are we sure are we keeping

2738
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:11,232
That's good

2739
02:27:13,024 --> 02:27:14,560
And there's a there's a market differ

2740
02:27:14,816 --> 02:27:15,328
Prince between

2741
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:16,864
The way you're using the

2742
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,144
The exact same language

2743
02:27:18,912 --> 02:27:19,424
And Alex

2744
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:24,800
He's a seven-year-old he doesn't understand

2745
02:27:33,504 --> 02:27:35,040
It could be very easy for

2746
02:27:35,552 --> 02:27:38,368
I just I do

2747
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:39,648
In function

2748
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:40,416
It's very easy

2749
02:27:40,928 --> 02:27:41,696
Mindset

2750
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:42,720
Be difficult

2751
02:27:43,744 --> 02:27:47,584
It would be a very simple action right but it would take

2752
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,888
Unlearning a lot of things

2753
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:52,960
I grew up in

2754
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:53,984
Such a

2755
02:27:55,008 --> 02:27:56,544
Repressive and

2756
02:27:57,056 --> 02:27:58,080
Colt

2757
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:01,152
So it is

2758
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:03,456
It is something that I am still

2759
02:28:03,968 --> 02:28:06,528
Like I'm 30 years old

2760
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:07,808
And I have spent

2761
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:14,720
20 of it trying not to be the a****** that my family has raised me to be

2762
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:16,000
Not great at it

2763
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:19,328
Hadn't have been raised

2764
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:21,888
You'd still be struggling

2765
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:24,192
Like it's just a

2766
02:28:24,448 --> 02:28:25,472
It's a product of Art

2767
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:26,240
X

2768
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:28,800
It's a product of our evolving

2769
02:28:29,056 --> 02:28:30,336
Understanding

2770
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:31,360
It's

2771
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:32,896
Evolution of empathy

2772
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:36,736
It's something where

2773
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:37,504
We are

2774
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:38,784
We're realizing

2775
02:28:40,064 --> 02:28:41,600
Experience is much deeper and

2776
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:42,368
Much

2777
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:43,136
More

2778
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:47,232
Wire married

2779
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:48,256
Venom

2780
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:49,536
Yeah

2781
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:51,328
The good old days back when America was great

2782
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:54,912
We thought it was much more

2783
02:28:55,168 --> 02:28:58,240
Unipolar or bipolar back then

2784
02:28:58,496 --> 02:28:59,520
And I realize that it's

2785
02:28:59,776 --> 02:29:00,544
Thousand

2786
02:29:01,568 --> 02:29:03,360
I grew up in a town with Five Guys

2787
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:05,152
Like that was that was it

2788
02:29:05,408 --> 02:29:06,176
Burgers

2789
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:08,480
Pretty much Five Guys Burgers and Fries

2790
02:29:08,992 --> 02:29:13,344
Publix

2791
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:16,672
No I grew up in a very very small town and

2792
02:29:16,928 --> 02:29:17,440
The

2793
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:18,464
Experience was

2794
02:29:18,976 --> 02:29:19,744
Very limited

2795
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:20,512
Denso

2796
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:22,560
Even even now after

2797
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:23,840
You know escaping that

2798
02:29:24,352 --> 02:29:28,448
It's still like I'm still learning new things that I am f****** up

2799
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:29,984
Not because I

2800
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:35,104
Existed in place where those things

2801
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:36,128
Even exist

2802
02:29:36,384 --> 02:29:38,176
And God like it's one of those we

2803
02:29:38,432 --> 02:29:39,200
Weird curses

2804
02:29:39,456 --> 02:29:39,968
Cuz you know those like

2805
02:29:40,736 --> 02:29:46,880
May you be like that cursive like may you live in interesting life span

2806
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:49,440
Packers like may you have to learn the whole

2807
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:53,280
It's kind of a curse but of it like it's a

2808
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:54,048
A good purse

2809
02:29:54,304 --> 02:29:56,096
It's always going to be on

2810
02:29:56,608 --> 02:29:58,656
4 bulb

2811
02:29:58,912 --> 02:30:00,448
Always going to be learning

2812
02:30:01,728 --> 02:30:02,496
Let's read

2813
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:05,312
If we're humans are malleable we're not

2814
02:30:05,568 --> 02:30:06,080
Like

2815
02:30:06,592 --> 02:30:07,360
Not like you have to

2816
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:08,896
To be stuck in your ways

2817
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:10,944
If it's

2818
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:12,736
The reality was that like

2819
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:15,040
There were

2820
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:17,344
This movement

2821
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:18,112
Is really trying

2822
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:19,392
And reproduction

2823
02:30:19,648 --> 02:30:20,928
There was some

2824
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:23,232
Actual evidence of that in the

2825
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:24,768
References Al excited

2826
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:26,816
Pretty freaked out about

2827
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:33,984
I would like I feel like we got it we got it we trans identities awesome

2828
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:36,032
I agree

2829
02:30:36,288 --> 02:30:37,056
Need to discuss

2830
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:40,896
The ending of reproduction whatever you like

2831
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:43,456
Anyway let's that's

2832
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:45,760
Let's do it

2833
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:51,392
This whole trans movement is about

2834
02:30:51,648 --> 02:30:52,416
Outline

2835
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:56,768
It's about outlawing male and female

2836
02:30:57,024 --> 02:30:58,048
Chromosome

2837
02:30:59,072 --> 02:31:00,352
Absolute

2838
02:31:01,632 --> 02:31:02,912
He's mixing up sex and gender

2839
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:10,848
Come out like Jordan Peterson

2840
02:31:11,104 --> 02:31:13,408
Biologically were born as this

2841
02:31:13,664 --> 02:31:14,432
Irrelevant

2842
02:31:17,248 --> 02:31:20,576
And now Google Executives just come out in lawsuits and they did that there

2843
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:32,608
What do you say

2844
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,168
Child dragon

2845
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,960
Maybe it's a dragon

2846
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:37,984
Female

2847
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:42,080
Different from a dragon

2848
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:43,104
At which is

2849
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:43,872
Is not a word

2850
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:45,152
Well anyways

2851
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:47,456
If you would like to learn

2852
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:48,480
And Dragonette

2853
02:31:48,992 --> 02:31:50,528
Read Anne McCaffrey

2854
02:31:53,856 --> 02:31:55,136
Peterson in the Bronx

2855
02:31:55,392 --> 02:31:56,160
Some of his shed

2856
02:31:57,440 --> 02:31:57,952
But

2857
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:04,096
This is

2858
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:07,680
I don't care what

2859
02:32:07,936 --> 02:32:08,448
People might

2860
02:32:10,496 --> 02:32:11,264
Weather like

2861
02:32:14,848 --> 02:32:16,128
Hold on a second

2862
02:32:16,384 --> 02:32:20,480
Are you saying that billionaires are f****** assholes who should say

2863
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:23,552
I'm on boy

2864
02:32:24,064 --> 02:32:25,344

02:32:26,368 --> 02:32:26,880
Do desert

2866
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:28,672
I've been too weird like

02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:30,720

I don't care

2870
02:32:34,048 --> 02:32:36,096
This year I'm just over this

2871
02:32:36,608 --> 02:32:38,144
Just so happens that this one might have

2872
02:32:38,912 --> 02:32:39,424
Right

2873
02:32:41,472 --> 02:32:43,008
I'm an expensive building

2874

I have yellow scales

2875
02:32:45,824 --> 02:32:47,616
Everyone does.

2876
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:49,664
You have expensive building

2877
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:57,600
Building

2878
02:32:57,856 --> 02:32:59,136
Ayane Golden Dragon

2879
02:32:59,904 --> 02:33:02,720
They are making you cry

2880
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:11,936
Chromosomes

2881
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:26,016
And then the sky's the limit

2882
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:28,320
And then there's

2883
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:31,648
Psychological warfare technician

That's also

2899
02:34:21,568 --> 02:34:22,080
The very

2900
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:23,360
F****** idea

2901
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:27,456
Cymbeline

2902
02:34:27,968 --> 02:34:28,992
The trans community

2903
02:34:29,248 --> 02:34:29,760
Is

2904
02:34:30,528 --> 02:34:34,368
It's backwards backwards there's no more

2905
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:36,672
Have. Been done

2906
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:37,696
Very clearly

2907
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:39,232
There's no

2908
02:34:40,768 --> 02:34:41,280
Like

2909
02:34:42,304 --> 02:34:43,072
More perfect

2910
02:34:43,584 --> 02:34:45,120
Indictment of the APA

2911
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:46,912
Then trans suicide

2912
02:34:47,936 --> 02:34:49,984
And the way Alex was doing it in the way he's about to

2913
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:51,520
Definition

2914
02:34:57,664 --> 02:35:00,224
Orchid veterans Farmers gay man in the

2915
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:02,272
No

2916
02:35:03,808 --> 02:35:05,344
I have been captured

2917
02:35:10,208 --> 02:35:13,024
And there's dangerous underworld

2918
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:15,328
The people that want abused

2919
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:19,168
Almost every quote trans person

2920
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:31,200
You know it's

2921
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:34,016
That's terrible

2922
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:36,576
That's so terrible

2923
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:38,880
It's kind of amazing

2924
02:35:39,136 --> 02:35:39,648
Sing to me

2925
02:35:40,672 --> 02:35:41,184
That's

2926
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:43,488
For the most part

2927
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:45,280
We took his

2928
02:35:45,792 --> 02:35:46,816
He's monstrosity

2929
02:35:47,328 --> 02:35:48,096
And his language

2930
02:35:48,608 --> 02:35:49,120
So many

2931
02:35:52,704 --> 02:35:53,472
Them

2932
02:35:53,728 --> 02:35:55,264
Every time he brings up

2933
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,544
The trans community

2934
02:35:57,056 --> 02:35:57,824
It is

2935
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:00,384
Unwieldy

2936
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:06,784
You know why every know why every time when we have ever heard him

2937
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:07,808
Him talk about transfer

2938
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:09,088
Houston

2939
02:36:09,344 --> 02:36:11,392
The most offensive thing

2940
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:12,928
Yeah because you can

2941
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:16,768
The Vanguard now in terms of like

2942
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:18,048
It's not

2943
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,584
It's not

2944
02:36:20,352 --> 02:36:21,376
Like socially

2945
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:25,216
Totally unacceptable to say these things

2946
02:36:25,472 --> 02:36:31,616
Right exactly that's why I said the n-word

2947
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:35,968
If he's excited feels like it's okay to say tranny but not the end

2948
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:38,528
Example

2949
02:36:38,784 --> 02:36:39,808
Static document

2950
02:36:40,064 --> 02:36:41,344
If something that like

2951
02:36:41,856 --> 02:36:42,624
15 years

2952
02:36:43,136 --> 02:36:43,904
Even

2953
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:48,512
The Alex 15 years from now will be

2954
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:51,072
When Alex Jones said that word

2955
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:51,840
Yeah

2956
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:56,192
If you really want to get into the reality

2957
02:36:56,704 --> 02:36:57,728
Of the transit

2958
02:36:57,984 --> 02:36:58,496
Experience

2959
02:36:59,264 --> 02:36:59,776
Which

2960
02:37:00,032 --> 02:37:00,800
I don't think I'm

2961
02:37:01,056 --> 02:37:02,080
Fully

2962
02:37:02,336 --> 02:37:03,616
Aware of

2963
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:06,688
And and looked into

2964
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:07,456
To some extent

2965
02:37:07,712 --> 02:37:10,272
High incidence of

2966
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:12,064
Escorting and profit

2967
02:37:12,576 --> 02:37:13,856
4

2968
02:37:15,392 --> 02:37:16,160
And that is

2969
02:37:17,696 --> 02:37:18,208
Not

2970
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:18,976
About

2971
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:23,584
Probably it's it's it is not

2972
02:37:24,096 --> 02:37:26,656
Well it's it's there's no probably about it

2973
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:28,192
It's probably

2974
02:37:29,216 --> 02:37:29,728
Totally

2975
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:31,008
More about

2976
02:37:31,264 --> 02:37:32,544
Runaway

2977
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:33,568
Kids

2978
02:37:34,848 --> 02:37:35,872
Almost 100%

2979
02:37:36,128 --> 02:37:38,944
About

2980
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:39,712
Don't accept

2981
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:42,016
There's a much higher

2982
02:37:42,784 --> 02:37:43,552
Homelessness

2983
02:37:45,344 --> 02:37:45,856
Youth

2984
02:37:46,112 --> 02:37:50,464
Which is one of the reasons why we support the charity we support absolutely

2985
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:53,536
The issue comes down to like

2986
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:55,072
Homeless

2987
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:57,632
Israeli ramp

2988
02:37:58,144 --> 02:37:58,656
And that just

2989
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:00,192
Parcel

2990
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:04,800
With that experience if you want to talk about the totality of the Tramp

2991
02:38:06,848 --> 02:38:07,616
It's not a joke

2992
02:38:08,896 --> 02:38:11,968
That's an embarrassing

2993
02:38:12,736 --> 02:38:13,248
Costings

2994
02:38:14,528 --> 02:38:15,808
Aventa lump in

2995
02:38:16,064 --> 02:38:16,576
The highway

2996
02:38:16,832 --> 02:38:17,344
Suicide

2997
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:19,392
Puzzle

2998
02:38:20,416 --> 02:38:21,696
You're all prostitutes

2999
02:38:21,952 --> 02:38:24,768
You fucken bunch of people everyday and then you grow yourself

3000
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:27,328
That to me is one of the

3001
02:38:27,584 --> 02:38:28,096
Like

3002
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:31,680
That's a terrible

3003
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:33,472
Easy line to

3004
02:38:33,728 --> 02:38:34,240
To draw

3005
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:35,776
Between how

3006
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:37,824
The people who don't belong

3007
02:38:38,592 --> 02:38:39,104
Dominance

3008
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:39,872
Social

3009
02:38:40,128 --> 02:38:40,640
Stratus

3010
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:45,760
Exist with a higher suicide rate than the

3011
02:38:47,296 --> 02:38:49,088
Isn't it such a simple

3012
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:51,392
It's such a simple line to draw

3013
02:38:51,648 --> 02:38:52,160
Of like

3014
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:52,928
Oh

3015
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:55,488
Are you constantly excluded

3016
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,536
Surprise your suicide rate is

3017
02:38:58,048 --> 02:38:59,840
Like it's that simple

3018
02:39:00,352 --> 02:39:01,120
Even like the

3019
02:39:01,376 --> 02:39:01,888
The train speed

3020
02:39:02,144 --> 02:39:03,168
Does it just go back

3021
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:03,936
To another

3022
02:39:05,216 --> 02:39:07,008
Do you like go back to feudal times

3023
02:39:08,288 --> 02:39:09,056
The death rate

3024
02:39:09,824 --> 02:39:15,456
Suicide proper was higher than

3025
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:21,344
It turns out that historic pushed to the side

3026
02:39:21,856 --> 02:39:22,624
Treated like the

3027
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:23,392
The other

3028
02:39:23,904 --> 02:39:25,440
End up with

3029
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:27,488
All of the bad stuff

3030
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:28,256
Right

3031
02:39:28,512 --> 02:39:29,792
And and

3032
02:39:30,048 --> 02:39:31,840
The people who do have all the

3033
02:39:32,352 --> 02:39:33,376
Look at that

3034
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:35,936
What's wrong with them exactly

3035
02:39:38,496 --> 02:39:39,776
Right f****** stupid

3036
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:42,592
Emmett even like we're not

3037
02:39:45,408 --> 02:39:45,920
Just think

3038
02:39:46,944 --> 02:39:48,224
He waffles back and forth

3039
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:48,992
In his language

3040
02:39:50,016 --> 02:39:50,784
Thank you really only

3041
02:39:51,296 --> 02:39:52,576
Villard

3042
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:54,624
People who were born male

3043
02:39:55,136 --> 02:40:00,256
Who are actually in

3044
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:02,560
Other side

3045
02:40:03,072 --> 02:40:03,584
Are men

3046
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:04,608
Right

3047
02:40:05,632 --> 02:40:06,144
Anyway

3048
02:40:06,400 --> 02:40:07,168
It's not important

3049
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:10,496
I just wanted to point that out cuz it seems absent

3050
02:40:10,752 --> 02:40:12,800
The conversation community

3051
02:40:13,056 --> 02:40:14,848
You're at home correct

3052
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:15,616
Totally lost

3053
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:19,456
What's about Lexa

3054
02:40:20,224 --> 02:40:20,736
Western

3055
02:40:21,504 --> 02:40:22,016
It's all just like

3056
02:40:22,528 --> 02:40:23,040
Where you got that from

3057
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:26,112
I think his understanding of

3058
02:40:26,368 --> 02:40:28,672
Community probably a lot of it might come

3059
02:40:28,928 --> 02:40:29,440
From Torrance

3060
02:40:29,696 --> 02:40:32,512
Well I here's here's my

3061
02:40:34,048 --> 02:40:34,816
Analysis

3062
02:40:35,584 --> 02:40:36,864
And it's pretty simple

3063
02:40:37,376 --> 02:40:38,144
When it comes

3064
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:39,424
Two guys like Alex

3065
02:40:40,192 --> 02:40:41,216
It is

3066
02:40:41,472 --> 02:40:42,496
Ultimately like a

3067
02:40:42,752 --> 02:40:43,776
Fear of

3068
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:46,592
Is this lady I'm

3069
02:40:46,848 --> 02:40:47,616
I'm trying to have sex

3070
02:40:49,664 --> 02:40:51,200
So if it's a woman

3071
02:40:51,456 --> 02:40:53,760
Identifies as a man

3072
02:40:54,016 --> 02:40:55,296
And lives her life that way

3073
02:40:56,576 --> 02:40:57,856
He's not trying to have sex with

3074
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:01,184
If it's a man identified so far

3075
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:02,208
Yeah exactly

3076
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:03,488
The man who identifies a

3077
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:04,256
Does a woman

3078
02:41:04,512 --> 02:41:05,536
Then he is

3079
02:41:05,792 --> 02:41:06,560
Terrified

3080
02:41:06,816 --> 02:41:11,680
Is the possibility that he'll choose out of it entirely and now just

3081
02:41:11,936 --> 02:41:12,448
Becomes a train

3082
02:41:13,728 --> 02:41:19,872
Exactly comes transaction about about sexuality becomes a thing where it's like

3083
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:21,152
I can't I can't

3084
02:41:21,408 --> 02:41:21,920
Barter with

3085
02:41:22,688 --> 02:41:23,456
You are not even

3086
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:27,808
It's a purchase in my landscape it's the modern gay panic

3087
02:41:28,064 --> 02:41:32,416
Of like oh no what if I actually want to f***

3088
02:41:32,928 --> 02:41:36,512
The modern it's very classic

3089
02:41:40,352 --> 02:41:41,120
Horribly

3090
02:41:42,656 --> 02:41:43,424
Was that one for

3091
02:41:43,936 --> 02:41:44,704
Nip Tuck

3092
02:41:45,216 --> 02:41:45,728
Show

3093
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:52,384
Watch one episode about it I watch one episode

3094
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:53,920
It is very terrifying

3095
02:41:59,552 --> 02:42:00,064
And in the web

3096
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:03,136
Doesn't wanna discuss that

3097
02:42:03,392 --> 02:42:06,464
Because they're using these people just like Hollywood

3098
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:12,864
He defends Roman Polanski

3099
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:13,888
Because

3100
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:14,912
Pig

3101
02:42:16,704 --> 02:42:18,752
Barriers of family

3102
02:42:20,544 --> 02:42:21,056
Because

3103
02:42:21,312 --> 02:42:21,824
Now

3104
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:22,848
People would have been

3105
02:42:26,688 --> 02:42:28,736
In Illinois just a few weeks ago said I

3106
02:42:28,992 --> 02:42:32,832
Certifies child

3107
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:36,416
Not at all

3108
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:39,744
Really simple

3109
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:41,792
Only thing the courts

3110
02:42:42,816 --> 02:42:44,608
Possibly debating is

3111
02:42:45,632 --> 02:42:47,168
Do we put them in prison

3112
02:42:47,424 --> 02:42:51,264
For life or a hospital for life

3113
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:53,056
You can be dry to be in

3114
02:42:53,312 --> 02:42:55,616
Prison is it's going to be a thing

3115
02:42:55,872 --> 02:42:57,664
Kills himself the first day in prison

3116
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:00,480
I don't know about that

3117
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:03,552
Yeah whatever it's not like it's not like

3118
02:43:03,808 --> 02:43:05,344
It's not like quartz or debating

3119
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:06,112
Huh

3120
02:43:06,368 --> 02:43:06,880
This guy thinks he's

3121
02:43:07,136 --> 02:43:07,648
Is it trout

3122
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:12,512
No one is having that conversation except Alex

3123
02:43:12,768 --> 02:43:15,584
The only person who's having that conversation

3124
02:43:17,632 --> 02:43:19,936
Just say you're a little boy it's okay

3125
02:43:20,704 --> 02:43:22,496
Semantical games

3126
02:43:30,944 --> 02:43:34,272
You are one hundred percent for homosexual

3127
02:43:35,296 --> 02:43:35,808
F*** you

3128
02:43:38,112 --> 02:43:42,720
Homo genius

3129
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:46,560
You write f*** you right terms of

3130
02:43:46,816 --> 02:43:47,328
The definition

3131
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:49,632
He's wrong terms of the

3132
02:43:49,888 --> 02:43:50,656
Interpretation of like

3133
02:43:51,168 --> 02:43:54,240
No one's mad about the word homosexual

3134
02:43:54,496 --> 02:43:55,264
Your projector

3135
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:56,544
Sing this on to yourself because

3136
02:43:56,800 --> 02:43:58,592
Cuz if the safe thing to complain about

3137
02:43:58,848 --> 02:43:59,616
It's fake

3138
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:04,224
But it's safe for you to complain about that I have your f****** dumbass listeners

3139
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:05,248
In The Sticks

3140
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:08,064
Don't have any idea of what the real conversation

3141
02:44:09,344 --> 02:44:11,648
You'll never have someone on your show Alex

3142
02:44:11,904 --> 02:44:12,928
Who actually ever

3143
02:44:13,184 --> 02:44:14,720
Grasp of the issues

3144
02:44:14,976 --> 02:44:16,768
They'll just be more Russian propaganda

3145
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:26,496
But it becomes this whole idea to make people victims

3146
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:32,384
Including I want to put Drano in my eyes I'm blind

3147
02:44:35,456 --> 02:44:37,760
You are blinded to Stafford way off

3148
02:44:38,016 --> 02:44:41,088
It's not abuse

3149
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:45,440
Music

3150
02:44:45,696 --> 02:44:47,232
Blind because they identify

3151
02:44:47,744 --> 02:44:48,512
As a purple penguin

3152
02:44:49,024 --> 02:44:54,144
HK416

3153
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:56,960
Purple Penguin

3154
02:44:57,472 --> 02:44:59,520
Science fiction book

3155
02:45:00,032 --> 02:45:00,800
Who would come up

3156
02:45:01,056 --> 02:45:01,824
Something like this

3157
02:45:07,968 --> 02:45:11,808
Trans is good lower population actually

3158
02:45:12,064 --> 02:45:13,088
Oh it's so good

3159
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:16,928
Your mother or father a boy or girl

3160
02:45:17,184 --> 02:45:18,976
Because

3161
02:45:20,768 --> 02:45:25,632
You're okay I'm out

3162
02:45:27,424 --> 02:45:29,472
Are you done yet

3163
02:45:31,008 --> 02:45:32,288
To anything

3164
02:45:33,056 --> 02:45:33,568
Anyting

3165
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:35,360
Dragon

3166
02:45:36,384 --> 02:45:37,408
Adult dragon

3167
02:45:48,928 --> 02:45:50,976
Using these poor people as a victim

3168
02:45:51,744 --> 02:45:52,256
F*** you

3169
02:45:53,024 --> 02:45:55,072
Communities abusers

3170
02:45:55,328 --> 02:45:59,936
Or heterosexual and homosexual

3171
02:46:01,984 --> 02:46:07,359
The whole thing there's the last 16 minutes of audio that we played over whatever

3172
02:46:07,615 --> 02:46:08,639
Time to talk

3173
02:46:09,151 --> 02:46:09,663

Transphobic rant

3178
02:46:17,599 --> 02:46:19,903
That I like the people

3179
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:21,695
But they're going to destroy the species

3180
02:46:22,207 --> 02:46:22,975
They're f******

3181
02:46:23,231 --> 02:46:27,583
Stupid and everyone is just enabling abusing them

3182
02:46:28,351 --> 02:46:29,375
Listen

3183
02:46:29,631 --> 02:46:30,655
God loves gape

3184
02:46:31,423 --> 02:46:31,935
But he hates

3185
02:46:32,959 --> 02:46:34,751
Re-ride loves

3186
02:46:35,263 --> 02:46:39,871
God

3187
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:45,503

Cuz I have one more clip

3189
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:54,207
After all of this

3190
02:46:54,975 --> 02:46:55,487
That is

3191
02:46:56,255 --> 02:46:57,535
Justice vintage

3192
02:46:57,791 --> 02:46:59,839
I'm glad closes

3193
02:47:00,095 --> 02:47:03,423
At least that's actually closes talking about Donald Trump

3194
02:47:08,287 --> 02:47:09,311
No no

3195
02:47:09,567 --> 02:47:10,079
He's like

3196
02:47:10,335 --> 02:47:14,687
He's like a dog

3197
02:47:16,479 --> 02:47:17,503
Like one of those dogs that

3198
02:47:18,527 --> 02:47:20,063
What's that

3199
02:47:20,575 --> 02:47:21,087
Bernard

3200
02:47:23,391 --> 02:47:24,415
Nope that's already closed

3201
02:47:24,671 --> 02:47:26,207

3202
02:47:26,975 --> 02:47:27,999
Navigate to that close

3203
02:47:29,535 --> 02:47:30,047
Vintage

3204
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:30,815
Go fuc

3205
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:32,095
Yourself Alex Jones

3206
02:47:36,703 --> 02:47:38,495
Been around the block

3207
02:47:43,103 --> 02:47:43,615
And

3208
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:46,431
I could have sex with most beautiful women Hollywood

3209
02:47:46,687 --> 02:47:48,479
Forget it you know why

3210
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:51,039
Every time they didn't have a soul

3211
02:47:51,551 --> 02:47:52,831
I couldn't get attracted to him

3212
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:54,111
Because it was all fake

3213
02:47:54,879 --> 02:47:56,927
Let me tell you something

3214
02:47:57,183 --> 02:48:00,255
These people have no souls they're not happy it was it was bad stuff

3215
02:48:01,023 --> 02:48:01,535
Great

3216
02:48:01,791 --> 02:48:03,839
Great so f****** you is bad stuff

3217
02:48:04,095 --> 02:48:08,959
No apparently it's in the hot cuz they would have been thrilled to do that

3218
02:48:09,471 --> 02:48:10,751
So f****** it would be good stuff

3219
02:48:11,519 --> 02:48:15,615
Wait so the reason they didn't f*** him was because they don't have dolls

3220
02:48:16,127 --> 02:48:17,919
Yet know that's why he wouldn't f*** them

3221
02:48:19,199 --> 02:48:22,015
What so I'm Alex Jones your Angelina Jolie

3222
02:48:22,783 --> 02:48:23,295
Hey

3223
02:48:25,855 --> 02:48:26,879
Pretty good you want to have sex

3224
02:48:32,255 --> 02:48:38,399
No I don't want to have sex with you offering

3225
02:48:38,911 --> 02:48:42,495
Where do I get a note

3226
02:48:42,751 --> 02:48:48,895
I have your glove life maybe we should have a larger

3227
02:48:55,807 --> 02:48:56,319
Exactly

3228
02:48:56,575 --> 02:48:58,367
I would say that judging someone is

3229
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:00,415
Having no souls Bangla judging

3230
02:49:00,927 --> 02:49:01,439
Tired

3231
02:49:03,743 --> 02:49:09,887
So probably indicates more about you than other people you're judging

3232
02:49:10,143 --> 02:49:14,495
What a piece of s***

3233
02:49:14,751 --> 02:49:19,615
And again

3234
02:49:20,127 --> 02:49:21,407
Hours ago but

3235
02:49:21,663 --> 02:49:22,943
There is a great

3236
02:49:23,199 --> 02:49:25,503
Article everyone needs to put that out if they can

3237
02:49:25,759 --> 02:49:31,903
And if you're going to book or Twitter and you can push this out to more people it is in Port

3238
02:49:32,159 --> 02:49:34,207
Is that more people understand that Alex Jones is

3239
02:49:34,463 --> 02:49:35,999
Probably committing a crime

3240
02:49:37,023 --> 02:49:37,791

3241
02:49:39,327 --> 02:49:40,863

02:51:19,679 --> 02:51:20,191
Implied
