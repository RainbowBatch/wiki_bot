00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,336
A little bit about

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,920
Jordan

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,224
What is your favorite

5
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,760
My favorite what do you mean

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,528
Do you know

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:27,392
Like a little trinket

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,952
Souvenir stores in bought one and had

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
The rest of your life you know

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
I got you the little nope nope

11
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,544
Or something like that nope

12
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,200
Oh yeah I mean the closest thing to that is when I was in Austin

13
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,736
We went to just

14
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,528
Some sort of a vintage shopping

15
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320
Ran into a guy who

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
Fixes old radios

17
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,512
I got sold like a really old radio that looks fuckingawesome

18
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,608
I want you to have some sort of like

19
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,360
He got married wedding party

20
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
And he made a little those Funko doll outside of all of the people who were in The

21
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
Cherish

22
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
Really cool

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,512
Have you ever been in those stores

24
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,072
It's never appealed to me

25
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Okay

26
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,680
I don't know I mean I guess probably cuz they spent so much time growing up in Hawaii

27
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,984
And there's so many like touristy things

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
Obviously tourism

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Huge part of the

30
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
The industry

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
Local economy

32
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
And so it always appears

33
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Stupid

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
These are the f****** people who are

35
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
Just coming into enjoying our beach

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,440
Bratz lyrics

37
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,376
Confrontational but I think we're good

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,544
The cute seem to not believe that I'm not

39
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,224
No I don't think I do we're flying to your parents house I bet I could find some

40
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
Maybe actually know I've been in your parents house I don't I don't even know if they have it

41
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,208
Hello Kylie.

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,048
I was just there not too long ago and I didn't recognize much of anything

43
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:47,936
There

44
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,360
You don't know much better

45
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
The old past

46
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
We're back

47
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,016
2012 take a look

48
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,624
January 23rd

49
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,976
How Alex responded

50
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
The aftermath

51
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Sandy Hook

52
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
Before we get Today Show

53
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Like take a little moment

54
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
Out of our time

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,472
North Florida Gun Show

56
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,800

Just old

60
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
No

61
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
I thought it might be knowing

62
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
But then I realized that the last name is also

63
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
No thanks but thanks

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312

No thanks

66
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
Both Worlds

67
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
Anyway

68
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,248
No thanks

69
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
Somebody

70
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,631
It also very much

71
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:30,079
Don't get mad and tell your brother someone sodomites a bucket of poop

72
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
Jesus Christ

73
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
Thank you so much. Thank you very much

74
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
For sure we would appreciate

75
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Little

76
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,687
Dangerous

77
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
Out of whack

78
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
Things you don't expect the pop-up become

79
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
We're here

80
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Fort Worth

81
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
13

82
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
Post-sandy hook business

83
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,887
Appropriate

84
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
Probably scream

85
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
At their phone

86
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
If we didn't

87
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
Bring up the fact that This American Life

88
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Just did there

89
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
A piece

90
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
Two segments

91
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,247
And a lot of people have asked

92
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
You gave it a listen

93
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
We're your first day

94
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
Oh Alex is lying people who remember him they didn't like

95
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
Yeah

96
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,911
Yeah I think I think

97
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
I think so I think I was probably

98
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,847
Some of the most essential pieces of the coverage I think you've covered

99
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,919
Up first-half about Sandy Hook

100
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,575
In terms of hearing to use struggle

101
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,647
3

102
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Perspective

103
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
That hold the whole situation

104
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Have you started narratives that are brought in

105
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
The world the actual

106
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
First-person damn

107
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
Well I mean you kind of

108
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
Maybe not intentionally

109
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
Somewhat subconscious

110
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
Justly go out of your way not to

111
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Because

112
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
You know

113
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,967
Like hypothetically

114
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
So monster

115
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
To then have it brought

116
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
The real world and it's

117
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
Stark truth

118
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Is kind of heartbreaking

119
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Listening to

120
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
Truly

121
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,511
How can somebody

122
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,631
Do this right unaware of the effect

123
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,191
Did they have

124
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Horrible things

125
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,335
Yeah that's kind of in the realm of

126
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
We've talked about this

127
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
These things kind

128
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
You know

129
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,967
In terms of the information base of our podcast

130
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
No that's not

131
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
New

132
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
At the end

133
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,159
Where is Alex's origin story

134
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Really

135
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
F***** up

136
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Oh yeah

137
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
Journalism that we couldn't do

138
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
The idea of going in finding

139
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
These people that Alex

140
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,983
Yeah the idea of like

141
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
Alex has one story

142
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
Five other people have

143
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
Hundred percent

144
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,367
My favorite guy was the the guy who

145
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Who found out that

146
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,695
Entrup love each other uses like

147
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
I don't know if I want to

148
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,071
The guy who is Alex beat the s*** out of

149
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
Almost killed

150
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,935
Yeah I mean exist stories that

151
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,775
The people from his school Tell match up pretty well with some of the

152
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
Hero Stories that Alex has

153
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
Just without the Alex

154
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Picton Park

155
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
To justify

156
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
Impeding

157
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Fleetmaster

158
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,831
Also the idea of him running around the school

159
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
Matches up almost entirely with Alex

160
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,487
I got lured into

161
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Even a lot of that stuff

162
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
Isn't really new to our

163
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
During the people who lie

164
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Threatened

165
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
When he was younger and stuff like that

166
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
The thing that rang the most true was when

167
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
Woman Within

168
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
Talking about Holly

169
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Describing

170
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
All the way

171
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Would threaten her with

172
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
And it was like

173
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:03,487
Cast I have you ever heard his about what the globalist

174
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,351
Will do to you they'll take you down and right

175
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
When she said that I was like you didn't like listen to his show to know that that's a big

176
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
Part of his performance still his

177
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
True from those people

178
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,247
From Justice

179
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
We've been able to get a

180
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
From looking at him

181
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
It was

182
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,791
Awful it was awful

183
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
It just makes you realize that there's no point where you're going to come up with VP

184
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Right

185
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
Hey you got me

186
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
There's never going to end your job

187
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Ronson

188
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,807
Who did a very good job on the PC

189
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
He's like

190
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,647
And let me tell you that I am not going to stay.

191
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
If I was good at it

192
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
But

193
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
While he was talking to Alex

194
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,911
I told him the story of how Alex is a huge Apple Alex turns around

195
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
I've never been an hour

196
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
For your own

197
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
Brightright

198
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455
Alex has always known that Jon Ronson ism

199
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:32,319
Media figure like he came into his life as a reporter right along with him

200
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:37,439
Covering him for a peace always

201
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Be nice to him

202
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Eunos

203
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,095
Platform to be like Alex

204
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,167
Beat the s*** out of paper

205
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,751
I was never in his best interest to be addicted

206
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,799
Of course not

207
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Haven't I always

208
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,943
Ben strategic about our relationship

209
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,503
Also Alex

210
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
We all know the truth

211
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
I thought it was

212
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Insight

213
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
You know tough but if it's

214
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Same time

215
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
You know

216
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,631
Proof that there is no positive outcome

217
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
Who is

218
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Nomad for a while

219
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,455
Demonstrative

220
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
On NPR

221
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,575
Reaffirming of our like

222
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,903
Our instincts are too bad

223
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,559
I think after 2 years of listening to the got a pretty good idea of what

224
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
2013

225
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,519
How much transition

226
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Away from talking about

227
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
At all

228
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
All just gun paranoia they're coming to get your guns

229
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
Going to start a civil war

230
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Baby boo

231
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,039
Uno's

232
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,647
Maybe you know but first we ever out of context drop

233
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
Propaganda

234
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Redial

235
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:27,263
What could you be clearer about immediately

236
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
It's propaganda

237
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
See now you're not being clear about terms

238
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
He'll explain it later but

239
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
Fink

240
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
That's actually what it mean

241
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,927
So we're going to listen to

242
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,743
To enter into

243
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Obsession

244
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
On this episode

245
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
I think someone is recently

246
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
Explains that gaslighting is

247
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Nothing

248
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,775
Idea

249
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
He talks about it

250
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
For almost the entire show

251
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,391
Name for what I do it's very weird

252
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,535
But I was listening through this

253
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
The show The Middle

254
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
Keep talking about gaslighting

255
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
So I pulled the clips

256
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
Specifically just to illustrate like

257
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:33,055
Alex is aware of what gaslighting

258
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
But as this goes on it just

259
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
God it's so bad

260
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
Because I have the definitions in the history of gaslighting

261
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
Call charm

262
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
Just one time.

263
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
Define gaslighting

264
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,711
You walk in

265
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
And because of the

266
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:37,311
I got another example telling people that you never said that

267
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,151
The constantly telling people while there's evidence

268
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
Extreme version of gaslighting

269
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,855
But you carried out and perpetuated on the This American Life episode

270
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,719
Is the next clip him being like better example

271
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,815
Play clips from my show yesterday my catalog

272
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
Basically just explains it like that

273
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,215
It says that it's a trick that the globalist

274
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,031
Because of TV never being dumb or whatever

275
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
It works more

276
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,895
Messages or whatever so

277
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
You can't cover

278
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
Story

279
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
Starts talking about how a Morgan suck

280
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
Evergreen Terrace

281
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,183
Alex has started a petition

282
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:31,583
To get him deported as we know from our previous episode

283
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,167
Piers Morgan has to be on his show

284
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,311
Godwin we didn't episode about the actual interview

285
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
Of January

286
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
Alex on the 3rd

287
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:50,271
He's very aware any in his next life you can tell he's clearly

288
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
He's mostly doing this for Pueblo

289
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
Morgan

290
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:18,687
Sound right

291
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
To try to get some

292
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,719
Operation

293
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,303
New York and Los Angeles

294
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Is that cats like

295
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
Is that

296
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:44,031
Did the post if they broke that story

297
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,455
Yeah I find that might have been for a Time

298
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,855
Recognizing exactly what he's going to bring to Piers Morgan show

299
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,183
Be a big thing because we're

300
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
Heaven is going to be clips of it everywhere

301
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,815
Describing Pierce's Morgan

302
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Does being like

303
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
He's going to have that fights tickets

304
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:16,543
Motive

305
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Bright

306
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
The transparent

307
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Motive

308
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,759
The Illinois State

309
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,087
At this point is considering a bill

310
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,207
How's it going

311
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Has heeded the warnings

312
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
Core and

313
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
Covers the story

314
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Perhaps the most

315
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,935
Ouija

316
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
Looks like

317
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,711
Turner's semi-auto

318
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,479
Like you do with all other is no moderate Islam all Islam inside

319
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,319
What are we going to what are we playing this game

320
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:37,695
Stream idiolect Illinois

321
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,303
And then they're going to let you know when they won't turn in their guns

322
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,119
I mean this is just I can't

323
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
Simulation of that extreme

324
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Gun grab paranoia

325
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
Not not not with you

326
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
But not with his ID

327
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
Hey once Illinois

328
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,711
Outlaws everything but Bowl tax

329
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
Right then you know North Carolina

330
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,343
Because North Carolina does everything that Illinois.

331
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,463
And what's North Carolina's so goes the south Florida

332
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,327
We all know California is

333
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
Ripped away from the United

334
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:23,007
States by Massive earthquake

335
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,895
In the next hour

336
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Is an ounce

337
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,807
There's going to be checkpoints permanent all over the place

338
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:44,255
Machine Gun Nest

339
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Terminus

340
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,239
Checkpoints

341
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Martial law

342
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,767
Fallujah

343
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
7 years on

344
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:25,983
You know I wouldn't to the Machine Gun Nest checkpoints in Fallujah control in the United States

345
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,311
Afraid afraid

346
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:35,711
The Berlin Wall over every Highway every hundred

347
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
Miles will be

348
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Giant

349
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
Yeah

350
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,671
I think Cliff is only worthwhile to demonstrate like how stupid

351
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,951
So much of the stuff

352
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,255
He says around

353
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,815
Cockamamie nonsense

354
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,375
The very idea of it

355
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,911
And that the mainstream media

356
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
Announcing

357
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,031
These checkpoints

358
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
It's absurd

359
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
And the way that used

360
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,919
Announcing rather than reporting

361
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,991
So is touch one of those small symbols of

362
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,831
A year f****** full of s*** because yours

363
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
State mouth

364
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
The government

365
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,560
Who told them to announce the rollout

366
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Play bazzi

367
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
Media covering the stuff in announcing

368
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,104
Announce announce its from there into like

369
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,920
Justifying a ton of news stories

370
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
An apocryphal stories

371
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
But he's been told by either

372
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
His coworkers

373
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
Or people who know his coworkers

374
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
Which is even more flimsy than making up news stories

375
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,048
Yes and this one is about

376
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,632
Employees girlfriend getting pulled over by the police

377
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,680
I don't believe most of the story

378
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
Girlfriend

379
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,136
Is a turn signal

380
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
Night

381
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Number three

382
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,016
I just don't even know what to say anymore

383
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,392
Number three

384
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,696
Number one Hey listen

385
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:01,120
I don't use any of the cartels

386
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,912
Bright number 2

387
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,984
Drink-drive what am I

388
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:10,336
Don't look at the backseat there's a lot of open bottles of wild turkey

389
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,432
Three future and watch some of my live streams right

390
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,992
Appear to be quite drunk while driving an automobile

391
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,280
I mean it's weird because he's telling the story about Darren mcbreen's girlfriend in life

392
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:36,192
I mean if that did happen maybe she did swerve or something like that I don't know or I'm also willing to believe that it

393
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
It was over

394
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:43,360
Frisch's cop that was trying to meet a quota

395
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
You know acting

396
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
A little bit overzealous light

397
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,504
Alex

398
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
2 p.m.

399
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
I am also

400
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:59,232
Well you're almost like

401
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
He said the same thing

402
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,376
Alex is telling a story about somebody else realizes I don't have a full grasp

403
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:09,472
The detail don't really know the story very well I don't listen to

404
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
My better make is about myself

405
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,800
Cuz I can like myself

406
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,640
I got three points I forgot the third one

407
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
I don't even know what to do

408
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Cool

409
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
This next clip is just

410
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
An expression of the

411
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,856
The extremist

412
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
But he is

413
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Putting into

414
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
Broderick around this time

415
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
Is it a Mountain Dew commercial

416
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,048
8 boards

417
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
Let me live wire.

418
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,168
Come close

419
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
Closest ER

420
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,544
Earlier you saying that the Illinois state senate

421
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,104
Going to pass this bill and then they're going to be shooting gun owners in

422
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
To do whenever one well

423
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Say hooray

424
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
Well I'll be having a great old as an image into your listeners Minds based on

425
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,368
You know that is pretty f***** up

426
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
Because it will catalyze the reaction in some way

427
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,744
Weather

428
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,536
Is another Quest

429
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
But you can't control that

430
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
You can't control how your audience responds

431
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
Extreme message

432
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
You're putting out

433
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
That's irresponsible

434
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
Does Mexico play

435
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
I think is even worse

436
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Because

437
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
It's not about what somebody

438
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
Going to do

439
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
It's what they're already

440
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,296
So you understand if you listen to this clip

441
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
It's not

442
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
Illinois

443
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,160
State Senate banning guns or anything like that

444
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
We're already at the

445
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
Be killing these blah blah

446
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
Right we're past that

447
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:41,888
And that is expressed in the patriotism but they're already

448
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:48,288
Killing you

449
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,568
Talking about John P holdren book

450
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
Eco science

451
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,712
He's not talking about like advocating for

452
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
We should or saying that

453
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Eplan

454
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,856
To put sterilants in the water and stuff like that

455
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,672
It is a textbook about ecoscience

456
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,232
Yeah

457
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
There are things are like

458
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,304
People have said

459
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
This is an option

460
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,888
It's not discussed a deposit

461
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
Relevant context

462
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,056
Leads you to believe that

463
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,616
It is not a good idea

464
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
So

465
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
It's just bulshit he's taken out of context Passage

466
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
Just from textbooks

467
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
But he hasn't read the entirety of

468
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
I mean like

469
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
This is happening

470
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
They're killing us already

471
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
Like if you hear that sort of thing

472
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
You actually believed him

473
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Why wouldn't

474
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Makeup

475
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,768
F****** Splinter Cell

476
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,584
Why wouldn't you form a terrorist group against the government

477
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
They're trying to

478
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,472
But yeah after that

479
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
No it's a man has always been battling the shores dad's true

480
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,664
What's the difference

481
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,688
I meant

482
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,224
Will you take this as read a lot of

483
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
The time

484
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Looking back

485
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
. we're like

486
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
Tensions are really high

487
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
In the country

488
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
In the aftermath

489
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
And there was that gun

490
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,976
Discussion that's going on about like

491
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Jesus's

492
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
It's f***** up that this

493
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,912
It's happened before we know it's going to happen again

494
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,472
Tensions are high

495
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,896
Middle-of-the-road Arguments for being against

496
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
Gun control

497
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
Some people have middle-of-the-road argument

498
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
4 gun

499
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,296
Some people of impassioned Arguments for gun

500
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,600
Some people like Alex

501
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
Impassioned argument

502
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
Gun control

503
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
And when you're in that

504
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
That's sort of

505
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
Temp space

506
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
Bringing in stuff like this

507
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
Really

508
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
Really of danger

509
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
Because you

510
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
You introduce an idea of a Nexus 10

511
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,984
Threat that's outside of that discussion

512
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,520
Yeah and it's

513
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:32,128
I don't know I just put myself in the head space with someone who actually believe

514
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
That's what he said

515
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
I don't know how I would

516
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
Make a bomb or some

517
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,856
All his listeners would do that right

518
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
It doesn't seem like a far cry from what

519
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
He's hoping someone

520
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
First

521
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
It is kind of a tacit

522
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,632
Acknowledgement

523
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
From his listeners

524
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
None of what he's saying is

525
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
Is actually

526
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,800
True in that we don't see a s*** ton of these

527
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,384
Wars started you know like

528
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,480
There could be a lot of people like

529
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,016
Go to steps into trying

530
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
Plan something

531
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Ornaments

532
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,184
I don't mean this in a bad way cuz I'm glad

533
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,464
It could possibly be

534
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:22,048
Maybe a lot of them were cowards

535
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,352
Maybe there are a lot of people who do believe

536
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
Don't have the

537
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Whatever

538
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
It would be that way

539
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,080
45% of his listeners are too cowardly to build

540
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,152
45% a Eva's listeners

541
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,944
I've tried to build a bomb

542
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,504
And started about how I stopped about halfway

543
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:46,368
And then the final 10% have probably gone to a pizza place and shut up

544
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
Space on your tablet

545
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,376
I found I found an all too much

546
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,656
Search McCobb humor in

547
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
When he says that America's

548
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
Do the most f*****-up

549
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
Because of all the

550
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,824
Like immediately after

551
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
Sandy Hook

552
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,896
There's a double entendre there

553
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,992
Huntingtown

554
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
Agreed

555
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,256
That's

556
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
Piece of decoration on your

557
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,936
We get back now Alex tells another story that I

558
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
Think is accurate

559
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,008
About another one of his employees

560
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Having a run-in with

561
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
The police

562
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Shout

563
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
Christmas

564
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,344
Yeah I think there's some details missing from that story

565
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
I think there's a

566
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
Modifier Miss

567
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
Missing between

568
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,560
Wi to

569
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,352
They want to stick needles in

570
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,960
What do you talk about is that there are some

571
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,688
Refuse take a breathalyzer

572
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
Refuse to do the test

573
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
Then they came

574
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,784
Force you to give blood

575
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,856
Part of the reason for that

576
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,928
That it will maintain it will retain as evidence

577
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976
Whatever and you have not

578
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
If they have a reasonable suspicion that you're drunk

579
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Timestamp

580
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,168
Yeah don't do that

581
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,008
Because I think the police had a long enough time we're drunk drivers

582
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:16,640
Kind of realized they could work things out and their blood alcohol content

583
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
Before they can do any kind of test

584
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
There is no

585
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,504
The proof of

586
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
The underlying

587
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,600
I'm not saying it's a good thing

588
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:30,464
But that's the rationale for why they do it

589
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,024
I don't know what's going on

590
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
The story about his employee

591
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
But I don't believe

592
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,632
Story

593
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,424
Know if I understand correctly

594
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
She was driving

595
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,776
There are people in the car may have been drunk

596
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
Who may have been drunk

597
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
May not have been drunk

598
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
Will never know

599
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
While she was driving

600
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:53,248
Herself completely sober driving complete

601
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,296
No red flags

602
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,088
They are pulled over by the cops

603
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
The cops go in there

604
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:02,720
And they charge they say out loud they're charging

605
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,536
Who are not driving with a DWI

606
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,888
I think it's the only way

607
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,216
But don't

608
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,496
The people who were in the car with

609
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
Really f***** up

610
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
And then the police were like

611
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
We got to

612
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,896
You know somebody's got to do something there's so much

613
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
Smell whiskey

614
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:28,064
Flashlight

615
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
And she gets really from dads

616
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
We need to take you

617
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Station

618
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
Give you a breathalyzer

619
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,400
Charged

620
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Why

621
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
But there's no way that

622
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,984
The story makes sense

623
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,520
But you can end up

624
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,592
Like with the police

625
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
If you don't

626
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,896
I'm not

627
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,528
I don't necessarily notorious for

628
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Just dropping stuff

629
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,392
That's not really what I mean

630
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:07,232
Notorious for doing that

631
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
Okay we're going to have to

632
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
Come on

633
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,984
If you're pulled over for DUI and you're not

634
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Drunk

635
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
You're not going to end

636
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Getting truck

637
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:27,200
Unless you're addicted weekdays you might want

638
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
Got pulled over for

639
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
Brother

640
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:38,720
Do then

641
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,592
Yes they were not because the underlying charge wasn't real.

642
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
The cops

643
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,712
I wish we lived in that world fight

644
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
We don't so

645
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,880
Bright earlier brought up the idea of

646
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
These checks

647
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,952
Set up

648
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,816
Great

649
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,864
Piece of news to back it up some

650
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:28,128
Trevino

651
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,200
San Antonio Express-News reports

652
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,528
Officers

653
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
I'm driving

654
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
That's something

655
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:09,856
He's pretending he's reading an article about how is put into place

656
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,160
The next step after this without it

657
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,232
Is Machine Gun protected Fallujah style blockade

658
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,768
Problem is

659
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,096
This article is quoting from is about

660
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,144
Police Department asking for permission

661
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
Sobriety checkpoints

662
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,008
It has no indication that they got permission to do it

663
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,384
Also the local story out of San Antonio includes a ton of information that Alex

664
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
He forgets dementia

665
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
Reporting

666
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:39,040
For instance as of 2012 texts one of only 12 country

667
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
They didn't offer

668
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,368
Police Department's the option of setting up to you I checked

669
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:48,000
Texas consistently at the top of the rankings for most drunk driving related

670
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,816
And most drunk driving related deaths

671
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
I don't think

672
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
Things are related at all

673
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:57,728
It's a hugely popular state so it doesn't generally come in at number one on those list

674
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
That that breakdown

675
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
Fatality rate

676
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,080
100000

677
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:07,456
It's right pretty much all the time is Wyoming

678
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
Also doesn't allowed

679
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,272
Conductor you I check

680
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:17,440
The US Supreme Court has decided the checkpoints are constitutionally allowed provided that they serve

681
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,488
Put in a requisition for your

682
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
Machine gun

683
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
True

684
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
Has to be paperwork

685
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:28,704
Those the absolute right to decide that whether or not

686
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984
Adductors checkpoint

687
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,520
Within the state borders

688
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
And Texas

689
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
However

690
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,944
That doesn't stop them from checking up setting up checkpoints near the

691
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,808
Not on the border but near the border trying to catch undocumented immigrants

692
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,088
In September twenty

693
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,160
An article in the Houston Chronicle from December to

694
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
13 discusses

695
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
DPS

696
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:56,096
Hoping their use of checkpoints in the Rio Grande Valley where they were being

697
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
People's immigration status

698
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,168
Which would be against Texas law

699
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,216
The police department claimed that they had

700
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
Completely different

701
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,776
Very legitimate law enforcement

702
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,104
To which they were told you got to stop

703
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
I will be very

704
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,176
Route to take on this

705
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
My gut tells me he was

706
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
Super camps

707
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
I imagine

708
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,552
Kind of ignored it

709
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Maybe not a store

710
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,328
But whatever the case

711
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,888
Antonio what is the set-up whenever setup

712
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,520
For more than a decade the legislature has rejected proposals to allow a roadside checkpoint

713
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,312
Which typically Target drunk driver

714
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
During the last legislative session

715
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
San Antonio

716
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,432
Police chief Antonio Trevino

717
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,968
Urged a committee of lawmakers

718
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,504
To allow permanent sobriety checkpoint

719
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,320
Do you read that it's very clear that

720
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Did not allowed

721
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
Afraid of

722
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,792
Release it didn't happen until about a year later I have to accept

723
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,352
Recorded specifically used to Target immigrants

724
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
Richfield

725
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,448
Inconsistent

726
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
His world

727
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:10,336
Resistant to the DUI

728
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
If

729
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,968
Citrus like if you

730
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,576
Analogy to it would be

731
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
Stop

732
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
Program

733
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,160
In New York you know

734
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:30,560
Innocent people and they're just looking for various there is a possibility of

735
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:34,144
Abuse up the the stop for sure

736
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
Could I have some

737
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,640
Because in Missouri

738
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:45,920
There were

739
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
DUI checkpoint

740
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,248
A lot of the time when I was a young

741
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:53,600
I had a lot of friends

742
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,696
In the car and stuff like that

743
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
You know that there were

744
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,864
You would call or text all your friends be like

745
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,448
Of course of course

746
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,984
Speed traps

747
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,752
And stuff like that

748
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,800
Like going to the Boonville

749
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
They gives directions

750
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,456
Live updating

751
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,736
Traffic directions

752
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,064
They also include DUI checkpoints

753
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
It's on there

754
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,136
Are there apps

755
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,184
That's no good

756
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,232
You find alternate routes around

757
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
Warnings of the

758
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:36,352
The pop-up one of course

759
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,120
Casino

760
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,472
Was Notorious for

761
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,264
They had a lower

762
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
But you're coming off

763
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
People driving drunk coming out of the

764
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:56,320
Casino everybody knew it

765
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
Didn't know

766
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,488
You

767
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
If you're not drunk

768
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,096
They'll just let you off with a warning if you are

769
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,888
We're going to get arrested

770
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,424
That I kind of don't

771
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,896
The checkpoint is there too

772
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
Catch people who

773
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,760
Drunk driving

774
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:30,624
But if you

775
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
You're going to use a

776
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,440
Less Traveled Road

777
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,744
And that's going to buy

778
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
Statistical necessity

779
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Lead to

780
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,072
Fewer people

781
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:45,472
Maybe you're going to get into an accident but at least it's just f****** you you know there are some studies

782
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,264
I was able to find

783
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,544
Did make

784
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Reclaim

785
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
Finding

786
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,711
That put in a DUI check

787
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
Practice with

788
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,831
Related

789
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
Went down like to

790
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
Proof that these checks

791
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,535
Did and that is because of

792
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
Kind of what you brought up

793
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:16,191
The idea of going down another road while you're drunk cuz you know there's a checkpoint over here

794
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:20,799
Doesn't make that driving less intrinsically dangerous of course

795
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:27,199
You could still I don't know go into someone's front yard

796
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,783
Intuit

797
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,319
Because the last busy Street

798
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,647
You could hit them pretty easily

799
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,719
Yeah the odds

800
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
Making a bigger

801
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
Wreck on those sites

802
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,351
Favoring over where the

803
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
Blockade is

804
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,751
The numbers

805
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
Plies

806
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,895
Regardless no matter what

807
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,199
There's I think

808
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,759
American history is boring

809
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
You pretty accurate

810
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,343
You're not going to stop people from driving

811
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
That is not going to

812
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,255
No matter how many mothers

813
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,607
You know if you can do if you can take as many

814
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,143
Steps to minimize the

815
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,679
Damaged causes

816
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Because you know that

817
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
It's going to be an issue

818
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
Then

819
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,591
Secondhand smoke

820
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:32,479
You people are going to smoke but you shouldn't do it in a

821
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,319
The numbers

822
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,623
It. It does

823
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Risk aversion

824
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,207
Or minimizing

825
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,023
But I'm not sometimes

826
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
You can hope for

827
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:51,935
I don't know I don't know it's a little bit of a little ambivalent

828
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,471
How I feel about it

829
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,175
Now it starts

830
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
Extra

831
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,223
Complain about Hospital

832
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
But

833
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,647
The conclusions that he makes with those credits

834
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,999
What's going on

835
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,871
Hospital

836
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
So

837
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:42,367
I think it is criticism it's not what he's saying but I think it's criticism that the sort of the healthcare

838
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135
Business

839
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,183
System as a whole

840
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,743
Does absolutely speed on for

841
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:53,375
People under all of the uninsured

842
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,799
You get it out like I don't know you fall down and break your leg accidentally you can't get anywhere in ambulance come to pick you up your f***

843
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:06,431
For years because of how much of that ambulance ride cost you any of the emergency room

844
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,455
Your f***

845
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,503
Yes

846
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
Fair criticism Alex

847
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,831
A grade not going to help

848
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,391
Situation

849
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
Square diamond rings and necklaces

850
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,743
Don't think it's going to help you

851
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,303
That's a child's understanding

852
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
Ohio like

853
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,983
Being poor you get f***** by Hospital

854
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:42,015
I will give you this.

855
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:48,927
Or the idea of like you got to go to the hospital

856
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,511
A f*** out of here

857
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,607
Body swap

858
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,431
Also like the idea of

859
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:16,575
You got to go to the rich hospital cuz they're not speaking off them in there is also

860
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:23,487
But again it is very unfair and cruel.

861
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Like

862
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,839
Oh yeah

863
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
100

864
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
We could go with it

865
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,703
As the kids say

866
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,519
Grandma just had a stroke

867
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,567
And she's been in the hospital for

868
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,871
Forever and now according to

869
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,991
According to the rules of her insurance or something like that if she's not showing

870
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,295
Consistent Improvement literally every

871
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,343
She will have to go to

872
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
To this side

873
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,647
Nursing homes

874
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,183
Which is just going to bank

875
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,975
Like

876
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
She should have gone to

877
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:05,727
That's a good point

878
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,775
13 episode where he unblocked

879
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:14,175
What week is over diamond rings to pay for the Uber to get in the hospital cuz we couldn't afford the goddamn

880
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:20,575
Classic Gift of the Magi situation

881
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:26,975
Tragedy

882
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,999
Riddles for dumb reason

883
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,791
But he also

884
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,399
He has a story

885
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
He's telling about what

886
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
Employees

887
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
Who's

888
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
I guess there

889
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
Because he doesn't fly that it

890
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
His wife

891
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,919
Recently given birth

892
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
Stacy's

893
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
Situation with the

894
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
Kid

895
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
He's not specific

896
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
With the details

897
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,111
Also it's a third-hand

898
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,135
Personal story

899
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,207
So I'm not interested in that I'm going to leave all of it aside

900
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,487
And just try and get to the

901
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,279
Contact behind what he's talking about

902
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,583
And here he talks about how

903
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
The globalist

904
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
Hospitals

905
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,423
Or trying to kill pregnant women with Lexi

906
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,823
Okay

907
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,383
Cause a miscarriage or or or

908
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,431
Just bored

909
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:32,255
And a

910
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,327
Rashad

911
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
Okay

912
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,287
Is going to lead people to not get appropriate help

913
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,591
Yeah that is a very

914
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,615
Stupid

915
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
Message Judy putting out

916
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,919
And he was one of the reason

917
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:55,807
The issue here is the vaccines are dangerous for people who are pregnant but not all vaccines

918
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:00,415
Princeton any version of the inactivated flu virus vaccine

919
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511
Same goes for the tetanus and

920
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
Pertussis

921
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
Vaccine

922
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,863
Tgap vaccine

923
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,911
Provided

924
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
The 27th

925
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
Pregnancy

926
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:16,287
Conversely the MMR and chicken pox vaccines have the

927
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,567
The potential to be very

928
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,895
Because they contain live virus

929
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,431
Anybody in Phoenix

930
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,711
Respond differently

931
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,735
Then

932
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,783
Non live virus vaccines

933
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Beyond that

934
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,135
There are other variables that come into play

935
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,951
Primarily related to the mother's medical history

936
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,767
If you have a history of chronic liver disease

937
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,559
He's a doctor might recommend getting a

938
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,351
Titus B vaccine

939
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,887
There's a lot of variables

940
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,167
If a person works

941
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
Generally risks are kept

942
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
To a minimum

943
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,031
Relying on

944
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,359
His audience just accept his argument

945
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,383
Purely based on Steve

946
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,687
He's pretending that all vaccines have the same

947
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
Does nonsense

948
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
He's further pretend

949
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,295
A vaccine

950
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,087
Constantly being

951
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,903
So possibly one that was unsafe to give

952
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,183
To someone during pregnancy

953
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,207
Years back

954
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
Now is

955
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,535
Because of developments are indeed

956
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
Dodo sorsa

957
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,887
Everybody knows

958
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
Ever

959
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,519
That's why something that we

960
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,335
Which is that we had roughly 100 years

961
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
Before climate change would kill

962
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,991
On account of

963
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,807
That's Medical gaslighter

964
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
I mean

965
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:39,999
Clear-cut absolutely

966
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,303
Get vaccines and now they want to give him vaccine

967
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Not deal

968
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,631
Extemporize

969
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,167
Details that surround

970
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,191
Contacts

971
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,727
Of Medical Care like

972
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
It's absurd

973
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,543
It's that it's very

974
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,383
Structure of

975
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
What

976
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,223
Say eggs are good for us

977
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:06,367
And then they say they've got too much cholesterol

978
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,415
Figure it out

979
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:11,487
Right it does have that without the attempt

980
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:17,887
Did a joke instead you're just a whooping cough outbreak

981
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,751
So in the next Place Alex

982
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,519
Gets around 2

983
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,151
And this is where it really did show take say

984
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
I mean

985
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,759
It's basically like someone driving drunk

986
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,551
It may just take a swerve off of

987
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:39,135
Okay

988
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,607
Perception

989
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,167
Definition of gaslighting

990
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:55,007
And that is the definition exist within the info

991
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,567
Remember that

992
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,199
So it is next Club Alex describes has this

993
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
Beginning a 2013

994
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Because of

995
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:10,111
Gun grab

996
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,927
His entire career

997
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:28,543
Unfortunately our worst analysis is coming true the worst-case scenario is now in full

998
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,671
That is inappropriate cuz

999
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,695
Is that more folks

1000
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,679
Serious time in my 17 years old

1001
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:02,847
Scared what about

1002
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,431
Beginning of his career was around when Oklahoma City

1003
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
Write like what about

1004
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,015
You undersell

1005
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,063
Those other very serious

1006
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,343
Things in your career

1007
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,623
You are just afraid

1008
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,391
Of this person

1009
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,423
Is Merida's better

1010
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,959
So his his death

1011
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
Gaslighting

1012
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
Explode people

1013
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
Memories and make them

1014
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,823
They aren't real

1015
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,359
Is fully demonstrated

1016
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,687
This is the most important time in my career

1017
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,735
Play definition

1018
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,463
Perception

1019
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,255
Okay well okay

1020
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,839
According to the textbook

1021
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,935
Yes everything that Alex Jones is

1022
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:04,031
Career

1023
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,359
Just trust your memory isn't 911

1024
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,407
The thing that you put your career on and is when

1025
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
Global

1026
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,247
No that isn't that more serious

1027
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,807
Illinois state

1028
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:21,183
What's 9/11

1029
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,743
Stop it

1030
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:29,119
Right now this gun control bill

1031
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:39,103
Fine this next one

1032
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:39,871
Much worse

1033
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:51,391
Information is presented

1034
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:56,511
Please read the caption definition again

1035
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,815
Wow

1036
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,415
So

1037
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:03,327
That's a that's a lot to remember the vinegar want

1038
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:07,167
These drills was done without telling anybody

1039
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:10,239
National news picked it up and the entire country was like

1040
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:16,383
What the f*** are you doing I don't know if that's true but if it was it's not

1041
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:17,919
What we're talkin about

1042
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:25,855
Covered it already supposed to say Alex's

1043
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,415
Although it is funny

1044
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
The funny farm

1045
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,743
About it

1046
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,815
I would spend more time on that one but the last I think I'll

1047
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
Call lava

1048
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:41,727
The last

1049
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,007
So I thought I'd look into that

1050
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:49,663
Alex's asserting that there were drills were people in masks were marching people out there were going to be executed

1051
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
I'm not telling him that

1052
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,503
Which is why people let people having break

1053
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:58,111
Efukt up

1054
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,183
What else is actually referring to the helicopter exercise

1055
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
Military

1056
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,023
Minneapolis August 2012

1057
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,863
It's something that they from time-to-time to Urban Center

1058
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,935
Spokespeople commented on how it's important for their training

1059
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:14,751
Karaoke's exercises in unfamiliar areas

1060
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:18,079
The pilots could do a little bit of improvisational navigation

1061
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:24,735
One time when I worked at Groupon the helicopter training exercise downtown Chicago

1062
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,319
But I think it was

1063
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
Constituted

1064
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:33,183
Like you're in this high-rise building and there's helicopters that are like

1065
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:39,839
Going by pretty close to like your window lever

1066
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
For sure

1067
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:51,103
Why we get 5 minutes

1068
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,199
You know what the swing

1069
00:57:55,455 --> 00:58:01,599
Everybody everybody

1070
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,879
Superman all the all the time

1071
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,951
The Star Tribune article about witches

1072
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
The primary source

1073
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,511
Infowars article about it

1074
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
Tastes like

1075
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
Three-quarters the article

1076
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,703
And calls it his reporting

1077
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,727
People in Black Mass

1078
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,775
No mention of people having breakdowns

1079
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,079
The closest Conn's is saying that

1080
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:26,687
People who saw the helicopters thought they were and kind of annoying

1081
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,247
The article doesn't mention

1082
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,927
Unimportant part does

1083
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:40,255
Over-reporting

1084
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,047
Spinosaurus

1085
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,863
F*** it was so loud

1086
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,935
The article does mention some on-the-ground exercises

1087
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
Carried out as part of the

1088
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:53,567
As well points out that the bad guys

1089
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,615
Civilians pay by special operation

1090
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,639
Play the

1091
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,455
No one involved was unaware that it was a

1092
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,015
There's no indication that

1093
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,295
Even happened away Alex's

1094
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,647
And even if they did no one is aware unaware of what was going on

1095
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:13,279
Quite literally this is Alex gaslighting his audience ironically in the middle of accusing his enemies of

1096
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,047
Being Gaslight

1097
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,351
Now I will say

1098
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,887
Mistake of calling everyday

1099
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,423
Hangout putting it out in the open

1100
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,703
There is dumb

1101
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,751
Concern

1102
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,543
Give the public enough

1103
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,311
Advance

1104
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
And I accept

1105
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
There's some argument

1106
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,943
Could be made there about whether or not that

1107
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,039
When I worked at Groupon there was no advance

1108
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:35,807
Warning

1109
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:40,927
Flyby are wrong

1110
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
Or anything

1111
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,743
And I didn't even understand why they were

1112
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,535
You read these articles are talking

1113
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
I like the idea of

1114
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,119
This landscape is unfamiliar it's help

1115
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,727
Alright I get what you doing

1116
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,567
Also the military spokesman in this article who is

1117
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,847
The interview explained

1118
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,127
The date formally give

1119
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,431
Three days notice about these sorts of drill

1120
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,991
Do they found it became a little bit of a spectator sport

1121
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:09,087
We're people would come out in large groups to Choppers flying overhead

1122
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,647
And that had the potential to introduce serious.

1123
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:19,071
Military helicopters were going to be flying over

1124
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:25,471
You are cuz they're solo flying you introduced the risk of someone throwing a rock acting like that

1125
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:31,103
Right

1126
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:37,503
Course not everybody but you has like two million people in Chicago or whatever

1127
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:44,159
But they could throw a flare as a helicopter make

1128
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,183
.

1129
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,719
Bad variable

1130
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:53,887
Now don't try and shoot it down

1131
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,935
Does the danger that

1132
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:58,495
People ahead of time

1133
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,543
Justify not

1134
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,311
Doing it to

1135
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Begin with

1136
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
I don't know

1137
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:08,991
And I think there's a legitimate conversation to have there but it's not the conversation Alex's happen

1138
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
Execution

1139
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,535
Haha sorry it's a drill

1140
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:27,167
Sorry.

1141
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
That's nonsense

1142
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,239
That's crazy

1143
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,823
What's gaslighting

1144
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,615
Definition

1145
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
I'm back from break

1146
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,063
This is one of the

1147
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:44,831
4 Main

1148
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
Comes back from

1149
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:54,047
To self with the truth it is time for you to choose a side your list

1150
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,095
Alex Jones

1151
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,375
That's gaslighting

1152
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:03,775
Gaslighting people truth absolutely

1153
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,799
I know that he doesn't

1154
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,735
Structure of this show is halfway to get Sadia is insane

1155
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,999
F****** thing is all that

1156
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:30,399
I just want you to play each clip and then afterwards play the definition of gaslighting

1157
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:37,055
We might as we're what we might as well be there like the fact that he has the definition of gas like that he's read

1158
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,103
On his own f****** show

1159
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,175
That's damning clip if there ever was

1160
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,271
Like I would

1161
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
Careercert

1162
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
The last

1163
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
Cover

1164
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,879
Dating back to the

1165
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,207
Alex has been really mad.

1166
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,487
The globalist

1167
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
Eugenicist

1168
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
He's very against

1169
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,823
To some of the Eugenics argument

1170
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,479
Don't do it

1171
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,743
Population

1172
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,607
Yeah

1173
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:37,727
Symptoms

1174
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,639
Where we going

1175
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,159
That's the

1176
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,999
I mean there's nothing truer than I should

1177
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,679
Eugenics is good

1178
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:11,007
But boy I don't want to be specific about that

1179
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:17,151
Fireman

1180
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:23,295
Isn't he for eugenics

1181
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,647
Against the globalist

1182
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
Perception

1183
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
Is

1184
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
Against

1185
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:32,767
People down

1186
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:33,791
That's

1187
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
Diversion

1188
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:40,447
Is that full throated lie against but I've never ever

1189
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
Say

1190
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,775
Some of the Eugenics argument is

1191
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
Richards f*****

1192
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,847
Yeah that's weird

1193
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,639
Gaslighting

1194
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,783
Episode Alex starts taking calls

1195
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,319
From Obama support

1196
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,111
He wants to do it too

1197
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
Clown auntie

1198
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,951
Never work

1199
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,255
Because Obama supporters don't

1200
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
Listen to his

1201
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,887
Obama supporter

1202
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,423
Just to get on the air

1203
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,823
And that happened what is it called

1204
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,615
Was this guy who

1205
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,895
Joking

1206
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
About being Obama

1207
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,503
Everybody

1208
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,111
This guy is actually making a serious

1209
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,903
Deranged

1210
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999
So that's the first call

1211
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:45,727
That's the first Call of Duty

1212
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,311
Nothing worth really listening

1213
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,591
You basically

1214
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,199
Keep a call from the station

1215
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,479
One of these

1216
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,759
Owner Runner

1217
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,807
But someone is it is a filly

1218
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,135
We're going to keep you on our stage

1219
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,463
No

1220
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,743
Oh okay

1221
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,767
He actually has

1222
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:09,791
Ideas

1223
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,327
Ferragamo is not eligible

1224
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,607
Will be the president

1225
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:21,823
But in order to qualify to be a candidate for the United States president

1226
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,871
To be the president

1227
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,919
You have to have

1228
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,199
Natural

1229
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,223
Born

1230
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,015
Citizen

1231
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,039
Voltaren

1232
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:35,903
According to the United

1233
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:36,671
Nations

1234
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:04,831
Where is he really from

1235
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,135
It's only a distraction because guys

1236
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,159
Started

1237
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,439
Credibly races

1238
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,975
Conspiracy theories about

1239
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,607
I don't care

1240
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:20,959
Do you know how many presidents would not be eligible for the presidency

1241
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,567
Let's just go if that was in the Constitution

1242
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:34,271
There is a natural born citizen

1243
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,551
The time of the Constitution

1244
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,671
Like a workaround for the early presidents

1245
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,487
I'm stuff like that

1246
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,279
Both parents had to be

1247
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:51,679
Oh yeah

1248
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,311
But I wanted to I left equipment for a reason

1249
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:02,687
And that's cuz I wanted to tell you about how I started reading a little bit about Obama's dad Barack Obama

1250
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,759
And I found out that Obama's childhood home was located at

1251
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,575
25 11th Avenue in Honolulu Hawaii

1252
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:13,951
That's about five blocks from the corner of 8th and Harding

1253
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,255
In the house

1254
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,047
We both lived

1255
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:18,815
Mookie

1256
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,631
Ebi neighborhood in Hawaii like it's very close

1257
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,423
I've a hundred percent

1258
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,543
Around where Obama's when I was a child

1259
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,871
Well your home your home was haunted of course by the ghost of

1260
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,999
There's a lot of really weird parallels

1261
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,279
Between my life and Obama

1262
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,351
Emma's life and if Alex really wanted to I would love it

1263
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,631
If you tried to spend a Funko

1264
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,399
Conspiracy out of

1265
01:08:54,655 --> 01:09:00,799
Red Cross child I lived a couple blocks from Obama's child

1266
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,127
At home

1267
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,151
How old is

1268
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,199
How old are you

1269
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,319
Doesn't work out quite well

1270
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:15,391
But my dad was at Harvard at the same time

1271
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,047
Barack Obama

1272
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,071
Was at Harvard

1273
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,095
Then later

1274
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,119
We moved to Honolulu

1275
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,959
East-West Center

1276
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,007
Okay I'll shoot of University

1277
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,031
Be quiet

1278
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,823
Obama was also at the

1279
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:42,783
Think about all these connections a mile

1280
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:49,183
I don't know what you want to do but do something with that

1281
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:55,583
The greatest reveal of all time

1282
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,375
It started podcast with an a******

1283
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:04,031
In all of our photos

1284
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,823
Regression software

1285
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:12,479
Got me this nice beard and all of a sudden I'm doing podcast

1286
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:18,367
I got that very insulting and so now here we are

1287
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
Somehow that I

1288
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,535
Involved

1289
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:32,191
That you're that you're

1290
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
Here's the thing

1291
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,751
We ever guess

1292
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,031
What the actual

1293
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799
Result

1294
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,591
But I want to know why

1295
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,871
How old

1296
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,895
Filtered fight

1297
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:44,223
Yeah those little factoid

1298
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,551
Very near each other in our childhood home

1299
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,831
At different times

1300
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,879
But the same neighborhood very close

1301
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,903
Talk to each other

1302
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:58,815
My dad was at both Harvard and East-West Center at the same time is Obama

1303

2 something

1304
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,679
That does sound like an internet

1305
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,871
And then it auto-generate Seca

1306
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,407
Conspiracy theory based around

1307
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:16,735
More literal fact

1308
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:20,319
So many others

01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,007
Whatever

1336
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,055
Which is fine but all of it

1337
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,615
Thanos it's not real

1338
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,967
I like

1339
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:02,207
It's next level s*** there's nothing here that isn't like emotionally manipulative and

1340
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:02,975
Abusive

1341
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:09,375
So I mean like

1342
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,423
Liberty

1343
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
Freedom-loving

1344
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,031
The last thing you want

1345
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,383
Unless you're a propagandist

1346
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,967
And then the first

1347
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,503
If you're a propaganda

1348
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,295
What you want to Gaslight your audience

1349
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
It's about his

1350
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,343
What is propaganda

1351
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,647
What's the weather

1352
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:38,047
He's going to Define propaganda

1353
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:44,191
So wouldn't he using the definition of

1354
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,983
No he

1355
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,031
Define propaganda

1356
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,823
Defies reality

1357
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:58,527
Information

1358
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,671
Propaganda

1359
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Real

1360
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,199
First of all have you ever heard the terms White

1361
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,991
Black and grey propaganda

1362
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,343
So

1363
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,415
Have you heard the terms white gray and black before

1364
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:45,631
Supremacist

1365
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,215
From Carrie cast

1366
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,263
Probably heard some of that stuff

1367
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,847
She does have the sort of like light and dark

1368
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,383
Dichotomy

1369
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,295
Light dark

1370
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,623
Whatever the case

1371
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,903
Not in reality

1372
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:13,279
What she does do great propaganda but only for the gray

1373
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,583
Propaganda is not

1374
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,375
Information used

1375
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,143
To get something

1376
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:18,911
Done

1377
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,983
That isn't

1378
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Income

1379
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,311
Definition of propaganda

1380
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,103
The Great Wave

1381
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,127
Yeah

1382
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,943
And to tell your audience like what I do is wipe

1383
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,967
Propaganda

1384
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
Providing proper

1385
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,599
Gaslighting

1386
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,415
Because if

1387
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,463
If you're if you're there

1388
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,071
If you're at the situation where propaganda is so nebulously

1389
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,631
Not Define

1390
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,167
Has to be literally

1391
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,471
Anything to do

1392
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,751
And then you

1393
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,775
Create these

1394
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,543
Substance

1395
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:00,383
The propaganda

1396
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,687
You're setting yourself up

1397
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,223
As a white propaganda

1398
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,015
And because your definition

1399
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,551
The propaganda is saying something

1400
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
Things to do anything

1401
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:15,231
Everybody else who is not saying the same thing

1402
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:15,999
Or grape

1403
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,327
Conception of

1404
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,631
The property

1405
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:24,447
Because Fifty Shades of Grey

1406
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,471
Swell

1407
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,615
I showed you

1408
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,151
That crime rates

1409
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:37,759
And he's implying there's a causal relationship

1410
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,807
Ship there where is there may not be

1411
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,951
And based on his example

1412
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,047
So you're actually a great prophet

1413
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,095
Conception

1414
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:55,935
And all this doesn't matter you're a f****** propagandist

1415
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:58,495
Yeah I know what really

1416
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,519
People telling

1417
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,543
Youfact

1418
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,823
Like that's not

1419
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,639
Information is not propaganda

1420
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:16,415
Even he wasn't like

1421
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:29,215
Who actually shows up on this episode

1422
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:32,031
You have something to say about Sandy Hook

1423
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,079
Evil

1424
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,407
Denotes like beds

1425
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,687
Psych meds

1426
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,551
Jerome f****** course

1427
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,111
Psych meds psych meds

1428
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,695
Come in with something really responsive

1429
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,719
And it was just like

1430
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,303
Yeah this is

1431
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,839
This is an unfair a death

1432
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:56,863
Propaganda

1433
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,655
Passing it off on your body

1434
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,679
This way

1435
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,007
Absolutely

1436
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,151
Right

1437
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,175
From this lady

1438
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,199
Who is like

1439
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:16,319
In favor of Obama but I need you to understand I was wrong

1440
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,343
Paul supporter

1441
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:21,439
But as Ron Paul was unable to win the election

1442
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,351
Paul Ryan

1443
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:31,423
They are clearly going to take away women's rights

1444
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,727
They're going to infringe on my right

1445
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,775
So what the f*** am I supposed to do

1446
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,055
I went with Obama

1447
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,079
Like what

1448
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,615
She is made the first

1449
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
Reasonable

1450
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,199
I can remember on this vodka

1451
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,503
Like legitimately

1452
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:48,575
I cannot think of any more reasonable

1453
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,415
Like I said it's still an Infowars Ian are arguing

1454
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,951
It's still like a

1455
01:18:54,207 --> 01:19:00,351
I don't trust you it's not Romney is a

1456
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,375
Boardman

1457
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:04,959
Who's going to take my uterus and force me to make babies

1458
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,495
It's not even

1459
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,031
Ron Paul

1460
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,335
Be better

1461
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:13,919
Right

1462
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,455
The closest

1463
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:21,087
Call

1464
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,671
Sort of moving the goalposts

1465
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,511
Completely unrelated argument

1466
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,047
And then finally the collar

1467
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,071
Get sick and tired of it

1468
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,143
The problem

1469
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
In America

1470
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:42,335
Alex I want to say something controversial and I don't care if it gets everyone mad but I'm going to say to me the reason this country is going

1471
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,383
You know where is because

1472
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,455
Old white man who are running the Senate and Congress

1473
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:53,855
We have what 1% of Mexican and it said and black people that are in the congress senate

1474
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:06,399
Old man running the country suspended

1475
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:14,080
You are

1476
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:17,152
Right there alone is

1477
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:22,528
Crazy lady

1478
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:28,672
Saucer

1479
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,144
Very depressed

1480
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:50,176
And is she staying

1481
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:55,808
Of course not

1482
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,976
The answer is of course not

1483
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,512
Respondeat office station

1484
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,816
I'll still go along with you

1485
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:07,840
Whatever

1486
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:11,680
The Senate releases demographic information about every single session

1487
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,472
This was the

1488
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,496
12th Congress

1489
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,032
Here's the actual breakdown of it

1490
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,384
16.8% of Congress were women in 2012

1491
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,712
With a total of 91 persons elected

1492
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,504
17 Fillmore in the Sun

1493
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,296
Only 81

1494
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
Congress rap

1495
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,088
African American

1496
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,136
Not a single one of them in the Sun

1497
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:36,256
There were literally more radio talk show host seven African Americans in the Senate

1498
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:39,584
There are more former astronaut than African American

1499
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,144
Former comedian

1500
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,448
Then African Americans in the Senate

1501
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,496
And 112th session

1502
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:52,384
Cuz I'll bring it

1503
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,944
Congress was fixed

1504
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,968
2.2

1505
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,552
Which is considerably higher than regular

1506
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,416
Congress was overwhelmingly

1507
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:08,256
This woman is not far off from scribing the reality that

1508
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,560
Accurate

1509
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,376
She says that there was a 1% representation of a

1510
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,144
African Americans

1511
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,168
Congress and then

1512
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,192
She says the Senate

1513
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,240
Alex talks over her as she says

1514
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,568
And the number is actually zero for

1515
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,992
96% of

1516
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,016
And 82% of

1517
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,040
The house

1518
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,856
Nothing about the demographics

1519
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,648
112

1520
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,672
Congress comes

1521
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,464
Even close to matching the demographics

1522
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
The United States

1523
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,280
The point that she's making

1524
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,304
Incredibly valve

1525
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,376
Interview starts obfuscating

1526
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,960
I move the goalposts change the argument

1527
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,984
She's actually making

1528
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,520
What you see happened

1529
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,800
So crazy

1530
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,080
Yeah

1531
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,360
Alex

1532
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,896
Accuses her of what

1533
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,432
The Mexican

1534
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,456
Congress

1535
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,736
To replace archon

1536
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:05,600
Is that what you want

1537
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:12,000
Basically Define

1538
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,048
Is gas-lighting her

1539
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:18,144
Is a puppet

1540
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:29,664
Alec we can agree to disagree

1541
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:37,088
No I'm not

1542
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:44,768
I think we should start all over.

1543
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,872
You heard him say should we do

1544
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,224
She says no

1545
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,040
And then he implies that she said

1546
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,576
We should bring all these

1547
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,136
I was just making that up

1548
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,184
This is gas-lighting

1549
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,976
Is gas-lighting is audience

1550
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,000
Gaslighting

1551
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:22,656
Remember when you said that

1552
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,192
It's insane

1553
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,216
This is

1554
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,496
This is

1555
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:29,568
Program yeah it is it is really

1556
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,248
It's to the point

1557
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:40,576
Be careful

1558
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,624
We have to also

1559
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,160
And you see it everywhere

1560
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:46,976
Everywhere

1561
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:52,608
Because no matter how strong your will is

1562
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,680
You are going to have a unless you're psychopath

1563
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,984
You're going to have that moment where you like

1564
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,752
Wait

1565
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,800
Am I crazy

1566
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,920
Guess what is that constant like

1567
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,944
Drivers should be

1568
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,736
Brought up I don't remember

1569
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:15,136
I don't like to know the old white dude

1570
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,672
I am in the car

1571
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,976
Pictures of Fair Credit

1572
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:22,560
Did he come back and talk to me

1573
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,328
Switch the Meg

1574
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,400
I don't remember saying

1575
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,216
But I you know what

1576
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:34,080
This is gotten a little heated

1577
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,104
Brakes

1578
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,408
Controls the audience think

1579
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,176
Yeah

1580
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:38,944
Hit something

1581
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,272
Another

1582
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,576
Pro Obama collar

1583
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,904
This guy really is

1584
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,488
Anti-republican

1585
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,280
Which is fine

1586
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:54,816
I don't think it's

1587
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,352
I don't think it's

1588
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,888
If the premise Alex wanted

1589
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,424
Yeah but it's what he

1590
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:04,032
It's not the premise you introduced but it's exactly what he wasn't

1591
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,848
Let's go ahead and

1592
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:10,432
Fox

1593
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:17,344
Alex I support Obama because I hate the Republicans so much because

1594
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,648
The Tenth Amendment

1595
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:26,560
They could have been in the office they could have ran away with the election all they had to do was backup

1596
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,864
17 States

1597
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:35,008
Exercise the 10th Amendment

1598
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,568
Medical cannabis and

1599
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,128
Use cannabis.

1600
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:44,224
Oh it's party to cannabis for industry

1601
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,296
Punjab

1602
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,328
Are sections of broadcast

1603
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,096
No s***

1604
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,888
Is your college generally suck

1605
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,936
And this guy isn't Pro

1606
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:15,712
Switch difference

1607
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,248
This is

1608
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,016
Pathetic

1609
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:19,296
Like terms

1610
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,576
Also he doesn't

1611
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,208
Well I mean

1612
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:30,048
I like that I like

1613
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,632
Dave seems like

1614
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,936
Sure

1615
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:42,592
I just like his I just like slow Meandering tone

1616
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:45,152
Hurried

1617
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,432
Yeah

1618
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,224
It is what it is

1619
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,064
Is that called

1620
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
Was that the idea

1621
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,368
Legalizing drugs

1622
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:58,464
Whether it's for

1623
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
Purposes

1624
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,816
Clothing and what-have-you

1625
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,608
Great

1626
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,912
Great if you're a libertarian

1627
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,192
That everybody should

1628
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:09,984
These things

1629
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,056
Personal Liberty

1630
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,360
So that makes this next quick

1631
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,128
Really hard

1632
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,920
If you imagine that

1633
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:18,944
Libertarian

1634
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,480
Cuz I think this wise

1635
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,248
100

1636
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,296
Counter to libertarian

1637
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,136
A big supporter

1638
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:33,024
A drug decriminalization

1639
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,336
No that's not a side issue

1640
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,896
I think a Libertarian position on

1641
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,200
Maximize

1642
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,528
If you drink

1643
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,320
A ton of booze

1644
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,856
You will poison

1645
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:58,624
Yourself

1646
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:02,208
Everyone knows that this is very clear

1647
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:03,744
You have

1648
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,536
Is a personal choice

1649
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:12,448
Is what alcohol

1650
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:14,752
Market to dictate how much

1651
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,288
Rizknows

1652
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:17,824
Local

1653
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:22,688
Or federal government that should be able to the business

1654
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,224
Between Boos salary

1655
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:24,992
Who's buyers

1656
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:28,320
Should be just because it's a danger to you doesn't mean

1657
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,344
Have access to

1658
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,672
You are an adult you were a free man

1659
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,976
You have the choices in front of you

1660
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,024
To poison yourself

1661
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,072
It has nothing to do with who sold it to you

1662
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,120
The fact that Alex is like

1663
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,400
Micro

1664
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,680
Managing isn't

1665
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,448
Local

1666
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,568
As opposed to like the federal government

1667
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,848
Libertarian

1668
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,384
A hundred percent VA

1669
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,408
You drink yourself

1670
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:55,712
To death no one else is responsible but you

1671
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,528
You did that you chose to do that

1672
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:02,368
If Subway

1673
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,904
Yeah

1674
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:08,512
In line with

1675
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,280
Annie

1676
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,840
Libertarian thought that I've ever coming

1677
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:12,608
Incontact

1678
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,520
I've never heard that

1679
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:22,592
Nanny State put local level

1680
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,872
Yeah

1681
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,432
I don't I don't know that to be a robust

1682
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,456
Part of libertarian

1683
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:31,552
Thought but for being over-served

1684
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,576
I can tell you

1685
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,112
Generally speaking

1686
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,136
They were right

1687
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,672
The entire time

1688
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:42,816
Different conversation.

1689
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:45,888
You're a Libertarian should have the wherewithal to be like

1690
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,936
That one was on me

1691
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,752
You get you get this route

1692
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:53,312
I don't want to do the government over my

1693
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
Free booze

1694
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,176
Not libertarian

1695
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,040
You're in a certain state

1696
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,320
You are impaired

1697
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,856
And you don't know

1698
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,648
The extent of what you're taking a

1699
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,256
With in literature

1700
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:18,144
Very hard line they like absolute

1701
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,168
From everything I've

1702
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:21,728
Is very

1703
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,752
Very much

1704
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:24,544
Dry

1705
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:30,176
Which propaganda

1706
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,456
Absolutely.

1707
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,224
To the dark side.

1708
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,528
It's very weird

1709
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:35,808
Yeah

1710
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:36,576
Expect that

1711
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:46,816
But I did

1712
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:03,456
Confirm

1713
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,736
Constitutionalist

1714
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:07,296
Compared to the average

1715
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:13,696
More

1716
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:19,072
Helpless

1717
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,776
Person who

1718
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,056
What Democrats do

1719
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:37,760
Say that you're above the right light

1720
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,552
Republican

1721
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,600
Regret

1722
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,648
It's real hard to

1723
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,672
Have that

1724
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,696
Your self-perception

1725
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:49,536
Democrats are almost not people

1726
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,632
I don't like them cuz they're not extreme enough

1727
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,192
Yeah

1728
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,728
That's not good

1729
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:00,544
I am literally said Republicans are real

1730
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,568
Yeah

1731
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:07,456
I mean it's it's it's it's

1732
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,504
The energy

1733
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,808
Of the libertarian

1734
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:12,576
What are you

1735
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:18,976
Exploit

1736
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,512
Is for the rich

1737
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:24,352
Probably a parcel of liked the idea that

1738
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,680
Democrats are into

1739
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,472
Generally

1740
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,496
Civil Rights Act

1741
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,800
Libertarian

1742
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,080
Constitutionalist

1743
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,384
Not right

1744
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:45,856
So they soak up that enter date

1745
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,904
Propaganda

1746
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
To smallest

1747
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:53,792
They find the Democrat

1748
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:55,328
Policy set

1749
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,352
Of position

1750
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,632
Completely unacceptable

1751
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,680
And so where do they go

1752
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,960
They go to the Republican

1753
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,288
The middle

1754
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:07,872
Cuz they're not as overt

1755
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,160
Know that.

1756
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,208
Republic

1757
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,000
Represents the best

1758
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,816
Is that

1759
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:28,608
Did surprise me

1760
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,424
What time is it over

1761
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,216
Graphic

1762
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,592
Do you think there's

1763
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,896
So it would you say that

1764
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:43,200
Verse set of Republican voters on the

1765
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,504
Less than

1766
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,064
Like it doesn't it

1767
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,344
And yet they represent

1768
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,624
The best

1769
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,672
It almost seems like you're trying

1770
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:03,168
Whatever anyway

1771
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:05,472
You remember Republicans being garbage

1772
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:06,240
Allapattah

1773
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,056
You remember

1774
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,592
You hate Republicans

1775
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,944
They do represent the best people do

1776
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,224
Even though they're awful

1777
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,552
And they're garbage people they represent her garbage historically

1778
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:23,392
One final Obama

1779
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:26,720
Supporter caller

1780
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:30,048
Because this guy is

1781
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:30,816
Really

1782
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,584
F*** in Ark

1783
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,168
And that is

1784
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,704
I'm a business Traveler

1785
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,984
I live in Canada

1786
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,824
I'm all around I go all over the world most important things

1787
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,848
I think of the United

1788
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,616
Government

1789
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:46,176
Whether your puppet or not

1790
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:46,944
Instability

1791
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,808
The table is a real sense of stability

1792
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,600
And it really makes it

1793
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,136
The big difference around the world

1794
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,672
The places that I go to

1795
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,976
It's really great to be able to come

1796
01:35:59,232 --> 01:35:59,744
Comebacks

1797
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:02,560
It feels better coming in

1798
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:04,096
There is a sense of

1799
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:09,728
Steady Hand at the wheel

1800
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:16,896
Let's if you want to litigate the Obama presidency we can go all day

1801
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,688
We can do that that's no big

1802
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:25,088
If you want to litigate Obama's stability his appearance of a stable presidency

1803
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:28,928
You cannot

1804
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:31,232
Even with these people like

1805
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,608
Trump trying to make

1806
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,912
Tsunami wave

1807
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:42,240
Absolutely

1808
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,264
Things moving

1809
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,080
Of course

1810
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,360
Obvious

1811
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,408
Coccyx

1812
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,432
For sure

1813
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,200
But yet

1814
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:51,968
The ability to

1815
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,320
Did make a difference

1816
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,880
Stability

1817
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,440
Pretty good collar

1818
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,232
Yeah

1819
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,256
I gave him a

1820
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,792
Because

1821
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:07,584
I'm never going to

1822
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,120
Given Alex Jones caller in a

1823
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:13,472
Yeah I know

1824
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,008
Just because

1825
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:19,104
We have some high-quality colors

1826
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:19,872
Potential

1827
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,920
8 - caller

1828
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,712
If Alex didn't talk over her

1829
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,272
Cuz I think she had some other points

1830
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,464
That's your

1831
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,744
For every color

1832
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,024
Not getting an egg

1833
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,560
Because if you're is

1834
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:40,608
She had the chance

1835
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:47,008
But Alex talked over here literally everyone

1836
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:47,776
The table is Addie

1837
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:52,896
She had she had a B+ with what I heard

1838
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
But I also have to

1839
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,456
To accept that I could be

1840
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,224
Free fantasy book

1841
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,504
Alex tacos

1842
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,768
I thought Mitt Romney was going to take my rights away and I couldn't have these Edwards

1843
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,792
Right

1844
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:12,608
I don't think there's any chance

1845
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:14,912
That that was where she was going

1846
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,192
Something else

1847
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,728
Could have been like Federal Reserve

1848
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:27,968
But you comported herself quite well

1849
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:29,760
That guy was a really in

1850
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:30,784
Call

1851
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:32,320
I wish I would have

1852
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,112
It really

1853
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:34,880
Wasn't

1854
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,416
Wasn't that

1855
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,304
It was a it was Alex

1856
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,888
And it's more important

1857
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,656
After the call

1858
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,192
Cuz Alex

1859
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,264
Realizes he should have

1860
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,288
This guy

1861
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,056
Empty

1862
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,848
He let too many good things

1863
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:55,616
Come out

1864
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:56,640
Right

1865
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:57,664
And

1866
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,456
DoubleDown

1867
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:01,760
Episode 5

1868
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:34,272
Smartworld empowering women

1869
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:40,416
I want to be clear deposit slip for a second

1870
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:46,816
This has nothing to do with anything that was discussed in that guy's call or

1871
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:52,704
Jim talking about women being empowered or anything like that psychology

1872
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,728
Example

1873
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,264
Weird

1874
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:03,456
Gaslight

1875
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:19,328
Hollywood world Hollywood

1876
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:25,984
We all know that so

1877
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,152
Not as much as I used to

1878
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:40,576
World concerts

1879
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:49,280
Sky boxes

1880
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:12,576
You're in trouble

1881
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:15,136
You're in trouble

1882
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,048
Truman

1883
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,240
Yeah that one

1884
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:36,640
True.

1885
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,224
You do

1886
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:44,064
Like this is crazy

1887
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:53,280
Also possible that

1888
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,888
Even as good as investigator in journalist

1889
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:58,656
What does Jon Ronson

1890
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,192
There's a pretty good chance

1891
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:01,728
Be impossible to find a person

1892
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,496
Because they don't

1893
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:08,896
Astoria

1894
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:12,736
I'm sorry first episode

1895
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:16,832
I wanted more out of this episode

1896
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:22,976
R-Truth

1897
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,328
Is beginning 2013

1898
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,864
And there's not enough

1899
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,888
Dismiss

1900
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:30,912
Or just too much

1901
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,216
The idea of a bottle episode

1902
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,752
Just done

1903
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,776
About Alex

1904
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,312
Discovering the

1905
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,848
The concept of gaslighting

1906
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:42,944
And then proceeding to Gaslight at every possible turn

1907
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:45,760
I think there's a pretty strong humor and irony

1908
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:46,528
I needed that

1909
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:52,160
But at the same time it really doesn't help us understand

1910
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,952
Real pile of s***

1911
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,976
It's almost

1912
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:55,744
Cute

1913
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,376
A cute the word I would describe it seems like him

1914
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,168
It could be kind of ship

1915
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:09,312
Just it's like it's like somebody who turned the page on the calendar and realized that it is

1916
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:22,624
Oh my God I got can't wait to tell you all about that

1917
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,928
Yeah we got it

1918
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,232
It's okay and then he goes to the next

1919
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:35,680
Things they didn't do in the past and pretend

1920
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,472
They didn't hold them accountable

1921
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:43,104
For things that they didn't do

1922
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:51,552
I've always known fighting means and you know that I have always

1923
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,904
And have for forever

1924
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:02,560
Today on my word of the day calendar

1925
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,352
I don't know

1926
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:10,752
It is what it is

1927
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:12,544
You know what

1928
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:15,616
It's

1929
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:18,432
Always nice when we have

1930
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,456
Candidates for people

1931
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,736
Who technically probably have

1932
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:28,928
These callers Wyoming

1933
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,720
I feel like half the people in Wyoming

1934
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:36,096
Have a murder charge

1935
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,424
Yeah I don't know not funny

1936
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,192
Probably just

1937
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
That lady

1938
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:41,728
Doing good

1939
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:52,992
You could go to the Twitter

1940
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,784
Technology underscore

1941
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:59,904
You bet it is probably go to what's the other one

1942
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:03,744
Committed crimes all over the place

1943
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,328
Go home and tell your mother your Brilliance right there

1944
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,608
We are on

1945
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,400
Overcast

1946
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,448
Libra

1947
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,240
How I got over

1948
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,128
Do feel like

1949
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,664
You called it

1950
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,736
Brought up how old

1951
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:27,296
Tire Congress

1952
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:28,832
Think she was on to some

1953
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,952
We probably have

1954
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:34,720
And

1955
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:38,560
Based on John Ronson's reporting

1956
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:41,632
Maybe didn't kill somebody or maybe it's a whole other

1957
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:43,680
Almost

1958
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:45,984
Terrifying

1959
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,312
Imagine what he's done to people

1960
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,152
Probably

1961
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,992
Controlling

1962
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:02,624
Alex
