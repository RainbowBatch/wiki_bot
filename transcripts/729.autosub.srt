Knowledge party.com

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
Dot-com

00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:10,656
Alex Jones

7
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,752
Jordan is I mentioned this to you the other night

8
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,288
And that is that

9
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,848
Hope Springs Eternal

10
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
Sure that the first time you mentioned that to me the other night but no but it's it's this context

11
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
I just

12
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:32,160
So recently that there's a new Sonic game coming out Annika game

13
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
I was a big fan

14
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,816
18/20 of Sonic Adventure 2 battle

15
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,376
Play the hell out of that on a GameCube

16
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
Big fan

17
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,704
The rest of the games of that ilk

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,080
Absolute garbage.

19
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,480
3D games have had a very bad reputation

20
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,040
Finally by history

21
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
I'm going to

22
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:04,416
Okay this new one when it comes out I'm going to try it I can't I can't

23
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:10,816
Hope Springs Eternal my friend you could be burned over and over again income

24
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Come back to bed

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
That blue

26
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
Hedgehog

27
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
There is something to be said about a

28
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:22,080
Hedgehog that goes fast I don't I don't know what to say about that it doesn't really make

29
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
Make sense but

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,504
It is a part of my brain forever something also I think just really evocative about that sound when you get a ring

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
There is that

32
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,624
Takes you back really satisfied

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,000
My bright spot will soon be a blast spot whenever it

34
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,072
I have a bittersweet

35
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Brightspot

36
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
Over the weekend

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
The Laver cup happens named after Rod Laver use the tennis player

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
And I

39
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
Rodger Federer and Rafael Nadal played a doubles match and it was the last match of

40
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
Rodger Federer's career an exhibition kind of thing just for fun right

41
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:13,280
Everybody else their there was like a tournament or whatever but for the two of them they like what are we we're just here for fun

42
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,168
Afterwards

43
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
Everyone cried

44
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Uncontrollably

45
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
It was ridiculous to see like

46
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,128
Just grown men openly weeping in front of

47
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,200
Thousands of people Pete Sampras was there waiting

48
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
Andre Agassi

49
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
If you want just enough Wimbledon

50
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:44,256
Nobody was it was a really really amazing moment that you will never ever win

51
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
Miss again that's very sweet

52
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,608
Is really really cool

53
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
Mibor of tennis

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,472
But I am very happy for you

55
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
That's a big guy that's a big-time

56
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,360
So Jordan today we have an episode to go over

57
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:04,480
We're going to be talking about a special report that Alex put out on Saturday September 24th

58
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
2022

59
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
No

60
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
New new news

61
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
And last week

62
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
Alex

63
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Better blow up in

64
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,679
And I did get a little bit of feedback that on our last episode where we talked to Elizabeth Williamson

65
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
Did I give a whole lot of context

66
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
For what was going on in the courtroom

67
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:33,919
When Alex is having his blow up in somebody's face

68
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,247
But I had prepared but we had some recording difficulties

69
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,343
I wasn't able to use a recording software that would allow us to

70
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,671
Of course I am so we had our interview and

71
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:51,327
You know this already that the three of us had with what happened totally headspace where

72
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,727
The little inside baseball league and I apologize we should have done a little bit better job of laying some of the ground

73
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
I'm working

74
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:05,407
Yeah it is a little bit weird when all three of us have missed maybe two to three minutes of this entire trial

75
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,759
How are we going to expect

76
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,319
To come to the show having already known all these whores

77
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
It's so I mean

78
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,439
What I reflect on it a little more

79
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
It is almost as

80
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
Easy as a Galaxy to blow up

81
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,935
Regulate Every Lie Is there is not a ton of more to it there was

82
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
He was being questioned

83
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
About his coverage of Robbie Parker

84
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Chris baby

85
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
I asked him

86
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
Questions along the lines of

87
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,711
You put a Target on this guy's back did you not

88
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
And then Alex got really mad started saying about a liberal

89
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,855
Wanted to kill people in Iraq

90
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,695
Oh you pick and choose who you care about right

91
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
And meanwhile Norm

92
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,583
Paris was yelling objection over and over again anything and

93
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
Without the reason it was like it was like a TV show where somebody is pretending to be a lawyer and they just showed up

94
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
Injection in the judge has to be like

95
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,383
You have to have a reason to Norm was like I'm a real technical lawyer in the universe

96
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,711
He's unbelievable more than Shakira

97
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
Play the song

98
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,391
Cai mean that they had the jury

99
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Leave the courtroom

100
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
And the judge was confused

101
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
By the fact that normal subject

102
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,655
Think the things that Alex was saying right as opposed to things of the other Council sayings

103
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
It happened repeatedly that

104
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Norwood Macon

105
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Objection

106
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:42,431
And Alex will have already answered the question and won't stop talking

107
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,991
Constantly tried to explain to him

108
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
When your lawyer object

109
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
Stop talking

110
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,367
Absolute cuz you might not have to answer that question

111
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
We didn't register

112
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,559
No no it was it was like watching a t-ball game where the kid hit the

113
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,959
33 straight times and they're like well technically that's a strikeout but this is t-ball so I'm going to put it right back on

114
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,543
Mighty one more time alright Alex you can do this

115
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,663
Maybe next time and then the other thing that was a

116
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,295
Constant source of tension and a problem was that Alex would be asked yes or no questions

117
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,623
And then answer with a what was

118
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
Starting to be a monologue

119
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:29,279
I need to be reminded number of times you could just answer yes or no

120
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
If you answer yes or no

121
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Makes him look real bad

122
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,911
And the issue there is which I Feel Like We Do

123
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Fully

124
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
All understand in the courtroom

125
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
The reason that they look bad it's

126
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
It's because he's guilty

127
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
And he's already been found guilty

128
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,967
Reliable or whatever the right terminology

129
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
That you can't

130
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,343
You can't answer it away this like I'm maybe I'm going to get off on this one

131
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,023
That happened on Thursday and then on Friday

132
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Norm

133
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Announce that

134
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Alex was not going to be

135
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,679
Cross-examined he was going to waive his right to cross

136
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Examined

137
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,543
Cuz I was going to leave town he was going back to Austin there's a surprise move

138
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,943
Yeah they reserve the right to call him again apparently early this week maybe Tuesday or

139
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Hindu to be back

140
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:26,879
To be questioned Sommore

141
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,951
Call him again under subpoena cuz that's what you would have to

142
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:36,095
To do at this point but Norm is also said he's going to plan to call him to testify on his own behalf

143
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,703
And the main reason so he can actually monologue and not have to answer yes or no questions

144
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:47,103
Well I mean you know where the bread is buttered and why Norms getting a paycheck is a

145
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,503
Give me some time on that standard Run cover for me

146
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Nobody's ever gotten

147
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Airtime out of valley

148
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
Are Alex's got married

149
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:03,487
Yeah I understand not on cable but it'll do it'll do so

150
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
Alex came back to Oz

151
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
A.m.

152
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
You know why

153
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
Why did he do it

154
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,215
We have to we have to see this Saturday show to find out

155
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,287
He's telling the exact same story that I would tell which is that

156
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,103
He got spanked and then ran away with his tail between his legs

157
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:24,479
That is not what he has to say before she walks

158
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,039
So why these two just ahead of marriage

159
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,343
I just got a marriage recently

160
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,951

How many we got a couple of technocrats here in the next Jordan

Gary with a hard G and there's a long explanation of how to pronounce this

169
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Not like Jerry

170
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
Okay

171
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359

And then we're going to

At the end of the day

182
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
F*** you and your new world order

183
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
And f****** horse you rode in on

184
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
All your s***

185
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby

186
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
I'm Yours

187
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Tomorrow

188
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
And you never see me again

189
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
I never want to come back

190
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,231
I apologize

191
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Yesterday that I

192
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
Was legitimately having break

193
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
Better tomorrow boy he's not this is not a good show

194
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,103
As I was getting ready for you to show up

195
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
I really did feel like this

196
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
It feels like it's been awhile

197
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:38,111
It was just really only just been two episodes we had interview

198
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
Other people they put out one episode a week

199
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,047
So they're like well what are we doing our last two episodes that was practically a month ago for us like what their Lifeboat

200
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
We did that yesterday

201
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
Emotionally it feels like

202
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,423
It's baby but I'm up

203
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
All but it is not but we're back

204
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
After a Breaking of interview

205
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
So Alex

206
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Came back

207
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
From Connecticut

208
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
Really big reason why and it is

209
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
The headline

210
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
Of his emergency

211
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
LOL

212
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,087
Yeah mushroom cloud a fire

213
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,743
I just got back last night from Connecticut a show trial and I'm following the news globally a boy

214
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
Ward

215
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,423
Incredibly dangerous levels in Ukraine and I'm strongly considering not even going back to testify

216
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
On my own behalf in our part of the trial

217
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Show trial

218
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
Concern

219
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
Without my family would a war Rec Center

220
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
That's why I took my wife and my youngest daughter

221
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Midnight

222
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,807
Grown-up or almost out of school

223
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Tore out

224
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Moana showing High School

225
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
And they got my parents

226
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
And family here

227
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
When it's that serious okay

228
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
I've never acted like that I never behave like that

229
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:56,191
Beefy's frequently acted like that but yeah apparently it's I do want to be stuck in Connecticut with a noob starflyer

230
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,519
That's that's a that's an all-time great

231
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,919
Excuse that really. Really is it's not bad if if I was a teacher if I was like a first grade teacher and a student was like

232
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
I'm not going to do that homework and I was like why and they're like

233
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,111
Well assassination could happen at any moment to my father and I don't want to be stuck doing homework

234
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
Instead of taking a bullet for him

235
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,303
You the bad person in this scenario I would rather I would love to do this book report but Putin's out-of-hand

236
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,863
No he's

237
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,263
Also cool that is other kids can just be fine

238
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
I'll handle Dukes on their own but the young ones

239
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,175
I don't know about new I don't mind being separate separate from the case of a nuke

240
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
Yeah the team

241
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,575
Listen you don't want to be trapped inside with them even during a nuke sorry

242
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,695
Maybe a little bit but that is a headline

243
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,791
Nuclear war, right around the corner.

244
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,631
The New World Order is upon us okay and

245
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,447
Flip through here that I can even I almost

246
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
I seriously minute email to go to Connecticut to defend myself

247
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,127
We're going to Global depression the borders are collapsing

248
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
People are dying by the millions in the poison shots

249
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
We are inside the New World Order license John

250
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,439
You're absolutely inside the Louisville take over the great reset it's all here it's all happened just like they said they would do it

251
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,279
People are dying by the Millions

252
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,839
I was trying to

253
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
Forget whether or not he

254
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
So he's saying that that's cap

255
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Currently yes

256
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,823
We're losing millions and millions of people are dying because of covid-19 cuz of the covid

257
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Alright

258
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
How many millions of LK

259
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,015
I feel like this is one of those this is one of those

260
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
Math problems where you're like

261
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Okay sure

262
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:55,231
You say a million a day that's a problem but it only takes like a week before it's 10 trillion people dead or whatever you know what I'm saying

263
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Population

264
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
One of those problems

265
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
Noble

266
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,679
Little boy can't remember it's like that's right that's the wrong one

267
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:09,567
Real factorio you got it probably not right either

268
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
Yeah I think this is a little bit

269
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:18,271
It's silly but if you were to ask him but how you knows this you'd say something about actuaries and then we

270
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Move on it

271
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
Assured

272
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Scumming

273
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
It's going to happen

274
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,255
Millions of people are already dying cuz of the vaccine nuke seemed almost like week

275
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,327
I mean I guess it depends on

276
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
How wide

277
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
Whether or not nukes

278
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,959
Who killed Millions not fair certainly there would be Fallout

279
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
You know that that could have

280
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
Some pretty serious after effects

281
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
Screw up air travel out of Connecticut

282
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
That's one thing we know for certain

283
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,735
I find that difficult to understand the direct

284
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:54,879
Who won the Duke I think people would still be flying out of kinetic Rent-A-Car

285
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Nobody's driving

286
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Connecticut

287
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
So

288
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
DMV the nukes

289
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
There,

290
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
But there's

291
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
One way

292
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
That we can stop this thing

293
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495
And the way you trigger the public to peacefully protest

294
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,823
And the flood the streets with Candlelight vigils a transcend party

295
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
Is by checking the slideshow fever right

296
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,991
On mainstream platforms like Twitter and Instagram and Facebook

297
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
They don't get her and and

298
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
Independent groups like Gab

299
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
And

300
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
Everywhere else

301
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:34,559
Because you are the info Warriors and without you ladies and gentlemen we are not going to be able to stop this we have a good chance

302
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
Shopping list

303
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Predict

304
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
A 50% chance

305
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
Tactical nuclear war

306
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
In the next few months in Europe

307
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
That will cause a global depression

308
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Incredible problems

309
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,639
You'll be nightmare Beyond imagination

310
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
And

311
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,991
Fremont animal Santa Cruz I'm doing about a 20% chance

312
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
I'm a full-on nuclear war

313
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Show

314
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
I have a lot of trouble

315
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
Publishing all the side issues

316
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
Melissa's going on

317
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
Yeah that's if you want to stop nuclear war you need to spread Alex's content all over the place free advertising for him

318
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Will

319
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
Initiate

320
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,263
Write series of

321
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,407
Bipartisan Candlelight vigil says not to Nuke anybody that's a good idea

322
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,247
Yeah that is a good idea I mean if your Alex and you just want people to

323
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
Spread it around that is a great idea

324
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,695
Does he and throw this out at cuz I think based on what he's telling me

325
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,535
Because nuclear war is so imminent and almost

326
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
Brinkley unavoidable I mean it's a coin for

327
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
Whether or not we have a new attack

328
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Pickle nuclear war

329
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,727
Which I would argue if you start with the Tactical one

330
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
You're going to get a full one pretty quick

331
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,847
Yeah well one leads to the other attack

332
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
Is he still selling stuff though

333
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Oh yeah

334
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,831
It feels like that's not important or like if the court isn't important it does tertiary things

335
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
2

336
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,975
I feel like money is less important now than it's ever B O U Back

337
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
It's not though

338
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:13,631
Suspend this is a three hour long

339
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
I would say

340
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
45 to 50 minutes

341
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,495
Straight edge

342
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
It is so much I was going to say how many you cut out all of the not add so we're going to listen to about 15 minutes of

343
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,711
Free show who cumulative available

344
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
I mean I have Captain some of the ads just

345
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
For flavor but like

346
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,135
Seriously though

347
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
50/50 chance

348
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
I mean that's a truck

349
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
Yeah that's very serious I got a hug

350
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
The kids

351
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
People better take this more serious

352
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
Anything I've ever taken in their life

353
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Is that real

354
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Are you better

355
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
Your children

356
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
Better better hug your mom your dad

357
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Your brother your sister your mom

358
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
You better get right with God

359
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,663
I'm telling myself that when I point my finger at you

360
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
3 more pointing back at me

361
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
But we're coming under judgment ladies and gentlemen now

362
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
Are all the serious documented news

363
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
Couple weeks

364
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
Countless text Anson County

365
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Videos

366
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
Talk about the 24th

367
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
Of September

368
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
2022

369
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
And how

370
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,983
All these historic historically of happened on this day

371
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,311
Jewish calendar and mysticism the rest of it

372
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
I'm not putting in stock in that

373
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,943
Clearly every time the world's on the verge of a cataclysm

374
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,759
The general public will pick a date and decide is that

375
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
It's not that.

376
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Causing it's the place

377
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
And point in Time Warner

378
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
Bartels at something that

379
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,279
That's wonderful

380
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
September 24th stuff was like weird qanon

381
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,423
Going around online

382
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,823
Are you Alex choosing to do things on certain days because of the numbers

383
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,919
Prison their Arcane by meaning

384
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:08,319
Closer than it had been a thousand years that he was like yeah they totally choose that day what are you talkin about

385
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:14,719
Interesting when it's convenient for him to be into Arcane esoteric b*******

386
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,303
When it's convenient for him to just ask her to look down on it

387
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,631
I mean if he looked me in the eyes and said

388
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
Jordan

389
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,727
Correlation does not equal causation I think I throw hands

390
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Instantly

391
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,823
Like I wouldn't be able to stop myself what a Visa Jordan

392
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
Factorial

393
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,455
I'd be like I was looking for that word earlier thank you think I was looking for grateful

394
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
So Alex

395
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,319
You know of course. You look like you didn't care at his trial because

396
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
Nuclear war was on the mind

397
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,415
And that's why you was look like a aloof.

398
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Dick I get that

399
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
That but

400
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,743
There's other things that are happening

401
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
Allegiances are shift

402
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
Alright loyalties are being tested okay

403
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Ted Cruz

404
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,703
Kill the queen sported

405
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,495
Merging with big media

406
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Having total immunity

407
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Normal person

408
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,151
Accurate the other line supports World War 3 by the way

409
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,271
Really now unclogs and shows you the horrible person he always was

410
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,111
I tried to hope that he was an opportunist and went against Trump and

411
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,159
All that because she just wanted power

412
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,464
But I hope that you don't in the end

413
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
He cared about his family but he doesn't

414
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
He is a Goldman Sachs

415
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Operative

416
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
Bad as they get

417
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
You went against

418
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
Trump

419
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:36,128
I mean this Batman sequels bad 922 so we'll see

420
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:42,528
Do it again I'll write down the date there we'll see how long it is before Ted Cruz is fine

421
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
Probably a week

422
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:51,232
Ted Cruz is actually a secret Patriot but he was a double secret Goldman Sachs double pay for something extreme that

423
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,632
I got me back orders for real this time or whatever

424
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,496
Is this a that Beto is better than Ted Cruz cuz at least paid I will tell you what he's about

425
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
Alright well

426
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,872
I guess I was going to be alright fundraising for Beto

427
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,176
Yeah but a baby boo

428
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,736
So Alex has been dealing with some bankruptcy

429
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,552
Situation naturally last week

430
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,648
The the judge Judge Lopez right bankruptcy case

431
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,232
Removed his lawyers and his

432
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
Reorganization officer

433
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,912
Because of conflicts of interest and the lack of transparency that was very clear on Alex's part

434
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,472
And excessive spending

435
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
That's suspicious

436
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,872
You wouldn't expect somebody whose business was going in through a bankruptcy

437
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,200
$80,000 on security for a trip

438
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
I took Connecticut that you cut short

439
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,808
Yeah yeah but I mean

440
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Nuclear war

441
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,672
Fair enough to save your life

442
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
From a nuke

443
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,280
With eight other guys really feel when it is it is

444
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,864
Yeah so and anyway Alex has some spin

445
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
For the bankruptcy

446
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
So I wanted to bankruptcy.

447
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,496
Extra money

448
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
The donor that scrutiny

449
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
And

450
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:16,736
A lot of people see that ago you're closing your door so chapter 5 is emergency reorganization

451
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,552
Where you show your having trouble paying your bills

452
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
But then you do and reorganization wear it

453
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,672
Sets The Benchmark for how much money you actually have

454
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
So we can stay on here

455
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
Continue to operate and also

456
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
Show the state quarter body else

457
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,400
When they claim at $4000000 like they falsely did the Texas show trial

458
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,496
We can show certified all the stuff that's just a lie

459
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
Infowars

460
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,944
Preach me systems to stay on air

461
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
Operate because they have federal laws

462
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
We're not supposed to just be able to sue somebody

463
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
And shot him down

464
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
We're very transparent about that

465
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
Why we're doing it

466
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
And I'll just address this now here

467
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
I never been in bankruptcy

468
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
We never even

469
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,816
Taking loans here

470
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
And

471
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
Except for my dad

472
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
I looked at the big

473
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,752
Situation was doing on the fact we were in solid seeing all their lies

474
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,056
The table

475
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
I know the bankruptcy and then most lawyers don't work

476
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
Most people don't work that's what I got some good lawyer

477
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,552
But then where the Court's work should have other Shepherd lawyers that don't work for you

478
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
Bankruptcy

479
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
And those lawyers

480
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,464
The judge ruled last week Judge Lopez in Texas

481
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
Had not been transparent

482
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
About everything

483
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
They don't the past not bad things but

484
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,704
The fact that they publicly done our last bankruptcy

485
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
Democrats kick back

486
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,544
We got Infowars the website back

487
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,616
And if it works Health it's a successful company

488
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
Very real bankruptcy

489
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
What kind of free speech systems to buy quote pay debtors

490
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
They wanted to show true

491
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
I didn't want that bankruptcy.

492
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,928
Hold up Alicia actually owe them money

493
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,792
Find a lawyer the cro that they pointed

494
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
Did not disclose you know what's Publix all the news

495
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Clothes that

496
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
But they done the previous

497
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
Bankruptcy just months before

498
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,032
Bankruptcy and a another

499
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
You don't say

500
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,080
Former

501
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,616
To the judge removed

502
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,640
Cro

503
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,944
And of two Shepherd coat independent lawyers

504
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
We're all by the way

505
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
I want saying anything I'm just saying

506
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
Okay your old lawyer in Texas was a former high-powered democratic

507
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:41,376
Right

508
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
This is not

509
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
Really

510
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
Fair Tucker. Quite accurate

511
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:52,640
What are the concerns was that these people who are the other bankruptcy

512
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,456
Employment at Infowars

513
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
And there was a

514
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,528
A concern that they would

515
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,064
Have a conflict

516
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,624
If there was something that was inconvenient to Alex

517
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,512
Right I am so they were not impartial in a way they could be trusted by the bankruptcy court

518
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,656
So you're saying that if you hired a lawyer who is very interested in getting a job for you

519
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,216
Right and that lawyer did a good job

520
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
Then that lawyer would get that

521
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Right

522
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,592
So maybe that lawyer would have an incentive

523
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
To do a

524
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Float

525
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
Good job

526
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:32,832
Weld opposed to a accurate what these concerns could be there and then I believe also

527
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
You know

528
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,624
Somebody

529
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,416
Who have somebody who's

530
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
Holy independent because

531
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,256
I've ordered of what you're looking at you

532
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,584
Like a web of family businesses

533
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,864
And you know

534
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:48,960
If you're somebody who has any reason to have deference towards Alex

535
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,496
You're going to

536
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
Probably run into some brick wall

537
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:58,176
You're going to run into brick walls that you didn't even know you needed to ask about you know it's that kind

538
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,760
Even if you are doing a good job Alex will say something

539
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,808
And if you believe any word he says

540
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
He's going to get away with one thing

541
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,672
Ghetto like it doesn't matter if he gets away with all of it

542
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
But you just don't

543
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
Have the capacity to get

544
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
Every single thing

545
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Unless you are completely

546
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,096
I supposed supposed to his

547
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,912
Oranjestad

548
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:23,008
Completely neutral to it if you were just doing your job

549
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,056
Well right by the book

550
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
No attachment

551
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,688
That's fine it is it is so infuriating when he

552
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:34,272
Complains like they claimed I have 400 million dollars no

553
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
The guy made an estimate

554
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,088
Based upon what he

555
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,112
He could glean

556
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,440
From the amount of Life finances that you gave

557
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
To him in the first

558
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,328
If you'd given him your actual Finance wasn't it he wouldn't have asked you mated s***

559
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,728
Also along the lines of like this is an estimate of what a business test numbers license

560
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
Wellwood looked at

561
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
Well-run business

562
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,152
Speaking of a badly run business Alex's book

563
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,200
Deal apparently wasn't so good

564
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,016
Get the great reset with the world sign

565
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,832
That's a donation as well as was $99

566
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,136
Something bucks

567
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,672
World right now

568
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,512
And again blisters also FNAF world

569
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
Teddy's house

570
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
$76,000

571
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Came in

572
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
2 weeks ago

573
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,384
That's great

574
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,944
I'm so running out of money I'mma keep 20,000

575
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
And put the other

576
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,808
Groudon and yeah

577
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,624
Another 80,000

578
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
But that's how books work

579
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,488
It's not the number one book in the world

580
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,144
Also it said number 18 on Amazon now

581
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,912
Every now and again

582
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:00,288
January 6th report number 15 okay performing Alex on Amazon

583
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:06,688
They sell the January 6th report Steve Doocy and his wife

584
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Cookbook

585
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:12,320
Sliding down to number 1080 of falling

586
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,856
Also still beating Alex

587
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,648
Be very hungry caterpillar

588
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,952
But that's should be there forever

589
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,792
The Barefoot Contessa's cookbook is a number 16 beating Alex

590
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
Wow

591
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:28,192
Who is the Barefoot Contessa is it all of us or is it like the friends we met along the way

592
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,240
Oh okay

593
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
Also Colleen Hoover

594
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Killing it

595
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
So many so much

596
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Book Sales

597
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,712
Damn people like that why a romantic really do

598
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,088
Alex should have negotiated a better deal on these books

599
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,624
And also

600
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,440
Where are we at if you need to

601
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:55,840
You keep 20,000 of that for yourself as opposed to putting it into the business

602
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
Right

603
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
It makes no sense based on

604
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,680
The way he lives

605
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
WhatsApp

606
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,104
Yeah okay fine then you get okay then don't tell us you're keeping 20004

607
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,664
Yep so Alex

608
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
Answer some

609
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,248
Clips from the trials that he wants to play

610
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Cuz this is about

611
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Nuclear war

612
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,904
And I would have now are before hit more news and bring Robert Barnes on hit this other news

613
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
Some of these little excerpts

614
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
That the crew put together

615
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,048
One of them is where they attacked me over

616
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
Cryptocurrency like I'm a criminal

617
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
Charlotte Craven little promo together

618
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,960
And then we're going to

619
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
Go ahead and air before I

620
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,848
Left yesterday Connecticut went to a apple orchard with my wife and daughter

621
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
My five-year-old

622
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
And I'd AJ

623
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
What

624
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
Talks about

625
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,576
The ultimate Revolution God's green earth

626
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,368
The counter to the tree of death

627
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:57,792
What apple orchard did you just tell me what are you telling me that he's going to play a clip

628
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
Of him in the courtroom

629
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
AAA

630
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Compilation

631
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
Put together by his

632
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,984
His team is also going to play a clip

633
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
Of him

634
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
And his wife and his daughter walking

635
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
Through an orchard

636
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,872
Because that's got the Ultimate Green Earth Revolution

637
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,480
I mean it's just really kind of a nice Saturday I suppose so

638
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,040
I'm fine with you having a nice Saturday

639
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:24,928
Chicken playing piano on the Georgia guidestone

640
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,976
Problem

641
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:31,072
With the Alex's getting crypto or anything like that and it wasn't in the case

642
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
That wasn't the problem

643
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
The issue that was

644
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,960
Trying to be elucidated by Chris Mattie

645
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,008
What is the issue of

646
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
Alex

647
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:45,920
Do people know that when they give you crypto it goes to your personal account

648
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
As opposed to

649
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:50,016
Because that could be seen as maybe deceptive

650
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,088
Fund the infowar donate

651
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
82 this we're going to go straight

652
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,184
His wallet Rhino that that might be

653
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,768
Manipulative business has he said in the dryer

654
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,816
Right he said

655
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,864
I understand what you're saying but it all just goes

656
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,656
Through my personal account

657
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,680
To the business

658
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
Now I would argue that perhaps

659
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,288
For a good piece of evidence

660
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
Sty maybe we should be

661
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Be suspicious about that

662
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
He said

663
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:22,272
I'm going to take $20,000 right now cuz my book money that I said I was going to put all into the business

664
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
Reason to be suspicious

665
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,856
What is definitely no Trail

666
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,952
Is it going to be aware aware of than that money did go

667
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:36,352
To the business and I mean I guess if you want to put it like really super abstractly like a going to his legal fees or some

668
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Being like that

669
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,192
It still hasn't?

670
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,216
Bright

671
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,264
Highway Barnes is going to be on

672
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:49,408
He's going to do or use on to talk about Russia in the nuclear war

673
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
Going to say about the case

674
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,088
Robert Barnes joins us Robert will also Odyssey into Russia the huge escalation there that is the

675
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
Big Central story

676
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
But there

677
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,720
Baffled wrapping an output in Signal not bluffing Friday nuclear war

678
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,280
That's coming up the shower as well but I think it's important

679
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
Front center

680
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,608
To talk about the show trial and

681
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
Your observations

682
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,240
Who are you seeing a bunch of crying parents

683
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,056
Bargain Bin Ford Avenue

684
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:21,408
A lot of former judges and current judges in a lot of people call my lawyers instead

685
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
Wow this blow up in their faces is not going well

686
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
Yeah

687
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
That's a vibe

688
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
Then oh

689
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,088
That's that's not something you like

690
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,880
Here yeah it is

691
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,696
It is fun

692
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
Because I got company

693
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
It is

694
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
It is fun to like

695
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,072
Listen to Matty in court

696
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Just be like

697
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,936
You're using this trial as a fundraiser as we speak

698
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,240
Irony because

699
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:52,640
You did say went out to talk about the crypto things like you're going to use that in an ad liquor and then he did

700
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,968
There's a part of me that wonders if you would have used it in a diff

701
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
You hadn't upset

702
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
Like maybe that's trolling

703
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
And if so

704
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,832
Fairplay

705
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,368
You know I guess it's

706
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
Duo

707
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,976
It's a little shady but dude do what you got to do is

708
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
He didn't have the idea

709
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,864
At all gave it to him he's like

710
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:19,520
That's a concern how could I possibly have left money on the table like that

711
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Yeesh

712
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,872
Yeah it's a barn sucks

713
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
Stu

714
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,176
Allison Barnes

715
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,248
Boy this is a bad display of

716
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,576
Just a bunch of psychos sitting there being weird as s***

717
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Yeah

718
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Just lying

719
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,464
They showed a magazine we put out

720
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,536
With Obama on the cover saying Obama comes for your gun

721
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,120
Let them talk about how I didn't like Obama in case yours are Democrats

722
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
When my lawyer tried to come back

723
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,496
And cross-examine the judge said no politics

724
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
I mean

725
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
There's a point of this whole trial

726
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,456
Is 2% a trailer only one side is

727
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
Is allowed to present their case

728
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
And it's the part of the case.

729
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,808
It's not considered relevant

730
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
For this day

731
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
And that's that's exactly what

732
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
Play sand

733
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
Fortunately

734
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
Fully resist their effort

735
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,280
For you to play there

736
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
Script for you to stay

737
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,632
To their tail you to play the villain in their rule

738
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,680
Oh yeah I don't think so

739
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,752
It's why they could never afford a trial on the merits why they couldn't

740
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
Never give you

741
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
You're dating

742
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,592
In court as we've seen president mean

743
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Lead Witness

744
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
Was an FBI guy

745
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,944
You know nobody who died

746
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
That day

747
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,736
Why is he suing

748
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,272
What is DM

749
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
You still in the FBI FBI lawyer

750
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
FBI lawyer

751
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Doing Alex

752
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:42,720
Never heard of me

753
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
Until the suit

754
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,328
He did not admit that Alex ever said his name he says he didn't

755
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,168
No it doesn't know if you did and Alex can't say that he didn't

756
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
No

757
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
No because

758
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,592
There are so many videos but they did not produce you got it so legally Alex can't make that claim

759
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,408
And this is pretty shity on

760
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,200
To try and prevent this person

761
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:07,040
Bill Oldenburg as just an FBI lawyer who is no

762
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,904
Connection to the case as if he wasn't somebody who responded to the school

763
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,744
As if he wasn't somebody who was the subject of

764
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,280
Conspiracy theories surrounding

765
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,352
People being actors that ended up conflating him

766
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,936
With the mister wheeler and grieving parent has if he doesn't have to

767
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,216
PTSD from just

768
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,240
Walking on that say

769
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:30,336
Just being there be a lawyer

770
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,640
Contrasting API lawyer

771
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:39,040
It seems like their rules and s*** but if Barnes is allowed to save this stuff in public and still be

772
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
The lawyer I feel like there aren't

773
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
Really is even

774
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
Much of a lawyer

775
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Think he does stuff for

776
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,424
That's quite frankly that is a good point I'm sure he would be disbarred if anybody had reason to

777
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,824
I mean like I think that a lot of the stuff he does doesn't end up getting into a quart

778
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,224
Waterfalls on Alex's show and talk about

779
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
Do the vaccine people

780
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,160
So Barnes just as a completely distorted

781
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
War

782
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,720
View of what happened in that courtroom

783
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,512
Yeah I was waiting to hear

784
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,048
From any of the plaintiff

785
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
Call

786
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,120
That their injury was

787
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,936
Caused by something you said or did

788
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,240
And instead what I heard was stories

789
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
Been mostly relate

790
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,288
Do you at all

791
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,872
So I mean you could he's just pretending to that whole thing about Matt Mills

792
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,688
The guy who interrupted the Super Bowl press conference

793
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Didn't happen in the courtroom

794
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:47,136
Because that would to satisfy this curiosity that that he has

795
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:52,768
This is just selectively removing these things from the conversation about the because they're inconvenient

796
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,816
You want there to be nothing

797
00:37:55,328 --> 00:38:00,192
You want there to be no connection editor needed no connection for your argument to make any sense

798
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,520
So there wasn't anything there was

799
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,104
It shouldn't get in the way of whether or not what you need

800
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,176
To be a good time

801
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
It's a good time

802
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Anyways fireship

803
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
So Alex

804
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Believes

805
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,088
He is scared to play

806
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
Attorneys

807
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,416
Well I mean emotionally Maybe

808
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,720
He thinks that they are like

809
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,816
So worried about the the case now he's blown It Wide Open

810
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,400
I can't get into attorney-client stuff obviously Robert

811
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
But

812
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,728
They were calling her lawyers back there

813
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,032
Yesterday morning they were in full panic

814
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,080
They were on the ropes

815
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
And

816
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,408
They basically didn't even want me to testify yet

817
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
Yesterday

818
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,968
And didn't know what to do

819
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,576
And we said yeah we'll just come back we're a little quote for sour case you know where handcuffs

820
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,624
And it straight jacket in the restricted

821
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
Next week

822
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,208
Why even have your normal cross-examination

823
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,512
Unlimited stuff Maddie said because Maddie

824
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,560
Better nor Patterson's words but

825
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,608
They were in complete panic

826
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,168
Even the media agreed they blow up in their face

827
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,216
So yeah

828
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,544
Is real worried real scared of of Alex's

829
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Righteous

830
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
Triumphant

831
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Outburst

832
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,664
Oh man this is coward s***

833
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,944
This is coward s***

834
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:22,368
That wouldn't engage in this real bad

835
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
Week

836
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:24,928
Oh man

837
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
All right I mean I don't want to

838
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,024
You don't like what out when I play baseball

839
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
You know I didn't

840
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,632
Get a strikeout and then I was like see the problem was the ball was afraid to hit my

841
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,984
Mybat that was the main issue right it was that it wasn't the picture was good

842
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,384
Is it that bull was I got them terrified and also I want to I want you to write down really quick here

843
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
Norm said that Chris Maddie

844
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
S*** the bed

845
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,296
Yes write that down that'll be important later will do

846
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
Barnes

847
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
These people aren't ready to deal with

848
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,024
Truth people doesn't sound true like a boss like a Norman Alex

849
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
What do you see all this going

850
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
For me I think they're

851
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
Plan B

852
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
Because there's

853
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,728
Is false and that's their problem

854
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,288
So they're trying to die

855
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,312
Because Norm Patterson

856
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,848
Is refuse to go along with their f

857
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,384
Trial

858
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,664
And I and you

859
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
Refused to go along

860
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,272
With efforts to limit your ability to defend yourself attic

861
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
Quidleys York

862
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,088
Usually entitled to within the rules

863
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
They're not having sex

864
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
Success in your seeing their

865
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Frustration be

866
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,440
He publicly Express

867
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,976
I mean to be honest with you from

868
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
Pure legal person

869
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,280
Employer lawyer

870
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,072
This has been very

871
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
Incompetent

872
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
I mean these parents

873
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Effective represent

874
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,984
Understand that this is a very politically

875
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
Play powerful

876
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
Tolconnected Law Firm

877
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
In Connecticut

878
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,848
I heard from many people

879
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,384
We're on the plane excited

880
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
Who thought that

881
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
The plaintiff lawyer

882
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,528
And it's because he's more politically motivated

883
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
Did the prosecutor

884
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
It appears to me

885
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,368
Phineas actually can get

886
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Truth or Justice

887
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Is because

888
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,208
Would rule against him in action

889
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
Truth

890
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
Is in fact

891
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
And that's why he

892
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,304
He can't at least

893
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
Situation trying to

894
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
To do a soviet-style

895
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
Sassy styles

896
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,448
Cuban Fidel Castro style showed

897
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Trial

898
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
Because the truth

899
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
Is still leaking out

900
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
Anyway

901
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,104
Chris Mattie is bad Council says

902
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,688
King of bad counsel Robert Barn

903
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,760
About to be sued for

904
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:32,160
If we take anything that the Infowars corporate representative testified to under oath seriously

905
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Etheric

906
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
Considering suing

907
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
Hugh Robert Robert.

908
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,328
Mediastar Bobby Barnes for malpractice

909
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:44,192
It is it is ridiculous to say that they're doing a bad job

910
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
Because

911
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:50,592
Barnes believes that the job itself is is like impossible to do because it's

912
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,407
Spec right so you can't do a bad job

913
00:41:53,919 --> 00:42:00,063
Unless there is a real thing that you could do a good job for rights like if Barnes had advice up here's what you should have

914
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:06,463
You should have called this person or you should have cross-examined this way

915
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,255
Have not brought the suit

916
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
Yeah

917
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,839
Souls like

918
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:15,935
Shut the f****** also was the lawyer who filed

919
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:21,567
Alex Against The Young Turks so it's a little bit to pot

920
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
Iams kettle

921
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,175
Seems like way here was where things got real messy

922
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Barnes

923
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,807
Has a conspiracy about Sandy Hook

924
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,855
That is not good that's not good

925
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,927
The question was

926
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,975
Pick any better skin with a false flag

927
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
A false flag originated

928
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
From Pirates

929
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
Putting up a false flag to trick

930
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
The boat they were about to

931
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Hijack

932
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
Inlet and loop

933
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
That doesn't mean the Looting

934
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,495
Didn't happen

935
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,287
Didn't happen to post Flags event

936
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
Did in fact

937
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
But the cause

938
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,407
The culprit are in accurately identified

939
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,943
And that is precisely what happened

940
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,015
Issues concerning Sandy Hook

941
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,807
Which is it turns out the politician

942
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Pocketed the money

943
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
Rather than put school safety

944
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:13,279
And if they have done so if they've done something as simple as allowing teachers to lock the inside of the doors of the bathroom

945
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Inside their class

946
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
Be able to lock the inside of the door

947
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
It to their

948
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,191
Be able to have other means of self-defense available

949
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,495
Train people with guns

950
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,287
In the teachers and schools

951
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,103
Personnel

952
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
What date did paulito

953
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,919
Couldn't let that message

954
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Get out

955
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,735
And the reality is the Democratic Party

956
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,015
He didn't like the fact

957
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,295
You put up a pole

958
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
What might be a

959
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
False

960
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,439
But that's because what's the political reality right now

961
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
Political reality right now

962
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,071
Is the more school shootings happen the more plaintiffs lawyers like his firm profit

963
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:52,191
The more school shootings happen the more the Democratic party with their gun-control agenda process

964
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,495
They don't have an incentive to Max

965
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,519
Text my school safety

966
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
And that's why there today that's why they

967
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
Cover up what he

968
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
Sandy Hook

969
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,895
In the school safety inadequacy

970
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Wow

971
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,783
Alright so Barnes is getting added to the suit

972
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:12,159
Well this isn't even as bad as he gets

973
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
On this episode

974
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:18,815
Wow cuz he should be out of the suit he's now part of him towards around

975
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
Interesting

976
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,911
Desi territory said that the government covered it up

977
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Yeah

978
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,239
Damn that Democratic politicians

979
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:31,871
Embezzling and pocketing money that was

980
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:36,223
The shooting happened at makeup covering that up by

981
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:41,087
Bad sort of making an example of Alex or something messed up

982
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,391
Did the thing that you get sued for

983
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,671
In the thing that

984
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,719
In the place where they're getting sued for it

985
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,511
It's it's strange

986
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,791
The strange tactic

987
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:55,679
I mean if I were him I would I mean I would say that many might have said to me that he is

988
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471
Is not doing a good job as Council

989
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:01,055
Well he's not cancel

990
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
Amino acid uses

991
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:08,991
Stalking law degree as a prop basically extreme right-wing shows and his own podcast

992
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:12,063
Is

993
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,391
That pull that was brought up is actually

994
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:19,487
An important point so there was a pole on a Infowars

995
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:25,375
On the homepage that was what will the next false flag be a bombing a shooting or whatever right

996
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,679
Import of this the point of it was

997
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:33,567
To illustrate how Alex's conditioning in advance for the audience to believe things that happened

998
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
Baked before they hatch

999
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,151
Anything if you're predict

1000
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,711
Sting something is going to be a false flag

1001
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,503
When something happens

1002
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,039
You're going to think it's a false

1003
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,087
This is something that we've discussed

1004
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,367
Quite a bit

1005
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,159
In terms of Alex's baby

1006
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,719
The way he acts the way he

1007
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743
Get these

1008
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,303
These narratives in place in advance

1009
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
But V

1010
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,167
Itself was a really helpful visual

1011
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,471
Explanation of that and of course

1012
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
Barnes

1013
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,335
Doesn't like

1014
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
So

1015
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
Look Barnes

1016
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,151
Just

1017
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,431
These going for it

1018
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,455
He's swinging it something

1019
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,991
Alright cuz they wanted to blame

1020
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,295
The gun rather than let the world know

1021
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,343
Big Pharma has culpability here

1022
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,671
Because the way in which young men are being medicated on some of these

1023
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,207
Drugs is often back

1024
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
Firing in Arizona

1025
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,511
And has side effects

1026
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,791
They often don't fully

1027
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,095
Know about or meaningful remediate

1028
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
They don't want to talk about it

1029
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,495
Safety because that is stated the Democratic politicians and political class

1030
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
In

1031
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,591
And they don't want to talk about culture that glamorizes violence

1032
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,871
Because it's a cultural a prophet

1033
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,943
And they don't want to talk about media glamorizing

1034
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,479
These individuals that commit

1035
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
These horrible crime

1036
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,039
Because big media process

1037
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,319
It's a lot of the pot pocket

1038
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
The cash the most

1039
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
Anybody

1040
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
And that's why they had to

1041
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Blame the gun

1042
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,439
And blame Alex Jones

1043
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,975
They couldn't blame the shooter

1044
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
It couldn't blame Mental Health

1045
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
They couldn't blame school safety

1046
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,583
They couldn't blame big Pharma

1047
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,631
And they needed to continue to happen because

1048
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
It's the only way that

1049
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
Continue to politically

1050
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Prophet

1051
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,239
Off of the school shooting

1052
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
And that's what's this

1053
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,311
Disturbing that was maybe most unsettling

1054
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Is it case

1055
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,871
It's about preventing the harm from

1056
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
School shooting

1057
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
Consequences

1058
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,199
Vulnerable

1059
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,247
Is being used to cover up

1060
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,271
The true culprit

1061
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
Parties

1062
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,319
For the school shooting

1063
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,135
Cantu falsely blame those who are trying to defend

1064
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
Personal rights and liberties

1065
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,231
This is just b******* I mean

1066
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
Even if you take

1067
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Everything

1068
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,607
As true that you saying

1069
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
So you shouldn't

1070
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,471
Yeah but even if you do the trial that's going on isn't about school safety

1071
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,775
It's not about any of this stuff it's about the

1072
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,847
Harm than Alex cause to these people

1073
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,127
By way of his

1074
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,175
Lies about them

1075
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,455
The

1076
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,015
Denial of their children's existence

1077
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,831
Yeah so I don't know I mean

1078
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,879
Interesting to throw a bunch of

1079
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,671
Mud at the wall and see

1080
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,975
See what kind of designs you can make out of it

1081
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
This is

1082
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,279
Disgraceful stuff

1083
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,815
I mean I just

1084
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:09,727
Sometimes you like with this clip especially I feel like you should play that in front of the jury as just

1085
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,847
It doesn't get more obvious that there's no other way to stop them then to stop

1086
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Because

1087
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,407
The lawyer

1088
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,223
Who started on viskase

1089
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
Yeah

1090
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,783
Who's Back years later

1091
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
During the case

1092
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,367
After he was kicked off of it

1093
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,439
To do the thing the cases about

1094
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:35,839
More less and I mean he's been monetizing coverage of this case

1095
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Eva fry Regal Barn

1096
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,167
Spry podcast or whatever the f***

1097
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,751
So he has every reason to have seen all of these things

1098
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,543
He's pretending it didn't happen

1099
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,639
Like the the Super Bowl press conference guide

1100
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:55,039
He's pretending that bill Altenburg is just an FBI lawyer he knows that that's not the case right

1101
00:48:55,295 --> 00:49:00,159
The trial and made money off the analysis of it right this is malicious lying

1102
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,439
Play no other way around

1103
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,767
No he's just intentionally lying to appease Alex and

1104
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,535
Create like

1105
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,095
Some kind of a weird reality where he

1106
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
Aggrieved

1107
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,191
Yeah I mean this is just

1108
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,727
This is just textbook

1109
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:14,751
Like

1110
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,591
Here's punitive damages the only punishment that will affect

1111
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,663
But like when you say punitive damages the point of

1112
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
Punitive damages is to

1113
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,503
Punish the behavior

1114
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,807
To get the behavior to stop not to like

1115
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,367
Find the behavior like hey okay

1116
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:35,231
If you kick that dude in The Shins you always five bucks but you can kick him in the Shins as long as you got five bucks

1117
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,791
You know right is you have to

1118
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
To stop this

1119
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,863
It's happening on the show

1120
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,447
After trial already did that

1121
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,983
Oh my God

1122
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,311
Make money printing cost money

1123
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,591
Fretboard

1124
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,151
So he's got to try to hide and lion grants

1125
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Because he's

1126
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,735
Dealing from a deck

1127
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:57,759
Deceit

1128
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
He can't come across as a

1129
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,575
Is a credible office

1130
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,623
Truthful voice in the courtroom

1131
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,415
And that's why he

1132
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,439
He continued to look

1133
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,463
Bad is because

1134
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
Cuz he was unable to track

1135
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,535
He was unable to provoke you

1136
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,071
Different talking about Maddie

1137
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:15,935
Unable to provoke them a little

1138
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,727
Steve

1139
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
Richard response

1140
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,287
Play Imagine You Are

1141
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
Any was unable

1142
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,335
How to get away with

1143
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
A concert

1144
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,151
Lies in the manner and method in which he made

1145
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
His presentation

1146
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,223
He couldn't get away with it

1147
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,015
In his grandstand vision of this

1148
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,087
Political theater where he's the hero at the end of the documentary in the

1149
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
The film

1150
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,927
In that span fyp

1151
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
I thought this was about

1152
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
I thought this was

1153
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,047
News about

1154
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
Personal injury

1155
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
I thought this was about under

1156
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,375
Disputed

1157
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,191
I'm not seeing any of that

1158
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
I'm seeing politic

1159
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
Politics

1160
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
Politics

1161
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:51,775
Theater

1162
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,799
Theater theater

1163
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
Because that

1164
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
The plaintiff Scout

1165
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,127
Has always been about

1166
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
They have used

1167
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
These Perron

1168
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,967
For the game of the

1169
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,991
The political class

1170
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,807
With which they are aligned in the political causes

1171
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
Which they are assigned

1172
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,623
That's the real

1173
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,951
Might be

1174
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,999
Plaintiff

1175
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,535
B b

1176
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,327
I think you should be added to those

1177
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
Case I mean I don't know what else

1178
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,911
To say other than if you say

1179
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,983
The parents are being used by powerful interest

1180
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,263
Then you are

1181
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,311
Part of the Sandy Hook denial

1182
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,639
How if you are the plaintiff

1183
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,943
How do you respond to that

1184
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:37,599
Because if you say no I'm not being used by only you are you just don't know that you're being used

1185
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,159
Best way to use somebody's if they don't know they're being used

1186
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:44,767
Right if you have a sincere belief in the case that you are

1187
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,071
A part of than this

1188
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,119
Is a denial of your trauma

1189
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,959
I do lose the denial of your experience

1190
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,239
At very least

1191
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,031
If not legally actionable

1192
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
So shity

1193
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,639
It's unbelievably shity here is what

1194
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
He is saying

1195
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,943
He is saying

1196
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,991
That ultimately

1197
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,807
What they went through was meaningless

1198
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,879
And it has nothing nothing to do with anything

1199
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
And no one cares

1200
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,487
Yeah so your barns

1201
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
Start sucks

1202
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
Yep

1203
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:21,631
He also thinks that. Sandy Hook

1204
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
Conspiracies

1205
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
This is a Tesla

1206
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,263
Show me on this one is a fun one

1207
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,031

Relief

1212
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
Even talk

1213
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:33,919
About Elmo

1214
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,455
Everybody suing

1215
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,759
Infowars mostly dinner

1216
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,527
Was a

1217
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,807
Critic is Paul Joseph

1218
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,087
Watson the editor during the summer

1219
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,367
Time frame

1220
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,415
Critic of the Sandy Hook the Niagara Movement

1221
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,743
Infowars was a restraint on the Sandy Hook deniability

1222
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:48,767
The

1223
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,583
Skateboards made no money off of the Sandy Hook Taniya movie

1224
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,655
We have had honor debates on who was right

1225
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,983
Absolutely Indie people were mad at you

1226
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,519
You calling you both Bridges

1227
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,799
Saying that you were fake

1228
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,335
Because you were critical

1229
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
Deniable

1230
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,151
For so long and

1231
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
And so often

1232
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,199
And so many other people were

1233
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
And info

1234
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,015
And the reality is the reason why

1235
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,807
People went to

1236
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,367
Conspiracy theories in the denier movement was be

1237
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
Because

1238
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
The politicians in kinetic

1239
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
We're covering up there

1240
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,975
Complicity and culpability

1241
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
Indian attic

1242
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,767
Receive school safety

1243
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
That's why they're destroying this

1244
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,839
School that's why they're hiding

1245
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,631
From the sunshine laws

1246
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,399
That's why they're not

1247
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
For your information act

1248
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
Open records Act

1249
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,775
Request that triggered a lot of

1250
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,567
Conspiracy theories

1251
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
Say anything wrong in there

1252
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,615
Conclusion

1253
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,663
He wasn't fat cover up take

1254
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,431
Taking place by the

1255
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,223
In Connecticut

1256
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,759
In the only case the kinetic

1257
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,783
Quartz didn't allowed to go

1258
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,575
Who's the one that exposed

1259
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,111
Schools for inadequate School safe

1260
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
They allowed seven

1261
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,415
$3000000

1262
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,439
Shakedown

1263
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,255
And now they're allowing another

1264
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:56,607
By the way the judge bars me from letting them know about that

1265
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,935
I can't get to let people know about that

1266
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:03,263
I guess there is apparently a cover-up

1267
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,287
Yeah

1268
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:07,103
This is not something that is

1269
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,407
Long-standing as a defense

1270
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:15,807
Alex Dusty I've not been aware of this this life maybe I miss

1271
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,087
Just a couple episodes

1272
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,951
This was guy to now when Barnes is on sometimes so. That might explain it but this

1273
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
This team does

1274
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:28,095
Pretty f****** over-the-top right it seems off the beaten path a little bit

1275
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
There's that and

1276
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
Just

1277
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,423
Disgraceful

1278
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:38,079
Well I mean it might as well be a full-court buzzer beater is what he's going for

1279
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,383
He's he's trying to throw it away

1280
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,943
Not good and there's a couple things in

1281
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,503
That explanation that he was

1282
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,039
Offering that

1283
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
I think our

1284
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,135
Farpoint one is it Paul was fairly critical

1285
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,159
Of this

1286
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,975
Right you don't get to use that he was not listen

1287
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,023
He was critical of you

1288
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:02,655
Yeah and you didn't listen to it being critical of other people he said specifically

1289
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
You guys

1290
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,263
Yes Alex you need to stop this Alex he use your name

1291
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,383
Alex is going to complain about other people. There's that and then the second thing

1292
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
Is that

1293
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:19,039
You know Barnes does bring up something to did happen and that was that some people were mad that Alex was

1294
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
Olympic streaming

1295
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,831
On this conspiracy

1296
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:21,855
Guess what

1297
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,439
He got more extreme

1298
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,511
I think that this argument works

1299
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,559
Very solidly against Alex

1300
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,351
But I guess it

1301
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,423
What's better for him

1302
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,983
Is that if you ever get to reality

1303
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,519
In any of these Siri

1304
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,799
You're going to find it works

1305
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,823
Against Alex

1306
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,103
On account of reality

1307
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,663
That is true every part of reality that you would

1308
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,199
Inject into their

1309
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,223
Conspiracies you're like

1310
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:54,623
Well that sounds bad for Alex that's the real world it's a reality of stationary in in some ways

1311
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,183
So we on Friday

1312
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,487
Interview with Elizabeth Williams

1313
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
I did not expect

1314
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,143
But she factors heavily into this episode

1315
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,983
Alex is mad about a tweet that you put

1316
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,567
Let me do that

1317
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,943
And all the other huge news it's not that it's not going to shine there I want your view on Russia

1318
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,479
Economy Inn Maggie

1319
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,855
Elizabeth Williamson

1320
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,159
This woman is a

1321
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,183
Sandy Hook grip

1322
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
This woman writes her book

1323
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
Proud make money on San Diego accuses me of it

1324
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:37,631
She goes around for years and says stuff that's not true or Twisted about maconce

1325
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
Winner really follow her

1326
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
But

1327
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
Yesterday

1328
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,775
About to leave

1329
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
Leah

1330
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,823
Airbnb

1331
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,103
We decided not to

1332
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,919
Do the cross-examination just do my own case next week

1333
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,807
When was Korea guys walked over his look here's the New York Times all over the news

1334
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:59,391
Can your lawyer just attacked you in court and said you were horrible person

1335
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,183
Everything you say is fake

1336
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,231
Terrible job

1337
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,351
Call Norm

1338
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,167
Videos

1339
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,751
He said that we didn't talk about you in the court cases

1340
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,823
What's behind this was it was in Chambers

1341
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:21,663
I want to cancel this there there there there on the roads I didn't say that

1342
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,223
I think you're the great job or B called me said you did a great job

1343
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,759
If you're joking

1344
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,807
I should have the text that he literally

1345
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,599
Play lost control

1346
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
Turn hallway

1347
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,463
And so she's I'm sorry I'm sorry I shouldn't have done it

1348
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,999
Norm

1349
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,815
I want to trust you but it's hard to believe she lied that

1350
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,607
Because I'm telling you

1351
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
Veritracks

1352
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
It's a lie

1353
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,935
Cheatham said I'm

1354
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,471
I'm sorry I made it up in a tweet

1355
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
So suffice it to say a lot of this is nonsense

1356
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,567
Here's what happened

1357
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,103
She put out a tweet

1358
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,735
That was essentially saying the Alex could have testified today if you wanted to

1359
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,039
But his lawyer said in court today

1360
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:03,903
He looked so bad in front of the jury some time away from that right

1361
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,183
What the Tweet was

1362
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:08,511
Now the issue was visapur paraphrase

1363
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,535
Then

1364
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:13,631
He didn't save that Norm didn't say that what he had said was

1365
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,447
But he wasn't going to have Alex testify

1366
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,239
Cuz I needed to lower the temperature

1367
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,335
This is the miscommunication bad paraphrasing

1368
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,127
That is engaged in

1369
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,919
And cheap

1370
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:32,319
Put a tweet out saying hey he didn't say this right so out of courtesy I talked to him and I'm on it

1371
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,927
Delete this tweet correction and I think

1372
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
You know I think

1373
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:42,559
Your your mileage can vary as they say but I think that's a fair paraphrasing

1374
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,887
Absolutely no that's what I that's what make

1375
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:52,287
Okay maybe that's not how Norm would experience it and then I don't know exactly what else you would have met by

1376
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,079
But we got to lower the temperature

1377
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,151
88

1378
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:02,527
And I understand why she retracted it and I do

1379
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:08,415
Write a note that's the poor paraphrasing

1380
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,695
On the other hand

1381
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,231
Words have to mean things

1382
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,279
And the words that Norm said

1383
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,071
Meme the words that Elizabeth

1384
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,631
So if you don't want words to mean things

1385
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,167
Then don't have work

1386
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,799
That is but there is enough wiggle room for interpretation I think that when you say he said

1387
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:31,199
It gets it gets a little bit messy but I think it's alright paraphrasing but technically

1388
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:35,807
You can make an argument for it is inaccurate that's my main problem with it

1389
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,111
I think my main problem with it

1390
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,391
He said if you accept

1391
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,695
That hit what he said has wiggle room

1392
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:44,511
Then you are missing that what he said was what Elizabeth

1393
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,119
If you're going to tell me that there's wiggle room with what

1394
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,911
He said I don't believe

1395
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,495
But there isn't a world where Norm could believe

1396
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:57,311
I think he's sincere Leah saying I don't want Alex

1397
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,615
What's the testify to lower the temperature because

1398
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,919
He's worried that Maddie is too hot

1399
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,455
Or something like that

1400
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:10,111
I could see that perception being in his head when he says that I don't believe that that reflects real

1401
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,415
Bright spot I can see

1402
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,183
Alex

1403
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,463
Or Norm

1404
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,279
Having that be there reality right

1405
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:22,399
So to them if he's a misrepresentation but them having a reality is the problem

1406
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,191
That were existing in the first play

1407
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
I guess so

1408
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:30,847
Indulging them in their reality which is clearly not true

1409
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:37,247
Is the problem I don't really know what else you could do that's a good point you know who we are who we are now

1410
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:42,367
Across the global a crush their false

1411
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:46,975
We have to I think we need to

1412
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
How would you

1413
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,815
A false reality Crusher

1414
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,631
Anyway

1415
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:57,215
We can make them up in false reality World tiny bullhorn

1416
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,519
So we needed to make up

1417
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,567
This life because

1418
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
Alex to Tooele

1419
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
1 quart

1420
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,687
Norm's doing Victory laps everybody's calling him saying

1421
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,479
Chris ready crap the bed

1422
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:13,087
Judges are calling and everybody's flipping out it's incredibly everybody agrees to blow in their face

1423
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,135
He gets up there and says

1424
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:18,207
Well if everybody you know this is a big victory when I can do this

1425
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,167
And then

1426
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,215
Delete the twin says this

1427
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:29,983
Folks

1428
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,543
I'm going to delete this tweet after talking with

1429
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,823
Pat Patterson

1430
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,591
Jones lawyer

1431
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,639
Raisin in the courtroom

1432
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:40,479
Though not with me

1433
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,271
I asked him after what's wrong

1434
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,039
He makes

1435
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,575
The accurate point

1436
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,367
Study did not say this

1437
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,183
As I rode here I apologize for the Earth

1438
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,487
You're a lying witch

1439
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,023
On a broom

1440
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,815
I mean

1441
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:00,447
She didn't tell us.

1442
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,727
Call maryna break Nico's

1443
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,519
You're joking she did say that

1444
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,847
Talk about you and hearing

1445
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,943
They were in shambles

1446
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,735
Biagio's

1447
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,063
You're joking right you didn't believe me

1448
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,903
She literally pulled it out of her butt

1449
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:25,023
So you have Alex did so well they needed to spend some housel is came up with this fake

1450
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:25,791
Sweet rice

1451
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:31,679
Also a bunch of other people were calling Norman saying that Maddie crap the bed

1452
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:35,007
Sure so maybe Alex is misquoting somebody

1453
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,823
Maybe he said that Norm said that

1454
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:44,479
Did Norm actually say that cuz if not exactly

1455
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,783
He will he will

1456
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,855
I'm sure it's just a dumb childish game.

1457
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,415
But I know you got to get where you at

1458
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,695
You got it you got to do what

1459
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:59,071
You know you only have a few opportunities where people I have like a mistake

1460
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,095
Sure

1461
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,655
You know I am not a huge mistake

1462
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:06,239
Something that she apologized for clarified

1463
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,775
And because of that Alex

1464
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,823
Canal pouncing attack

1465
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:16,991
Well in case she's trapped by having a real job and not being able to say

1466
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:17,759
F*** you

1467
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,295
You said that

1468
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,831
You know like

1469
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,111
That's because that's

1470
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,135
What I would have done

1471
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,951
Well

1472
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:28,511
You're not like North because

1473
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,535
Norm

1474
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,815
Thinking about suing

1475
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
Do it

1476
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,143
Coincidence that Elizabeth Williamson

1477
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,423
Grifting off of

1478
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
Sandy Hook

1479
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,215
Personally

1480
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,263
Profiting off the pain of Sandy Hook

1481
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,335
Would lie and libel about you and alive right now though

1482
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:46,175
Because it once again reaffirms that if the truth came out

1483
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,455
Even with a bias

1484
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
Jury pool

1485
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,759
The truth came out

1486
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
They would not get

1487
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:56,159
How much raise this

1488
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,719
Ignore Ms really thinking about legal action against

1489
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,999
Was just curious

1490
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,047
Because not premeditated

1491
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,583
Pure whole-cloth fraud

1492
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:06,143
Excuse me I'm to claim

1493
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:08,191
The lawyer try to destroy his client

1494
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,495
We could destroy his job in his legal career

1495
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:15,359
Enormous so angry he couldn't believe when I told him he was just flying never seen it nor so angry

1496
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,431
Child

1497
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,479
The fact

1498
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,295
She thought she could just do so let's put her picture back up there

1499
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,319
I mean who

1500
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,111
Issues are official photo

1501
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,415
Mars Attacks aliens

1502
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:33,023
She has no self-awareness of how nuts she looks I mean

1503
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,327
Charlie Manson can't make a face like that

1504
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,863
We're doing this

1505
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,423
Yep it's Grace you know

1506
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,007
I really really really would like it if Nora

1507
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,287
Tried to sue her

1508
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
Because then

1509
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,103
That they would be like

1510
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,127
Okay well

1511
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,407
She took the Tweet down right

1512
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,687
Really fast

1513
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,503
Until then this suit goes away

1514
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:56,319
Which would make you think if Alex had

1515
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,879
Stop talking really fast

1516
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:03,743
Then the suit would have gone away

1517
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:10,655
Did Norm actually say that he was considering suing because if he isn't then Alex making s*** up about his way of lawyers

1518
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,447
Which is maybe worse

1519
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,007
Exactly what Elizabeth

1520
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,847
So anyway Barnes is a real pile of s***

1521
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,455
Harvesting the

1522
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,223
Pain

1523
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,039
Who's harvesting the paint of these families

1524
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,831
These plaintiffs lawyers

1525
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,879
Depressed is Elizabeth Williamson

1526
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,159
Weather personal

1527
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
In political

1528
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,207
And partisan profit

1529
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,743
It's really disgust

1530
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
And it's important for people to know out there

1531
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,351
Admit to my knowledge

1532
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,375
/ 90 /

1533
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,167
Percent of the people who have

1534
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,215
A relative who died at Sandy Hook

1535
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,751
They're not suing out

1536
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,335
The Bassmaster

1537
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,127
Some people refuse to go along with

1538
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,687
Only a small percentage

1539
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,967
We're convinced to go along

1540
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,759
That's another fact

1541
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,527
He can't have

1542
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:02,623
Well especially if you say they refused to go along with it

1543
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:06,975
Because that implies that it's all being driven by it

1544
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,255
Basically

1545
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,535
Based on the thing

1546
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:15,935
Is that we've seen based on the behaviors the experiences the people have gone through I fully fucken understand why someone would choose

1547
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,703
Choose not to do it

1548
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,751
It is a

1549
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,287
Horrible thing

1550
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:26,687
To go through what these families had to go through in the trial if there was not a sincerity

1551
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,711
Behind what they were doing

1552
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,527
Very much don't believe they would have made it

1553
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,855
Even close to this far

1554
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,623
Weren't

1555
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,927
Sincere and dedicated

1556
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,231
Working on behalf of

1557
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,815
The the the memories at Ed and f****** all of us

1558
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,863
Then they could have settled

1559
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,655
Years ago

1560
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
Years ago

1561
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:50,239
Alex would have been happy to pay the

1562
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,311
Off. Like whatever 20 million dollars

1563
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:56,127
Play my victory out of it

1564
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:59,711
Yeah undisclosed settlement and everybody would have just

1565
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,759
F****** allowed him to keep doing that bowl

1566
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:06,879
And that's what would have happened cuz that's how we live most of our Lives we would powerful people f*** off

1567
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,671
You know and do whatever they want

1568
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:11,231
Yeah it's possible that could have been how it went

1569
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,535
But it didn't and now we're here and Barnes

1570
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,863
Is possibly defaming these families even more

1571
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,399
Admitting my knowledge

1572
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,423
Over 90

1573
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:23,519
Percent of the people who have a relative who died at Sandy Hook

1574
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,287
Are knots

1575
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055
Suing Alex

1576
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,591
Natsu

1577
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:30,175
The vast mass of people refuse to go along with

1578
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,735
Only a small percentage

1579
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,015
We're convinced to go along

1580
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,807
That's another fact

1581
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,575
He can't have

1582
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
Presented to the jury

1583
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,159
So it's part of a process where there

1584
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,183
The ones worth

1585
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
Responsible

1586
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,999
Or more risk of more mass shootings

1587
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,023
The ones

1588
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,815
Responsible for covering up political

1589
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
Cocoppa billeting complicity

1590
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
And what

1591
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,143
Sandy Hook

1592
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,679
Where kids lives could have been

1593
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,959
Say

1594
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,983
Because of Road pilot

1595
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,519
Pocketing money

1596
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,055
The reasons intended originally

1597
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:57,823
For school safety

1598
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,359
You're the ones covering up for

1599
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,407
Pharma and Airfield Mental Health

1600
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,199
Institutions for young men in America

1601
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,223
They're the ones

1602
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,503
Prophet

1603
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,551
And they want to blame you

1604
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
For standing up for the

1605
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,647
An amendment to blame you for second-guessing

1606
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,927
The politicians were doing

1607
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,719
It exposes what the whole case

1608
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,743
This is really about

1609
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
In a simple Nacho

1610
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,839
Alright well said we're to come back into 10 more minutes Robert Barnes

1611
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:22,911
Well said you committing the crime

1612
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,495
Well I mean well said this is being

1613
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,775
Express

1614
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,823
A very

1615
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,383
Simple reading of this

1616
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,151
Could be

1617
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,431
That the plaintiff

1618
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
Who have decided

1619
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,759
The to go along with this case

1620
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,527
Our response

1621
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:42,367
Possible for further school shootings there gauged in a cover-up of the things

1622
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,671
At the school safety at Sandy Hook

1623
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,743
Definitely follows

1624
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,279
From pronoun reference

1625
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,327
You know how pronouns are in Port

1626
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,095
Into language

1627
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,631
And understand

1628
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:57,471
Yes you use the pronoun to refer to the people

1629
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:01,055
Even if you don't say their names individually princes

1630
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:05,151
You didn't say the name of every single person who had a relative

1631
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:10,271
At Sandy Hook so sure but however you did use a collective pronoun

1632
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:14,623
Describe all of them meaning you are talkin about them

1633
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,903
Words

1634
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,439
Words

1635
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,999
So

1636
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,839
We're not done talking about this place apparently

1637
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,631
I am I'm genuinely

1638
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,423
It's supposed to be a lawyer

1639
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,263
Lawyer and he's doing nothing

1640
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:37,663
It's supposed to know this is about nuclear war. I wrote that down at the beginning

1641
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,759
Now we're going to talk about

1642
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,087
Conspiracies about Alex's day

1643
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,647
Militarisation closing at the Russia news

1644
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,439
I'll let you go to a great job at a barn

1645
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,255
You watch the trial knollview Club

1646
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,119
Prismatic Democratic party operative

1647
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,935
Literally gets up there

1648
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,471
Over an hour

1649
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,007
Brings up

1650
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,799
Now we gave them total discovery

1651
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,103
We're not allowed to say when you miscarry

1652
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,431
Of the 286

1653
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,991
Weeks after they file suit on us

1654
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,527
In two thousand and

1655
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,551
18

1656
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:22,207
A bunch of emails saying I want to get you on a hurt you were going to kill you Alex Jones

1657
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,487
Sandy Hook

1658
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,511
Any better

1659
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
People

1660
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,839
There are secrets

1661
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,631
Embedded link

1662
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,399
Stafflinq

1663
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:35,519
Shall we turn the email over they know how to scan them

1664
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,823
And magically find the secret links

1665
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,871
Highlights with your car

1666
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:43,967
It's up there and says okay follow lawsuit against The Young Turks that you filed

1667
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,039
Stop saying I'm a child pornographer in all this

1668
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,087
He said yeah it's true

1669
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,135
I said you didn't do anything

1670
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,671
It was said to you you didn't open it

1671
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:57,279
Later he says show you Dixon child born

1672
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,815
Let's just admit it you did it

1673
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:03,167
He wanted to cover himself earlier knowing for Clips on the internet

1674
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,983
I said what you just said earlier I was jealous

1675
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,543
So imagine the evil of that

1676
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,359
That's not what Alex said Alex said yes

1677
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:17,759
I don't fully understand what Maddie was asking him but he's pretending not to because he doesn't want his audience to understand the situation

1678
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:24,415
Maddie was asking Alex about how he'd Sue The Young Turks over statements they made about sending c********* to the Sandy Hook playing

1679
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
Just lawyers

1680
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:31,327
This was meant to really make it clear that when he's on the other side of things Alex fully understand how damaging

1681
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:36,959
Claims can be more than willing to sue people for making such claims

1682
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,519
Maddie was very clear that the FBI it looked

1683
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,591
Intuit the emails have been opened and they were sent

1684
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,359
Text to Alex

1685
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,151
And they were turned over unknowingly

1686
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,455
Which is why Alex Felton the right to sue

1687
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
However

1688
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,271
If the claim was just that

1689
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:53,343
What's Joan sent lawyers child born in emails

1690
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,135
Then that claim is technically

1691
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:55,903
True

1692
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:02,303
It wasn't intentional and Alex didn't know what was in the emails but those emails did get sent from Alex's team to the plaintiff's and

1693
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,583
Only did contain child for

1694
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,119
This is what the

1695
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,399
The Tweet said

1696
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,679
That was included in Alex

1697
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,471
Who complained Against The Young Turks which is

1698
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,751
Why Maddie was making this

1699
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,519
Distinction

1700
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:14,847
The thing that Alex was suing over was a statement that was technically

1701
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
Accurate but what's the

1702
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,431
Suggestive in a way that could lead to reputational damage

1703
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,759
This was all to illustrate that Alex is posturing and Defiance in the

1704
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,527
McKay's are

1705
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,807
Decisions that he's making

1706
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:29,951
Play more than happy to use the courts of the weapon when he feels aggrieved even if the technical claim that was being made

1707
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,743
And being called defamation

1708
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:34,559
Is strictly speaking Acura in this case

1709
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:38,399
If they wanted to file a free-speech defense

1710
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,423
Towards this

1711
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,823
The Young Turks maybe they could have fought their their first amendment rights or whatever

1712
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,103
And maybe they would have won or lost

1713
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,639
But they would have had that option

1714
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,431
In this case it is not

1715
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:55,295
Yeah I don't know if everything that's said in the videos on The Young Turks

1716
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,831
Because I can't imagine

1717
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,599
Them

1718
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,391
Making the kind of claim

1719
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:05,791
Homestead Alex is saying babe did but be really in the bit of the lawsuit that MattyB

1720
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,327
Brought up in court it was

1721
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,143
Just the claim that is technically true

1722
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:15,263
Albright illustration

1723
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:18,335
Of Alex's willingness to

1724
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:23,711
Use this these things that he's pretending to not respect what he's on the other end of it because

1725
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,735
Jesus

1726
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,551
Piece of s*** liar defenses

1727
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,111
Lackadaisical

1728
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
A generous word

1729
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,927
Willingness to

1730
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,951
Give over discover

1731
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:41,631
We're just going to give you a million emails that you can't go through and we definitely won't go through them oops they have c*********

1732
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,703
Alex if you recall

1733
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,239
Early on

1734
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,775
When this happened

1735
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,799
Alex

1736
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:53,663
Chris Mattie

1737
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:57,759
AMC speculated about these theories with the norm pattis

1738
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:00,063
Sitting at the desk

1739
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:00,831
Clearly drunk

1740
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:04,415
Yes just what I wanted back to that.

1741
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,975
So imagine the evil of that

1742
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:11,583
To know how to secretly find secret in bed

1743
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,607
Invisible images

1744
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,959
I'm not saying he did it he said I said that I didn't say that

1745
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,031
Very suspicious

1746
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,591
And then at the end

1747
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:26,175
He comes on hour later and says the jury he sent c********* the families

1748
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,455
I mean

1749
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,295
This is unbelievable these people are on

1750
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,599
Believable robber they had to use

1751
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,879
High-tech system foretold

1752
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:35,903
The skin

1753
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,231
And a skandam

1754
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:42,047
And they reported us the FBI V information

1755
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,607
The FBI said we're not guilty cuz we never opened it

1756
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,447
This is just too good

1757
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,495
I know.

1758
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,287
What

1759
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:53,823
I mean

1760
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,383
Alex's is dancing around this

1761
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,151
Good

1762
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,175
No

1763
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:04,575
I mean that's again another factual statement I don't know I don't know who he thinks this looks bad for the bib

1764
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,623
Plaintiffs attorneys

1765
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,903
I'll just say this

1766
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,719
How do you get 287,000 emails

1767
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,791
And then scan them for secret links

1768
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,631
And then they 5-minute just it doesn't sound good

1769
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,191
There's a lot of

1770
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
Concern at the time

1771
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,495
Mr. what the source of this was

1772
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:27,103
In weather was somebody aligned with the plaintiffs lawyers Allied online lawyers

1773
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:30,431
And Ally

1774
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,759
Exact

1775
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,783
It was days

1776
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,807
Sought information

1777
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,111
That was guaranteed to produce

1778
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,903
Stuff that you didn't even know exist

1779
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,719
Oh my God this is also suspicious

1780
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,487
Yeah

1781
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:46,303
I mean they're just getting closer and closer to like

1782
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,607
It was a setup

1783
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,423
I was never really sure

1784
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:54,495
About what was going on until he waited like

1785
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,775
Like 45 minutes an hour

1786
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,359
But you did some c*********

1787
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,919
I was like oh my God you just did it

1788
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,455
He did it right there

1789
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,759
He did it right there

1790
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,903
Completely misrepresented your public presence

1791
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,207
What you said was

1792
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,487
Whoever said that

1793
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,023
Child Point information

1794
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
To have out

1795
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,887
Million dollars

1796
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,447
And then he spotted that I said he was doing it

1797
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,983
Is this

1798
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,287
You just

1799
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,055
Projection

1800
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,847
You did like 5 seconds ago

1801
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:35,199
I'm you said he did he did that he's a nice person

1802
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,223
What

1803
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
Uno's

1804
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:45,439
Who knows I came to a revelation tone of voice that went

1805
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,743
You did

1806
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
You said

1807
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:49,791
He did

1808
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,911
He did it right there

1809
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:58,751
Play-Doh just not existed for these people

1810
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:02,847
How can they be so mad when people change their pronouns and they have no concept

1811
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:05,663
50 what they are but look Alex doesn't think

1812
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,479
All I know is that he completely misrepresented

1813
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,247
Presented at the

1814
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,271
Time how that

1815
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,063
I came about any misrepresented in

1816
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,855
In court your Public Presentation

1817
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,135
You made it sound like

1818
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
You

1819
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,439
Stuck his feather photo op

1820
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,999
10 pointed to it and said you wanted his head on a stake

1821
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,047
It's all false

1822
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,071
I just this is a lot

1823
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,351
It's just one more lie

1824
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:29,215
I don't think Maddie sent me that

1825
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:32,799
All I know is all things disgusting aren't 5 minutes I'll give you the floor

1826
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,591
Unbelievable

1827
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
F****** real

1828
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,663
Yeah I mean if you're listening to this what

1829
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,431
You Come Away with

1830
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:42,015
What do what how confused would you be

1831
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:46,367
But what point is this guy trying to make I mean I think I think

1832
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,927
Anybody would be justified in thinking

1833
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:52,255
The conclusion that I'm supposed to go to is the

1834
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:57,119
The plaintiff lawyers did send Alex this but he said no no

1835
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,423
Rides like sort of a facetious way of

1836
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:06,079
Not getting himself suit again

1837
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:06,847
Nice person

1838
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,639
After you defamed

1839
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,223
Secretly

1840
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:17,855
Maliciously sent you c********* in order for you to send c********* to them

1841
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,159
And then

1842
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,951
Are part of the conspiracy

1843
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:25,023
To convince the families to go along with a

1844
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
Fake

1845
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
Lawsuit

1846
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,887
I think what you would come away from with this broadcast

1847
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,471
Is that the Sandy Hook thing was a false flag

1848
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:39,871
Run by the Democratic f****** party because they need to finish Alex off they've planted

1849
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,663
Stephen is emails and

1850
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:46,783
To recap Alex is being sued

1851
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,903
A little bit

1852
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,487
Fly Barn system ideas

1853
01:18:55,743 --> 01:19:00,095
These ideas basically just f****** give most of Ukraine to Russia has hair like that

1854
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:04,191
The parts of Ukraine that want to be part of Russia

1855
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,495
Loud

1856
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,263
Be part of Russia

1857
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,287
In the dispute

1858
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,567
Finish it go on

1859
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,103
There's no reason

1860
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,127
Continue

1861
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,663
Backfiring economic saint

1862
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,687
Considered

1863
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
The great reset

1864
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,223
Agenda

1865
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:16,991
Can world

1866
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:17,759
The pound is

1867
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,807
Dropped to the lowest level in 4050

1868
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:20,575
Years

1869
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,623
The Euro has dropped one of the lowest levels

1870
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,391
It's ever been

1871
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,183
They're having a fuel crisis

1872
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,207
Since in Europe they're having a

1873
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
Food crisis

1874
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:27,999
Cineeurope

1875
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:28,767
That food crisis

1876
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,303
Expanding to other parts of the

1877
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,071
The world

1878
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:34,143
The net effect of this is going to be really ugly

1879
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
That the West

1880
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
War on Russia has

1881
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
Failed even head

1882
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,519
Kissinger his acknowledge this

1883
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
It's time to

1884
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:41,823
Who is trumps

1885
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,359
Suggested do a deal

1886
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,383
LP Steel

1887
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,407
Get out

1888
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,903
If we look at what's happening in China

1889
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:59,231
The relevant pertinent issues

1890
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,279
You've got five minutes

1891
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,351
Some of the rumors that I got

1892
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,375
By sudden

1893
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,167
Flight cancellations in different place

1894
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:13,824
Abso Barnes Bend is it now yes to spend some Wheels

1895
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,592
Oh my God

1896
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:19,200
You realize Alex said I'm going to give you five minutes here's the floor it is still a little rude

1897
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:22,016
Dawn

1898
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:26,624
Yeah he was hungry. I love I love that this is just how things work

1899
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,744
You can invade a country and then you couldn't hold a referendum to see if people want to vote

1900
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,512
2

1901
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,536
To go

1902
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,864
And be totally fair election and then

1903
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,776
I'm amazed it burns

1904
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:45,824
Foreign policy

1905
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,640
The Acumen I think

1906
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,456
Basically what he saying is

1907
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,224
Guys

1908
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,992
In Ukraine

1909
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,016
I understand

1910
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,040
You want to be people

1911
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,576
But the Euros law

1912
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,600
So

1913
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,624
Your Russians

1914
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,928
What is Canada invaded like

1915
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,696
Wisconsin

1916
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,488
Well we got to give it

1917
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:09,888
Right. They wanted to become part of Canada tomorrow remember whenever that Civil War

1918
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:12,704
We're happened why didn't the South just say fine

1919
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,752
Wii U on us

1920
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:21,408
Reborns leaves and this is two and a half hours in Alex's a little bit upset about

1921
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:22,944
But man

1922
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:30,368
It's hard that estimate how dangerous this this this Russian situation is only this

1923
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,136
Crazy

1924
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:35,232
I've got some other news I want to hit on the economy and I'm super

1925
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,280

You know we are

1928
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,008
Okay. This whole thing was about it was I did too

1929
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,032
But it was

1930
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:50,080
An hour plus of barn

1931
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,360
Yeah

1932
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,152
Probably an hour straight of ads

1933
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:56,480
Yeah I mean look this year was mostly ads listen to some of this b*******

1934
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,552

We haven't watch MPR PBS your lucky man

1939
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:16,704
$70 for Ed Woodberry for coffee cup

1940
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,776
Everybody watching knows the coffee cup cost $5

1941
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:22,080
Everybody watching knows the t-shirt cost $6

1942
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,384
What are silver

1943
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
The point is

1944
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:30,272
Is that it's a memento

1945
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,552
And you were part of that

1946
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:34,368
Taxpayer money to fund in br

01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,904

1951
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,280
The fundraiser coin

Blong stretches like this

1975
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:34,272
I was listening to this I was like

1976
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:36,320
I can't imagine

1977
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,880
Watching this and being like mayonnaise guy

Like how

1980
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,512
Is there a value in

1981
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,560
This as something to observe

1982
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,352
I don't know I just don't know

1983
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:55,008
Put in a number of clips about like how Alex is like hop at Gates

1984
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,568
Apparently Biden said something weird

1985
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,616
Did you know little bit of these new things

1986
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:03,456
Sort of just vague proclamations of nuclear war coming

1987
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
And then

1988
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,504
So much

1989
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,040
Petty grievance about his

1990
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,320
Israel

01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,856
Yeah I mean we've

1992
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,416
We've seen this existing Alexa

1993
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:17,024
People who've escaped called to oregano like scientologists in that like you know they'll

1994
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,816
Don't come back unless a like

1995
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,400
The leader of the cult we would every day he would just talk

1996
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:25,216
Yeah and we would all just sit there and listen and it

1997
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,752
Didn't really matter what he say

1998
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032
You know

1999
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:33,664
About the Basking in the glow by father is is proud of me I suppose

2000
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,040
I guess there might be something to the casino you hear people who were like I've been listening for 10 years

2001
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,576
How to what

Yeah you know

2004
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:48,000
How can you handle your brain being jostled all over the place like that

2005
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,840
Anyway we have one last clip here and this is how Alex

Pennsylvania

2007
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,144

2017
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,064
Melinda French Gates

2018
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,648
Giving a little speech

2019
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,440
55 seconds here.

2020
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,536
Tireless work she's doing

2021
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,608
To help steer the world through covid-19

2022
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,424
For being an extraordinary champ

2023
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,704
Champion for Global health

2024
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,008
And for the immeasurable

2025
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:35,360
Inspiration she provides two girls and women around the world

2026
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,640
Including me

2027
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,944
I am thrilled to present

2028
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,272
The 2022 Golden Globe Award

2029
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:44,576
Two remarkable leader of our time

2030
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,344
Ursula

2031
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,368
Von der leyen

2032
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:03,776
Ahead of the European Union and you see that rainbow sloths really different cakes

2033
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:06,592
That's the symbol of the great reset and the Bilderberg Group

2034
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,384
Coronavirus swab

2035
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,408
The wef

2036
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,176
So

2037
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,504
Literally cutting off your up literally pushing force inoculation

2038
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:15,040
Any questions

2039
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:15,808
Weather

2040
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,112
Melinda French Gates is a globalist are

2041
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,392
Absolute Troy

2042
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,440
These are eugenicist

2043
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,744
These are the population is he

2044
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
Keller's

2045
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,304
The very

2046
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,096
Worst magnitude there

2047
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,288
I'm going to end the broadcast

2048
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,080
For the first

2049
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,408
89 minutes of endgame blueprint for Global enslavement

2050
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:52,160
Melinda Gates is bad again so I got to go watch a little bit of my movie like God

2051
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,464
That is f******

2052
01:26:54,720 --> 01:27:00,864
The clip was not about her nose Melinda Gates giving an introduction to Ursula Von der leyen

2053
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,680
Who's the head of the European Commission

2054
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:05,728
There's no rainbows

2055
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,008
It's a circle

2056
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,544
There's a circle 8 just called it a

2057
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,080
The swastika

2058
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,104
Circle

2059
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,128
I don't

2060
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:14,688
I don't know. I can't imagine anything more trivial

2061
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
Then

2062
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,224
So much of

2063
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,760
What he spends his time with

2064
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,808
Yeah but at the same time

2065
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:20,832
I think

2066
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:22,368
Make that this episode

2067
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,136
Is

2068
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,928
Deeply troubling

2069
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,280
Barnes's behavior is legally it's deeply troubling

2070
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,304
I've no lawyer

2071
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,584
Monroe Barnes

2072
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,216
But it doesn't seem okay I mean I just don't know what else to say I don't know what else to say

2073
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,776
I mean I think that

2074
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,312
I'm no lawyer

2075
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,872
But I do know a little bit about diesel

2076
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,408
Right and this is

2077
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:50,272
Past that one might say you do not know karate

2078
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,040
No

2079
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,320
But you do know

2080
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:53,856
Crazy

2081
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:54,880
Yes

2082
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,160
Sure

2083
01:27:56,672 --> 01:28:00,512
So yeah I hope there's some consequences for this sucks

2084
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:03,328
Yep this is got to stop but somebody's got to stop this

2085
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:06,912
This is what Alex had to leave Connecticut for

2086
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:07,680
To stop this

2087
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:10,496
It's it just I can't keep going on

2088
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,776
It's Barnes is

2089
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,336
Barnes came on to do anything

2090
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:18,688
Yeah like there's no not saying that he didn't do the thing

2091
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:22,272
Yeah I do wonder if there's some

2092
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:26,368
Some sort of a cushion of whatever he was saying

2093
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,904
In terms of legal

2094
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,440
Disability

2095
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:31,744
I think that it's

2096
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,048
Disgraceful behavior and

2097
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,328
You should lose his life

2098
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:37,888
Absolutely

2099
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,192
Indeed we will. But

2100
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:40,960
