43
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
It wouldn't be a bad idea to

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,168

77
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,959

79
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,175
Please do it be helpful so I'd like to start out this episode today

80
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Language is a little

81
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
Sensational in the last episode

82
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
I know that I called myself out for like these are stupid

83
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
But it's still not the kind of conversation

84
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Star show

85
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
Especially because

86
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,119
Little more time is going on in the mystery solved of where has Alex been

87
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,447
Austin American living in art

88
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,543
Happier time for him

89
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,615
So I knew that Alex had recent

90
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,199
Learned or the world has been reported

91
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
If you was going to have to sit

92
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
For a deposition

93
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
In Houston

94
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,391
But none of the stories that I had

95
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,183
Had any kind of specifics of

96
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Timeline

97
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,767
However I found an article in the Austin american-statesman

98
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
For last week

99
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,351
That was talking about Thursday

100
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
He had a court appearance

101
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
That

102
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
The judge decided the

103
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
But he had to sit for

104
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
For a deposition

105
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
This Thursday

106
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,335
So on the 14th of March

107
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
He had to sit for a deposition

108
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,687
I'm still not sure why that means he was gone for a week

109
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
But that has to have some

110
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Maybe he had to go to

111
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
Connecticut to give the deposition

112
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,183
I'm not entirely sure

113
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
That explains his absence

114
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,559
If the

115
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,119
Lawsuit is brought in a specific

116
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
You

117
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
Do you have to go to that state to give the deposition or you could you just rude

118
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
To go extinct

119
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,919
I don't know I don't know how it works but I do know that

120
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Pending in Texas

121
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,039
I don't know there's so much

122
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
Non-transparency

123
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
In terms of like how this

124
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,951
Call Casey

125
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
It was missed by our

126
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
Or speculation

127
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Bring up the possibility to

128
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
The legal cases

129
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
We're getting real

130
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
We just thought that it could be

131
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Be worse

132
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
After listening to

133
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
It was it was

134
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:58,207
Everybody

135
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,815
Betty Wright

136
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,191
It's it is what it is

137
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
Explains pretty much all

138
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
Case is getting real

139
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
He's in a bad place

140
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
I'm thinking back on Thursday

141
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
The 14th he was back

142
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
Studio doing part of his show

143
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,551
So everything is somewhat back to normal

144
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
We'd not have time before recording

145
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
To cover music

146
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
Half an hour or so of it

147
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Is pretty boring

148
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
So

149
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
Not enough present-day stuff to go into so we're going back

150
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
To no longer 2012

151
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,983
2013 January 1st second

152
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
2013

153
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
What's the temperature

154
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
Amanda

155
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431

156
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,527
Text crazy

157
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Like

158
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,647
What are the really frustrating things about studying Alex Jones and take

159
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
Bring him in his own linear path

160
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
Is that he never gives you what you think

161
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
You're going to get

162
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
We expected

163
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
Good bit of Sandy Hook.

164
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,983
I don't know where

165
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,079
Videos of the cat

166
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,919
Yeah it's the middle of December

167
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
2012

168
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
To have a fair amount of coverage

169
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
The false flag

170
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,207
Suggest that people or actors

171
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Certifit

172
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
Fear that the globalists are taking their guns

173
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,703
Which will lead to a civil war holding pattern

174
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,799
Until the end of 2012

175
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Laughing about how people thought

176
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,455
That he thought it was the end of the world on December 21st people

177
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,807
This is a crisis level emergency

178
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
The gun grabbing is going to happen

179
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
It's it's

180
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
It's not so you expect that

181
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
After the holidays

182
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
Not really focusing on anything

183
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
Can you just kind of Costa

184
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Draeger's

185
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
New Year rolls around

186
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
Then you start to get that new field for a month and then it all goes away and comes back to ship

187
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
Really feeling it on

188
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
The first

189
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
You can hear them this first

190
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,471
Official

191
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
I will

192
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
He doesn't

193
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:57,919
Define distal

194
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
I hope

195
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
Looks like

196
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
Soul searching

197
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
I'm going to put out more information

198
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
That does not suggest there's a lot of depth

199
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:18,143
To that song no no it doesn't the most informative years

200
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Equivalent of like

201
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
Just saying I'm going to

202
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,519
Eat healthy this year

203
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,847
At the end of you like I think I did

204
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Reviews.

205
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Plastic

206
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,991
Zagg pronouncements of of the new year

207
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
He doesn't make another documentary

208
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
Cuz the last one that I ever put out

209
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
Stretch

210
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
Was that

211
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
With with 1,000

212
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Joel skousen

213
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:49,119
Did not know about that it's just a really long interview

214
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
You can bug out

215
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
Long to just talk to Joel skousen

216
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
It's so long

217
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
It it's longer

218
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,159
Zen documentary

219
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
But I watched

220
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Not good

221
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
I don't think it was a good idea

222
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Salt Lake

223
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
2 hours really got to go hard

224
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
To be shittier at your jobs

225
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
The project Berry

226
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
I wasn't really thinking about covering it for the

227
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
This episode

228
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
Things to do at

229
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,479
Glass about

230
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,063
Like legitimately the documentary

231
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Is Jacob Wohl

232
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
And Laura Loomer

233
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,719
Just sitting around or standing outside door

234
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
That's some compelling footage right there

235
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Terrible

236
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,631
Did they use real probably more visually stimulating then

237
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
Strategic relocation

238
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Alex's

239
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
What were his places

240
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,247
What if we looked into it and there was it like

241
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,903
I don't know where to hide my gun I guarantee there would be some useful information

242
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,487
It doesn't pay me to admit that

243
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
Even these like crazy survivalist

244
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,983
Do have some pieces of good information like I know how to get water

245
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
You bet

246
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
Everyone should know that

247
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
So

248
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
It's just

249
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
It's a matter of scale

250
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,991
So

251
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
The most informed

252
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
But if you're ever

253
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
I'm going to do this

254
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
I'm going to crush it

255
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
The rest of the show is dogshit

256
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
Of course

257
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,999
It is a no-man's-land I listen to it I can find

258
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,303
Nothing worth discovered

259
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,399
It's a lot of like looks like

260
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
Kind of stuff she has mr. and mrs. America get ready

261
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Your guns

262
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,127
And in order to justify that he plays a like

263
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
Years and years old clip

264
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,735
I'm talking about in the past

265
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,111
If she was able to get a bill through that would have taken everyone's done she would have done that

266
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
But you can't

267
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:25,279
She couldn't do it then was implying in any way she still wants to do that

268
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,583
Legislation

269
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,191
So he's using that to make the argument that

270
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
Dianne Feinstein is a

271
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:39,103
Mr and Mrs America

272
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:44,223
Something that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie movie

273
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
That's where they fell in

274
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
Lowe's

275
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
And that the doctor

276
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
From House

277
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Was that was

278
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Movie

279
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:02,399
Jennifer is trash there's nothing going on there

280
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Walkthrough your thought process

281
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,519
On the 2nd

282
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
January 2nd

283
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
And Alex

284
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
Man of 10 seconds

285
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,455
Can't remember what year it is information

286
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
Alright dude on his desk

287
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,423
Real facts

288
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,519
It's already

289
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,823
Eddie's Betty says it every day so it's

290
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
You can take a little while

291
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,247
It's already the 3rd day of March 2000

292
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,807
Any does not explain it all why he

293
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
He's saying that the Year is already longer

294
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,951
But I wanted answered

295
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:06,399
Ciara

296
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
Picture this year

297
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,287
I did one bad show that's about it

298
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,359
What was

299
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Professor Snape

300
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,431
Dumbledore

301
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:28,671
Rick was still around in 2012

302
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,535
Fine as long as rickman's around it was good times you know what else was around

303
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
That was still around

304
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,775
Larry summers in 1990

305
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Whoa

306
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,519
So

307
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Get rid of people

308
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
Like that but they're a couple problems

309
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:25,247
Larry Summers

310
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,647
Media has a link to it which the research process was just to make sure there was something on Wikipedia

311
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Forget that there's a second

312
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
So I couldn't

313
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,935
The second problem is that if you read the Wikipedia entry about this memo the second paragraph on the page

314
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
You just get down to the second paragraph

315
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,823
You find an explanation that one Larry Summers

316
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
Didn't write the memo

317
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,991
The guy who did text the memo with meant to be satirical

318
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
It means to prompt interrupt departmental debate

319
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
M3

320
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
The verse of the memo that was Week Tonight

321
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,207
Was doctored specifically to remove contacts to make it

322
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,791
Seem like those proposals that were being made or serious

323
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:16,191
So somebody added a modest proposal to make it look like they really wanted to eat more less

324
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,031
New Yorker the author of the memo

325
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
2 Summers

326
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Is it

327
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Walt Walt

328
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
I strongly recommended that

329
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
He say I had written it and then you just signed it

330
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
Larry said no that wasn't just dial

331
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
Whatever you signed he would take

332
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
Responsibility for

333
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
He took the flag

334
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,863
In 2001 Pritchett spoke to the Harvard magazine

335
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
Specifically light out what it happened

336
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,471
Basically the summation of his explanation

337
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,335
Somerset requested that he read over the world bank's global economic prospects

338
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,895
Report which was largely about trade liberalization

339
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,991
He was tasked with writing a memo to Somers NY

340
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
Which ended up being 7

341
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Long

342
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,879
What are the points Pritchard said GPS was the World Bank

343
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
I meant that free trade would naturally

344
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,487
And specifically like automatically

345
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
Lead to environmental benefits in developing Khan

346
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,631
Quote he questioned the data supporting that claim

347
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,471
Criticism Road isn't ironic

348
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,519
Conventional economic term

349
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,359
Dumping pollutants on pork trees would be welfare enhancement

350
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,687
For the world as a whole the bank audit endorse policy

351
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,271
Right

352
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
They're up there after Pritchard says

353
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,159
Someone with access to the memo doctor Ditka

354
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,207
Combined to The Heading In the sentences on pollution

355
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Toxic waste

356
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,535
Shorn of their context than the intended irony

357
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:51,167
This one page form appears to be a policy proposal

358
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,519
The version of the Galaxy's red is

359
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
The doctored one page

360
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,359
Which version not the version that is the actual memo

361
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,687
All he knows is that there's a Wikipedia article about it

362
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
And that's good enough for

363
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
He has no idea he's read the propaganda version

364
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
Of this

365
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
D2

366
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
As opposed to the real version

367
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,023
That sounds about right did they find out who dr. the memo or did that guy get away with

368
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
Go to bed

369
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
I'm not entirely sure if they ever rebuild

370
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
Whodunnit

371
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,807
The trace it is b*******

372
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
Congratulations on starting 2013

373
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
Very informal

374
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Cuz I didn't know about

375
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,607
Information

376
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
Most of the first

377
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,447
Wasn't talking about Dianne Feinstein

378
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
And I'm continuing these.

379
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
Are you gone

380
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,639
Trend

381
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
Where

382
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
If Alex has been doing

383
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Some soul-searching

384
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,551
It's in a weird Direction and it's about his own celebrity

385
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
Because it next clip

386
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
Alex talks about Howard

387
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
He's never tried to be a movie

388
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,256
And then tell the story about auditioning to be a

389
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,640
Point of order Tommy Plata is linklaters if it's a

390
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:42,784
Different project

391
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
Experience

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,560
Other movies

00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:11,200
Dick

395
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,600
Auditions for movies

396
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
Already

397
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,768
Alex

398
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
You would never

399
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,456
One of these Casting Studios

400
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,600

402
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
I mean

403
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
What's the answer

404
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,328
Because if the answer is no

405
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
Is the answer is yes

406
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,496
Alex was a super attractive

407
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
I've seen his broadcast

408
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
From 9/11

409
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,664
But you know it's from 2,000

410
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,272
I don't know if you took like a real downward slope in a year's time

411
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,392
What you look like an average

412
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:30,560
Maybe late thirties do even though he wasn't late that's what he look like

413
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:36,960

415
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:49,504
Inflection that took him down the path we're on right now

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
Sex worker

417
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
He was rejected from entry

00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
Prince into that world after

419
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672

00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,296
The growing up

428
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,928
Is pretty cool on some level

429
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,512
Even if it is because linklater liked him and gave him the part

430
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
It's still an achievement

431
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
Subways

432
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
I don't want to take that away from

433
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,192
But okay

434
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544

A little bit before

437
00:24:54,016 --> 00:25:00,160
As the book goes

438
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,720
Asian role in talk radio

00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536

Free movies

447
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Something like that

448
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
He starts talking about

449
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,832
Disgusting mrs. Hollywood

450
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,112
And how evil it is

451
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,928
And it gets caught up in it and starts lamenting

452
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:39,328
The women who have been chewed up and spit out by the system

453
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,400
It's on this one huh

454
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,384
Farm girl from Kansas

455
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,992
You don't have to get back to that energy

456
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
You're just perfect

457
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
Perfect proportions

458
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,952
California

459
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
She oughta be a movie star

460
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,792
She was so pretty she was so smart

461
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,840
That's just what she should do

462
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,680
A lighter shade of the Black Dahlia

463
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
Thousands of times

464
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,736
50 years of Los Angeles salon

00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:39,232
Mother

466
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,352
Wholesome

467
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,656
Mrs America

468
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:53,312
I think Alex has been listening to Too Much poison and maybe hasn't been listening to Mama's Fallen Angel

469
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:02,528
Cowboys

470
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
I mean

471
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
Fisher

472
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Businesses

473
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Exploitative

474
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
Clearly

475
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
Describe

476
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
Connotations

477
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:25,312
You know perfect complexion that's America has a perfect

478
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:31,712
Fix complexion. Like if only she hadn't of done that she would

479
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,296
And found a man

480
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,344
New version this could have gone whatever

481
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,672
For that but he's trying to compare that to America end

482
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
America is a

483
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
Mafia

484
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
To America

485
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,584
And Hollywood is apart of

486
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
There's more

487
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
Anthony start

488
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:56,288
Ramblin a whole bunch settle down we could have

489
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,360
Canada

490
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
Well I mean

491
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
The queen

492
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:09,856
Are we staying in the Americas want a relationship

493
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:16,256
Brushes

494
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,400
Traditional that Mrs America Russia would never allow that

495
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,704
Not at all

496
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
Number for does Fall Apart

497
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,080
A little bit

498
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
Alex is trying to make that

499
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,920
Talking about

500
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,712
How there are like

501
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,576
I don't even really know how he gets into it starts telling stories about how

502
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
When he was a kid

503
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,928
Outside of Dallas

504
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,000
The town in order to buy beer

505
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
Okay

506
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,352
I'm not really honestly sure how that relates

507
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
To the largest

508
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
The conversation

509
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
To do with like

510
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
Mafias make

511
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,776
These areas of town bad

512
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,848
And like the police is with the mafia

513
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Yeah

514
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,152
I don't think

515
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
He gets that far

516
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,248
Complaining about it in some ways to say like

517
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:13,344
There were terrible things going on there but I could go buy beer there

518
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,672
More time talking about how he

519
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,976
Got beer there connect now

520
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,792
It's not like he is trying to say

521
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
See I can go anywhere

522
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:30,240
Because I am not a terrible situation

523
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:35,616
These neighborhoods work that they didn't card people for alcohol

524
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,664
Without realizing what he's talking about

525
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:45,344
It gets worse as the clip goes on where you talked about going to buy beer

526
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
Indeed

527
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,208
Put 100

528
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,128
Is like New York

529
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:21,952
Of the stuff that goes on out there

530
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
I don't really

531
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
The problem that I have is he's not really

532
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
He's not really deal

533
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Ewing weather

534
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
Steven

535
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
But he's painting

536
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,848
Are you just got done talking about how Hollywood choose up Annex

537
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
Louisville

538
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,688
These impressionable young

539
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,272
Impoverished communities we could buy beer to take it back to the rich place

540
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,320
To lure cheerleaders through his house

541
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:54,720
So I don't understand exactly where the disconnect is there

542
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:02,144
But he's a f****** dick in the story right

543
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:09,824
I am going to go to this neighborhood

544
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,944
Right and they've been specifically put down there

545
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
Let's sell this kid liquor

546
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
I'm going to take that liquor

547
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,832
Backup to my rich f*** neighborhood

548
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,416
And I'm going to try sexually assault women

549
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
I mean

550
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,512
He's describing is like

551
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Youthful Shanaynay

552
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
22 Atherton

553
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:35,936
Although he's talking about it with like a very naughty

554
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:41,568
You know they are out of someone who is like

555
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:47,968
Maybe in college reminiscing about high school years

556
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,272
Is pushing 40

557
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:56,672
And have a family

558
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:01,024
I remember when I was 15 and we used to do that

559
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,936
When I was younger it so I bought

560
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
I could get

561
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
Cards

562
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Drunk

563
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,784
Play

564
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,904
Manipulate time back and forth

565
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,048
Alex goes back to that metaphor that he was

566
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,584
Who's making about America

567
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
Turned out by Hollywood

568
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
And ends up as a

569
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,008
The prostitutes

570
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,544
Heroin overdoses

571
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:49,152
If you thought that first telling of that allegory was gross

572
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
Strap it in

573
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
Way grocery

574
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,272
More or less the same stories

575
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
Sites to tell

576
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
But go harder

577
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,208
Beautiful

578
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,912
Pieology fence

579
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,008
You shouldn't have to announce why right now over

580
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,896
And cigarette Burns and cuts all over it

581
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,368
Overdosing

582
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,376
There's always

583
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:47,008
She's 6 months into it

584
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,432
Mom

585
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,464
Little kids

586
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,840
La Carreta

587
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
Don't you ever try to leave me again

588
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,728
Arc dad dad on a dirty match

589
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,616
And Brazil

590
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,808
This is

591
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Did that

592
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
That

593
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:41,536
That was his grandma that's her that's her letter Alexa

594
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,800
Just getting into telling the story

595
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,336
An excitement of the

596
00:34:54,592 --> 00:35:00,736
Gross misdemeanor

597
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
It's dumb

598
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,208
That's a gross person

599
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,560
Wrong with having that Dark Fantasy a lot of great writers

600
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,144
There is something wrong with the way he tells it

601
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,496
Yeah everybody

602
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
Literary achieve

603
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,360
Scare

604
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
That's it

605
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,688
He's using it to reinforce like his idea of what

606
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,736
His perceived enemies are doing to the

607
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
The United States

608
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,576
So I mean it's manipulation pure and simple

609
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
Manipulation by

610
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,392
Gross button

611
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,184
Yeah really f****** gross

612
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
Even the writers for Dragnet would be like

613
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,024
Pull it back

614
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
Come on

615
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
This is a weird

616
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
This is a weird place that

617
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Episode

618
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
Departure from

619
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
These days

620
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
Stopping

621
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Real weird

622
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,616
Just kind of make you scared about gun grab

623
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,176
Much more like

624
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
This is a weird Alex Day

625
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
This is strange

626
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,552
Forget the talking about these

627
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
These shootings that are happen

628
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
How do you compare

629
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,648
Other killers

630
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
From the past other serial killers

631
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
He comes to the conclusion

632
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
The combines all of them

633
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,568
The dog walker

634
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:34,688
New York

635
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:40,064
Worshiper worshippers are our problem

636
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,392
Our problem is devil worshiper

637
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,952
Going.

638
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
He's grasping at straws and terms

639
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,584
Figure out exactly what

640
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
The Narrative is about

641
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,192
He's already

642
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
Volkswagen government

643
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
All that stuff

644
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,288
But

645
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
He's still

646
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
Unclear how to land on

647
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
How did the

648
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,944
Explain Lanza

649
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,528
Because there's documentation of him existing before

650
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,392
Information that's available that he can't just make disappear

651
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,952
We have to still contextualized

652
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,280
As of the beginning

653
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,328
Is

654
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,144
Like he's already laid the foundation of the psych meds

655
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,424
And video games

656
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
Like that

657
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
To Hollywood

658
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:35,360
Hollywood is just

659
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
General

660
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
It is

661
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
Satan

662
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,528
The problem

663
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,344
That's not something

664
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
Oh yeah

665
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:51,744
And it was almost like to hear on

666
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:59,936
No I don't even like to go Brett all the time

667
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
I was just letting you know

668
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,408
Barack Obama

669
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
Do some of this comment

670
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Because at the end

671
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
He says something

672
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
That was the present time

673
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Is that real

674
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
Taken

675
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,584
Scana minutes

676
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,824
Considering he will seriously

677
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,640
Flipping test

678
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
Because actually a fair point but

679
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,808
Very poorly said and the other point

680
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
The idea that

681
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,648
Barack Obama can get away with these things

682
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
He's black

683
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
We racist

684
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,720
Viewpoints

685
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
To have

686
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
But

687
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
Or at least I think he's

688
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
Trying

689
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:36,704
Is the idea that probably a lot of middle-of-the-road democrat

690
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,240
Didn't do a good job of

691
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,520
Obama's

692
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,312
To the fire and demanding more out of

693
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,896
He was delivering

694
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688
The function of

695
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
It is

696
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
Ethnicity at all

697
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
I think it's a funk

698
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
Function of dumpy monster

699
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,112
It is it is such a thing that you pointing out

700
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
We in that

701
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,768
The right would say

702
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,560
She's doing all this stuff as a way to criticize

703
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,608
You guys love

704
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,400
Liberals love it when he does that

705
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,568
The ones who didn't wear like

706
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
Democrats

707
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,896
Well you're not being loyal

708
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
Everybody who

709
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,736
Who doesn't want that to happen

710
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,088
And the people who say we do are the ones

711
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,184
Like that's essentially like

712
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
Worldview

713
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,768
Loyalty

714
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
Yeah I think

715
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Okay thanks to Anna

716
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
NetSpend

717
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,192
I think that you just had you had a situation

718
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,032
People aren't good at being their own

719
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
Watch Dogs

720
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,504
I think you see that to some extent with either party whenever they're in power they don't do a good job of

721
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,552
Calling out the

722
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,624
Of the person who's on their team

723
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,648
Present

724
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,208
I think that's a natural phenomenon

725
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
There are forces

726
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,072
Within each side that dude

727
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
Try to do

728
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,888
But they're usually on the outskirts

729
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,168
They're not usually

730
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
Closest

731
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,984
To the actual levers

732
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,032
The power

733
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,824
Coming from the other side

734
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:24,224
He's always in bad faith because we're going to do that once our guy is in

735
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,088
Was not right or whatever

736
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,648
Calling alien Omar

737
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
So

738
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,680
Is something

739
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,752
Really opened area of exploration

740
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,288
Episode

741
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
That I'm

742
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,151
Getting a little bit in

743
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,687
On this episode

744
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,759
Opens up

745
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
Of understanding Alex

746
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
In a different way

747
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,599
I think that's

748
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,671
Because if you're not paying attention

749
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,695
This guest

750
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
Bucking bull

751
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,327
This person would be not even a blip on your radar

752
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
But

753
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
You look into him a little bit

754
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,935
You scratch the surface

755
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
He becomes

756
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,639
He becomes an introduction into some really f***** up world

757
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,175
That Alex is connected

758
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,199
2 in waist

759
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
That we might not have

760
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
Realized

761
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
Here is

762
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
Captain Mark Richards

763
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,839
Congressional whistleblower

764
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:51,519
Okay I don't know I don't know if I want to know which

765
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
Where this is going

766
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
Soap operas just one more in a long line about Stephen Iran-Contra

767
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Fair

768
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:06,623
They almost got that would have changed the course of the universe

769
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,951
Russell every comic as that story

770
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:17,375
I really don't I bet you do know no gay guy I've ever done ever done would have changed

771
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:23,775
Career let alone what they have it done

772
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:30,175
Bridgewood opened up for no I've never been close

773
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,015
Proves the rule play from heavy metal

774
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,295
Thousand of those

775
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:45,535
But a story about

776
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,423
Where part is that a number of them aren't making things up entirely

777
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,775
Even if they're embellishing a little bit to make a hero story for themselves right there not

778
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:00,639
Like making it up out of whole cloth Like Larry Nichols can lie about the extent he was involved

779
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,687
But he was definitely make

780
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:09,087
Can collect calls on behalf of the contras absolutely

781
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,903
He was lying about the truth about the

782
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,999
You could have been like if he was in

783
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,303
Yeah

784
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,887
Company in Atlanta in the late

785
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:27,263
In 1985 a guy named Gary Bast came into his operation and offered to buy the company

786
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,311
To stay on running

787
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:36,223
Gradually became

788
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:41,599
Testifying

789
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
Is people who worked with Gary batt

790
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,999
Play Robin Williams what is this

791
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:53,631
Investigators looking into the Iran-Contra

792
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,215
Scandal they interviewed their offices

793
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:03,615
And deep that his evidence was not worth pursuing Iran-Contra businesses

794
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,735
People

795
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
Substantial

796
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:17,183
Neither he nor Gary bass got in any trouble about Iran-Contra it conveniently Bob claims that all the records

797
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
The government has by the company

798
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,303
Have been classified as top secret

799
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,655
Shopko

800
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,423
We have

801
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,215
It we need to get to the

802
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,543
In the world to establish a villain

803
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
Gary Beck

804
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,407
Because you can repurpose them later when you need them

805
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:41,247
Like having a hand in the Oklahoma City bomber

806
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
Slater

807
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,087
We'll get to that

808
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,927
Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence

809
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,535
Decided

810
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
They decided to head out to the woods in Montana

811
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:13,759
For now all you need to know is it since 2014

812
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:20,159
Planet is heading our way and how they leave their building

813
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:28,095
His career path I'm not going to like this website include the section of photographic evidence from

814
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
A various playing

815
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:33,215
It includes a picture of gold bars with the caption quote

816
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,055
Fort Knox

817
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,871
The rest of the pictures are

818
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,711
Okay that's good

819
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:50,111
It's just a bunch of picture of bars of gold

820
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
Could be

821
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,999
F****** stock photos

822
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:02,399
The rest of the pictures are clearly photoshopped Shottas

823
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,543
Are you suggesting the picture of a real life wormhole

824
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,591
But it's just the moon with spiral drunk

825
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Coming out of it

826
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,503
Okay

827
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:23,903
Video game

828
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
It's at least decently done

829
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:35,935
So that's this guy's career but that's not nearly all he's

830
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,751
Next clip

831
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,823
We get to hear a little bit from Bob

832
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,615
He gives his own fire

833
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
Alex

834
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,831
Miscellaneous random

835
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:59,231
For myself for this morning program

836
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:06,143
Exactly what you been saying

837
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,783
One of the primary people

838
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,319
Creating

839
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
So

840
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,751
His buyout that he wants Alex to know

841
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
Is that he personally

842
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,871
Was the parts of starting the militia Patriot movement

843
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,735
Name of this episode

844
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,063
Close it is to the actual

845
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,743
Don't forget you in Montana you have to start a militia just

846
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,511
To survive out there

847
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,327
It's kind of part of the team

848
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,679
It was an early member and leader within the militia of Montana

849
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:15,775
One of the first militia groups to form in the aftermath of the coast

850
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,871
Thereformation response to the Ruby Ridge standoff

851
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,455
The actual guy

852
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:29,855
Attend the meeting in Estes Park Colorado that would go on to be known as the Rocky Mountains

853
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,927
Conference where the modern militia movement was born

854
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:37,279
160 self-described Christian man who were all very white

855
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,095
Not to discuss their discomfort about how the Federal

856
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:40,863
It was behaving

857
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
Particularly as it related to

858
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
The central figure of Ruby Ridge

859
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:49,567
For this point a lot of things that we've experienced as being deeply interconnect

860
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,359
Like white supremacist groups

861
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,383
Certex protester

862
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,663
Christian identity

863
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,735
We're just vaguely but intensely anti-government group

864
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,271
We're not generally working

865
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,039
Together

866
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,855
Extremist existed in those categories previously

867
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,927
There are often unwilling to collaborate

868
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,719
This 1992

869
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,999
In Colorado with an attempt

870
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,279
Just saw that robbed

871
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
Good

872
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,399
Uno

873
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,727
No I don't want that

874
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:23,103
The meeting was organised by extremist preacher Pete Peters

875
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,967
Is Ministry largely centered on his argument that homosexuals should be put to death

876
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,551
As he laid out in a booklet

877
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,879
I'm sorry was white

878
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
Rock rocks

879
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:44,863
Yeah representatives of the Klan Christian identity of the Posse Comitatus

880
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,215
A literal Murderers Row

881
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,799
This was a meeting that is literally something out of a comic book

882
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:59,199
A gathering of villains who don't really even like each other against their common enemy the federal government

883
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,247
We need to take

884
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:08,159
Alright we're going to take your

885
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,375
27 years later we can see was

886
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,655
Probably pretty

887
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,031
From Stephen of right-wing extremism in modern American

888
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:30,943
Close to the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous for the idea of armed civilian militia

889
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:37,087
Twerk

890
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:41,439
Armed civilian militias would be mostly white middle-class

891
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:44,511
Individuals who are not necessarily racist

892
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:48,095
Either anxious about the economy and their future

893
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,911
As it turns out some excuses for bigotry

894
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:54,239
Never stop being affected

895
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,103
Anxiety

896
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,711
You see here from these groups like the area Nations and

897
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
The clan

898
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:09,087
Christian heating up

899
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:15,487
Get better recruitment they realize that they have to Brand as being about economic anxiety as a

900
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,279
Close to the actual racist

901
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,071
S*** that they were actually

902
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
So

903
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,167
That is to say is

904
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
History

905
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,751
Everybody around here

906
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
We know

907
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,103
How we feel about vinod

908
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,895
Of all kind

909
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,687
And a lot of the white

910
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,247
But we can't

911
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
We can do it

912
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,087
Well it would hurt.

913
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,207
Clan members and Logan would you rather successful

914
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,743
Would you rather

915
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,143
Was a strategy forming brainstorm

916
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,079
Plant

917
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,895
And how the situation the Patriots found themselves

918
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:13,599
Malady of evil moment where it's like Holiday Inn

919
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:19,999
Conference Wireless

920
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,023
Sales

921
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,583
Jeezy All of the ideas.

922
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,519
I'm on any of Alex's shows

923
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
From any point

924
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,127
Very close to Alex's

925
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
New York

926
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:40,735
Meeting with Louis

927
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,783
Representative

928
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,343
You may recall that beat was the guy who came up with

929
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,879
Concept or popularized

930
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,671
The concept of the leaderless resistance

931
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,975
Which Alex talked about being apart of

932
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,255
In the mid-90s

933
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,559
We have the force

934
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:59,167
We have the capacity we have the world and we will not

935
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,007
Call the one

936
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,823
Special Ops

937

Where are the ones galvanizing organization

938

Where are the ones

Reclaim this country for white

954
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:09,567
What they were about a little bit

955
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,615
Rocky Mountain rendezvous

956
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
Larry Pratt

957
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,431
Head of gun owners for America

958
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,735
Someone who Alex had on the show as a guest

959
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,783
In the week after Sandy Hook

960
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,903
Strongest proponent of the strategy moving forward being the formation of quote

961
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,695
Unorganized militia

962
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,767
Which followed beam leaderless resistance ideology

963
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,071
That's making them almost impossible to

964
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,167
Larry Pratt was one of 106

965
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,239
People who were at this Rocky Mountain rendezvous

966
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,519
We're all of you

967
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,799
The representatives

968
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,079
From the clan

969
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,127
Aryan Nations other neo-Nazi

970
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,663
Group Christian identity

971
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,223
Text protester extremist

972
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,271
All together to strategize

973
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,807
Along with Louis beam

974
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,343
It's insane

975
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,415
This is a real very serious problem

976
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
Really

977
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,767
Bums me out because

978
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:05,375
If that was the plot of a warrior style Road movie

979
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:11,775
A small group of a white nationalist

980
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,335
Call gang right that go to this meeting

981
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,127
They realize what's going on almost

982
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
Immediately

983
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
Everybody likes

984
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,967
The doors

985
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,039
Through each different gang the Klan is all wearing white Hood

986
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,599
The Aryan Brotherhood or whatever it is they wear

987
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,623
What do they wear

988
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,439
And then you got

989
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:41,727
A sign that says the three people voted on the Fed

990
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,823
The Holiday Inn Express

991
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,127
I can't find it

992
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,199
We list of that hundred sixty but I bet there's some other names

993
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,479
Oh yeah

994
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,975
Sure

995
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:13,727
Becker

996
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:15,775
The rendezvous

997
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:22,431
You don't start the militia of Montana

998
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,711
But almost certainly exist

999
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
Previously

1000
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:29,343
Occasionally take up arms and storm Courthouse

1001
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,415
95 most of the militia of Montana's work was on the

1002
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,207
The information Warfare side of

1003
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:38,815
They were less paramilitary in nature and more of a mail-order militia

1004
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:42,143
They were clearing house

1005
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:45,727
4 militia groups to get videos on how to start your own militia

1006
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,799
The author of the report

1007
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:55,199
About about that

1008
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,479
Backlash from people like

1009
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,783
Which isn't a coincidence

1010
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,063
You know what that reminds

1011
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,623
So much of Isis

1012
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,975
Perspective a little bit

1013
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
Defending

1014
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,839
These Patriot militia types

1015
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,119
When you realize like

1016
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887
A lot of

1017
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
He's actually

1018
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
Involved with

1019
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,447
Rzp

1020
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,471
Who were the ones

1021
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,495
Who started this

1022
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:24,895
9 starting pitcher was Chaka block with racist

1023
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,175
Anti-semite

1024
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
And very dangerous

1025
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,247
So

1026
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,807
I think Alex might be in

1027
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,159
At least at this point

1028
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
His career

1029
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,207
Earlier

1030
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:45,887
Yeah that's who is ahead of that

1031
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,167
Mercenary group

1032
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,703
Blackwater Erik Prince

1033
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,983
That sounds like

1034
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,519
Something that he masturbate

1035
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,335
Like bij if he wasn't at that meeting

1036
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,407
Like every night.

1037
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:06,623
Dream-come-true rarefied air

1038
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,183
Considered himself actually I found

1039
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
Father

1040
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,607
Sodalicious

1041
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,399
Situation where they at

1042
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
Inside of things

1043
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,959
But make no mistake

1044
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,871
The materials are distributed included a ton of white supremacist publication

1045
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,663
Work by Holocaust deniers

1046
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,967
And plentiful articles referring to Judaism

1047
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,503
Movie quote synagogue of Satan

1048
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,575
It was a committed member of Aryan Nation

1049
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:42,975
Before starting to downplay that part of his life most likely as part of the message

1050
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,999
Rocky Mountain rendezvous

1051
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,303
In order to win people over to our side

1052
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,095
We have to pretend we're not racing

1053
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:53,215
Turn of events

1054
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,007
For 2006

1055
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,567
His brother kicked him out because he had cheated on his wife

1056
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:02,175
Which life started to organization called the Coalition for men's rights

1057
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:06,783
Which is basically a support group for men who had restraining orders against them for abusing their wives

1058
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:13,183
He was kicked out of the group for cheating on his own one his own

1059
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,231
Immoral

1060
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:21,631
The leadership of the Maury show

1061
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:26,239
No do I get from the pronoun

1062
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,847
We started this

1063
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:38,015
Attract

1064
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,063
Of where the hustle goes

1065
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,207
Price you guys are awful

1066
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,303
Shortwave radio in early

1067
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,095
Boards on the internet

1068
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,447
Let them know about the noble get their oppressive federal government

1069
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,263
T95 article in the guardian

1070
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,591
In speech after speech Basu dire warnings of

1071
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,359
The coming threat

1072
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:08,223
5 days before purchasing a gun

1073
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,551
The 1994 ban on limited number of assault weapon

1074
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,367
The leaders urged Their audience to read the writing on the wall

1075
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
People control

1076
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,815
According to the militia it's all part of a wider and undeniable trend

1077
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,863
The government is now at war with the people

1078
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,143
Weatherby excessive

1079
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
Do taxes

1080
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:30,239
Expanding regulation or plant national identity card

1081
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,543
Washington is constructing the apparatus of

1082
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,127
Alex Jones May as well

1083
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:36,895
Those beaches

1084
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,687
That is his

1085
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,991
World Series 1 million

1086
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,975
Derail the militia

1087
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:56,095
Community in no small part because he wasn't a body made of exactly what the

1088
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,679
But as soon as he actually

1089
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,727
And blaming everyone else

1090
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,799
Intoxicants

1091
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,079
Blaming the Japanese

1092
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,359
As retaliation

1093
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,407
4

1094
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:13,759
Another terrorist attack the casting of the subway

1095
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,319
Conspiracy theory was

1096
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,599
Beebe so

1097
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,647
He was forced out of his own group

1098
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,975
He was he was kicked out of the Michigan militia

1099
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
Because he was

1100
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,511
Forever Pets

1101
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:29,375
Real dumb

1102
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,959
Somewhat but it also was indicative of the level of identity crisis

1103
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
This world

1104
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
The world

1105
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,615
The real face of

1106
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,895
When was about it been revealed

1107
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,711
Although the attendees of Rocky Mountain rendezvous

1108
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,991
So hard to conceal it

1109
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,295
And that's recruitment went on the decline

1110
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,319
But of course

1111
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,367
The ones who did come around after that play

1112
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:55,999
Radical than the recruits have been previously thought that McVay was

1113
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,815
That these guys were betraying their eyes

1114
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Ideals

1115
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:04,191
And the ones that suck around the ones were like yeah McVeigh was absolutely right on

1116
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,495
So of course we're not going

1117
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,287
Or they're the ones

1118
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,591
Internalized

1119
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,127
It's all fake

1120
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,319
This is the point where I get I'm getting a little bit

1121
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,879
Maybe I'm drawing connect

1122
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,159
That

1123
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,695
Might be a little bit

1124
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,511
I'm not entirely sure

1125
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:36,447
This is a woefully simplistic and CliffsNotes version of the story when you look at the Players he look at the motivations you look at

1126
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,215
Connections

1127
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:40,287
I find it hard not to come away with one very strong

1128
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,055
Conclusion

1129
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:45,151
In the early nineties the militia is Montana in the Michigan militia exist

1130
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,431
Symbiotics state

1131
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,503
Radicalized

1132
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,807
Immediately shortwave radio what-have-you

1133
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,111
The Michigan game

1134
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:58,719
Alex Jones is clearly at least a spiritual extension of the militia of Montana

1135
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,255
Has he has a medium out

1136
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,815
It spreads the narratives propaganda

1137
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:08,447
Towards that paramilitary group that will give them the training

1138
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
That they need

1139
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:09,983
To become

1140
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,263
Dangerous

1141
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,311
So who's the Michigan militia

1142
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,079
In this equation

1143
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,895
The guy who started the toy shop

1144
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,967
But the question is a little bit more complicated

1145
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,503
Then just saying

1146
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,271
Or whatever

1147
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:25,087
Do the Rocky Mount Rendezvous happened in 1990

1148
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,879
82 is before the election

1149
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:31,231
The militias did not officially begin their organization until mid 1990

1150
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,071
3in Turley 1994 election of Bill Clinton

1151
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,607
The first Democratic president

1152
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
81

1153
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:42,495
If you take Carter out of the equation Clinton was the first Democratic president since LBJ

1154
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,287
And the Civil Rights Act

1155
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,335
The rise of malicious

1156
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
We fight against

1157
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,407
Further expansion

1158
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Human rights

1159
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,199
Non-whites

1160
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,991
As it was about anything else

1161
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,271
But they were too hard

1162
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,551
And they were too fast

1163
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,831
And they overplay their hand

1164
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,487
Exact whether or not it's about to do that

1165
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
They

1166
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
What

1167
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,583
After the bombing of the Murrah building

1168
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
Militia Act

1169
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:12,447
It hurt their ability to do much more than Purdue

1170
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
News propaganda

1171
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:17,055
The Montana militia Alex Pepsi a burning

1172
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,079
Until the time was

1173
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:22,943
In 2008 Barack Obama was elected in the same way that the militias organized

1174
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
Met up to plan their strategies

1175
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,039
Estes Park back in 1992

1176
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,087
Literally 2009-13

1177
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,647
Far-right weirdos plan to Summit on Jekyll Island

1178
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
Georgia

1179
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,695
To plan their next moves

1180
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,719
In their struggle against

1181
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,023
A democratic been elected

1182
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,303
The time was right

1183
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,327
Deformed

1184
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,655
I don't think there's a coincidence

1185
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,703
I really don't

1186
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:49,311
Because I think the way you have with these groups as when there's a republican in office

1187
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,895
They know that whatever they care about isn't going to be infringed upon

1188
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:58,783
Window discourse becomes so much closer to what they're into

1189
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,831
Why not just engaged

1190
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
Did the Civil process

1191
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,647
Right or at least back

1192
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,439
Bush was in office

1193
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:11,839
Why not try and run for office or why not try and deal with this through legislation

1194
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,191
Has President we don't have it

1195
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:16,959
Sympathetic

1196
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,495
So we're going to have to use

1197
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
Right

1198
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:26,175
Jekyll Island meeting was organized by Alex Jones is Bob Schultz of the we are we the people Foundation

1199
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:30,015
It was gorgonize by another of Alex's get Edwin Sierra

1200
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,575
Another person who was there with Eric cutting

1201
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,623
Representative of the oak

1202
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,183
The group in which Alex finally found

1203
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,463
The Michigan militia

1204
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,511
To his militia of Montana

1205
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,863
The Jekyll Island meeting involved to radicalize town hall

1206
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
That were being held around

1207
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:51,263
Perfect opportunity for recruitment

1208
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:56,127
Something to Alex and his oathkeeper buddies to Rhodes of opened

1209
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,175
The meeting also involved learning

1210
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,199
From the lessons of the past

1211
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,527
Timothy McVeigh screw things up for the militias for a long time

1212
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,575
The force them into a position where they had to

1213
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,599
Construct elaborate

1214
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,903
The Pretenders attack wasn't

1215
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,183
Exactly what they wanted

1216
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Does it happen

1217
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,767
But the problem is they also provided

1218
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
With an

1219
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
Did benefit

1220
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:17,375
Because they spent years insisted the OKC bombing was

1221
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,143
Conspiracy

1222
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,679
They've created a built-in.

1223
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,703
Sprint

1224
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Future events

1225
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,263
It could be that could derail their move

1226
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,335
When one of their members would inevitably take

1227
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,127
Antigovernment message seriously

1228
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
They had a built-in

1229
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,943
To say that it's

1230
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,735
The globalist trying to make us look

1231
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,063
I think that's where we find ourselves

1232
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,343
In 2012

1233
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,391
Have some of this

1234
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:42,719
Explains a good bit of Alex's

1235
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,999
Operation

1236
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,559
And how

1237
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
In French

1238
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,887
And a lot of this militia history

1239
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,935
I'm seeing himself as a part of

1240
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,471
Yeah but I also think

1241
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
You such a

1242
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,799
That like obviously

1243
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:57,823
He doesn't explain every

1244
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,639
No I don't know

1245
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,687
But he's pulling these negative

1246
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,479
But I think that this is

1247
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
Is a huge one

1248
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,015
And I think

1249
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,831
I think on some level it goes back to

1250
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:09,855
The beginning of his

1251
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,951
Is it possible that these organs

1252
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,719
Innovations

1253
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,743
That works

1254
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:19,327
We theorize in and all that stuff

1255
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,351
About

1256
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,375
Some kind of dark

1257
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,215
Is it possible that

1258
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,007
These organizations are the ones that

1259
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,543
Al profit

1260
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,127
It seems unlikely I think probably

1261
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,943
Maybe provided a support

1262
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,967
Network early on

1263
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,295
Those communities

1264
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,319
Another voice

1265
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,135
Of their side

1266
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,207
Material support

1267
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,511
But like Alex only got on the air

1268
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,703
A lot of

1269
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,007
The Montana

1270
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,567
Both lost a lot of their

1271
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,199
Oh I mean like as time has gone on

1272
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:12,319
No Keepers start coming in together like

1273
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,855
This is it this is starting

1274
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
To be a group

1275
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,695
Tribunal throw around money

1276
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,255
Where they started

1277
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
Let's get involved about

1278
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,399
The first time

1279
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,423
April

1280
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
2009

1281
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,471
I hate like

1282
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
Talk about

1283
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:32,799
A blogspot

1284
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,639
Keepers he didn't even have like a normal website

1285
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
URL

1286
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,479
I don't know

1287
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,503
I don't know

1288
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,527
This is the

1289
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,063
The part of it that I think is

1290
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,343
For Alex

1291
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,391
The part that I like

1292
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,695
I think whatever nefarious in

1293
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,975
Influence there could be

1294
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,255
I don't think it is anything

1295
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,303
I think this is

1296
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,351
This is closest to where Alex Hart

1297
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,119
Really like

1298
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,143
Yeah in some way

1299
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:03,775
Feliway the layers upon layers of onions

1300
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:06,591
He's like the guy who

1301
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,615
Wants to

1302
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,383
Dress up

1303
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,175
Play actors Soldier

1304
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,575
And 100%

1305
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,855
Is

1306
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:21,951
Surrounded by fascist surrounded by biggest

1307
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,719
Nauseated

1308
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
People

1309
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:24,767
And does he

1310
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
Damnedest

1311
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:26,815
To make sure that

1312
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,911
Pretend that they're not those things in order to keep

1313
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,823
I don't know there's a lot more gear

1314
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,359
And I think we're only just

1315
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
Now starting

1316
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,919
Into Summer

1317
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:42,943
Glimpses

1318
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,991
Of Alex's militia leaning

1319
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,015
And one of the reason

1320
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,807
For that is I think it's probably a

1321
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:51,903
Of his show in the era that we don't have

1322
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
Archives

1323
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,975
Yeah like I think if we went back

1324
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,999
2

1325
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
I mean we have

1326
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,815
Just a small glimpse

1327
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:05,215
Of stuff from the 90s and Clint is him thoroughly saying we are the ones with the leaderless resistance

1328
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,007
In the mid-90s

1329
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,031
Soleil

1330
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,311
Did did

1331
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,079
That I have

1332
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,103
My working

1333
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,895
Is a lot of episodes

1334
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
We can't find

1335
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,943
Would probably be

1336
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,223
Very deeply

1337
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,247
Stoked

1338
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,783
In malicious.

1339
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
Fleet like a lot of those gas

1340
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,391
From that world

1341
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
We're probably stick

1342
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,951
Pictures of your show back then

1343
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,255
And now it's not so much

1344
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,279
He's grown

1345
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,303
Evolved

1346
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,631
And now we have in the wake of

1347
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,655
Sandy Hook

1348
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
Do you have

1349
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,983
I mean not that it wasn't

1350
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,775
Do you have Larry Pratt

1351
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,799
On twice

1352
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,591
In the week after Sandy Hook

1353
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,639
What was at the f****** Rocky

1354
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,663
Rendezvous

1355
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,199
In the same week

1356
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,223
Stewart Road

1357
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:48,991
Twice

1358
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,783
The Oath Keepers guy who is

1359
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,343
Whether you like it or not

1360
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,159
Essentially an equivalent to the Michigan weather

1361
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:59,999
Because if you really look at it let me what do you have you have a bunch of people

1362
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,047
From The Oath Keepers who

1363
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,327
Baby it's not with your

1364
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,607
Malaysian is about but there's a

1365
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:11,263
I can come up off the top of my head with the least five people try to plan terrorist attacks

1366
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
I think I had to

1367
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:16,383
Both at least

1368
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,199
Their parallels that are very important

1369
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,319
They're real

1370
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,111
Do you have these guests three rhymes

1371
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,159
Sprite do you have these guests

1372
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:29,951
Gun

1373
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,487
Supporting weirdos

1374
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,279
But there's more to it

1375
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:36,863
And then now we have on January 2nd as Alex

1376
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,143
Cuz pivoted away

1377
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,191
From it being about Sandy Hook

1378
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,727
And now it's about.

1379
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
Exactly

1380
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,287
Ideas that these militias were

1381
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,055
We're putting out

1382
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,079
In the 90s

1383
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:50,175
You know this idea that the government's coming to take your guns and there's going to be a civil war

1384
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,967
This is very much what

1385
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,295
The militias were saying it after ruby red

1386
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,623
So of course what is he do he has one of the

1387
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,159
The f****** man guide

1388
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,207
From the Montana militia

1389
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:08,095
Doesn't bring up that he was one of the leaders of the militia of Montana

1390
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:12,703
That was a whistleblower

1391
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:15,263
When none of that

1392
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
But what is

1393
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,591
Is in the aftermath of Oklahoma City

1394
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,383
Bob Fletcher

1395
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:22,943
This guy who has Alex has on his show

1396
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,479
You know what his comment was

1397
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,015
There's a tenth planet

1398
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,551
Nibiru

1399
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,879
Get ready for more bombs

1400
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,647
Okay

1401
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
Cuckoo cuckoo

1402
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,791
So I think

1403
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,327
Discards a little

1404
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,631
And maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill

1405
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
And I

1406
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,727
Might be a hill Mountain

1407
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,007
Situation

1408
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,847
If you look at this I don't see any way to escape

1409
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,871
The fact that

1410
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,943
The influences of Alex are all

1411
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,711
Present

1412
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,479
In

1413
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,759
The early parts

1414
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:00,575
Of the militia movement in the early 90s

1415
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,855
That was

1416
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,647
Inescapably big

1417
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:11,583
The things in the messages that they had white washed and put out into the world

1418
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,607
Are very

1419
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,911
Consistently repeated analysis world

1420
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,191
And then guest

1421
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,471
Who are

1422
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
From that work like that literal meaning

1423
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,055
And then from the things

1424
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,591
It grew out of that meeting

1425
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,639
All there

1426
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
And if

1427
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,711
It it

1428
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,759
Hates a leaderless resistance

1429
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,111
Alex

1430
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,927
Cuz you can't 100% time to each other but

1431
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,463
We need those tapes

1432
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,511
We need to find those old episodes

1433
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:41,791
I think there's a

1434
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,095
Treasure Trove like things he doesn't want people

1435
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,375
Do I bet

1436
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:53,055
Especially the time he told the story about the first time I did p***

1437
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:57,919
Viagra

1438
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:00,735
I'll call myself out a tiny bit

1439
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,527
Analysis

1440
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,367
Because I think it is kind of overly

1441
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,391
Simplistic to be like

1442
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,207
Demolition of Montana in Michigan

1443
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,999
Operated as like one wasn't

1444
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,791
Information on Military

1445
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:16,095
Because there were other militias around 2

1446
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,679
I just look at it

1447
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,959
If you have

1448
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
If you want a successful operation

1449
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
You need to have those

1450
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,079
Two things bsep

1451
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,103
From each other

1452
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:27,871
Yet working

1453
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:32,735
Together of the people who are being trained

1454
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
In

1455
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
Military tactic

1456
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,575
Putting out

1457
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,343
Tropicana

1458
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,623
You need to be on the same

1459
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,671
Page but you cannot be related

1460
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,207
You can't be the same thing

1461
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
Because

1462
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,791
Let's say one of these guys goes and shoots up something

1463
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,559
Then

1464
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,095
You jeopardize your propaganda

1465
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:48,863
Outlet

1466
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,655
Do you know

1467
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,447
I'm separated

1468
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,471
And I think

1469
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,847
Yeah I agree

1470
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:02,175
There are very very clear parallels right yet

1471
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,223
History doesn't repeat it rhymes

1472
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,503
Like this

1473
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
This

1474
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,063
Explosion of

1475
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,087
White nationalist

1476
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,879
Militias and

1477
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,671
Murderers and all that s***

1478
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,463
It

1479
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,511
It wouldn't be as

1480
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
Often

1481
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,583
I don't think

1482
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,375
I could be wrong but it would

1483
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,911
We wouldn't see as much

1484
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
Violence

1485
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,215
If there weren't

1486
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,751
Some sort of

1487
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,031
Concerted ideology

1488
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,567
That ties all of these

1489
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:35,455
And we wouldn't be and we would be able to do more if they had actual

1490
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,735
Physical connection

1491
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:40,575
Organizations

1492
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,599
That were doing

1493
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,439
I don't know let's play

1494
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
In his.

1495
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
Benny's garage

1496
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,607
You know when that happened

1497
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,399
Like

1498
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,703
Right

1499
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,239
What an essential piece of

1500
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,263
How things key

1501
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,055
Keep moving forward is Alex

1502
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,335
It's on Aaron says

1503
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:08,223
Did this is a false flag and the government report comes out

1504
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,063
That's a real threat

1505
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,111
It's not really a big threat to Alex

1506
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:16,671
In his operation or anything like that

1507
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,207
Is a big threat to them

1508
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:19,999
To not be

1509
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:20,767
Connected to them

1510
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,815
Lead

1511
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:23,839
Some sort of charge

1512
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:24,863
To get that

1513
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,887
Redacted

1514
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,215
So which is why

1515
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,519
Even though there's

1516
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:35,615
Consequences for

1517
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,943
That's troubling

1518
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,479
Not great

1519
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:43,039
A little bit later the episodes

1520
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:43,807
Calls

1521
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,855
Alex gets a call from a guy

1522
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,135
Who

1523
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,159
How many

1524
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:48,927
If I hear

1525
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,975
This guy I think

1526
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,743
Jesus

1527
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,279
I don't know how much

1528
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,815
Literally

1529
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,351
But he's scary

1530
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,911
And he confronts Alex about

1531
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:06,079
I was that girl from Cairo near police

1532
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,383
Call Alex

1533
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:09,919
Privilege

1534
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:16,319
Yes I just wanted to let you know that I've been speaking with you for over to listening to your program for over 2 years now

1535
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:18,367
And nobody has ever called in

1536
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,671
Tell you what I'm going to tell you right now

1537
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,975
There are secret sleep sleeper cells

1538
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,511
All over the country

1539
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,047
That are ready and willing

1540
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,095
Take charge of the situation

1541
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,911
And I'm not talkin about kicking people's doors in

1542
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
Alright

1543
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:33,215
Let's be

1544
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:33,983
Clear

1545
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,519
If you talkin about

1546
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
That he

1547
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,591
His buddies were involved in

1548
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:41,919
Yeah

1549
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,479
But I'm not talking about kicking doors in

1550
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,855
Organizing Macy's style parade

1551
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:54,463
That's already but also notice

1552
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,631
The people that I hang out with

1553
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,167
Call ex-military

1554
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,215
I spent 20 years in the Navy

1555
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,495
And I know that I

1556
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,871
The only thing that bothers me sir about you

1557
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,175
Is that you were never in the military

1558
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,223
So you never swore an oath to the car

1559
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,319
And I have my doubts about you being a DOD plant

1560
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:23,391
And I want you right now to your worldwide audience

1561
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,671
Tell everybody

1562
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,207
That you are

1563
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
Real

1564
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,279
Because you offer

1565
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:32,095
You talk a lot but you don't really offer any solution

1566
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,143
And I'm an action person

1567
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:39,775
About Solutions

1568
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,575
Earlier

1569
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,855
Now you're calling in

1570
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:05,887
The Constitution.

1571
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:11,263
Who is that Alex is like you're just calling

1572
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,543
More than two

1573
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,311
At least

1574
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,848
Callers Play Hold On

1575
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,384
I have set

1576
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:22,784
Instead things that Alex like right right

1577
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,856
Questioning this guy in anyway because he

1578
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,136
No

1579
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:31,232
This is how you play with him

1580
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,512
And everything goes fine

1581
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,816
You get out of pocket and he will actually

1582
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,352
Respond to whatever you're saying

1583
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,888
Like a normal human being

1584
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,912
Which is

1585
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,704
I don't know who the f*** you are

1586
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,032
Stop process though

1587
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:47,104
If he were a DOD plant

1588
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:50,176
I believe he would have had to swear an oath to

1589
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,736
To work for the defense department

1590
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:56,576
I'm pretty sure that no matter which side that guys landed on

1591
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,856
He would have had to swear

1592
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:00,416
The only way

1593
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:02,208
Susan isn't he's fine

1594
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,488
That's it

1595
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,768
I'm not sure exact

1596
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,352
Where is the

1597
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:09,888
All the time

1598
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,936
Usually when he's coming

1599
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:15,264
So a little bit of a wrench

1600
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:20,128
And now expenses Wheels quite a bit

1601
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,920
One of those callers have called him out

1602
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,200
And he forgot to hit the

1603
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:28,832
Person on Earth

1604
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,384
It didn't

1605
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,152
Interpersonally

1606
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,432
He doesn't

1607
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,064
Let's just move on

1608
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,648
I'm totally fine

1609
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,464
You can't hurt my feelings Ivan

1610
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,632
What Solutions have I

1611
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:21,568
Also going on where

1612
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:25,664
Alex's responses like okay good I'm bad

1613
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,944
Pallet

1614
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:27,968
Like

1615
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:30,784
It wasn't even

1616
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,320
It was a conditional

1617
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,344
Sword of judgment

1618
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:37,952
You didn't serve the army

1619
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,304
Defend the Constitution

1620
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
Hey man

1621
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,960
I love you I support you all you need

1622
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,984
To do is

1623
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,520
Swear an oath right now

1624
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:57,920
And we're all on your team

1625
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,200
Is reluctance

1626
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,736
To do things like that people can

1627
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:06,880
Confront like I watched the whole thing

1628
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,440
That they want a lot

1629
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,232
Saying that you didn't marry her brother

1630
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,256
Right

1631
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,584
That's a

1632
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,656
These were trying to set some sort of a trap that like

1633
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:25,056
Or not they're going to make a big deal out of whatever you do

1634
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,616
That's not what this guy was doing

1635
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:32,480
If Alex has said I understand I haven't served in the armed forces I wish I would have

1636
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:43,488
Have done everything might like to uphold

1637
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,536
Dude

1638
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,328
If he doesn't

1639
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,864
Text now

1640
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,400
Say where you wanted to hit

1641
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,424
Maybe

1642
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:57,824
But

1643
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:02,176
Salute you were on your side or something like that

1644
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,968
They're not going to be bummed out to

1645
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,992
Figure Alex velluto

1646
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:08,320
The Constitution

1647
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,344
It's not a trap

1648
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:13,440
If there's no trap here but Alex is so defensive and weird

1649
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,976
That because this guy is

1650
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,512
Critiquing the possibility

1651
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,536
That he isn't

1652
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,352
He wrote that he presents himself

1653
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,888
He's got to respond

1654
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:25,472
Thank you f***** up

1655
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,752
I think it's

1656
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,336
The guy question Alex's manhood

1657
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
And Alex's

1658
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:34,432
Like the way

1659
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:45,440
Text military we all swore notes sleeper cells

1660
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:47,232
And that's where Alex is like

1661
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,792
F*** you you think you're great

1662
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,560
Maybe

1663
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,656
There may be some masculine

1664
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:59,520
Piece 280 I think it's more about love

1665
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,824
Douching

1666
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,408
There might be

1667
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,992
Much like Lennie in the B

1668
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,808
That metaphors pretty appropriate

1669
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:16,672
I think maybe there's a subconscious liver that's about that

1670
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,440
Masculinity

1671
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,976
But I think it's

1672
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:19,744
Do more like

1673
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,768
Loyalty

1674
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,560
Country and how dare anyone

1675
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,584
Impune

1676
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:29,216
Whatever answer Alex

1677
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:32,288
Swearing an oath to the Constitution

1678
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:39,200
He's done that a thousand times

1679
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:46,112
That's true in the phone

1680
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:49,952
Tell me that you love the constitutionalist

1681
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,488
FaceTime me bro

1682
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,768
Hello

1683
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,304
So

1684
01:25:54,816 --> 01:26:00,960
Things that make people like that last call

1685
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,264
Who is in a terrorist cell

1686
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,872
Activated

1687
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:13,760
Great-uncle

1688
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,832
What

1689
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,544
Is it

1690
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,592
No other people

1691
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,760
Around

1692
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,512
Not to split hairs

1693
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:58,816
From knowing a lot of the criticism

1694
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,352
About Alex

1695
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120
And Eve

1696
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,912
Communities online is message boards

1697
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,960
One of the issues

1698
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,520
Only talked about having family

1699
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,056
And stuff like that

1700
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:13,152
Constantly talks about family being in CIA and s*** like that

1701
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:19,040
Vaguely referencing

1702
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:22,368
Paranoid

1703
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:24,416
Real militia types

1704
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,184
Like

1705
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,464
The people who are

1706
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,792
The descendants of the Michigan militia

1707
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,560
They are

1708
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:34,400
Suspicious of people like who have familial ties

1709
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,448
The intelligent organization

1710
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,776
That vase t as part of the enemy part of was trying to

1711
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:40,544
Infiltrate

1712
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:46,944
They are like I have a great uncle cousin who

1713
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:53,344
Covert Ops

1714
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,624
And I don't

1715
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,440
If the CIA told him to go deal drugs

1716
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,768
And kill people in Chicago

1717
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,536
Dead

1718
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304
Right

1719
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:05,120
Bright there's no way you're walking away from

1720
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,192
Disruptive inverter a bunch

1721
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:08,960
Two people

1722
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,264
Just sign you don't want to sign

1723
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,312
P***

1724
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:19,968
That's what that's what's being expressed by that caller ID

1725
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,040
Only a little bit later in the show

1726
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,344
Alex manifest exactly why

1727
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,880
The hardest core

1728
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:27,648
Folk don't

1729
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,488
I wouldn't

1730
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:39,936
If you were operating in a splinter cell or you imagine

1731
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:46,080
Do you spell there's a problem

1732
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:55,808
Mexico plays the last one from this episode

1733
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,368
Alex

1734
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:11,680
Nation.com

1735
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:18,080
They are trying to move on

1736
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,640
We can back them off again that's how I look

1737
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,224
If we get the word out

1738
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:25,760
We can

1739
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,040
When this ago

1740
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,088
That's not what they did in

1741
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,904
They didn't get the word out

1742
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,720
What Bob Fletcher was involved

1743
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:41,120
You could make a decent argument that the militia of Montana was less

1744
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,912
Violently oriented

1745
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,264
And that's probably why Alex would have Bob Fletcher on

1746
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,544
As opposed to

1747
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,824
Someone from the Michigan

1748
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,616
Or something like that

1749
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,896
I could understand his

1750
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,176
More

1751
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,456
More comfort

1752
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:59,296
With someone who wears uniform as opposed to

1753
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:02,368
But make no mistake about it all of it grew out of

1754
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,928
The Rocky Mountain Rendezvous that was

1755
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,720
Lousy with Nazis

1756
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,768
Ariens White supremacists

1757
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,816
And people who

1758
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:15,680
Wanted to blow up like so

1759
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:20,544
When Alex says we need to do is what Bob did in the past

1760
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,360
Not

1761
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,384
Cool

1762
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:33,344
I was struggling to find a way

1763
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:39,744
What was it like at the globalist

1764
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,328
Bob Fletcher is super uncool

1765
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,912
Super

1766
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,728
Confronted him

1767
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,264
Absolution

1768
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,592
Absolution is do what Bob did.

1769
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:56,896
Didn't the 90s

1770
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,432
Going to end up with

1771
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,040
Do we eat

1772
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:09,696
He's going to end up with a national Guardsmen caught with a s*** ton of f****** guns ready to start killing.

1773
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:14,048
Guy from

1774
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,352
You're going to end up with all of this stuff

1775
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:18,400
Showing up

1776
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:20,960
Bunch of globalist

1777
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:24,032
The mail

1778
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,592
So I just be like

1779
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,176
I want to call myself out of tiny

1780
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,736
And I think there is so much more

1781
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,784
About this this

1782
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:37,856
And I think it'll be probably impossible for us

1783
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:40,672
Bully

1784
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:45,536
The militia movement alexson

1785
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,608
The consequences thereof and the parallels between

1786
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,888
2009 and 9

1787
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,936
B3

1788
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:56,288
It would be something that would be doctorate-level

1789
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:00,896
Lord of the Rings trilogy level of information

1790
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:01,664
Right

1791
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,992
But I think some of these things are important to introduce to the conversation

1792
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:08,832
It was that episode about Bill Cooper

1793
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:09,600
Without

1794
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,880
You're fully diving in

1795
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,160
Introducing

1796
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:12,928
N2r

1797
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,952
OurWorld

1798
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,488
We're able to

1799
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:22,912
Right

1800
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:23,936
Part of the Arizona

1801
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,800
Yeah we take a toad dip because it's what Alex Broughton

1802
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,568
Conversation

1803
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,104
He has Bob Fletcher on

1804
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:32,896
I don't like

1805
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,736
I don't immediately think

1806
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,760
Like oh

1807
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,528
I know

1808
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:42,112
This guy who is second banana in the militia of Montana

1809
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,648
I don't have that encyclopedic

1810
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,672
Knowledge

1811
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:48,256
Alex says that he's involved in the Iran-Contra

1812
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:53,888
I started the militia movement

1813
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:56,960
Yeah yeah yeah

1814
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,728
You start to fight

1815
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,264
These parallel start to be

1816
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
Clear

1817
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
You start to think

1818
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,080
You start to learn

1819
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,104
A little bit more

1820
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,640
I already knew about a bit about that

1821
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,664
Montana militia

1822
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,456
Oh wait

1823
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,040
That was started by

1824
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,576
Do Estes Park Summit

1825
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:14,624
Who else was there

1826
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:15,904
It's not weird

1827
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,440
There's so much

1828
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,208
There's just so much

1829
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:22,048
What did he have Bob Fletcher

1830
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,584
He specifically have Bob Fletcher

1831
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:34,848
Well that's what I'm saying it suggests to me that Alex

1832
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:40,480
Purposefully gave him the intro of somebody who is involved with Iran Contra

1833
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:43,296
As opposed to giving the man's full credit

1834
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:46,112
Right by which include

1835
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:49,184
It would be super

1836
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,720
Suspicious

1837
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:54,304
Himself was probably like

1838
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:58,144
Don't give me your actual intro

1839
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:03,264
He talks over and when he's like I started

1840
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,544
Yep

1841
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,896
Don't tell anybody

1842
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:14,016
Because generally he would want to be associated with

1843
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:19,136
Which

1844
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,696
There's a discomfort with where he stands

1845
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,488
Not like in the hierarchy

1846
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,048
In terms of where the narrative

1847
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,072
In the beginning

1848
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:30,144
Like I don't know if you want

1849
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,424
People to realize

1850
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:33,472
That like a lot of

1851
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:34,752
These people that he's talking to

1852
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,544
Are who they are

1853
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,360
Are there such

1854
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,384
Extreme

1855
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:45,248
After this

1856
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,784
She starts talking about Nibiru

1857
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,064
Fletcher

1858
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:54,208
Fletcher really just started

1859
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,816
Strange

1860
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:01,632
Dreams turn for the guy to start the

1861
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,936
Modern militia movement and leads

1862
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,960
Into the depths of

1863
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,496
How many people at this point

1864
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,520
A few

1865
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,800
It's you then just be like

1866
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,104
You know what

1867
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,664
I got to reach the top of my profession

1868
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:19,040
I think I'm going to start talking about

1869
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:24,928
10th planet

1870
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,768
You're kind of a con person

1871
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,864
You just like me

1872
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,656
There's nothing left in this well

1873
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:36,192
Let's try

1874
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,216
Yeah

1875
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,288
Mike cernovich

1876
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,312
Pick-up artist

1877
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,176
He's dropping off at

1878
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,712
Same thing with Mark Dice

1879
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:49,760
Being a memory scam salesman

1880
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:53,344
Pick-up artist who wrote a book about it

1881
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,648
Either Satanist everywhere racket

1882
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:57,696
Wrote a book under the suit

1883
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:01,024
The one popular online

1884
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,304
Self is Mark Dice

1885
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:05,376
And started going out Alex's show then try to do,

1886
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:06,144
Blankets

1887
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,704
It's all like these people are all over the play

1888
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:09,984
There's no disk

1889
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,264
Anchor

1890
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,568
I'd like to relate to that on some level

1891
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,944
I did stand up for a long time

1892
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,480
Stop

1893
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,272
Like I understand pivoting

1894
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:26,880
Because nothing is soprano

1895
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:29,184
All of your

1896
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,720
That's why

1897
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,792
I think that's

1898
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:41,728
Psychopathic mine Psychopathic narcissistic mine view of like

1899
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,776
Why the f*** I just do this

1900
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:47,872
Get out bright

1901
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,200
From time to time with these guys were they like

1902
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:54,272
Yeah I'm just going to write a book about being a pickup artist now with

1903
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,040
No

1904
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,576
Research note

1905
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,368
Nothing no history

1906
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,928
I'm not f****** work at all

1907
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:04,256
I'm just going to say a bunch of dumb s*** Big Break

1908
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,048
I'm the smartest human being on the

1909
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,864
Like that's something you wish you could

1910
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:13,984
Yeah

1911
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,432
Solid

1912
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,016
Militia of Montana

1913
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,296
Was like

1914
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:30,624
You know they were a mail-order kind of operation where they were selling

1915
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,160
These DVDs in it

1916
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:33,184
Information

1917
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:33,952
National things

1918
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,744
Right

1919
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,048
You can make the Alex's spiritually

1920
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,608
In terms of trying to monetize

1921
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:41,888
The militia world

1922
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:44,704
Yeah there's like a scam

1923
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,008
That didn't

1924
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,800
Exist as strongly

1925
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,592
If some of those other more militaristic

1926
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:54,176
Right like how the clan was an MLS

1927
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,200
Like that whole thing

1928
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,832
Is full of thoughts

1929
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:05,696
If any of this pops up going down the road

1930
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,744
Here in the beginning of January

1931
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,024
How Alex Price

1932
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:09,792
Navigate to

1933
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:10,560
Really treasure

1934
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:12,864
Where is Waterloo

1935
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:13,888
Anaya

1936
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:14,912
Early 20s

1937
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,520
Have to do when you're in treacherous water

1938
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:25,920
You got to give it up to the Somali pirate job through it

1939
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:27,968
So I don't know we'll see

1940
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:28,736
But also

1941
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:29,760
Need to find

1942
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:30,528
Episode

1943
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,808
I know they're out there

1944
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:33,856
I'll just put the call out

1945
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,136
Does anybody have any idea

1946
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,928
How to get your hands on

1947
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:43,328
Real old episodes

1948
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:53,056
If that is I swear to God if the last Blockbuster standing

1949
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,080
Has all those tapes

1950
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:59,712
We're Road trippin right now

1951
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,808
Public Access

1952
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:05,600
And

1953
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:12,000
I think there's got to be copies somewhere but we don't have access

1954
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,352
They don't have access

1955
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:17,888
CIA

1956
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:22,496
Who work there probably has copies

1957
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:25,824
I need them

1958
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,104
Do you have them let me know

1959
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:33,248
But until another episode this is little bit

1960
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:35,808
I was really hoping nice

1961
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:42,208
Restore our rabbit

1962
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,744
It was a bad week

1963
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:50,144
Express

1964
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,936
Life stress

1965
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,216
But your situation

1966
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,496
Has pivoted into a

1967
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:55,776
More stress

1968
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,056
Cool but different

1969
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:01,920
And I'm gathering

1970
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,968
Really really sit down

1971
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:04,992
Good 5-hour

1972
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,296
It just

1973
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:11,904
Arc legs back

1974
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:17,792
Our ability to Traverse treacherous Waters is coming to close

1975
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,352
Set an alarm for the ride along

1976
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:24,192
Next week absolutely

1977
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:31,616
That's correct

1978
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,344
Crazy

1979
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,904
Incubus everybody

1980
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,976
Listen

1981
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:49,536
Patreon

1982
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,352
But for now

1983
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,376
I guess if we look

1984
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:57,472
This not have any winners

1985
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:00,288
I disagree I think there's one

1986
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,384
Is Little Richard

1987
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:08,480
The guy who wrote the Larry's a taken out of

1988
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,504
Fair enough

1989
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,600
Butchered I'm certain his never killed anybody cuz I one guy techno

1990
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,624
Probably

1991
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,672
Is a gentleman by the name

1992
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,440
Alex Jones
