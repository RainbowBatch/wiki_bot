00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra First Time coloring

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,776
Flex fit round

3
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:17,408
Alex Jones

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,224
I think everybody's clamoring for plant

5
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,248
Play watch

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,784
July 11th

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,808
12 stands

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,368
Whatever day it is today

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,696
Beautiful holding

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,048
Right now little bit of a holding pattern of peppers are coming in well

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,864
But Notre fruit and yet there's a

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,632
You know we got the

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
Serrano's

14
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,800
They've come

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
You can see them there by their over a foot tall

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Fruiting

17
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,040
We'll see what happens there

18
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,440
I don't know I think probably by now this is my first rodeo with having a bunch

19
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,232
The plants I'm not entirely sure

20
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,536
Ground pepper

21
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
Trinidad scorpion

22
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
Chocolate bhutlah

23
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,544
I thought that I messed everything up

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,616
But so they're coming in nice they're still there still probably in the

25
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
45

26
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,992
6 in height range

27
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,576
Maybe just don't

28
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,624
Rub your eyes

29
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Right right right

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,464
That's the same thing with like jalapeno

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,048
Gnu rubberized

32
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,096
It's going to hurt but I mean

33
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,656
It's a scale of how much is

34
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,984
Glove to plant

35
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,312
Yes.

36
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:54,688
I didn't mess up

37
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
Finley planting stages

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
I think I was the Scorpio

39
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Really

40
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,368
I didn't want from touching

41
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,952
It was from touching the package the seat came in

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,584
Someone had handled the thieves as in Trussville

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,888
So good

44
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,544
All red I touch this and it hurts so bad I need to find a way

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,896
I got this scorpion this scorpion hot sauce like 4 days ago

46
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,480
You can see Jordan holy quarters gone

47
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
Yeah it's great

48
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
Like putting hot.

49
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
I like

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
Oh God there's a lot of

51
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
Certainly a sort of

52
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,424
I don't know anything about

53
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,312
The year of the

54
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,432
2013 investigation of how

55
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Uncovered

56
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
Fallout

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,880
Everything else around that they were going over

58
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
1st and 22nd

59
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
I'll tell you what

60
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
February 22nd

61
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,768
Is a bit of

62
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,192
It's going to take guns away from

63
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Veteran

64
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,032
Pretty much the entire show

65
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
It is

66
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
Not worth it

67
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
I just tons

68
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Tons of stuff

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,456
Things we've already gone over it so just be

70
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,064
Rote repetition of this isn't true

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
This is nonsense

72
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
We said that before we have

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,720
But first there's a bit more meat on their bones

74
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,768
And so we shall go over it but first

75
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,120
I'm taking moment to say thank you to people who supported the show

76
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
We really appreciate it

77
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,728
So first of all

78
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
You are now policy walk

79
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm a policy wonk drama

80
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,968
Tyler

81
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,784
Next

82
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
Boxcar Willie Nelson

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
Journal policy walk

84
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm a policy wonk

85
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
Thank you so much you are now about to walk

86
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,191
I'm a policy wonk I'm almost certain I mispronounce that and I apologize

87
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
It also makes me think of the great Blood Sweat

88
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Beer song Luke

89
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,479
That's probably much closer pronunciation

90
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,551
But I will say that Lucretia Mac evil is a great song

91
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,903
Boo-boo boo-boo boo-boo boo-boo

92
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
Dog portraits

93
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:54,655
Donated an elevated level we appreciate it very much

94
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
You are now a technocrat

95
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
I'm a policy wonk

96
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,223
Heroin

97
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
Is freakishly large

98
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,743
Capital of Saskatchewan

99
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Drive from like weed

100
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Right

101
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:33,823
Do you do that

102
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,407
Sports sure we would appreciate it please do

103
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
I started listening

104
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:44,063
To this episode

105
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
Me to no end

106
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,623
Now

107
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Very exciting it is hot out

108
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:55,327
Yes it was finally hit summer in Chicago and it is ice cream weather

109
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
That is not what he

110
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,983
Looking back at digging into past episodes of Alex

111
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
What's the show

112
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Exactly what you wanted

113
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
He doesn't follow through

114
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,663
But it's the sort of thing you really get excited to hear

115
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,399
That's really sad

116
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,007
That is so exciting

117
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
Because he is

118
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,895
In this late February stretch of time like he is kind of in a holding pattern

119
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
He's

120
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,735
Kind of got about all he can out of the Piers Morgan

121
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
He's got this double

122
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,831
W e Meredith

123
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
Swagger going but it doesn't

124
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,439
You can almost get a sense that he doesn't even feel like this is

125
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,767
Like really going to do that much for him

126
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
From listening to this episode

127
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
I could get a sense

128
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,679
But he realizes they're more interested in Glen back also

129
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
I think that he does feel like

130
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
I got to do something

131
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
We're going to write I got to mix it up

132
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,383
Yeah yeah I like that I like that

133
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,783
He's been the same boring unrequited love

134
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
Can I get there to go back to his old

135
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,951
Really rekindle the flame there like maybe try a little bondage

136
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
Little light Blythe

137
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
A baby I think

138
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,495
Wacky sidekick would do it okay well there's a lot of options

139
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
Read

140
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
I don't think it would help

141
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,711
Sound effect board

142
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:54,111
Kazoo noises

143
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
That would be great because we was Layla drop

144
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Air horn

145
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
I would love it

146
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
Doesn't really follow

147
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,471
At least not in the 21st and 22nd that I've Listen to I see no evidence

148
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
I'm shaking anything up

149
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
It is

150
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Very similar

151
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Broadcast

152
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
An extension of him

153
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
What kind of in a rut

154
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
A good amount of self-awareness

155
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Usually pretty abs

156
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,743
But he makes a couple of really valid complaints about himself

157
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
In this next clip

158
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
Frustration

159
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
100

160
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
To try to transmit to you

161
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,551
In the first hour is generally the best hour

162
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,287
And so I must

163
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
Absolutely

164
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,991
Swear I'm in control

165
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
I don't believe him about reading 100 articles in preparation for the show or anything like that

166
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
Those criticisms of himself are quite valid the first hour

167
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,967
Saying nothing in Treading Water by the third hour

168
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,367
I never go to Carl's when I say I'm going to go to college

169
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:08,767
I say I'm going to cover something later and then I just start rambling about it never really cover it

170
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,119
Is a Hallmark of your show

171
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Feature not a bug

172
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,495
That's how you get away with not covering things

173
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
This is a very weird to

174
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:26,175
This is where I brought him in for a performance review

175
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,271
HR backgrounds

176
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,367
Maybe that's why his

177
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,719
You told Allie take more calls

178
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
You don't know what it is

179
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,655
The moment of introspection here that I may find very uncharacteristic of him

180
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
Scaled-down

181
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Sometimes

182
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,615
But this this level of opening the show

183
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
We need to mix it up I'm

184
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
Ready not good after an hour

185
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
A lot of the time

186
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551
So I overcompensate by having gas

187
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,231
I never cover news and I don't take calls

188
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,303
We are in a 13 Going on 30

189
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,167
He and Rex swap telling the truth through Alex's

190
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
And then

191
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
For some reason they probably stepped on the

192
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,311
The same Lucky Penny but

193
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,151
Okay

194
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,967
Is b******* it's possible

195
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
Siri

196
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
I have other theories

197
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
Better much less Pacific

198
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:45,279
He's not feeling great realize it's a bad job he's doing that

199
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,351
Seems more like a psychology

200
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Restart

201
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
He says a couple of really

202
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,847
F****** weird things on this episode of

203
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,943
When he's being more critical and more self-aware

204
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
These sorts of ideas come to

205
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
To the surface

206
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,343
Now we've already heard him say that you got to give it up to the

207
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
The Somali pirate

208
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
Which was groundbreaking

209
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,767
Somali pirates

210
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
There's another group

211
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,039
You've got to hand it to the globalist

212
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
That's weird

213
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,999
He's not done he has more thoughts to expound on here but

214
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,583
It's always

215
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,023
Last breath

216
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,655
Was important experience at death

217
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Life is very fragile

218
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
To quote Shakespeare

219
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
Said this before I'll say it again

220
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
It would

221
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
And the stupid

222
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
But you are targeting

223
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,191
Beautiful

224
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
That is just beyond

225
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Beyond

226
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Okay

227
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,455
But you got to give it up

228
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,575
It does a pretty good job to how epic it is

229
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
I mean it's hard to

230
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,183
Taken outside of any

231
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Contacts

232
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
I don't know how terrible that is

233
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
Because you know you

234
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,607
He's expressing like okay so a parasitic

235
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
System

236
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
That kills its host

237
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:35,007
It would think that it was

238
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Purses from the house

239
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
To survive

240
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
But in doing so it leads to its own

241
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
Describe colonialism

242
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,111
I don't know how far off he is

243
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
In terms of just

244
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Sayings

245
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
But you can

246
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Take that outside the context

247
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Text

248
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:01,119
When so much of his fear in so much of his rhetoric is about there being like

249
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
A plant

250
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
To destroy White

251
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,703
Or a plant

252
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
To get rid of the middle class

253
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
What you very clearly

254
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Expresses

255
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
Mostly White

256
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
They're all this is an attack on

257
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
The gun Community the Patriots

258
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
You can't hear him say stuff like

259
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,831
You are attacking the beautiful and the intelligent

260
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
Without thinking

261
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
You're speaking in code a little bit year

262
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,791
If you were just dealing with the people I don't like

263
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
You are dealing with the people who are similar to me

264
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,935
And a Target exam with your eugenics

265
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
Nougat

266
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
I do feel like that

267
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Part of what

268
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Expressing their

269
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,871
Taken in the context of his work

270
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Noah

271
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Because he is being

272
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Perspective

273
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Self reflect

274
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
At the same time

275
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Globalist

276
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
AR apps

277
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Absolutely

278
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Yeah

279
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
Screws is my head because it's like

280
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
Do you really believe all this b*******

281
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:17,919
You can't you can't ever took your hand

282
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
Has gone if you

283
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,015
Indicate that like you have any doubt of your worlds

284
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
He doesn't have

285
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,415
Well I think

286
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
I don't know I don't know I'm not as troubled by but I see what you're saying

287
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
I think there's a

288
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
Self-critical in

289
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Introspective Alex

290
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Is also

291
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
Expressed

292
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
By virtue of his interaction

293
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
With collar

294
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
This guy calls in

295
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
Want to talk chemtrails

296
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
Prove

297
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,063
All the arguments Back Down trailer

298
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
This guy is

299
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Is pretty amazed

300
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Buck

301
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:04,255
I wanted to mention to your the modified atmosphere several months ago I

302
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,399
I want to encourage others to do it if they've already done it great and they Elders should

303
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,799
Need to do this is we'll get ahold of a microscope get some rain samples look at your rain

304
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:21,407
Under a microscope on you

305
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,271
Mind-boggling I have water samples

306
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:32,927
In my refrigerator and it's amazing what happens over

307
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
Long-term video

308
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:41,375
Glass containers I have the water in when I first collected it

309
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,823
And now over the course of several months

310
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,431
Today's disgusting fibers and God knows what the 10 there has all

311
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
And

312
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,159
Unscientific

313
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,287
Surprising thrown off

314
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:27,455
Any other day he might have jumped on that.

315
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Pivot into

316
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:33,343
Something you didn't want to come

317
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,743
It's really interesting also like whenever you you wouldn't have poo poo.

318
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,583
Said I'm not poop

319
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,447
Yeah you looked at stuff and hold that that's a great way to look at stuff

320
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
To start

321
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
You know but

322
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Don't fret

323
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Leave me alone

324
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
It's it's great

325
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,591
That you want

326
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
To go down this Avenue

327
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,271
You haven't proven anything

328
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,575
You are spending your time

329
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Go to spend

330
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Yeah like

331
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Seeing those

332
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,023
Moments are always kind of shocking

333
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,583
You could respond to everyone like that

334
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,167
There's no there's no collar that has something that

335
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:25,567
So we couldn't use that response

336
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,783
You are capable capable of critical thinking or at least word in 2013

337
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
To an extent that like

338
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,439
Incredulousness all of the like

339
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
Easily fool the bowl

340
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
Elements

341
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
It's dammit

342
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,399
Really operate like an adult

343
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,239
It's worse

344
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,567
It says

345
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,919
And that's very unscientific is one that he recorded a long time ago

346
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,223
This is just a little

347
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
May I could babe

348
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,575
Vacations weird

349
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,879
Misses the come-up but

350
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,951
In the same way you have that got to give it to

351
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
The globalist

352
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Cancer

353
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
They're also

354
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
More indication

355
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
Of like

356
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
Him expressing

357
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
Weird ideas

358
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
Turtle weird ideas

359
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
Kind of always

360
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
You'll like he believes

361
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
But

362
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,847
Doesn't really overtly say

363
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
Next one is about how Evans

364
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,175
I'm going to be replaced by robots

365
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,735
And I think underneath it is something

366
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
That maybe we

367
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
Haven't done a good job of

368
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
But I think as a firm belief

369
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
You working in the military

370
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,655
Problem

371
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:04,127
The algorithms are all out of control

372
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,976
That's insane

373
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,792
Call her

374
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,656
The thing that I think is interesting with underneath

375
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,728
The globalist

376
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
At least

377
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
To believe

378
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
In Alex's

379
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
Misconception

380
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
That the only value of human life

381
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
Is based on work

382
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
Alex believes that

383
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,528
I think he agrees with that

384
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,088
Do you know did is that okay robot

385
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
Take over all the job

386
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Wow

387
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
Kill Them All

388
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Alex believe

389
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
The date his enemies believe

390
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
That but at the same time

391
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
He doesn't

392
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Seem to offer any

393
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Kind of

394
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Real world

395
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
Solution to this

396
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,824
Or any kind of real

397
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:11,712
Humans have value outside of work really disagree with that

398
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
And keep people working

399
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
Yeah

400
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
Thieving of our imagining

401
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,648
A society where your value isn't based off your work

402
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,952
Figure able to put in at a factory

403
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
Or or whatever

404
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,096
Conception because you projecting

405
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
He's

406
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
On the same Spectrum

407
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Which

408
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,288
The only value of a

409
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Is taking his red B

410
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,176
Solution is to get robots Kill Everybody

411
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:47,040
Keep people working so they still have it

412
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,136
I think the fact that you know if

413
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
His enemies

414
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Are sucks

415
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
That

416
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,072
You know we're going to replace humans with robots and it because they're not working they're Expendable and

417
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,192
If he believes

418
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Contingent

419
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Upon him

420
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,776
Create such a Groundswell

421
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
Popular

422
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Support

423
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
Excitement

424
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,176
Around the idea

425
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
There is there is an entire

426
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,040
Beautiful world we could create if we were

427
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
To job

428
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
The tides

429
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,184
I think that being the end-all-be-all of Arts

430
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Right leg the amazing

431
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Community thing

432
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
We could do the amazing

433
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Cleaning up of

434
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
Nature we could do

435
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
There's so much

436
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
That sounds like something we should get a robot

437
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,472
Yeah probably

438
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,032
People exploring Hobbies

439
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
Creative Renaissance

440
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,384
You could go through allowed to follow their path

441
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
And had the freedom

442
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
To be able to do it

443
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
That

444
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,600
From him and put it in terms of like that be in the solution to

445
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
The problem

446
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,440
Don't shut down coal plants

447
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
And keep I keep

448
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
People working

449
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
Car factories in America

450
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,072
Isn't

451
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
Great solution

452
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,472
To his perceived problem and it leads me to believe that he believes the same thing

453
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,056
And are only valuable as

454
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Right

455
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
I mean

456
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,688
I suppose the things

457
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Would add to that

458
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
Is there is something

459
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Beer with n

460
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Outcome

461
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
Like

462
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,440
I do absolutely think that major corporation

463
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
They're doing everything

464
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
Possible at all times to Autumn

465
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
As much of the neighbors

466
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,608
Absolutely

467
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,680
Unreasonable to think they really care what happens

468
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Two people app

469
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,544
What is a rationale

470
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
The irrational fear is the part where they're all going

471
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
To kill us

472
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
You know

473
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:53,248
Like so that's another part of his worldview that

474
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
Is

475
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Just assumed

476
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,112
If they are doing one

477
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Sing

478
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,232
I'm not going to think about what my

479
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,536
Next I'm only going to take that it

480
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
Right right

481
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:12,704
If any part of the status quo changes even the slightest bit

482
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
Bright

483
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Apocalypse

484
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,824
So if Alex talks about his love

485
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
Of the John Birch Society

486
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:24,992
Is that mean we already know that he loves it on a site doesn't talk about it all that often

487
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
But find it important to point out

488
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
When he does

489
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,816
Talks about like people taking the John Birch Society was crazy

490
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
It's cuz they were

491
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Just like

492
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,008
Some kind of

493
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Skype type of people

494
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,104
Really really really sucked up

495
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
If you look at the materials that they distributed

496
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
Especially in the early times

497
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
It gives you a

498
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
A good example of

499
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
What up with

500
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
They were really about

501
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,904
One of the first books

502
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,928
Put out

503
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
WhatsApp to Alder

504
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
This book called The Jon Frankel

505
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
1 letters

506
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
Insane

507
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
Violence

508
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,400
In in certify

509
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,216
Same conversation as the Turner Diaries

510
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Or

511
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
The

512
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,360
Desserts that sort of malicious

513
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
A violent revolt

514
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,480
Yeah against the government that is gotten to

515
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
Collectivist

516
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
Or whatever

517
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
Piece of their DNA

518
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
It was one of the first

519
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
Books that they ever put out

520
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
Distributed

521
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
And so what

522
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Talks about

523
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,584
Is dad being

524
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,864
To the John Birch Society

525
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
Being a part of the

526
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,752
His childhood

527
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
Was something that Alex

528
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
May have had access

529
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
He was a wee boy

530
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Which is f***** up

531
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
That book is

532
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Is a real serious

533
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
During heat

534
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
4

535
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
Football in all of this

536
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
Sublimate the mail.

537
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
Desire to

538
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
Because

539
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
Basically what he's

540
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,584
He's doing is living out

541
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
Murder fantasy

542
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Through the

543
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,984
He's he's that he's angry at those because

544
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Cuz he doesn't want

545
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Fight a war

546
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
He wants to get his murder

547
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Yeah

548
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
There is something

549
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
Into that probably

550
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,088
So I mean also the the John Franklin letters

551
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Just to give some

552
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
Sensitive

553
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,184
Like what it what it's all about

554
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
It was written

555
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,256
Probably is anonymously written

556
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
But it was most likely written by

557
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,584
Review Loki Oliver

558
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,144
Who was one of the founders founding members of

559
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
The John Birch Society

560
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:28,032
Get out of the group because he was too openly

561
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Systemic

562
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
Had too much of a bigot

563
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,384
And he would go on to

564
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,664
Join William Luther

565
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Pierce

566
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
I just warmed

567
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,320
William Luther Pierce was the guy who wrote the Turner Diaries

568
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,368
Which inspired

569
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
Timothy McVeigh

570
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,464
To do the Murrah building bombing

571
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
That's a good dude

572
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,816
That I was able to find

573
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
Pierce

574
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,192
Discusses like his inspiration for writing the Turner Diaries was reveal Oliver

575
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Copy of the John Frank

576
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Letters

577
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
Which helps him

578
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
Start a figure out how he wanted

579
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
To write his book and

580
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
DD

581
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
They're all just writing

582
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,456
Fanfiction of

583
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
About

584
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,576
It does feel that way

585
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Justin Bieber

586
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
Did

587
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,000
Anti-communist

588
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
Organization that

589
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
Just felt like

590
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
We don't like,

591
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,632
Is absurd

592
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
From the beginning

593
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,240
Was a deeply f***** up

594
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,520
Propaganda

595
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
Strategy

596
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:37,408
Yeah and also probably had more to do with suppressing worker

597
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Chris Wright's

598
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:41,760
Vatican its actual opposition to copy

599
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Strange

600
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
People get together

601
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,672
There's always a thing that they say they're doing but manager

602
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Sure helps that they

603
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Their businesses

604
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
So I don't

605
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,352
Towards the China issue

606
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
Allergy

607
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
Speaking in space

608
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,728
Pacific terms I can't really know exactly what classified

609
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,520
CIA

610
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,568
Approved at the CIA

611
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:10,944
Was that one of his self-criticism was allergic to providing

612
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,344
Pacific no real alternative

613
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
Ciac classified information

614
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,072
Years Around 1949 involves China and spoiler alert none of them

615
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,144
On July 22nd 1948

616
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,936
The CIA put out a report titled

617
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,472
Current situation in China

618
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,288
Is a report the situation is described as being

619
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Not very good

620
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,128
The support for nationalist Chiang Kai-shek

621
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,992
Quote is that because we aren't successful prosecution of the war under his leadership

622
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,808
And his apparent unwillingness and inability to occur

623
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Compass positive reform

624
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,368
Airport

625
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,392
Describes increase

626
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
Stability in the Nationalist side of

627
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,560
The Chinese Civil War which was unlikely to be something that we could result no matter what we did

628
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,656
The report is not pro-communist or promo in anyway

629
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:07,776
It says quote the prospect for the foreseeable future and Chyna is it fast and indefinite

630
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Inclusive prolongation

631
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
Civil War

632
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:15,456
With the authority of the national government area in the Central and South China

633
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,016
And isolated major cities in North and Northeast

634
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
Is China

635
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,112
The worst Prospect is complete collapse of the national government

636
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:26,464
And its replacement by a Chinese Communist control regime under Soviet influence

637
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
If not under Soviet

638
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,792
Control and uncooperative towards United

639
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,328
If not openly hostile

640
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,144
So strange that they would describe the Communist coming

641
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,216
Power is the worst case scenario in classified

642
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
If that's exactly what they were work

643
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,872
According to the reports assessment the US was in a really precarious

644
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Do you ask

645
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:51,808
Pastor Bill providing Aid to Shanghai shek but his government was increasingly ineffective and facing opposition

646
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,856
But also from within

647
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,696
Anti us sentiment has been growing not only from the communist

648
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
Do you ask

649
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
Was taking the side in a civil matter

650
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,840
In the hopes of turning China into a giant

651
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
Calling

652
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,264
Where the US to increase the aid offer to Shanghai shek would almost certainly have grown and along with it

653
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
Check resistance

654
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
At the same

655
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,872
Time to question the USSR loomed large

656
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
Increase

657
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,480
84 the Nationalist could very easily result in the USSR

658
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,296
Formally and materially supporting the Chinese communist

659
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
To get out of hand

660
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,624
Really really easy

661
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,720
Considering a lot of these variables the report points out that quote

662
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:37,120
Many Chinese view the USA program is prolonging the agony of rather than resolving the Civil War

663
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,472
That was a sentiment that we couldn't fight

664
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,592
Was doing a terrible job of running

665
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,920
Inspiring to side with the Positive vision of what comes after the war

666
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
The CIA assessment reports

667
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,296
This time rate full acknowledgement of the uphill battle that would be involved

668
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,856
He tried to somehow help him win the Civil War

669
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,672
And how even if the US was able to lead them to Victory

670
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,208
It would likely not be a good

671
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
Since his government was

672
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
Completely unstable in all likelihood

673
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,584
You wouldn't be able to effectively govern the country

674
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,656
If we were to get involved it would likely involve

675
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
Full military commitment

676
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,240
As well as a pretty high level of us forcing

677
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
Reforms on his nationalist government

678
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,104
Which would be

679
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:25,760
This sort of thing would obviously trigger a backlash from the Soviet Union whoever strategic interest in their neighbor not being us puppy

680
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,624
The issue of the US position in the rise of Communist party in China is it

681
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Complex 1

682
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,952
But I can find no evidence

683
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
Equipment

684
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,792
The best argument

685
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
The US didn't

686
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Determine that it was in their best interest

687
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,888
To enter a full-scale war

688
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
In order to support Chiang Kai-shek in

689
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
The Nationalist

690
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,520
If that's the ultimate Alex wants to make the by all means

691
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
You should make it

692
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,848
I suspect he doesn't present the situation honestly

693
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,872
Because if he did

694
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
You be advocating

695
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:58,784
For a foreign war specifically in the interest of nation-building and imprinted US foreign policy on another country

696
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
Witchy presumably is

697
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
Supposed to be a guest

698
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:07,744
The idea that the CIA installed now the power at this week's lusive domain of insane anti-communist propaganda

699
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
At the time strident

700
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,608
Tommy just wanted the US to get militarily involved

701
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,960
Because it would create a problem for stalling on it

702
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
Is eastern border

703
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,288
When the US didn't pursue that strategy

704
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,312
Because it's obvious

705
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
Horrible

706
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,616
It would have brought

707
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:27,712
The interpreted that as he was not wanting to apply that Eastern pressure on spelling

708
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,784
Which is then translated into being active support for the communist

709
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
USSR in

710
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
That's all that's going on here

711
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,648
Revisionist history

712
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
Oversimplify

713
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,232
Application in order to create a way in which

714
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
This support

715
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
Communist

716
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
And it's run by

717
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
The John Bolton's of their day

718
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
Going for

719
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,544
I want I want to kill these people

720
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
And I don't care

721
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,896
It's probably worse

722
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
John Bolton is bad at

723
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
She is like I don't think

724
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,552
Take over China well

725
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,856
Vicky would be able to be as effective 50

726
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,416
The years from now is the John Birch Society was

727
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
No but really sick

728
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,512
You know like yeah his influences

729
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Is Insidious and

730
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
It's awful and will probably cause

731
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,608
Untold pain

732
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,912
In a lot of people's lives

733
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,960
But I don't know if he'll start a school

734
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,288
A school of thought that says

735
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
The even when forced to go underground

736
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,408
Because of the the people who looked at it is like.

737
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,992
Stupid s***

738
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
Influential

739
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
Anyway John Birch Society sucks

740
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,392
You're the worst

741
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
9049

742
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Sir

743
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,608
So Alex discusses how there's going to be a civil war

744
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,704
It's interesting that like he's always saying

745
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:57,312
You know with the intensity and like pressure that he sang it 2019

746
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
Finally come to this

747
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:04,224
Think about 20-30

748
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
Your broken record

749
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,296
You say that all

750
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,880
When the Civil War happens during the

751
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
It's important to remember

752
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
It's a toad on what

753
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,864
Target

754
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,160
Super smart

755
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:21,536
It's going on now how long is a sheriff now

756
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
There's a reason

757
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,896
Earlier what are you talkin about

758
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:43,296
You're going after the good beautiful people there's a little bit of code

759
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,112
You're trying to Target the white right-wingers

760
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,416
Set the consideration

761
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
If it weren't like this

762
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
How he sees things

763
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,560
This is going to be the minorities in the Socialist

764
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,120
Hey buddy

765
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:01,216
Clearly you're saying

766
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,752
Your you're

767
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,800
They're manufacturing an enemy

768
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,336
Except your

769
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,896
Creating the structures within which they

770
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
Manufactured

771
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,736
Like because his enemy is Imagine

772
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,808
He is imagining what his enemy would think of him

773
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,624
Ryan actually just telling us what he's

774
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,464
Yeah yeah there's there's something to that

775
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,816
So there's going to be a Civil War and the right-wing side is going to be manufactured

776
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,144
Create this whole war and that it all of it is just a

777
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,424
To demonize his side

778
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,984
Is it really gravy

779
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,544
Was that mean

780
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
I mean

781
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Like

782
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
How are they going

783
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
How is

784
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,688
How's it going to do the whole thing

785
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
I wish I knew

786
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,112
Yeah I mean I guess probably cuz I had to guess who I don't think he really lazy

787
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,440
Without specifically it would be by like

788
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Tricking

789
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,792
Some people on Alex's died

790
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
The paradigm

791
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,144
And getting involved in the war so they will be duped into it

792
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,448
Or just like

793
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
I guess agent

794
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
Provocateur

795
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
Starting up militias

796
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,824
Ready

797
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,384
Thanks but all people who are in the clan or fed them

798
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,736
Say that would be how it works

799
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
And you have to then

800
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
Create an entire side of

801
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600
Loosely knit

802
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,904
Barely even Associated people

803
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
And put them under one Banner

804
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
You know call them all one thing and then like you said

805
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
The goal there is to

806
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
Take it you know

807
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,656
Shoot anybody with a John Deere hat

808
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,192
Picture you characterize

809
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,752
An entire side as

810
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,056
You only need to see one thing

811
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,872
Like I like if they had a milkshake

812
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,664
You know that it would be worth shooting

813
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,784
Manufacturer

814
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,832
I mean 8 p.m.

815
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,488
Because it is interesting

816
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
Sing houses

817
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
His mind works

818
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:05,632
And another one of these like moments

819
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
Introspection but I think

820
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
Go awry

821
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:12,800
And Zack

822
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,080
I've ever heard on Alex's

823
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
The show

824
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,672
Now that's not true in distress

825
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:35,072
I do think that if you understood how his brain work it would be

826
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,144
Easy to defeat these goblins because they're imaginary

827
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
His brain works and how he over

828
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
Simplifies things

829
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
How he doesn't

830
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
Look for

831
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,360
And any

832
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:51,200
He doesn't look for the reality

833
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,016
Or whatever you know if you understood

834
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:58,368
This imagined enemy because you like yeah that's just your brain

835
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,160
Right this is your brain man

836
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,976
Yeah that's a big heaping piles confirmation

837
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,608
If you understood how my brain works

838
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
We could

839
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,680
And this

840
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:18,080
If all of your audience understood are you could all be done with this a long time ago

841
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,664
Congratulations.

842
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,712
Spoken true facts about life

843
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,600
If you understood the code

844
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,928
I understand much like Leo zagami having a code

845
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:39,072
If you understood that code

846
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
The globalist

847
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:53,919
And bring in

848
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
But we just know

849
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,839
Or argue with them

850
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,631
Do you understand

851
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,423
Thinking could go very poorly

852
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,007
You have a guy who's the Arbiter of

853
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,567
A completely on explainable

854
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,127
Plan these evil globalist are doing

855
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,943
If you don't debate these sorts of things

856
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:33,343
Filter automatically against whatever therefore understand

857
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,623
If only you understood

858
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,671
Easy only you could

859
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,463
See all that I see

860
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,023
The globalist believe X

861
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
Sex

862
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:49,727
It might just be a really good way to get people to believe something foolishly and unquestioningly

863
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
Yeah it doesn't

864
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Question

865
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:01,247
Intellectual Arguments for all the things that I believe but just be Oppositional defiant

866
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Just beat the Lakers

867
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:08,927
Reactionary opposed to anything I tell you our enemies are for

868
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
That's f****** stupid

869
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
It is

870
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,279
It is a recipe for

871
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,303
Self-destruction

872
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
More than anything else

873
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,143
Yeah

874
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
Like okay fine

875
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:24,287
So you get rid of all the people who disagree with you all of the globalist

876
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,615
And now all you're left with there's a right-wing Patriots

877
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
That you love to hang out

878
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,711
John Deere is doing big business

879
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
Hold on

880
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,783
You're only

881
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,855
Distance is against what somebody else does

882
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:41,183
So in your little group

883
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,975
We should do this will guess who that guy is

884
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,511
He's a f****** globalist

885
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,351
Neo global

886
00:43:55,007 --> 00:44:01,151
Smaller group

887
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:06,015
I imagine probably does happen in the last

888
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,295
Nearly as much at 10

889
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,367
As I do Alex and

890
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,135
A stupid world

891
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,975
But the way they all turn on each other

892
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Shapiro

893
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,631
Kessler the guy who organized the Charlottesville unite the right rally on

894
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:25,471
I've tried to accuse him of being a fat

895
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,775
Did this that sort of behavior

896
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,847
So well in a world of paranoia

897
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,735
Everyone is the target of that paranoia

898
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
Anime

899
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,039
Why shows up

900
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
It's

901
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
It is inevitable for his

902
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,207
Globalist

903
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Like

904
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:50,047
He talks about whenever they end up

905
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,095
Killing off most of the population

906
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
You think they are going to turn on each other

907
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,959
Like he understand

908
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,007
It doesn't feel like it applies to

909
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
To his group

910
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,591
At all

911
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
Introspective

912
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
Episodes

913
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
Because it feels like

914
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,223
Trying to figure out his

915
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
Trying to figure out himself

916
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,367
But publicly telling you he's trying to figure out him

917
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:18,463
I'm self probably probably

918
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,999
Thanks for going therapy is weak

919
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,119
In the next Wipeout talks about

920
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,679
Things that Obama is doing

921
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,239
Though is identical to something you celebrate

922
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
Did Trump doing

923
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,567
Idiot

924
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,319
Statistics instead

925
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,487
Alex was very excited about the idea of trump

926
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
Is soliciting

927
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,071
Stories of Violence by immigrants

928
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,447
Not too long ago Alex is very excited about that

929
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,263
Thought it was very important stories need to be

930
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,311
Hypocrisy is pointless

931
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,847
It is

932
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,871
So explicit

933
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
So

934
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
Want

935
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,039
Little measure

936
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
Remove so you have

937
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,087
To think for a sec

938
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,623
And then you're like

939
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,927
The critical you don't want it to just be us

940
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
Ifucking mirror

941
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,791
It's Ross

942
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
A little bit

943
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
Is probably one of the

944
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
The most overt

945
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Problems

946
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,727
That I have with

947
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,311
Undercutting

948
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,335
Pretty much

949
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,943
I know I know that I've said that before in the past

950
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
Like whenever there's

951
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
Really.

952
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
Deeply

953
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
In conflict with

954
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,367
His primary brand

955
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,159
Nobody tries to prison

956
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
But

957
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
Something he says and

958
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,487
In this clip makes me

959
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
Think like

960
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
Boo

961
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,375
I don't believe that someone like Alex

962
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,423
To present himself.

963
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,959
With the police

964
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
He has

965
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,519
Should ever be

966
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:45,919
Indicating that he believes that some people deserve to be slightly slaves

967
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,015
Arbiter of

968
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,599
It's not even that he personally will not be

969
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:02,047
I don't I don't cut into that I don't I don't believe that for a second

970
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
And I don't believe

971
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,143
I don't believe it just

972
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,727
Because you don't agree with whatever I believe

973
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,567
You deserve to be the victim of the consequences

974
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:20,735
Universal Health Care

975
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
Easter

976
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,319
Repast

977
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,879
Just because they were against it doesn't mean

978
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
They shouldn't

979
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,439
Have the positive

980
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
Benefit

981
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,279
I don't think that it is right

982
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,047
Did anyway

983
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
For Alex

984
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
To take like

985
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,863
Alright

986
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,887
You're not on my team

987
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,167
You deserve to be enslaved

988
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:42,239
I will I will be fine with you being a

989
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,287
You're about human Liberty

990
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,567
Your whole thing is liver

991
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,127
You should be opposed to it in every con

992
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
That's how it work

993
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:59,135
If you don't choose to join Alex and be free then you lose your freedom

994
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,415
And that makes

995
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Send

996
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
Or at least

997
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,999
We're fine with it

998
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,535
That is not okay

999
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,583
Absolutely not okay

1000
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
Indicate

1001
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,215
Interested

1002
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,495
Less than interest

1003
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,311
And truly think people being free

1004
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
And more

1005
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
Pinterest

1006
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,431
Yeah that's really all I can

1007
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
Test of

1008
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,903
Partisan leaving early

1009
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:33,951
Plans or anyting

1010
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,535
Will only benefit the people who

1011
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,815
Agree with me or what

1012
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
This benefit

1013
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,631
And it seems like

1014
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
The only thing Alex's intro

1015
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,215
Sit-in is benefiting

1016
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,847
. giving a s*** about the

1017
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
People who died

1018
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Right

1019
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:59,039
You're a little bit of work being

1020
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,343
The only thing that

1021
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,999
Do these things

1022
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,559
Right there is a sense of

1023
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,375
Using the globalists to express that

1024
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
Possession

1025
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,935
But there is still a willingness

1026
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,471
Engage with that idea

1027
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,751
Define

1028
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,519
Value

1029
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
What is weird

1030
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,359
It's all sounds a little bit

1031
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
Tumi

1032
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,431
Like when I get really

1033
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
Secure end

1034
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,527
Man I don't know how to wipe my TV

1035
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
I'm not any good at

1036
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
Terrible

1037
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
It's just like

1038
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,719
Directed towards me and he seems

1039
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,255
To direct it toward the global

1040
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
Making him

1041
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,935
You know us back to that don't make me feel bad

1042
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
Going to do it

1043
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,615
Tea party that's the only hope

1044
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
For America

1045
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,063
Socialism

1046
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:22,495
America

1047
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:27,359
And others

1048
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,407
So I mean

1049
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
If you think Karl Rove

1050
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,455
What is a socialist

1051
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,271
Wells Fargo

1052
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,879
Make me a Karl Rove at the Socialist

1053
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,671
I mean it's just the way to

1054
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
It's just nonsense

1055
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
Making

1056
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,815
I'm sure that everyone falls under your negative headache

1057
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:51,167
I guess just probably anybody who believes in any kind of

1058
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,495
Social safety net of any sort is probably social

1059
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,543
According to Alex

1060
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,103
What is he talking about 40

1061
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,127
98 part 2

1062
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,967
I'm not sure

1063
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,503
Cuz

1064
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,039
Figure out if I do anything

1065
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,719
Number that was Columbus

1066
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,511
Some stuff in like South America

1067
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,559
1498

1068
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,351
Leonardo DaVinci

1069
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:25,215
He finished his painting of The Last Supper in 1498

1070
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:26,751
No

1071
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,799
Yammy like he's obsessed with a Renaissance

1072
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,895
Started

1073
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,247
The only thing

1074
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,271
Really huge

1075
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
From 1498

1076
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,623
History is left

1077
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,159
Vasco de Gama

1078
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,951
Arrived in India

1079
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
Circumnavigated

1080
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
South

1081
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,095
Forgot

1082
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,119
Creating

1083
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:59,007
The spice trade in 1498

1084
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,567
I don't understand how that's related to what he's talkin

1085
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,895
There must be something that happened

1086
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:09,247
I don't know cuz I feel like

1087
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,111
Earlier we heard Alex talk about Cher

1088
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,135
Clark being great

1089
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
And that's

1090
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:22,303
We see is an indication that Alex having him on was

1091
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:26,911
Very much a strategy in order to be able to report on having him on yet

1092
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,703
Because he's a sheriff

1093
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
Popular

1094
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,359
And so Alex being able to attach

1095
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,151
Because no one gives a f*** if you'd like

1096
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:43,807
Sheriff larger-than-life

1097
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:50,207
Monster

1098
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,279
Happy

1099
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,327
Fair enough

1100
00:53:55,583 --> 00:54:01,727
You still using coded words for for black sheriff

1101
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,871
Well spoken like dude you know what that means

1102
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,407
Right you guys not a lot

1103
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,479
He does that a lot of things that I just choose

1104
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,247
2

1105
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,599
Not point out because if it did it would ever

1106
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:23,487
Alex talks more about that the idea of covering

1107
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,279
His own coverage

1108
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
I'm Sheriff Clarke

1109
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,863
And I think at the end of this we really get

1110
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,911
Education

1111
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,215
It's not wise

1112
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,263
It's kind of ironic song

1113
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,543
Everything is someone who

1114
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,639
But I think it's on

1115
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
Eagles Cowboys game

1116
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,199
Because of exactly what he expresses

1117
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:34,399
Choose clock

1118
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,311
Love love

1119
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,895
The idea that someone covering him

1120
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,967
Right

1121
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,807
More importantly is that point that he makes about like

1122
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:57,951
You hate that were talking about this and you got at the conversation

1123
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:06,655
Doing something f***** up we're saying f***** up being and now we're hijacking your cycle

1124
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,215
The strategy that has been

1125
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:09,983
Really

1126
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,519
Really effective

1127
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,311
I think that is

1128
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,871
A large part of what makes

1129
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,663
It's the media 3 or so on

1130
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:23,039
Hannibal absolutely

1131
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
Descending

1132
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,135
To the mud with these people who are bad

1133
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,159
We're just trying

1134
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:31,487
Either create their own brand or unpopularity

1135
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,279
Rise there stars

1136
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,143
Sensational irresponsible horrible Flame

1137
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
The venue cover

1138
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,263
Literally what happened in 2000

1139
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
That got us

1140
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,823
To where we are right now

1141
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
The Bursar

1142
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,455
Nobody would even have question

1143
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,479
Nobody would

1144
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:56,063
Ever thought about that unless the mediator

1145
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,855
Is bulshit Bad actors

1146
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,183
President

1147
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:06,559
Seriously and then repeated their claims

1148
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,607
Nobody with nobody

1149
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,655
You were just being racist

1150
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,703
Yeah and that's how we

1151
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:16,031
Yeah I think there's something to that

1152
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:21,919
I said before about like me pointing this out as we are a Alex Jones podcast

1153
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,711
I think there's a large difference

1154
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,991
Between

1155
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,527
Especially when we started

1156
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,063
Didn't expect anybody would like

1157
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:32,159
There's a difference between

1158
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,439
Critical analysis

1159
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,487
Reporting

1160
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,535
Don't b*******

1161
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:42,143
There's a difference

1162
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
I mean

1163
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,703
Simply simply put

1164
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
The easiest

1165
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,751
Way too different

1166
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,287
Invicta

1167
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,823
Type of coverage is we don't have that

1168
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
50

1169
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
250 rule

1170
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:56,735
Well if we have somebody on our show was going to say that obviously the birthmark

1171
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
Conspiracy

1172
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:02,367
This is bulshit brighter we have to have somebody else

1173
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,743
To argue I

1174
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,047
Yeah that might be a part of it

1175
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,631
I'm not entirely sure but I do have a pretty firm

1176
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,191
Send that

1177
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,215
The queerness

1178
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,263
The strategy of

1179
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,591
Trying to make people cover his stuff

1180
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,615
Is

1181
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,407
Very effective and he's very into

1182
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,199
Yeah absolutely

1183
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,551
Kind of self-aware episode on The Chew

1184
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,855
I have a couple clips

1185
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,623
From the

1186
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,695
Just because I don't want to do it on our next episode

1187
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:42,559
Let's just get it out of the way

1188
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:45,887
A large portion of the episode he has been refused back

1189
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:52,287
Got on the show who's the pharmacist who works for youngevity

1190
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,615
I assume that

1191
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,895
Definitely pointed out that

1192
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:00,479
He works for you

1193
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,295
Aboveboard about the fact that like

1194
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,855
He works he's a spokesperson

1195
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:09,439
For their sponsor are still giving out like

1196
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,975
Pretty irresponsible advice

1197
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
In many

1198
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,071
Census

1199
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,631
Sample of the Ebola blood otherwise the supplement

1200
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,911
Going to work

1201
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,703
That irresponsible

1202
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,239
Still like get off your bed

1203
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:28,127
The only other thing that happens I think it's hilarious is the Alex

1204
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,175
Is Onnit big Narrative of

1205
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,967
The military

1206
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
For the government

1207
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,271
Is that a veteran

1208
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,551
A lot of

1209
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,319
Mail

1210
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,135
Like a bulk mailing to all the veterans

1211
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,183
That turn in their guns

1212
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,535
Alex takes calls from veteran

1213
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,607
And none of them ever receive this message

1214
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,887
Like it keeps

1215
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,447
But they're all they're all talking like they have

1216
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:56,031
Or like Alex does not

1217
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:00,127
The fact that not received a letter

1218
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:04,223
Problem because they're out

1219
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,015
Excuses like I haven't checked the mail

1220
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:10,111
Yeah yeah I don't know

1221
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:14,975
That's right I heard from one of my guys

1222
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,255
It's the

1223
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,071
It's a sad display of it

1224
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
Very good

1225
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,191
But this one clip where Alex

1226
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:24,959
Explain

1227
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,007
So even if you're in the f******

1228
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
CIA

1229
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
You don't know what Alec

1230
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
Nose

1231
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Is the CIA

1232
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,871
Compartmentalize

1233
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,271
Do you know what your world is doing but then there's other people compartmentalize.

1234
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,087
This person

1235
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:41,855
You know X

1236
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,391
This person over here

1237
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:49,023
This other person thano W you know the alphabet

1238
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,047
Compartmentalize

1239
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,071
And what he's doing

1240
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,375
Compartmentalizing all the information

1241
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,167
So if you know X

1242
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:59,007
Now you know why all right

1243
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:02,847
No option

1244
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
But

1245
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,639
You then explain

1246
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,175
Poconos the entire game

1247
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,159
417

1248
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:31,775
Power structure

1249
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:06,847
At least two of those books about the Vatican were written by Leo zagami cell

1250
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,871
Mission of like what books

1251
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
He might be reading

1252
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:16,063
Hazel eyes

1253
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:22,463
Getting on the Nazis from those book

1254
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,511
I would say is like my dad is

1255
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,559
And I grew up in

1256
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,631
Close proximity

1257
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,935
It's Scholars we will dedicate their lives

1258
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,471
Studying various topics

1259
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,495
Helping

1260
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,775
People about those topics

1261
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,335
I know is a Hallmark

1262
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,127
Of every good academic

1263
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:46,783
Is rattling off how many books about a certain subject that threat

1264
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,135
It's in Supernaut infuriating in conversation

1265
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,671
Instead of

1266
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,743
You know engagement with somebody's argument you say

1267
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,303
I've read more books about

1268
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:04,703
When you more than people who are in the CIA and it's too complicated for me

1269
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,031
Express to you now let me tell you how many books I've read

1270
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,079
Gray

1271
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,359
That clip is

1272
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:14,687
Is definite like regardless of whether he believes it or is

1273
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:17,247
Acting or not

1274
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,015
You need to

1275
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:18,783
PSI Chi

1276
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,831
It's disrespectful to like

1277
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:27,743
Knowing things very idea of knowledge

1278
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,815
I don't know

1279
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,095
That's what happened

1280
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,399
Imagine

1281
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
Somebody

1282
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
Who actually cares about subject

1283
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Being like

1284
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
Acting

1285
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:44,127
Now that's the first time we've heard Alex radloff how many goddamn hope he's right.

1286
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,919
It's it's sort of

1287
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,991
Tio2

1288
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,783
Something that's irrelevant

1289
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,135
Yes you could have read 10 books about a certain subject and know nothing about

1290
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,415
You could beg

1291
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,463
You could have read horrible books

1292
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,999
For your ability to

1293
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,303
Internalize information could be

1294
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
Below-average

1295
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,911
Thank you could have not synthesize the information from those books

1296
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,935
You may have

1297
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,215
Technically red

1298
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,007
You can come away with it with

1299
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,799
No expanded knowledge base

1300
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,359
What are you saying it's just

1301
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,383
Appeal to like

1302
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:21,503
If you don't know that this doesn't mean anything you like he's right about the book

1303
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:25,855
Don't understand

1304
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,879
But he doesn't know anything

1305
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,463
Frustrating

1306
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,999
The literal

1307
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,023
Interpretation

1308
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,863
That is

1309
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,399
One who speaks

1310
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,679
It's does not know

1311
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:44,031
Right exactly

1312
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:48,639
Sprouts has not internalized the information from

1313
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,687
If you if you are mistaken

1314
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,503
Quantity of books with quality of information

1315
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
Yeah

1316
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:01,439
One last is talking about the talking to the youngevity

1317
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
Pharmacist

1318
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,487
Fuchsia

1319
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
Right

1320
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,351
Some people might

1321
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,911
Accused us of being somehow body-shaping

1322
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
And I don't mean to be at all

1323
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,519
It's just I'm interested in the relative size of Alex's next

1324
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,287
Throughout his career

1325
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,335
Banana split

1326
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
The

1327
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,735
Next version of plant

1328
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:30,111
It's not that his fascination with

1329
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:36,511
Are not good or bad unappealing or appealing about a smaller or larger

1330
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,071
Her neck and I'm not trying to make Alex feel bad

1331
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
At all

1332
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,887
He talks about his neck a lot

1333
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,751
His neck was shrinking

1334
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,687
Cam

1335
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:08,511
Bread that has gluten

1336
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:16,703
Cut the Wheat Belly I've not heard it before

1337
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,775
It's not heard that formulation of

1338
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,079
Gluten intolerance but

1339
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,407
I don't I don't I don't know if this is still something

1340
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,687
I has

1341
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:32,319
I'm not sure the first time I've ever heard

1342
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,855
It's it's

1343
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:38,975
Also relevant in terms of like not and not just making fun of his his neck or anything

1344
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,279
Because it's within the context of

1345
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,095
Almost a testimonial for his supplement yeah

1346
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:47,423
Like I've been I've been taking the I haven't taken them all but it would take

1347
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,983
Back on the the Infowars life

1348
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,263
Products

1349
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,567
All my arms shrinking

1350
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,847
Me getting smaller

1351
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,407
That's no he's indicated that he's losing weight

1352
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,759
So sometime in between 2013

1353
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
The present

1354
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,575
Perhaps when he stops taking

1355
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,855
Youngevity products

1356
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,671
His neck I got freakishly large

1357
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
As he has

1358
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,743
His aunt description

1359
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
Freakishly large

1360
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
I think

1361
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,095
It's almost a refresh

1362
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,143
Testimonial like I would prefer that

1363
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,167
To any

1364
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,703
Actually

1365
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,591
You'll be able to

1366
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
He's more religiously

1367
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:32,479
Look I'm lazy like you I'm trying

1368
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:38,879
Maybe you should buy it why are you making me feel bad

1369
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:42,207
It's grounded more than a lot of other one

1370
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,047
If you was trying to

1371
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,351
Completely craft

1372
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,911
You wouldn't bring up his

1373
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,727
Belly

1374
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,055
Although I don't know if it would be wise of him

1375
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:57,823
To say

1376
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,591
That

1377
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,383
Their products could

1378
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,407
Gluten

1379
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:09,087
A Dodge I don't know

1380
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:15,487
You would expect you be going over the top though

1381
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:24,959
Even though he's telling you I honestly I don't actually think that is just his way around like

1382
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:29,311
Arguments it's like well why are you unhealthy

1383
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:34,175
If you take all of your help supplement is never on Olive

1384
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,991
That is something I've always heard

1385
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
Even when doctor

1386
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,039
Group comes along

1387
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,319
Is likely

1388
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,647
Aisle and I mean to take how I just got to forget sometime

1389
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,671
And that way

1390
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,231
Can't be living proof that it doesn't work

1391
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,327
Consider that that is a

1392
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,655
Mercer

1393
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,983
Compared to the present day

1394
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,311
You see a bit less of like a really over-the-top sales

1395
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:05,151
I think probably part of that might be him not getting

1396
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,943
A huge cut

1397
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,503
You might not have as big an interest

1398
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,295
Are not moving the product

1399
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,319
Then

1400
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,087
Then he doesn't

1401
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,623
Omnipresent

1402
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,183
I'm here and I think

1403
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,487
This is a bit of a

1404
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,791
Alex is right when he started the first

1405
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,095
Episode on the 21st

1406
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:27,423
He is in a bit of a right there is a little bit of

1407
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
Stillness

1408
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,983
To his show in 2013

1409
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,335
Still not really talking

1410
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,615
About Sandy Hook

1411
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,639
You're at this point

1412
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,943
And I wonder if those two things

1413
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,991
Are going to join together

1414
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,039
The Dish Network

1415
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,087
Is it possible that maybe

1416
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,903
Being really f****** irresponsible in his reporting

1417
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:51,231
About dumbass conspiracy theories that he's already

1418
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:52,767
Throne

1419
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,791
And put dip

1420
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,071
Tutto into a little bit

1421
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,631
Is that going to be

1422
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
Who knows

1423
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,983
Feels real bad about

1424
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,007
Shut

1425
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,175
You know what maybe I should be less

1426
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,991
I'm going to

1427
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,063
I don't know I don't know

1428
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,855
Interested

1429
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,671
If only because

1430
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,695
Like to take a

1431
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
Zup

1432
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,583
It makes me think that maybe

1433
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,351
At least

1434
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,631
Something

1435
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,679
Excited

1436
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:37,055
Very excited to see what happens and especially because I'm not super-excited about

1437
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:37,823
Present day

1438
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,871
I don't really care about Alex

1439
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,895
Feelings about that

1440
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,919
Trump

1441
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,687
Media Summit

1442
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,479
I don't particularly care

1443
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,527
How about China that so

1444
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,111
Cooking up a little bit here in the past

1445
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,415
A much-needed

1446
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,207
Yeah I prefer that

1447
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,863
We do have website its knowledge fight.

1448
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:01,887
You bet it is

1449
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:08,543
Ross on Twitter

1450
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:11,359
Do you know where you could download Artio if you would like

1451
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
Go to I-20

1452
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:18,783
You could go to local co-op

1453
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,087
How many people get together

1454
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:21,855
Skateboard shop

1455
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,671
You get an episode of our podcast

1456
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:25,951
Skateboard

1457
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,255
But not if you just get trucks

1458
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:33,887
Episode of ours if you're only getting trucks

1459
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:40,287
No

1460
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,335
I have no evidence

1461
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:45,663
That the caller who put rainwater in his fridge killed anybody

1462
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:49,503
I don't know but I do I have no evidence

1463
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:54,879
You put a drop of water in the fridge it's only a couple years before you got it

1464
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,927
You know what your

1465
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,463
I can't prove you wrong

1466
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,511
Reroute no evidence that

1467
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,327
Probably have killed somebody

1468
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,095
Who's Alex Jones

1469
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:12,799
Alexandra Thurston color
