1
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect but knowledge by knowledge

2
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

3
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,536
Technology Beverages and a little bit about Alex

4
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,888
Indeed we are.

5
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,216
I've never asked you this and I am very

6
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Have you

7
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
Everwatch

8
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Foreign

9
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
Yeah

10
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
What is

11
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,408
Oh that's a second question

12
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,224
I would never

13
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,784
I've seen a ton of foreign language

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Yeah

15
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
I'm probably probably is for sure

16
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
That's where

17
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:48,288
Just like when's the last one because I know you're not a big movie

18
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
Just wondering in an adult

19
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:56,992
I don't know a place called ragtag that was like the sort of indie film house

20
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:01,088
In town there was a smaller Run movies would go right

21
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
Films

22
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Does Dallas

23
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,744
After-hours ragtag

24
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,864
They would run a lot of movies and end up seeing

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
It really tough for me to bring any

26
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,008
T22 mindray

27
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
A ton of them

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
Right okay that my

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
I was figuring if you worked at a small-town movie theater it's not like they're playing ball they've cartoon Tiger Hidden Dragon

30
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
For sure that's cool I'll believe

31
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
Play at the theater I worked

32
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
But it was

33
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
Gigante

34
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
Check when I was of just the Right Aid

35
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,816
I don't remember how old I was when it came out but

36
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
I was maybe emotionally 16 I remember

37
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,288
Without repentance

38
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
Yeah so I don't know if that movie Allah

39
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
Along with the United started French

40
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
Mission high school and so I have felt like a pretty

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,904
Particular kinship with limahl francophone

42
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
Yeah that's the one that's

43
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
6 up

44
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,120
I don't have a better answer

45
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
Okay

46
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448
Fellini

47
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
Alright okay you big Birdman

48
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,040
Or A Series of Unfortunate Events or whatever live long

49
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
My mom loved that movie

50
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Love the books

51
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,488
I don't know whatever anyway you guys broadcast write a lot about foreign language movies

52
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
Though not specific

53
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,376
And I know a lot about Alex the first time I know more about

54
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,008
Today we are not coming at the folks with a

55
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,336
Half surprised Friday episode for them because

56
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,920
You know I feel a commitment to put out two episodes a week

57
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,224
And I don't feel like our Wednesday episode was

58
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
A full

59
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,624
It was over an hour long

60
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,744
Episode we must right that wrong we got it on Friday

61
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
So

62
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,423
The problem was that in the present-day Alex's been out of Studio

63
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
And I don't know why

64
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,263
What will learn on this episode

65
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,663
I didn't know why and you look it is all this big stuff is happening in the world like Trump is like voted for the

66
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Little India

67
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
Iowa caucus

68
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Where is

69
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
Alex

70
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,671
I just hosting in 280

71
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
It's an absurd

72
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
Nightmare

73
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Answer finally on Thursday

74
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
February 6th

75
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
Alex comes back

76
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
Actor Studio

77
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
You know I mean

78
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,191
I hate to call it a breath of fresh air because it still sucks

79
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,751
Compare Lisa's not Coronavirus

80
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Woohoo

81
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
Okay

82
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
There is

83
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Of course they're going to

84
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
Play some Coronavirus

85
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
We'll do a little bit of that

86
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
On a certain level I apologized

87
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
The audience about like you know

88
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Betty

89
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
Keeps coming up but

90
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
I do feel like we're in the middle

91
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
Of Alex doing

92
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
A large-scale

93
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
Like a conspiracy

94
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,839
Pageant surrounding the coronavirus narratives and all of that

95
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,447
Tracking it in real time I think there is a utility to it even if it does

96
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
At some points feel a little bit like

97
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
This again

98
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,615
Trust me whatever is being on the podcast or show

99
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Is 110

100
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
The whole thing

101
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
It's like a it's like a cross dog show

102
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,719
I think it's disgusting and I don't like it but you know you got to keep an eye on it just to see what's going on

103
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
Fair enough

104
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
So we're going

105
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
Recovering February 6th

106
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095

Knickers

141
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:02,303
Thank you. I see that name I imagine it's a reference to something

142
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,863
Stop thinking of it just being like someone who's

143
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
And they accidentally poo in there

144
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Yeah that lives that sounds right

145
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
What sounds right

146
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,871
The image that comes to my mind

147
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
Indie band

148
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Starting in Barberton

149
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Sheriff

150
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Do Jordan like I said

00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
Not today on February 5th

152
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,647
And that it's just a little piece that Alex's recording and then

153
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
Going to take over the shower

154
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
And I hope the rest of it

155
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
So this is the beginning

156
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
There's a lot going on even on the 5th

157
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,399
There's a lot that happened Alex should be like

158
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
Leading the show with

159
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
But of course

160
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
Look at this Newsweek article

161
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Top story

162
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
On

163
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Google

164
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
Has decided

165
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
The Run

166
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
All the huge news

167
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
The State of the Union

168
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Control

169
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Coronavirus

170
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
Not happening

171
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,375
Infowars YouTube videos uploaded by proxy

172
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
I was abused

173
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
Totally banned everywhere

174
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
Such an interesting tactic that he's deploying of this like

175
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
They are making it the number one story which is just sort of a wave covering that he wants to make

176
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
Should not surprise me

177
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
To know that with all his

178
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,327
Is it will look at all this big news around

179
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,887
I am going to talk about me

180
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
Knights that makes perfect

181
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:49,311
Because I have to cuz they've made it the number one story such a weird

182
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
Deflect like just the application

183
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
Responsibility

184
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
He's published millions of stories

185
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
Interesting Lee in this

186
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,367
Lacerta complaining about everybody

187
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,207
Writing all these major stories about him that are inaccurate

188
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
I think he

189
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
References Wolfgang how big's arrest

190
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,143
For the good idea I've heard him

191
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Not Direct

192
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
Haha he doesn't talk about it it doesn't get into it

193
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,823
This is the only sort of oblique reference that I've heard to it so far

194
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
You'll see these headlines every few days

195
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
Alex Jones employees

196
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
Arrested for stalking family

197
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Talk about it

198
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:46,143
Obviously about Wolfgang

199
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Sure those are

200
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
Descriptions to make

201
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
But yeah

202
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
It's just so

203
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
Yeah such a week

204
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,919
Thing to do tonight even cover the story

205
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Bring it up if your

206
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
Committed to not talking about it

207
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,039
Because he has to create a strawman of it cuz

208
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
Is the big enough story that people might Heroes

209
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,719
Strawman of they're saying that he's an employee

210
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
That way you could sort of

211
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,839
Argue against the story without dealing with the merits of intellect

212
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
I did Elevate this guy and

213
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,703
He did send out a Sandy Hook

214
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
Parents social security number

215
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
That's a bunch of people

216
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
So like

217
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
I don't know it's just it's just

218
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,687
Yeah it's a lack of personal responsibility

219
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,039
So we have one more clip I believe yet

220
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
A skier from February 5th

221
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
And it's

222
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,927
Alex talking about an interview that Owens going to do later

223
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Which I want to talk about

224
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,279
But I also don't want to talk about the interview because

225
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Doing

226
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Coming up

227
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
In

228
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
2nd hour today

229
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,239
Francis Boyle

230
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,847
Will be joining Owen Shroyer live

231
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
So that's interesting okay

232
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
Owens interview missguided

233
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,743
So like I said I've no real interest in the interview itself

234
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:22,143
Which is a shame because the way Alex is promoting this interview and setting it up it sounds like a really serious legitimate

235
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
The message that the Coronavirus

236
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,519
Is a bio-weapon in the World Health Organization knows about Anna covering it out

237
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,103
So this guest has a man named Francis Boyle and on paper

238
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:36,223
If you just read his bio you would get the impression that he is someone whose opinion you really need to take Serious

239
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,063
He is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois

240
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,903
And has a resume full of things like being on the board of Amnesty International

241
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
And various intersections with the US government

242
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,607
For instance he did draft legislation that would become the biological weapons anti-terrorism Act of 1989

243
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,655
We just signed into law by George

244
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
H.w. bush

245
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:02,079
Do he did work on his draft it was really just the US version of the pre-existing you and biological weapons

246
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
Convention of nineteen

247
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:08,479
35 so it's not like he created rules about biological weapons out of thin air defined

248
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Did replace

249
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Coming

250
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
The guy would probably be insulting

251
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
Cuz I'm sure there were some

252
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
Things to flush out College of course

253
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
At the same time yes there was a previous

254
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,327
System framework I just needed to be put onto a u.s. level at the international

255
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,703
I can find no evidence that anything to do with the drafting of the UN convention

256
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,055
And that also seems unlikely thing as boil would have been 22 when it was drafted

257
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Any would have still been in

258
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
College

259
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
Precocious that's like that's like

260
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
Look whatever

261
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
Tentacles in College Hill

262
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
You'd already assassinated somebody

263
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,599
I just killed Aldo Moro

264
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:50,463
Still in grade schools has been killing people across the world

265
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Call Church

266
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,351
Despite his legal interaction with the subject of biological weapons people like Alex in these days

267
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:02,751
These folks they have a little bit of an Impulse to ascribe some kind of experience to him in the field of the science of biological age

268
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Which would be a

269
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Someone that's important

270
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
To consider when you have someone with what appears to be a legitimate

271
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,479
List of credentials making outrageous arguments on Alex's show

272
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Is there hiss

273
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
And Francis Boyle has a bit of a hist

274
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
What you might call a

275
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
A pattern

276
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,951
Calling literally everything a bioweapon

277
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,023
In 2014 Francis Boyle made the rounds alleging that the

278
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
The Ebola outbreak in Zaire

279
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,935
Liberia Sierra Leone and guinea came from a US bioweapons released

280
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,007
Either due to testing containment

281
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
And I assumed he was.

282
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Incorrect snow

283
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
And all the articles I can find about this I don't see him providing

284
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,199
Any evidence of this outside of vagin simulations and his own son

285
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Suggestion

286
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
Interesting Lee what you

287
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,367
Camp fine though is how his theories were used by the North Korean State media Outlet

288
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Like Pyongyang daily

289
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
2tact

290
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
The United States

291
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,767
Which is a really fun byproduct of rhetoric and work it

292
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:03,167
He puts out you put out anti us propaganda by yourself and all of a sudden other countries are doing

293
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,055
Authoritarian countries around the world

294
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
It just wasn't also his only dip into the

295
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
The pool

296
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,967
In January 2016 Francis Boyle appeared on Infowars

297
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
The tell Alex that the zika virus

298
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,831
Iris was a u.s. created by

299
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Got that right

300
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
I watched a bit of that interview my favorite part is

301
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
Is the first word

302
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Out of boils mouth

303
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,279
Quote I have no inside information

304
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
All right I heard that and that I stop listening

305
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Come on

306
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,727
Daddy's push similar theories about the swine flu and probably every other public health issue you can

307
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
Can think of

308
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,127
This is the kind of role that Francis Boyle plays on Infowars

309
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,223
Whenever there's a health-related story he's the seemingly credible voice

310
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
Alex can call to say that the outbreak was a

311
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
Planned by weapon design

312
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
Depopulate the world

313
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
When the outbreak is handled in the Publix

314
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Attention moves on

315
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,487
He disappears from the show so he doesn't have to explain why this

316
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
Attempted depopulation doesn't what I didn't work

317
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
Mary pops up whenever the next one come

318
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
If he still teach

319
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
I find I have a hard time getting

320
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
To the bottom of that entirely sure

321
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
When someone is 10 years

322
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Really talk

323
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,407
Yeah that's true really tough situation

324
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
What

325
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
100

326
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
Oh no he doesn't have tender tender

327
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,903
He was fired and gotten rid of but he was there for a long time right

328
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
I think your good name wrong

329
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
How do you look how is the yogurt

330
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
How do you guys do your guy I'm talking about dr. Yamamoto

331
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,679
Yes but how

332
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,775
He had to go for a walk

333
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Took the foundation

334
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:50,175
His theory seems to be that the US conducting research about things like in a bowl of Acts

335
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
Maxine or zika vaccine

336
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
That's actually cover for the US conducting research

337
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
To the how to use these things of the weather

338
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,391
Honestly that kind of thinking is just impossible to contend with

339
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
Because it frame something

340
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
Entirely reasonable

341
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Namely

342
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,767
Researching things that are medically very

343
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
Proof of international crime

344
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,631
What would someone with this position prefer

345
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
Would it be better to not research an Ebola vaccine

346
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,031
It seems to me that that would be painted as a nefarious

347
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Conspiracy of negligence

348
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
It's leaving the population is sitting ducks

349
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
In the off chance that I have outbreak did happen

350
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,599
At this position and it's a little bit exploded above the

351
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Reality that

352
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
I mean the government has done

353
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
Terrible I'll prove it

354
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,583
Maybe if they hadn't done it it would be harder for it to portray them as doing

355
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
I will I will

356
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Like

357
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
There is a level of

358
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
Reasonable distrust

359
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Of the government

360
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
With control over viruses the operative word has to be reasonable or they said

361
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,223
Main remain healthy

362
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,807
When you're going on Infowars health is no longer a concern

363
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,135
Even if you're a ranger yeah I mean if you are if you are somebody

364
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Who's going on

365
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Infowars

366
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
You have reasonable is gone

367
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,839
It was like if you were this guy in like let's say that you are really into

368
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,143
City bio-weapon related issues

369
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
The first 50

370
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,263
Tea minutes of your interview should be like alright Alex

371
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,335
We need to talk about all of these bad position

372
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,151
8 Hour going to be on your platform my bus

373
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,223
Definition of terms Alex

374
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,575
I'm kicked off already okay 50 weight phone issues

375
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,647
Bottom line here is that although Boyle has some legitimate

376
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,951
It's sounding aspects to his resume from the 90

377
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,023
These is more recent career has been marked by some pretty incredible claim

378
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,583
Generally made on Outlets like Infowars

379
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
I can find literally no reason

380
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
Take what he saying seriously

381
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
Where I'm sitting he's based

382
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,007
Squee just the member of the Infowars cast

383
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
It gives the appearance

384
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,639
Credibility to outbreak fears that Alex is using to sell his s*** when Mike Adams

385
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Kind of ruined his effect

386
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Fitness by being overeager

387
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
It's over

388
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Over for Humanity

389
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
There will only be

390
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
Lone Survivor

391
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,951
It's tough to go from there and retain your credibility do not just you not playback living just keep moving like

392
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,535
That's why I mean it's tough

393
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,583
Do you know shot that shot

394
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,143
Where do you where is there left to go

395
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
I wonder

396
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
So here's my problem with him

397
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,335
Boilermaker

398
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
I don't know

399
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:34,271
I don't I don't entirely know what his probably take me too long

400
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,087
Get to the bottom of a Bayside character

401
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
Utility as it relates to

402
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,511
Infowars absolutely off

403
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,327
Like it might just be a situation where he has

404
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,631
Lost his objectivity

405
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,703
See that's it that's my thing if you're going to be this guy you might as well be

406
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
The Griffin at this

407
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,871
Same time if you're this guy and you're not getting paid for it you're you're crazy sometimes that stuff's pretty tough though

408
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
Grist going is a full-time job

409
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
And if you're

410
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
Large

411
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
So we get to February 6th

412
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
The mouth

413
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,791
And I was thinking like guys probably all just going to be more Corona to coronavirus talk is going to be no

414
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
No good but Jordan

415
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:19,839
Remember

416
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143
How Alex said on recent episode

417
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,519
He was going to get a homeless person in studio

418
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,103
He doesn't do that on their show

419
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,503
I just want to remind people that Alex said he was going to do that

420
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Wheatley drop

421
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
Dear God dammit

422
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,183
You have spent so many years building up my truck

423
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
It's on porch

424
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
That like

425
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,815
It's so easy to forget though

426
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,399
Yeah and I don't do a good enough job of remind

427
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
Kicker going of like

428
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,519
Days since Alex announced you talked to do surgery

429
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,871
Give me the talk about the microchipping narrative

430
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,527
Yeah it's so hard to remember anything remember when we bombed in assassinated Iran we're all like it's going to be World War 3

431
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,063
3 an hour just whatever that

432
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
That was 2 weeks ago

433
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
Yeah I guess so

434
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
It's quick

435
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,952
Yeah so Alex is back in studio on the six

436
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Man

437
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Welcome back

438
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,864
We are live ladies and gentlemen

439
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:30,752
Thursday February 6th 2020 transmission any minute president Leon States

440
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,336
Walk through those doors

441
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,968
He is going to address the people of the United States people of world about the attempted

442
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
Take down for the 3rd

443
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
Current time

444
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
President-trump

445
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Fighting

446
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,440
Harder now because they're pop

447
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
Globalist

448
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Evangelist

449
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
That

450
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:01,472
Go to do this because it further divides and hurts the nation and it's very athletic

451
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Sure

452
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Absolutely

453
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Public presidency

454
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
Last 30 years

455
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,200
They don't know what to do now they've got not just a present that spray

456
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,016
President that understands the New World Order

457
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
Last minutes

458
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,672
American Century setting

459
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
The New American Century

460
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
Has begun

461
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
So

462
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:31,680
Boilerplate pretty standard stuff but most part Alex coming into Studio kind of uninspired

463
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
A little bit

464
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
I wanted to

465
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,032
There's some phrasing in there that I think of

466
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Really into

467
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
This thing I want to talk about it

468
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
A little bit

469
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
It's really weird that I

470
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,944
Alex is using the term New American Century

471
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,784
Primarily because that's what the last three letters in the

472
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
Pinac document Stan

473
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Amps for

474
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,952
The term New American Century in the world of Infowars is a one-to-one identifier

475
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
With the dick

476
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,536
Cheney project for a New American Century documents

477
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,840
Rebuilding America's defenses

478
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,144
Main title was switch Alex

479
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
Constantly using

480
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
Incorrectly to assert

481
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:10,336
Cheney wanted to use race-specific bioweapons and use the diprove a Dick Cheney Paul wolfowitz did 9/11

482
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
This is weird

483
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
And probably means nothing

484
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
But I think it's worthwhile discuss this for a moment

485
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
Because there's a

486
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Important

487
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,088
Sing buried within this the people might not immediately

488
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,232
Alex is obviously not signaling that he's been a neocon all along that he loves Dick Cheney now

489
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,048
He's just a fan of A Century Of America

490
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
Domination of the world

491
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,120
Preferably a new one

492
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,192
Something that you would describe as a new American Century

493
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,544
This is a very sensible way to express this idea and I understand why you would phrase it

494
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
That way

495
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,944
This is the same thing as George h.w. Bush using the words New World Order in a speech

496
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,016
Abdul that point there had been a world order

497
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,576
Where the United States and the Soviet Union have been soap

498
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
Preoccupied with each other

499
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,440
But they failed in their opportunity to be leaders in a global order

500
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,512
With the season of hostility between the two superpowers and

501
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:05,888
The end of the Cold War there was a possibility for the world world order it was different from the old one

502
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,936
A new world order if you will

503
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,104
People like Alex insist that Bush saying the words New World Order is proof that he was signaling to an evil cabal bent on world domination

504
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
Nation in the world

505
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
Without understanding how these words

506
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,224
Actually accurately describe

507
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
The ideal Bush was discussing

508
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,832
Alex is currently doing the exact same thing

509
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,160
Using an expression that means something very specific in one context

510
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
The context of his show

511
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,744
But also accurately describes

512
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Nothing he's talking

513
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,584
Because I'm not a dumb dumb I understand that

514
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
And I don't feel

515
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
Compelled to yell about Alex's secretly work

516
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
Paul wolfowitz

517
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Dick Cheney

518
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,240
Because he says he wants a new American Century

519
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,288
Anyway I bring all this up because it's

520
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Teachable

521
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
But how sad

522
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,896
The thinking patterns are that underlies so many of the foundation

523
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
Alex's conspiracy

524
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Theory

525
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
He knows that it does

526
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,528
Doesn't mean anything for Bush to refuse the words New World Order

527
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,320
Because he does the exact same thing

528
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
Just all bulshit

529
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,928
I think this is a very serious

530
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
Situation that requires

531
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,864
You musty oh no

532
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
That's a bit

533
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,216
His comeback after that

534
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Exactly

535
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,032
I was very startled to see that

536
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,640
You think that there is there's something important

537
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
Pointing out little things like

538
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
What is being done

539
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
Is this

540
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
The same behavior

541
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,904
Alex if you confronted him about it and was like hey you said New American Century

542
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Code for the

543
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
Pinac document

544
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,096
You know that's not what I intended as I know that I just it's just that I was talking about

545
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
America

546
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,776
He would have bought himself that sort of leeway and excuse that he would never afford anybody else.

547
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,312
It is just so it is

548
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
It's a

549
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Whatever

550
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,152
Advantageous

551
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,968
You just go ahead and use that the rules are for you not

552
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
So

553
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,320
Couches out of Studio like I said we get

554
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,856
Reason for why

555
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
Studio

556
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
Bandits lackluster

557
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,488
Getting my now is so intense that

558
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,864
Have had a vacation in over a year Mikey Highlander my wife said dammit we're going to have one

559
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
And someone had took one but I

560
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
I was working the whole time

561
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
I got on a plane early and came back

562
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,824
Because Wild Horses couldn't drag me away

563
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,128
He just wanted to vacation

564
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,248
That's not fair

565
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:34,368
You later that I totally am of the mind that like if you want to Vacation you can

566
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,392
Conduit

567
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,560
If you're out Jones and you're talking about how like yep you have like Adam coming on saying it's over for Humanity

568
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
The death battle with the global is right the quickening

569
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,936
Is upon us Shore and you not like I understand

570
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,264
It was a little bit up in the air about Wendy and

571
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,152
Impeachment vote was going to actually happen maybe we would have witnesses baby now

572
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,200
Obvious that the answer was no

573
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,784
But there was a possibility you didn't know the exact date in advance show

574
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
Iowa caucus

575
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,392
State-of-the-union window side

576
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
Pre-plan

577
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
Around like

578
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
First of all

579
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
We have this

580
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:19,680
Pageant going on about the coronavirus really big event

581
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
Are happening

582
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,384
Look how do you support labor rights and you should be allowed to there isn't labor rights that all over

583
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,504
14 days paid vacation per year he's he owns the company

584
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:39,392
Labor rights become murky when the employer is the owner

585
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,488
Sure go ahead and take a vacation I just think it's

586
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,888
It said something about you when you are this guy who presents yourself one way and then gigantic news events are happy

587
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,472
Inside and outside of the world

588
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
Think about nurses

589
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Like fuk it

590
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
I'm going on

591
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
Since that's also

592
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
I think

593
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
A very smart move

594
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
Just because

595
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
It goes bad

596
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,760
Back to the discussion earlier

597
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
Nobody's going to remember into we

598
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
Like it's just how fast shipping

599
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,352
And this way he doesn't have to say something incredibly stupid

600
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:25,472
Yes no one remembers that Alex wasn't there the day that the Pope

601
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
No one remembers

602
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,664
Exactly Matt Leo zagami and now they've got a bunch of ideas

603
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,296
Regardless of when you say that the world is ending and that you need to fight every single moment

604
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,088
You still got to take a vacation

605
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,904
Yeah sure the world is ending of course

606
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
Maybe maybe I should

607
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
Should take a cue from

608
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
Vacation

609
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,912
Alex gets into talking about some new other Coronavirus

610
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,960
Conspiracy UK and

611
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,496
I think that there is a

612
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,336
Type of thinking that's demonstrated in this clip

613
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
It's so bad

614
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
Coronavirus situation in Mali

615
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,992
Stop biological weapons expert

616
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,832
And a top scientist scanning the virus and saying it's man-made

617
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,392
Don't get ahead of this if you notice

618
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,144
8000 confirm I walked in here few minutes ago with 24000

619
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
The internal Chinese numbers that leaked

620
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,800
Publish in China by the people daily

621
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,592
4000 dead

622
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Yesterday

623
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,224
The number of dead is a number of

624
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Think about that

625
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,344
So Alex is suggesting

626
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,416
That the number of people infected

627
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
Is actually the Dead

628
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Right

629
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,768
That's just based on what he's

630
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,096
Is feeling well yeah I mean it feels like that makes more sense

631
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,656
For him to believe but he's saying also that this is

632
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Is based on

633
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,752
Official Chinese government numbers that leaked in the

634
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,288
The people's daily

635
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,592
I can't find the source

636
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,176
I can't find the source that Alex is talking about

637
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
From the people's daily

638
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Because

639
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Not

640
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,088
But I did find an article on Infowars about this it was written by Paul Joseph

641
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,184
According to his story Paul Source was website called Taiwan news

642
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,488
Switch is actually a actual news out

643
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,304
Propensity

644
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096
Tweets as sources

645
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
Might lead one to be

646
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,936
Be suspicious but it's an actual Outlet right I'll deal with Taiwan news

647
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,496
This article is covering how tencent

648
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
Dance website

649
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,056
Their website called

650
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,104
Epidemic situation tracker

651
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,176
He did briefly show numbers of fatalities and infect

652
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,504
And that are way higher than the official numbers that are being reported

653
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
The infection

654
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,624
Count was 10 times higher and the death toll was 20 4508

655
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
89

656
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,696
As opposed to the official figure of around 300

657
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,256
These numbers were up briefly then we're chained

658
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
Change to reflect

659
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
The official statistic

660
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
This article does not prove that the numbers that

661
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
Tencent had posted briefly our Act

662
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
It's just suggestive

663
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
With lines like

664
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:11,360
Some are speculating that a codon problem could be causing the real quote in

665
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
Internal data to accidentally appear

666
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,456
Others believe that someone behind the

667
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,504
I'm seeing just trying to leak the real number

668
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,576
I don't know what the situation with this is

669
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:24,672
What it seems entirely plausible that some kind of a glitch go to been responsible for the error

670
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,256
The theory that someone is trying to leak real numbers is baseless

671
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
And there's nothing

672
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
Supporting that terms of proof

673
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,888
It's just something that is suggested like well maybe that's what this is

674
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
The speculation that a codon problem

675
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,264
What's causing real numbers real numbers to show up

676
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
Even boring

677
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,360
Sense if your epidemic tracker is built

678
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,640
To be a propaganda front

679
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
The trick people that the outbreak isn't as bad as you say

680
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
It seems like you wouldn't

681
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
Connect that to the

682
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,344
Real numbers at all why would that be something

683
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
If you're yeah

684
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,488
Nobody's nobody at a Chinese Outlet

685
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
For a second

686
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
Is going to

687
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Leak that

688
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
Without knowing

689
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
Itsy I'm about to be

690
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
Seems unlikely

691
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,752
Basically

692
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Quite frankly

693
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,336
It seems like an error like that idea that the code is

694
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,640
Pulling in the real quote about real numbers

695
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,432
That seems like an error that could

696
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,016
Happen in the setup that they're presenting is what this website is

697
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
I have no idea

698
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,088
Why they keep to Google spreadsheets

699
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,440
Spider-Man accidentally clicked over that

700
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Alex is making

701
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,328
Tons of money right now amping up any indication that the Coronavirus

702
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,144
This is bad as it possibly can be and that everyone is lying

703
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,216
You accept whatever piece of information helps

704
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,520
Push that narrative regardless

705
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
Substantiated it is

706
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,824
Which I think is bad

707
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
Also we see here again another

708
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,176
Instant of him Miss citing his sources

709
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,992
Because he either doesn't know anything about the story he's covering

710
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:57,344
Or he wants to make it more difficult for his listeners to find the underlying information

711
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
But he's using to push his narrative

712
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,232
The people's daily it's not the people's daily it's Taiwan news

713
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
Is the

714
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
Pretty basic stuff that he is

715
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
F****** up either

716
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
Because of incompetence

717
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,888
Or trying to cover the tree

718
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
I'm not entirely sure what it is

719
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
Probably about

720
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
So

721
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,592
Add turns out

722
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,640
He was infected with Coronavirus

723
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,736
I'ma say something else

724
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Fever

725
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
Knock on wood

726
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
8/4 years

727
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,304
Get on the airplanes today all the rest of it knocking on wood telling you that

728
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
Got a fever

729
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
Flying back

730
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
Got something

731
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
Gone now

732
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,288
I feel great

733
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,896
Can our body else I know has pretty much been sick with whatever this respiratory stuff is

734
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,016
Probably coronavirus about coronavirus update

735
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,368
Down some you gargle

736
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
Beltmann

737
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
Chanel

738
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:17,216
At that point he does take a little pull off a bottle of gargle

739
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
Turtle is a word

740
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,312

Drinking Pepto-Bismol straight from the thing every 10 minutes

Just like weird it's it's a bad

746
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
It's like Shania

747
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:49,216
Not take his own products on the show goes well

748
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,264
Vermillion nanosilver

Incredible things

756
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,880
So we're launching off here into a

757
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Pitch

758
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696

I'm getting a fever that is product

760
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
Killing a fever

761
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,888
Even though he knows specifically a person who has already cured

762
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
The Coronavirus

763
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,288
Why isn't Alex going to him

764
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,616
Galaxy Vanos that's bulshit cuz he's not having

765
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
Around

766
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
Steve you can't be doing that

767
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,504
You dumbass sometimes people like

768
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
Alternative medicine

769
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,344
Sometimes people like

770
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Granny's

771
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136

Put your bedroom door in the morning you wake up and you're healed that way everything

774
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,424
Every time I've ever had a few deceptive frog in high school

775
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,496
Do black people like a lot of different things

776
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,312
It turns out Alex has a little bit of a down-home

777
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,384
Remedy for how he cured himself of his fever

778
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,432
So I got home last night

779
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
My wife said you're hot

780
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
Thermometer mouth

781
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,040
At about 100

782
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Temperature

783
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,624
Steinbeck 157

784
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,696
Super Bowl

785
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,256
Got my coil silver silver bullet

786
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Some of that

787
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,144
Took a couple Advil climbed into bed and slept from 7

788
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
Until

789
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,752
7 a.m. this morning and the fever was gone

790
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
Put on double shirt

791
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,640
Two pairs of sweatpants

792
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
That my ass up

793
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,456
Laika

794
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,528
And got up this morning and

795
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,832
Yes

796
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
Something about

797
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
When you

798
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,208
The Romans noticed

799
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,000
Sayings about it

800
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,608
What are we doing here

801
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,912
Things that would happen to either have another what are we doing

802
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,240
Clockwork everybody knows a long time to get sick

803
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:05,408
It's like 12 but I just

804
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:10,784
Commercial about how are you superstitious about getting sick

805
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
My God you can't

806
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,160
Save for 2 years I haven't been sick in 2 years and then be like

807
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:21,024
Ohshit see what happens when you say you haven't been sick in a long time

808
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,376
Also there's a lot of silver in that story

809
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
How you might have broken

810
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
My fever

811
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,472
The Advil in 12 hours

812
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:33,312
Sleep dad cook himself like a turkey

813
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
Maybe they're a lot of

814
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:39,456
A lot of things that could have helped one of my strategies in terms of fevers that I have had some

815
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,272
Success with over the years as I take really hot baths

816
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Like You Raised

817
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,880
The temperature even I don't even know if that works

818
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,904
Something that I've always

819
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
It seems like

820
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Exactly what I was

821
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
What is mirroring

822
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,768
But I could just say that I took silver

823
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,792
Over beforehand to and

824
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:57,376
Then save the silver help really bad with hell

825
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
I just

826
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,728
I'm just like okay well eventually this will go away and then go to work

827
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
You like my dad

828
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,336
Just wait it out it'll go away my body is healed itself

829
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
Before I'll die

830
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,432
Hi this is how life Works sure

831
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,760
You're not get some silver you're not like Alex

832
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,368
You get on an airplane how I finally got it for

833
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
Ray's going to pull that on Saturday

834
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,280
As soon as I got out of the airport.

835
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,568
We have a lot of that but

836
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,616
Jailbreak

837
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,664
Last week

838
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,224
Homeland Security

839
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
2007

840
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:50,112
You cheating cheating bastard

841
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
Forest

842
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,000
The only thing found at a star's family which is the Coronavirus

843
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,608
From them private label

844
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
Original

845
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
Leonardo's Red Hill

846
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:08,032
Supermoon 2Cellos depending on gas

847
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,616
And by the military operations

848
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
On their hands and face

849
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Something

850
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
Abrasions like a swamp

851
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
Directions Bass Lake

852
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
They said

853
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,768
The word they used to watch all those documents today

854
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
It was

855
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
The point is is that

856
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
It's chilling out

857
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,216
Yeah it doesn't

858
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,752
Are we past illegal yet

859
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:45,152
Man I think we're getting there cuz there's a notable increase in recent nanosilver and

860
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
Nano silver

861
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,992
As a way to protect yourself from the Coronavirus

862
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,064
This might be okay in the case of

863
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,600
The super silver wound gel

864
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,904
Santa's we discussed on recent episode that product

865
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,440
Has been tested by the FDA

866
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,488
And it's technically a drug not a supplement

867
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,560
Lately Alex has been using claims about the

868
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,656
The super silver wound gel and applying those same claims could be made about

869
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
The super blue toothpaste

870
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,984
Immune gargle which book

871
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,008
Contain nanosilver

872
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,616
His reasoning seems to be that if the FDA has approved the marketing of the wound gel

873
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,896
And it has nanosilver in

874
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
It must be cool tomorrow

875
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,504
Any product containing that nanosilver in a similar fashion

876
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Tracks

877
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,576
This is very much not allowed by the law

878
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,416
There are Myriad of reasons why this is not acceptable as a business practice

879
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,000
This but probably the easiest to explain is that these products are not even

880
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
I'm close to the same

881
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,096
The one the FDA has approved as a topical ointment

882
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
The other ones are weird things

883
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Things to be taken in

884
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,680
Currently which makes them

885
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,704
Wheatley in Carver

886
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,264
What really easy way to look at this

887
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,592
Is it the wound gel has 24 parts-per-million nanosilver

888
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,360
Where's the court

889
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,896
Infowars store website

890
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
Immune gargle has 15

891
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
In parts per million

892
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
It makes a big difference

893
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,784
When considering the products and what they may

894
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
My dude

895
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,368
Paperwhite Alex constantly tells his audience

896
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,160
It's not to eat the wounds out

897
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,440
Because it would probably kill

898
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,512
You would think that the fact that one product is potentially

899
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,792
Toxic and the other one is

900
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,072
Is not really Devon

901
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm straight how

902
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,888
You can't make a dental claims about them

903
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,168
Especially when we're talking

904
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
Sing about 9

905
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,496
Parts per million separating

906
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:19,104
It's a big difference

907
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
You probably

908
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:26,528
Fatal that would make you feel good you might get a fever might have to take some other silver

909
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,136
According to the dietary supplement health and Education Act of 1994

910
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
Paragraph six

911
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,464
Discover statements made about nutritionals

912
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Support

913
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,792
Claims can be made about supplements to the extent

914
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,816
But Studies have shown

915
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
The claims to be

916
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,400
True like you can say that melatonin helps

917
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
Set sleep patterns and stuff like that

918
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,496
The paragraph and quote

919
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,520
A statement under the

920
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:51,872
Sub paragraph may not claim to diagnose mitigate tree

921
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,151
Cure or prevent

922
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,711
Specific disease or class of diseases

923
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,783
If the manufacturer of a dietary supplement propose

924
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,807
To make a statement

925
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
Described in the first time

926
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
Paragraph

927
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
Any idea in the labeling

928
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
Of a dietary

929
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:08,255
The manufacturer shall notify the secretary of the FDA

930
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,583
No later than 30 days after the first marketing

931
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,143
Of the dietary supplement with such a statement

932
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
That's such a statement

933
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Is being made

934
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,007
This is to say that even if you provide a disclaimer

935
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,591
That the product is not meant to diagnose treat cure prevent any condition

936
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,895
If you make a claim to that effect

937
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
Your required

938
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Inform the FDA within 30

939
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,551
The FDA is not interested in health claims unless they

940
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,319
Call to ask

941
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
A substance

942
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
And it does

943
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
Disease or health-related

944
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,207
Condition you need to have both of these things

945
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
Before you risk getting in trouble

946
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
Princeton

947
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,327
If you want to say that fruit is good for your health

948
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,119
The FDA considers that healthy

949
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
The guidance

950
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
Which they don't regulate

951
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,471
Health claims on the other hand they do

952
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,263
And those occur when there is a

953
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
And a condition

954
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
Alex is very clearly

955
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,895
His immune gargle and toothpaste to being helpful and

956
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
The prevention of the Coronavirus

957
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,455
Which constitutes

958
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
A health claim

959
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,295
I'm not certain how concrete you have to be with your claim

960
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
For the FDA would

961
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Take action because

962
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
You being so vague and suggest

963
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,903
Did with his picture

964
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,463
Is there is there well maybe they like

965
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,487
Yeah you couldn't make

966
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
Take the case of court

967
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,791
He's making unfounded health

968
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
For the purposes of

969
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
Podcast

970
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,375
I'm comfortable saying

971
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,679
That is exactly what he's doing

972
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,215
And the basis that he's using

973
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,287
Is the FDA approval of the wound gel which is erroneous

974
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,591
Replying to the other nanosilver products

975
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
It's just disgusting Behavior

976
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,199
And anyone who wasn't trying to profit off of Public Health

977
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,759
Is literally the

978
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,551
The fingerprint of a Shameless opportunist

979
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
I think he

980
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
Thinks that by

981
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Claiming it

982
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,903
The Pentagon and not like

983
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:46,303
That's his that's where he's going to be like oh see I'm not claiming that a doctor better than

984
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
I'm just saying that the

985
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
The Pentagon

986
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,911
Which hey the Pentagon does all kinds of weird health check

987
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,959
The Pentagon thinks that LSD can control

988
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:57,823
Mine it doesn't matter what the Pentagon thinks I'm just saying if it comes down to it that's not

989
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,639
Week

990
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,663
Think that's what he's

991
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,735
England for these

992
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:09,343
Narratives these ways of pitching these products are emerging at at

993
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,135
The time when there is

994
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,439
A public health issue that Alex

995
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,767
He's really building in and making a major Focus

996
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,631
Using all these memes and dumb unsubstantiated things

997
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,655
To build

998
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,703
Panic surrounding the Coronavirus

999
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
And then being like

1000
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,543
Oh hey by the way this nanosilver that I sell

1001
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,847
There's secret studies that have been done yet

1002
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,639
It's just f****** a response

1003
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,455
An awful and we know it's not going to stop because

1004
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
Apparently it's working

1005
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,247
Very well

1006
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,575
This is the first time in a long time he's been happy about

1007
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
No totally

1008
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,903
I think we're going to hear this go

1009
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,207
Going for a long time it's not only the

1010
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Open sales

1011
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,511
It's also the food

1012
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,071
Of course

1013
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,471
In the conference room in Africa

1014
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
And he gave us a call this morning

1015
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,335
And he said well we are

1016
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,455
But now it's 3:50.

1017
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:13,855
And everybody else is totally sold out anybody else telling you the reference is lying to you or it's crap they got high quality

1018
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,159
Twenty-four hours a day

00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:23,071
It may go up to two or three weeks by next weekend

1020

To put a clock on

00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,335

1029
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:53,023
From the food people and it's going to be longer now you know why

1030
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,607
Inflated demand that Alex is creating with these

1031
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:00,191
Didn't like his entire hour-long infomercial

1032
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,239
In all of the content

1033
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
Terrify people

1034
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,823
About to

1035
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,687
Virus situation in order to drive

1036
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,967
You've got

1037
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,527
The my Patriot Supply and by the way

1038
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,831
There's a people who Supply a ton of other be

1039
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,647
People who sell survival food

1040
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:24,511
Diversified in terms of I believe Ben Shapiro food people are them too

1041
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,559
Shapiro has food survival food

1042
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,631
The f*** is wrong alot of these people do okay

1043
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
Jim Bakker

1044
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,447
Use auguston Farms

1045
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,239
Is there something different

1046
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,287
Okay good friends apparently they don't have any food

1047
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:42,687
What was no help so he's going to be like we would love to tell you survive

1048
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
Apple food

1049
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:50,111
I almost guarantee the baker's page is no one else has food

1050
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:56,767
Not just that but God wants you to buy his behavior

1051
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,047
Manipulative sales

1052
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,375
This is all it does is funnel people to buy the survival

1053
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,399
Now there's an

1054
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,703
Increased artificially inflated demand

1055
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
Just pushing back

1056
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,287
The delivery times that they compromise

1057
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,639
And that appears to be a run on food maybe they don't have enough to

1058
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,663
Fulfill

1059
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
It it all it does is

1060
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,503
Exacerbate Bank

1061
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
Yeah

1062
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
It is

1063
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,647
It's like that's one of those things where it's like

1064
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,207
They are not

1065
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Bummed

1066
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,023
You know like

1067
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,815
My Patriot Supply is in like

1068
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:35,423
Alex we need to we need to stick by FDA rules that you can't

1069
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
Say these things

1070
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
They're like

1071
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
You keep talking

1072
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,311
My Patriot Supply

1073
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,359
Nothing to do with the silver

1074
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,943
Okay then

1075
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,271
I don't know

1076
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,319
I don't know if Alex could get them in trouble

1077
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,391
I think that they're not responsible for the way Alex

1078
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
Sell stuff

1079
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,719
I'm not sure that's an interesting question

1080
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,767
My Patriot Supply

1081
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,815
East is

1082
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
I guess

1083
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,447
Making false claims about a disease is that acts

1084
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
Anyway

1085
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
What do you mean like

1086
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,543
Like saying that the Coronavirus

1087
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:16,383
This is going to kill you and your family tomorrow I don't think the coronavirus could take you to court

1088
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,735
Irene has a as it like I

1089
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
Criminal

1090
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:27,903
Situation there can you know inciting a panic or anything like that I don't know in what way

1091
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,207
It would be

1092
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,303
So we'll get back to there's more obviously there's more of virus stuff

1093
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
Coming up

1094
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
Weirdly we get a

1095
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,375
Reprieve from

1096
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
Because Trump is giving

1097
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
Don't be giving a speech is

1098
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,239
Victory speech

1099
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:48,639
Yeah by beating this impeachment trial and so Alex comes in and starts talking over

1100
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
For the Applause

1101
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
Has given Trump

1102
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:58,367
The Big Dipper

1103
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:11,167
Thank you

1104
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:22,431
You better start defending his supporters of hundred dollars

1105
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:32,159
So they're going to make a move physically on tropical house the impeachment

1106
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,231
Is Trump has got on Facebook

1107
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
We're all going to die

1108
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
So deposit

1109
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,167
Long

1110
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,959
Gives Alex a lot of

1111
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,239
Opportunity to talk over

1112
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:52,895
I love you so much

1113
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,735
There's a lot of like

1114
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,319
If it's weird that that's a quote that he uses cuz I want to I know you know that

1115
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,367
But there's not a lot of subtlety

1116
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,463
Star Wars I don't understand

1117
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:11,071
There's no like moral ambiguity about it at all there

1118
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,863
Evil the Rebellion is good

1119
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,423
Legitimately it's one of the most clear-cut examples of

1120
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,959
Black and white heroes and villains

1121
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
Any movie that I can

1122
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
Can pick up

1123
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,775
Alex

1124
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,079
Identify with the bad guy

1125
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,895
These bad guys are close

1126
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,711
The line he's quoting while waiting for Trump

1127
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,759
To come out and give his impeachment acquittal speech

1128
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:33,343
Is a line that Darth Vader says after Obi-Wan is

1129
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,415
Been killed in the death star's heading to wipe out the Rebellion right

1130
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,463
The words of an absolute villain

1131
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,743
On the cusp of wiping

1132
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,767
Now the only helper

1133
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,071
Freedom from tyranny that's the last of the universe

1134
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,887
This could be seen as Alex being stupid and just

1135
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
Is the dork

1136
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
But I have a

1137
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,775
Strong suspicion that it's really more of a tell about what type of person Alex Jones actually is

1138
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
He's a fan of the empire

1139
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,615
What he sees Trump is hero

1140
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,895
About to give a triumphant

1141
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,455
It brings to mind Darth Vader on the

1142
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:02,015
The cusp of solidifying universal rule

1143
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,087
I think I think that that's why that triggers it is

1144
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,391
How can you not like a apple

1145
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,415
Come on

1146
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,207
He's an authoritarian

1147
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:15,327
Tater he-he's maneuvered his way by a political machination

1148
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,655
To destroy the entire flashlight

1149
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,935
Absolutely

1150
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:27,103
He's in control of rebellion at the same time that I was creating the Clone Stormtrooper

1151
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,687
I mean this guy knows how to play the game also

1152
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:34,015
Shoot lightning from his fingertips can you do that's not to like

1153
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:39,903
Super silver fingernail like

1154
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,207
So Trump gets to talkin

1155
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,255
And he has a little bit of a verbal dip

1156
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,559
My Kindle in a number of his speeches that he

1157
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,375
He's been giving me seems to like lose

1158
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,399
Track of words

1159
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,703
I think part of that is probably just like he's

1160
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,263
No teleprompter Ringgit reading stuff in

1161
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
Turtle bike

1162
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,591
Start saying the word

1163
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,383
Getrag Stuck in the Middle

1164
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
Gets bored cuz he doesn't have an attention span and

1165
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:02,943
A super old

1166
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,503
There's a lot of people who speculated about like

1167
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,271
Neurologic

1168
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Nicole events

1169
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,343
And stuff like that know that that's

1170
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,623
McKay's

1171
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,415
Bit irresponsible for us

1172
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,439
Suggest that

1173
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
I think it would be

1174
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
Dumb

1175
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,511
Forgot

1176
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,583
But there are instances where you just clearly doesn't know what he's

1177
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,863
Eddie starts

1178
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:26,751
Yeah this is not one of those occasions I would never talk about any of that stuff at all

1179
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,103
Because of trump in WhatsApp

1180
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,895
Is talkin

1181
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:37,247
In his speech and he gives a little bit of what I would describe as a verbal dip

1182
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
And Alex

1183
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:42,879
Takes the opportunity and he just needs to portray it in the way he wants his audience

1184
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,975
Develop friendships and relationships when you're in battle and War

1185
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,791
Much more so than Jesus have a normal

1186
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,071
Situation

1187
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:55,679
With all that we've gone through we've done I think more than any president

1188
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,215
And administration

1189
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,775
Almost crying but that really

1190
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,199
And Republic

1191
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,247
You just said situation kind of

1192
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,575
A video there's no emotion.

1193
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,903
I don't believe for a sec

1194
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:16,927
About to cry

1195
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:22,047
What would it take to make him cry of it maybe somebody removing his

1196
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
Is named from a building

1197
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:27,935
I would assume that would be an emotional moment that's about it

1198
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
Space

1199
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,519
The reason that I brought up those

1200
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,335
Things of like the media covering like these

1201
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
Is weird

1202
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,383
Start of hiccups

1203
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,919
In some of his rallies

1204
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,223
Is because I think Alex is aware of that

1205
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,271
And I think the key that

1206
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
Kind of being

1207
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:47,647
Close enough to that but yeah

1208
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,439
But that is what's going on there

1209
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,975
It paints Trump is like an

1210
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,071
McMahon but he still has feelings

1211
00:53:55,327 --> 00:54:01,471
It's expressed on days when troops died or days when you've just defeated you

1212
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
Your greatest sin

1213
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,287
So

1214
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Did the speeches

1215
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,591
Deandre

1216
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,895
Ed's long

1217
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,967
Interest in most of it because there's one thing

1218
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,247
Love's

1219
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,295
We first went through

1220
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
Russia Russia Russia

1221
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,647
It was all

1222
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
Bulshit

1223
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,767
We then went through the weather report

1224
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:31,679
Don't delay that you are my presents

1225
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,239
Can children are way so it just children Alex

1226
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,263
Love's

1227
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,055
Of course he loves

1228
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:42,687
The Trump said b******* taking it even more to the lives with his

1229
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:46,527
So Alex gets like really defensive about like no we're not going

1230
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,063
Edit that out

1231
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,367
And you know what I mean

1232
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,927
Broadcast

1233
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,511
The president

1234
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,303
We can say that word

1235
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,399
Nothing and nobody the FCC that Trump runs going to get anybody in trouble

1236
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
True

1237
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,519
It's the first time cussing

1238
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,103
So first

1239
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,383
Tyranny

1240
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,783
Alex's pretending this is the first time Trump is sworn in a speech indicates that he has literally no ma'am

1241
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,623
Memory for things that Trump is a complete fraud no

1242
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,391
Interest

1243
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,439
Anything you saying being true

1244
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,767
Who can forget the time back in September 2017

1245
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:32,351
When Trump was in front of a rally in Alabama talking about Colin Kaepernick

1246
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,375
He said quote

1247
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
You loved

1248
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:37,215
See one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects the flag

1249
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:42,079
Get that son-of-a-b**** off the field right now out he's fired he's fired

1250
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,127
Or what about the time on the campaign Trail

1251
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,919
Trump discuss how he would deal with ice

1252
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,223
Quote I would bomb the s*** out of him

1253
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,015
Or in February 20th

1254
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:55,391
16 when Trump was holding a campaign rally in Manchester New Hampshire where he calls Ted Cruz a p****

1255
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:00,511
While pretending he was with repeating something someone in the audience headset

1256
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:04,607
That's debatable that one's debate which is vulgarity a disease

1257
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,375
Absolutely

1258
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,911
After his speech at

1259
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:10,751
C-pack you said that people were going to start attacking him with b*******

1260
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,775
Like legitimately

1261
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,567
Trump cannot stop swearing

1262
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,335
Speeches

1263
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:18,943
It's the polar opposite of notable when he said b******* in this speech the Galaxy's

1264
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,991
It's such a common thing

1265
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,039
Urban tons of Articles written about it

1266
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,599
Like one headlined the profanity president

1267
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,647
From May 2019 in the New York time

1268
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,463
Or one headlines Donald Trump keeps person

1269
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,999
Here's why it might help them

1270
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,303
17 time

1271
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,327
Or from the washing

1272
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,143
Can post how Trump took swearing mainstream

1273
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
Or from November twenty

1274
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,703
MyTeam in the week

1275
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,239
The cursing president

1276
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,567
Angle on this is legitimately unhinged

1277
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,639
God Trump's we're so goddamn much that it's the

1278
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,455
Topic of a conversation about whether or not it's an intentional

1279
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
Strategies used

1280
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,783
He swears more than any other president

1281
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,087
On the subject of people getting away with things

1282
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,903
No other president ever would have gotten away with

1283
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,951
Be consistent barrage of b*******

1284
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:08,351
He doesn't his rallies in speeches Ono might want to come down at that horseshit conservative victim would talk

1285
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:13,471
If Barack had said this is all bulshit when he was talking about Fox News Fox News it'll be like

1286
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:18,591
Look at our powerful president look at how he's unafraid of the lives and he's willing to

1287
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,639
Where did he call Kanye West

1288
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:25,247
The jackass it was a new cycle for a week

1289
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,807
I don't know what Alex's take all that was IP address

1290
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:34,207
Probably worried about it later

1291
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,511
Appethai probably didn't even notice

1292
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:41,631
God it's so funny that William Randolph Hearst would have turned this into a reason to end a present

1293
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,447
Then say like one b******* and it would be like

1294
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,775
And there went

1295
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,311
He said bulshit now he's gone

1296
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,895
Honestly I think it indicates a certain amount of lack of

1297
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,431
Control like it it's

1298
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
Unbecoming

1299
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,015
I know that's a conversation that maybe

1300
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,295
Antiquated and pasta

1301
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,831
But I don't

1302
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
Enjoy it like

1303
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:08,255
I don't I don't appreciate seeing president saying bulshit

1304
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,031
Well it's a little bit like

1305
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,567
Seeing it's a little bit like

1306
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,871
Like seeing your parents wear for the first time

1307
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,663
Like because you think

1308
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:30,271
These are Edina when you're like 10 or 11 you think OSHA.

1309
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,319
Together they are the authority

1310
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,855
30 figures I know I can trust

1311
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:37,695
Ask them and then they swear you like all bets are f****** off I don't know what the

1312
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,975
The f*** is going to happen here

1313
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,767
Yeah there's a difference

1314
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:45,631
It's two between like the queen

1315
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,167
Parents

1316
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:51,263
So Alex is really insistent that this means

1317
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:57,407
Like he's really pretending that he's never seen

1318
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,711
We paused it we went to break when he

1319
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,271
Came out at 12

1320
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
It was all

1321
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,343
Bulshit

1322
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,159
Use cuss words on air

1323
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
Really

1324
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,231
I'm sick as hell on broadcast

1325
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,535
Do it on The View

1326
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,327
They do it on Good Morning America

1327
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:21,215
They do it comes at night they do it during the family

1328
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,007
Say doodle all over CNN

1329
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,847
If we do it

1330
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,223
MSNBC

1331
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,503
Cut it out as well

1332
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,295
Because the president did that

1333
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,855
Know how serious things are

1334
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,159
Sure like all the other times you sworn

1335
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:47,583
You know they'll they'll swear on those liberal shows like whatever build miyares

1336
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,679
Tim Allen is swearing on Last Man Standing that's that's exactly

1337
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,519
Their sitcoms are everything to Tim Allen's now.

1338
00:59:55,775 --> 01:00:01,663
Definition of the globalist it, absolutely everything

1339
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,455
Home Improvement man

1340
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,503
Never going to get better

1341
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:11,647
There's a weird trend of Alex like sort of listening to the speech and rejoicing throughout it like

1342
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
Psychic

1343
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Cagoule

1344
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,231
Like a Villain who's just won

1345
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,767
Like I can't

1346
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
Sounds like an evil person

1347
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:24,959
Has failed severely the Liberty Patriot movement is taking over the Republican Party

1348
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,983
The Republic

1349
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,335
Quiet

1350
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:35,455
Tenafly

1351
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
That's

1352
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,551
Wow

1353
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,879
Wow man I eat I guess

1354
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:46,463
We have to I guess in their perfect world we rewrite

1355
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,999
All of the Bond films

1356
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:51,327
Where the billionaires are the bad guy and it's just like

1357
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:57,727
They're the heroes

1358
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:04,127
I didn't have a thorny to use those gadgets he wasn't in his own sovereign

1359
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,943
Haitian Dan how is it what are you doing going from Russia

1360
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,479
Even if you're carrying love

1361
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Stroop

1362
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,807
True Blood was a bad guy

1363
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,599
I think an argument could be made

1364
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,367
From the left

1365
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:17,951
The bond was a bad guy 2

1366
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:23,071
Play me every one of those movies were Back From Russia with Love

1367
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,095
But it opens

1368
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,119
He's

1369
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
Having this lovely pic

1370
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,471
About to go on a nice little boat ride

1371
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,031
All sitting there you get to call and the woman's like

1372
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,335
No put it down you don't need any just

1373
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,383
Waxer you just hit there another like

1374
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,199
Holyshit I'm not seen this movie in a long time

1375
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,735
What the f***

1376
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:45,343
Surprise me knowing what I know about you

1377
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,647
Sean Connery

1378
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,719
Not many of those movies that was not Jean Russia that appealed to

1379
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
Watch

1380
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,511
As a younger man

1381
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
Maybe

1382
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,839
Seen one or two Bond movies

1383
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:01,983
I think I'm meeting Sean Connery's ever been that type of movie Azhar does

1384
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
Homer

1385
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,775
Fair enough

1386
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,567
I find the

1387
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,103
Type of movie that

1388
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:07,871
It's like Bond

1389
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
Tubi

1390
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,175
Laborious

1391
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,711
Exhausted

1392
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:12,991
Okay

1393
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,295
But

1394
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,087
Primary goal on this February 6th

1395
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,623
Show is to

1396
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,159
Talk about Trump speech

1397
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,695
And then go to call

1398
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,231
That's basically all he want

1399
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
What's to do

1400
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,535
So he talked about that how we're going to get

1401
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
It's called

1402
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:31,167
Coronavirus

1403
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,215
Giant developments on

1404
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:39,615
It is deadly to some and it is spreading

1405
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
That is engineer

1406
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,479
Call donnisha Jackson

1407
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:49,599
That's not confirmed confirmed by who are the confirmation is that self retracted study

1408
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:54,463
Ivetta Alex saw the udon

1409
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:59,583
It is now but it's become a part of Alex's rhetoric and a touchstone and a talking point

1410
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,143
So it shall never be never

1411
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:05,215
Never check in on any that's the confirmation that Alex has

1412
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,239
And now in the

1413
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,799
Canon of Infowars information

1414
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,359
True Vine

1415
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,431
So is the word I would use

1416
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:18,527
So this episode also was very heavy on food sales like he's pushing

1417
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
S*** hard

1418
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,599
Cuz I think he recognizes that it's work

1419
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,623
Yeah there's a chance

1420
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:28,511
I've got the statement here for my favorite Supply when you're in Fort Worth

1421
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,071
Camuy bar the money offender operation

1422
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,887
It shipped out the very same time they're going our computer system

1423
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Decade

1424
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,871
Now it's 10 to 14

1425
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,663
High-dollar it 7-0

1426
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,991
Orders are so high and everything's going so crazy

1427
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,575
Today

1428
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:58,975
10 to 14 days or so high Alex is recognizing I believe

1429
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,743
Energy is working

1430
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:01,791
Increase

1431
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:05,375
In the orders that are coming in for the food based on what

1432
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,655
Able to

1433
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,959
Salad always able to sell it

1434
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
It is ironic

1435
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,311
How much he Israel dagg

1436
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,615
That in some ways

1437
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,151
China is now saving

1438
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:22,783
Business nap that is a cruel cruel University 11

1439
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,111
So when a man like a

1440
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,135
You know he works

1441
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,159
With my Patriot

1442
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,439
Supply and what are you doing

1443
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975
The only good food

1444
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,279
Is it weird that is that's what

1445
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,047
B design

1446
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,655
Great

1447
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
That deliver when they say

1448
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,335
It's about industry

1449
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
Sad episode of luscious the truth

1450
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:54,271
Is it breaks his heart to have to say that his

1451
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,855
Competitors are not good breaks his heart

1452
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,879
He what

1453
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,951
Genuine competition Daddy

1454
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,719
Each business

1455
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,999
It's too tight

1456
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:10,399
That otherwise they would never it's like those before the free-market Djokovic and Federer

1457
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,447
I work for all three of them they wouldn't have read

1458
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,263
The heights that they have reserved salute

1459
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,847
I have bad news tennis is a bad business

1460
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,615
Goddamnit

1461
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,455
You like Rafa only good time to plant

1462
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,247
Who is just

1463
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
It is strange

1464
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,295
Strange

1465
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,855
So he wants to get the calls but he doesn't

1466
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,879
Because he

1467
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,415
Wants to do more

1468
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,487
Is really use these narratives that he's built up

1469
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,511
How to sell things

1470
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,071
You really going hard to sales cuz of course

1471
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,351
That's why

1472
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:45,727
But it hurt that he went on vacation I wiped out on a plane to come back and sooner

1473
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,055
Strike while the iron

1474
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,871
1000% 101

1475
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,407
Towing trucks

1476
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,943
Leave him

1477
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:59,039
Heather selling out of food what is Coronavirus and the 20/20 at all the craziness

1478
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:02,111
Pop stock market

1479
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:05,439
They are going to be very very serious

1480
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,719
Portal Chell.

1481
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,999
I think that is a perfect

1482
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:12,095
Very distilled down example

1483
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,399
Tudor drive people towards

1484
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
The sales that he wants to

1485
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,311
I mean there's a large chunk there he's talking about the

1486
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,591
Can I get back to

1487
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,407
To the silver and I think we're entering into like

1488
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,991
Really Mia out application

1489
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,271
Super unethical

1490
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,831
And I do think that he is at great

1491
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:35,135
Yeah I think

1492
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,951
I would love to talk to somebody from like the FDA

1493
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:40,767
I'm feel like a

1494
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,839
It's though

1495
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:50,239
That's true I have lived my life via the no snitching rule difficult to go against the grain

1496
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:56,639
No yeah it feels like it would be an interface like I feel like it would also be interfering with Alex's world to an extent that I'm on

1497
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:00,735
Regular I were to put in motion something that ends up getting

1498
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,271
$1000000

1499
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:06,879
I feel like that would be interfering with his world and then me covering

1500
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:09,951
Him dealing with the consequences

1501
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,767
Are you mean the apotheosis of your career

1502
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:15,071
I can't bring myself to

1503
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:19,167
Get to that point where is the line is

1504
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,727
Well it's

1505
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,775
Terrible that we don't have any lawyers who listen

1506
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,383
Supplement regulation lawyers

1507
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
But I don't know

1508
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,711
The big bottle of immune gargle

1509
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,991
It has been patented

1510
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,271
Nano silver in it

1511
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,831
Show me just saying

1512
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:45,023
Go to l.a. confidential

1513
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,375
From the commissioner of Food and Drug Administration

1514
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,703
You've also got the head of Homeland Security in here

1515
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,543
Confidential documents

1516
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,335
Do we have in Super Silver

1517
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:02,175
Silver whitening toothpaste

1518
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:08,319
We are original products

1519
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,391
Company

1520
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,671
Ladies and gentlemen

1521
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
When Alex

1522
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:19,839
Splashed up on the screen the document that he's talking about if you look at it's just about the silver

1523
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:22,143
Is just about the wound

1524
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,447
So whatever he's trying

1525
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,727
To use to apply to

1526
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,751
These other products

1527
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,031
Does not apply

1528
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,311
It might as well be a receipt

1529
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,079
From Bed Bath &

1530
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,663
He has a responsibility to not act

1531
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,503
Because these even these Secret

1532
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,783
Whatever

1533
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,807
But he's reporting

1534
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
To be the basis

1535
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,343
Is this

1536
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,367
Claims

1537
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,647
These reasons anyway she

1538
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,415
Somebody's making

1539
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,183
Arnot

1540
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,743
About the gargle and not about the tooth

1541
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,095
Directly about the dajjal

1542
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:55,423
And I don't know I have a hunch that this is not

1543
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,007
I'm I'm always amazed when people buy

1544
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
Toothpaste

1545
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,823
That are

1546
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:08,991
Infused with something odd like that used to sell like radiated toothpaste it'll be like

1547
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:11,551
It makes your teeth glow-in-the-dark and I'd like

1548
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,855
No I don't want any of that

1549
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,415
Basic toothpaste

1550
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,231
What are you up to on a stick then

1551
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,511
Used to do it

1552
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,839
So Alex gets back to listening to Trump speech

1553
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
It still going on

1554
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,631
And

1555
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,399
I think he starts

1556
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,935
A little bit

1557
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,959
Because it's not his

1558
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,751
Aggressive and violent as he wants

1559
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,519
Said to be

1560
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,799
EXO he makes

1561
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,103
A really big declaration

1562
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,431
The Democrats work for foreign multinational government

1563
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,039
Their party has to end

1564
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,599
Republican party has to break into

1565
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,695
European model of 10 different party

1566
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,463
Party cuz

1567
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:55,327
Buy out the other parties

1568
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:58,143
Body system is the best that's not perfect

1569
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,447
So it's worth noting that one of those Jake

1570
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:04,799
Atlantic Hallmarks of authoritarians or Shoring up their powers outlawing their opposition

1571
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,079
Compari's

1572
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,639
This is a it's not a shocking

1573
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
Think that's okay

1574
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:10,943
Consistent

1575
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:16,319
So when you see people suggesting that the political party that they're against needs to be destroyed or outlawed

1576
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:20,415
The fuk up that they're in the beginning or middle stages of supporting

1577
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,439
Democratic

1578
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,231
Authoritarian form of government

1579
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:27,071
Which I was absolutely is and that's why he identifies with Darth Vader in the Empire

1580
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:29,375
It's a huge thing also too

1581
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,167
Blame your enemies

1582
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,727
Word for word for ship that you are

1583
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,007
Word for word guilt

1584
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:35,775
Maybe

1585
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,823
Also how stupid is is playing

1586
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,127
He sang the GOP should split in

1587
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:44,735
The two-party and then that will be the new two-party system because the Democrats are all

1588
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Evil global

1589
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,039
Butterfly

1590
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,063
This plan is that a lie

1591
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,903
Also thinks that a lot of Republicans namely the ones who don't worship Trump

1592
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,927
Are evil global

1593
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,207
Well it makes sense

1594
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,511
Because what you do then is now that you've

1595
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:01,375
Split into the two party system once more you have the hard right and then you have the middle right

1596
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,399
And guess what

1597
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,191
The middle right

1598
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:09,055
Neocons also work for foreign governments are also corrupt it's at

1599
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,871
We got to get rid of that party to split our Hardware

1600
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,407
Play into the two party system

1601
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,431
Thanks

1602
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:19,807
The split would end up being Trump fetish community on one side and then on Trump lovers on the other

1603
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,879
I'm just like you said we're exactly back where we started

1604
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:26,463
Without accusing the side that he's not on of being the globalist

1605
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,999
Racket that needs to be destroyed

1606
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:32,607
There's no polite political disagreement that's really possible in Alex's world because

1607
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,399
He believes his enemies are

1608
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,679
Literal demon

1609
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,447
Arizona

1610
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,751
No matter how many parties there are how big

1611
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,055
He created all the ones he's not in will need

1612
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,079
Need to be destroyed

1613
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:45,663
Alex wants loyal symbolic opposition

1614
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,967
He wants his Trump dictatorship

1615
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,015
Control like 85% of the

1616
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,807
Then a different Republican Party

1617
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
Need to be the other

1618
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
10%

1619
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,647
Completely incapable of doing anything

1620
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,207
Providing the appearance of some kind of democracy

1621
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,791
That's more or less what he's expressed Crazy Eights

1622
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,583
Blake the first time we've ever seen any

1623
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
Anything like this

1624
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:07,679
The really unusual thing for a chakra

1625
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:14,335
To do you would think a student of History like Alex Jones be aware of the kind of things that he's advancing as he's ideal

1626
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:19,199
You welcome does seem like this has happened before and since he has red

1627
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,015
So much history you know he would know about

1628
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:30,975
Certainly not a book a bad with the Nazis to political party

1629
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,767
Great well you think

1630
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,815
I think the Nazis of the bad guy and then you realized

1631
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,887
The Stormtroopers are based on the Nazis which means emperor

1632
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,191
Team is based on Hitler and all the sudden you love Hitler

1633
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:41,983
So

1634
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:42,751
Interesting

1635
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,823
Alex it like it's not a stray thought

1636
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,615
This becomes a theme

1637
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
For the rest of the episode

1638
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,407
So talked about

1639
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:52,479
Need to outlaw the Democratic Party

1640
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,783
Applicants party

1641
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,575
Party's poll numbers end

1642
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:01,695
Donald Trump's poll numbers are the highest I've ever had that

1643
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,679
Because from my family standpoint

1644
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:14,751
It's been very unfair

1645
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,287
Organization

1646
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,551
He's calling for Trump

1647
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,367
To Outlaw the Democratic Party

1648
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,903
This

1649
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,719
There has been a series of red flags

1650
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,791
What Alex Jones wants

1651
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,351
There could not be a larger

1652
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,655
Easy buzzard

1653
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:47,519
The reddest of flags

1654
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:52,383
Alex wants a dictatorship here Alex Watson authoritarian regime

1655
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,455
Surrounding his incompetent Weird Al

1656
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:58,527
I do feel a little bit like a mundane That Tune

1657
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:02,367
Edward two words into it and I hit the buzzer in like autocratic rule

1658
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
Autocratic rule

1659
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,927
This is really easy

1660
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,999
How long your political opposition

1661
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:13,375
I mean even like Trump coming to power with you lock her up in the idea of jailing your political opposition

1662
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,423
That's the nation

1663
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,823
Form of the weasel around with like I sincerely believe that Hillary Clinton has committed all these crime

1664
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:25,151
Absolutely that's sort of like a

1665
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,687
Hey you sound a bit

1666
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:29,247
Like an authoritarian trying to shore up our

1667
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
Are you can

1668
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
Trying to get around

1669
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,831
Outlawing

1670
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:36,671
Your only viable political opponent party

1671
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,743
I think I think you've gone way past

1672
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:42,047
Radical state

1673
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,863
What's the definition of radical state

1674
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,423
From a legal basis when Trump leaves office

1675
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,191
Switch

1676
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,239
50/50 shot at this point

1677
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,799
He should go to jail

1678
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,591
Like there's no other

1679
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,615
Whether or not

1680
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,407
You care about party affiliation

1681
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,943
Committed the crime

1682
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,223
Necessary

1683
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:00,991
Anita's alone

1684
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,527
Pattern of committing the crime

1685
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:05,087
And he's going to continue to commit the crimes even after

1686
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,111
You know as long as

1687
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,159
So it's not a political

1688
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,951
Statement to say he needs to go in

1689
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:14,047
It was like probably what

1690
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,327
If Trump were to

1691
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:19,423
To be any trouble after leaving office who would be something

1692
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
To be Beyond

1693
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:25,055
The scale of our Justice

1694
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,591
The UN

1695
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,663
Image of Justified

1696
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:32,735
The Hague is going to be in real trouble

1697
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
Situation

1698
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:38,111
Trump starts rambling telling stories about Steve scalise playing baseball

1699
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,719
Not what I wanted

1700
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:44,767
I wanted to fire and brimstone

1701
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:47,839
Speech for Trump is going to come out and say the globalist are fuc

1702
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:51,423
Right I beat this impeachment right you guys are going to pay

1703
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:57,823
He said bulshit man starts talking about Steve scalise playing baseball

1704
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:01,919
And the first picture you sent is second base and the guy is really in bad shape

1705
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,223
This is terrible

1706
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,807
Round ball shot

1707
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,719
I think too much

1708
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,047
Well it's going toward him

1709
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,119
Stop that

1710
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,655
Constable

1711
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:27,263
He's now laying down

1712
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:34,431
What is the most incredible thing I've never seen

1713
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:43,391
Not this demonized creature thus the strawman

1714
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:46,975
I think Alex is partially right when he says the Trump U Van Nuys

1715
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,255
People who need to be more

1716
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:55,423
By standing next to them they are more human than Trump

1717
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,031
Noises really bad yeah it does seem like

1718
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:06,943
Like like what are you going to say Alexandria ocasio-cortez

1719
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,759
Sure will give you that one Rashida tlaib

1720
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:16,159
It will give you a good statements whenever

1721
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,463
Previous how many civil rights leaders

1722
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,487
Is a diabetic

1723
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,767
Oh my God yeah

1724
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,351
It says that humanizes people 8

1725
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:28,447
Things like this are Steve scalise Who Sold himself as David Duke without the baggage

1726
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,239
Yeah this guy

1727
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:34,335
There's good people on both sides at Charlottesville through unite the right rally

1728
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:37,407
Humanizing people who are

1729
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:44,063
Not great Among Us hasn't wanted a commitment actually by ass crack

1730
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:46,367
I should be clear I don't mean wipe

1731
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:49,695
People as a whole I mean people who have

1732
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,719
Some way

1733
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,023
Some people who are not

1734
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,047
Good

1735
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,095
I will say that he probably wouldn't

1736
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,119
Try and human eyes

1737
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:00,703
He would I think he would probably leave that white person

1738
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,495
Not a dude call you

1739
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,615
So anyway Trump gets to talk about how he thinks that's

1740
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,895
Elise is awesome

1741
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,943
Steven he is fantastic

1742
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,735
You are fantastic

1743
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,271
You and Liz

1744
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,063
I don't know who this is

1745
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,623
Is wife is named Jennifer

1746
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,671
His kids are named

1747
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,231
I have no idea what he's talking about

1748
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,279
Like I looked into it because there was a

1749
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,303
Female

1750
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:31,167
Secure a capitol police officer was also injured

1751
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,447
She's not

1752
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,519
To talk I don't know

1753
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,543
Vicky forgot Steve scalise

1754
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,823
His wife's name is.

1755
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,615
That's what I

1756
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,383
I'm suspicious

1757
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:43,711
Yeah when we're talking about conspiracy theories let's go with Trump

1758
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,735
Read

1759
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,551
So Alex is hearing all this talk about scalise

1760
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,367
I think he's getting

1761
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,135
Sick of these

1762
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,159
Nice words

1763
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,183
Like he's really starting to

1764
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:59,839
Pissed off

1765
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,679
Seymour tax

1766
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:07,007
Said some of that

1767
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:09,823
So I just too much nice talk

1768
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,591
I want

1769
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,359
Him too

1770
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,383
Gocube

1771
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:16,223
I want him to release these sealed indictments I want to do a tack

1772
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,015
But I will prosecute bulshit

1773
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,087
Yeah yeah now that he's free of all of this s***

1774
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,623
It's time for him to

1775
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,415
Consolidate his power base

1776
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,487
Disband the entire Democratic Party

1777
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,511
I assume

1778
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:32,095
Very least hang your Nancy Pelosi in effigy

1779
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,631
And White House

1780
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:38,751
Nap so I made for that it then that is exactly what he is he's on he's hyperfixated

1781
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:42,335
Eliminating Democratic Party

1782
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,871
I don't want him.

1783
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,663
Hey big bring the country together

1784
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,943
F*** no

1785
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,247
Shouldn't be together half the country should be

1786
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,015
Gone

1787
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,783
And

1788
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:54,623
The people who vote for democrats should be forced to vote for

1789
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,183
Other Republican

1790
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:00,767
They should be forced to vote for republicans

1791
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,303
B words

1792
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:06,399
They should have their political party outlawed

1793
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:11,519
You know what we need we need a new Republican party and I know just who should lead it Pete buttegeig

1794
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,799
Wine I mean

1795
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,200
What's the Democratic party of course of course

1796
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,952
Now how do we do that

1797
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,048
The country shouldn't exist

1798
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,632
Enemy operation

1799
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:41,216
So he's just really on this tip like I don't know where it's

1800
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,776
Coming from

1801
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,384
Call him going on these ramps so consistently this

1802
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,176
Hitting this point so hard

1803
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,272
It's weird not a good sign

1804
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,552
I really do think we're getting

1805
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,576
We're getting

1806
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,600
The point where he's

1807
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,184
What is

1808
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:07,328
Destroying the Democratic really passed the point where he was

1809
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,352
Exploiting this

1810
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,376
Autocratic

1811
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,656
Kind of b*******

1812
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,424
Thinking

1813
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,496
Okay well yeah I know Trump's mobbed-up

1814
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,776
I see now he's got all the

1815
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,080
White aggrievement yet

1816
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,872
This is perfect for my bass

1817
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,152
We're going to ride this out

1818
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,968
And then he just forgot that he was

1819
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:24,992
Lying

1820
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,856
It's possible it's hard to know what goes on within the hearts of man

1821
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,648
William Shakespeare

1822
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,464
Alex Goes To Break

1823
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,744
And he comes back

1824
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,280
Anybody heard like a voice

1825
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,608
Owen Shroyer is now in Studio City

1826
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,400
And being ineffectual

1827
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,008
But it's not The Highwayman

1828
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,592
You're not allowed

1829
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:54,688
You're not allowed to even hear giant James Brown

1830
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,760
I got it

1831
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:30,528
Got to move tells me what to do or do not

1832
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,600
He thinks the songs about the Holy Spirit

1833
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,160
Also James Brown

1834
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:40,000
Get on the scene like a sex machine also about the Holy Spirit

1835
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,560
James Brown funky drummer

1836
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,400
That's it because all jumpers

1837
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,680
All drummers have the Holy

1838
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,008
Lest you think of that

1839
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:56,896
Sing along with I got soul Superbad if you think I put him in a good mood

1840
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,176
No

1841
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:02,272
It did not

1842
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,088
Complaining about the Democratic party and how they got to go

1843
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:11,744
Feeling nice about the people Democrats so long

1844
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,328
Where you put up with this so long

1845
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,608
In the Democrats

1846
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,632
Like

1847
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,912
What about

1848
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:24,800
Wasn't it just a few years ago the Alex was above the political George W bush

1849
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:31,456
Really should have just dispatched of the democratic party that makes sense he's Goin ideologically

1850
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:35,552
For so long it's been about like a the whole left right Paradigm is all an illusion

1851
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,600
They're all the same

1852
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,160
But now you see me put up with this for so long

1853
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,696
The Democrats

1854
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:47,584
The saint you were secretly Republican all along cuz that's what everyone said I'm like

1855
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,376
Where were we

1856
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,168
Because we figured this out a long time

1857
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:51,936
Time I go pee

1858
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,728
His Paradigm is not the left

1859
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,776
A paradigm

1860
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,080
I mean that's where we're that's where we're at

1861
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,408
It's the

1862
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,200
Classes of

1863
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,224
Person

1864
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,248
He is

1865
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
Against

1866
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,040
The other

1867
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,064
Yep it's cuz

1868
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,344
Christian is so important

1869
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,392
Mail

1870
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,672
Cisgender

1871
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,952
All of these

1872
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:17,024
Heterosexual all of these identifiers

1873
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,840
That's what's so important

1874
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,376
Not the

1875
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,680
Necessarily the Democrat or Republican

1876
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,216
But now he's ready

1877
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,264
Recognize that his coat on coat Patriot

1878
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,056
Folk the Liberty

1879
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,872
Folk have taken over the Republican Party

1880
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,640
So now it is

1881
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:34,944
Well it's not

1882
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,224
Because there should be two or five

1883
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
Sure

1884
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:39,296
God he's so stupid does he not even

1885
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,832
When you say

1886
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,624
Get rid of my political enemies

1887
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:45,696
And then let's take my political friends and split them in

1888
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,768
Dwayne based on whether or not they worship Trump

1889
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,536
Ball sack

1890
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,072
And then guess what

1891
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,864
They're the new f****** global

1892
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:57,472
We just do it over and over and over again based on instead of

1893
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:03,104
Oh oh evangelicos now it so you're not my type of Evangelical you're a megachurch

1894
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,664
Guess what you're out of the Republican Party

1895
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,688
Like it's f******

1896
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:10,016
An obvious this is the mentality

1897
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,808
Alex is

1898
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,928
Just a part of I get it always ends up this way

1899
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,696
Some more division

1900
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:22,048
So Alex and his next start taking some

1901
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:24,352
Calls and you get to caller who is

1902
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,376
He's trying to

1903
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,656
Give alok

1904
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,704
It's proof that a major coins

1905
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,752
Dean of the United States is about to happen

1906
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,544
And the proof that he provides

1907
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,080
I think he's been

1908
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:37,408
Big prepper incoming outbreak repeat what you were saying that they have

1909
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,968
You're watching this around the country. It's not a hoe

1910
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,064
What

1911
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,112
Directions back

1912
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,136
In the Bay Area and

1913
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,720
Doing a emergency

1914
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:51,488
Job fair

1915
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,792
Drivers

1916
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,912
Normally you wouldn't think anything of that

1917
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,496
Because of what's going on with the Coronavirus

1918
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,264
Virus

1919
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,312
You know they know what

1920
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,104
This is what

1921
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,152
Or maybe not

1922
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,176
I don't know

1923
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:12,992
That's not proof of anything normally you wouldn't think that's

1924
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:13,760
Suspicious

1925
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,064
And I will go.

1926
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:19,648
This weekend there were multiple job fairs

1927
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:25,536
Preferred CDL for specific Fields some of them are in the healthcare field subwoofer

1928
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:30,144
School bus drivers

1929
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:31,936
I mean is it

1930
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
Nonsense

1931
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:40,384
You know he jumps off from this and tries to justify why he believes that this outbreak is the real deal

1932
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,176
As opposed to in the past

1933
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,456
When it was all

1934
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,784
Even though in the past you said it was like

1935
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,832
Yeah Rio but the globalist

1936
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,856
Doing it

1937
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,648
I don't know it's weird

1938
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,440
Is nonspecific

1939
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,256
Terms that he uses around like what's real and what's fake

1940
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,280
It's also

1941
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,816
Indecipherable

1942
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,096
To the point of not mattering

1943
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,680
Real and very bad

1944
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,728
Well it will be eventually

1945
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:10,592
Normal because they're not hyping it but the real ground-level a

1946
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
Phineas

1947
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,384
Prices

1948
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,456
Not hyping it but I'd like to see the world

1949
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:16,992
What is that

1950
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,320
Coming out showing all sorts of people at checkpoint

1951
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,392
Piles of dead bodies in body bags

1952
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,184
Where was this is much bigger

1953
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:29,792
Like I said Alex is no precise definition of what he means by the globalist

1954
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,816
Was typing something

1955
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:34,656
That's such a nonspecific idea that you can just throw it around however you like

1956
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:41,056
Even if the World Health Organization and the media are covering this outbreak you can say that they're not hyping it enough cuz they're not saying

1957
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,080
Things like

1958
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,616
It's over for Humanity

1959
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,408
Only be Lone Survivor

1960
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:52,320
They're not there you know they're not hyping it if they hired Flavor Flav then we're golden there then there's no

1961
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,088
Complained about height

1962
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:56,928
They're not hyping it be like my friend the health Ranger

1963
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:02,816
Does he was the same time treating it like it's a very big deal

1964
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,376
Lourdes manipulation tax

1965
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
To justify the

1966
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,168
Conclusion

1967
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,960
But Alex is already operating

1968
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:15,104
And that conclusion is that this is a civilization level threat which is actually a bioweapon deployed by the globalist

1969
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,640
You should be very scared of it

1970
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:19,456
And the only solution is buying all of the products of Alex cell

1971
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,504
That's legitimately the entire game

1972
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:26,624
So the stories that he's talking about that woman being shot at a checkpoint is based on an uncanny

1973
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,416
Confirm video someone tweeted

1974
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,440
I have no idea if

1975
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:32,512
It's real or not and that it's not even a video of her being shot

1976
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,560
Just someone on the ground who appears to have

1977
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,328
Benshot

1978
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:41,216
I have no idea if it's real and the last few times coronavirus season of Alex's show

1979
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:42,240
I've seen things being

1980
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,032
Posted that are very old videos

1981
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,568
The people are recirculating

1982
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
Claiming to be current

1983
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,128
I don't know what that's

1984
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,664
The case here and neither does Alec

1985
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:53,248
He doesn't care to know because assuming it's real and current helps

1986
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,272
Sell the fear that

1987
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,296
Casella's Prada

1988
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:56,832
Someone being told

1989
01:28:57,088 --> 01:29:02,464
Stay in their home if they're sick isn't really a bizarre story so I don't really know how that's being presented as some kind of

1990
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,256
Yeah not sure what the angle is

1991
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:06,304
Yeah if Alex points to a video of

1992
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,584
Getting shot and

1993
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,144
Current I want to f****** newspaper

1994
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,472
For in that video otherwise I assumed it was from

1995
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,008
12 years ago and it

1996
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,800
It's whatever is good

1997
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:22,432
I agree just saying that that the applicability

1998
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:27,040
Stuff about that like crematoriums in body bags all stuff Alex's reporting

1999
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,856
Michael Snyder's economic collapse blog

2000
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,648
Which was I recently pushing

2001
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,696
Can the chicken vaccine patent narrative

2002
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,256
Along with other memebase outbreak conspiracy

2003
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,584
All the stuff that's on this site is a site

2004
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,888
It's based on the same sort of Evan

2005
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,424
Alleged photos in

2006
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,704
Possibly out of context

2007
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,496
Quotes from people like in the

2008
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:47,520
The epoch times

2009
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:50,080
None of this Rises to the level of solid reporting

2010
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,104
Best as I can tell

2011
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:55,456
It's really hard to get solid information about this situation but that's not an excuse.

2012
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,248
The traffic in here say in speculation

2013
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:02,624
The main reason why you're seeing this type of reporting out of all of these right-wing blogs and website

2014
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,672
Is because they have very low standard

2015
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,208
It's for what they accept as proven

2016
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:08,768
And they cultivated audiences that don't care if they're caught

2017
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,328
Clear on this point also there also

2018
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,096
Food apparel

2019
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,888
Probably a lot of them are

2020
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,424
A lot of them are

2021
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,216
So I don't know Alex

2022
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:20,544
Say all this stuff about like it's obviously way worse

2023
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,592
Because I've seen all these things

2024
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:26,944
Some of them are memes and some of them are absolutely

2025
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:32,064
Old videos being recirculated and being repurposed as about

2026
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,344
The Coronavirus

2027
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,184
Some of them are stories like the chicken vaccine patent that Alex still

2028
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,488
Thinks is real

2029
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:41,280
And there are things that are in

2030
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,048
Anecdotal

2031
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,328
Like if you see a

2032
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,352
Picture of

2033
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,632
Someplace that has

2034
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,168
Two body bags in it

2035
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:50,240
You in your mind assume

2036
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,520
It must be a lot more

2037
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:54,592
Where is it could just be two people died in this Hospital

2038
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:58,176
Get run on anecdotal stuff

2039
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:00,480
In terms of assessing the scale or scope of them

2040
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:01,760
And Alex

2041
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,296
Does cut 215

2042
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,064
Years from now

2043
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:08,416
We would like to welcome our new director of the World Health org

2044
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,464
Carpe donktum

2045
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,488
Better choice

2046
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:14,560
So Alex starts

2047
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,840
Can hear about how

2048
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:20,704
Tuttle-Click earlier Alex was ranting about how when Trump

2049
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,728
Call Tim

2050
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,264
She doesn't

2051
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:29,408
I don't need recognition I don't need you to Pat me on the head I just want you to do

2052
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,200
Globalization

2053
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:33,248
Mirrors that

2054
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,272
I'm here

2055
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:38,112
What does the average person just wants recognition

2056
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:44,768
Metal or at least that's what Trump thinks that's not why they really did it

2057
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:47,328
Embarrassing to get those models

2058
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:49,632
Three of these people because I know they're evil

2059
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:53,472
Play my soul in my will and I'm fighting against that

2060
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,752
I think that's about Rush

2061
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,824
I think about Rush Limbaugh

2062
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:01,408
I I didn't get a medal Rush got a medal all he did was get

2063
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,200
Answer I can get cancer

2064
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,224
I think

2065
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,808
I'm not motivated by that

2066
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,856
Even though farison for most people

2067
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:13,440
Battles after we after we listen to the Piers Morgan

2068
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,720
Follow up

2069
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,488
Put the Gun Shop

2070
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,512
Where is like

2071
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:23,168
Hey how are you we had

2072
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:30,336
Yeah I went there and I confronted him

2073
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,104
I don't know

2074
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,384
F*** off

2075
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:37,504
Talking about how like you really it is all just about

2076
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,528
Defeating the globalist

2077
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,296
For him

2078
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,088
Consistent about

2079
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:42,624
That it was though some people have

2080
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,560
All the presidents

2081
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:53,120
Cuz I'm like you cannot trust

2082
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,656
The people you brought in

2083
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,728
Conversations all the time

2084
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,520
Like what

2085
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:04,640
Talk bad about John Bolton you know I've had a lot of drinks with him and play poker with a man

2086
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:07,200
That's definitely Rodger Stone

2087
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,248
Absolutely Rodger Stone

2088
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,272
I said listen

2089
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,808
He's against everybody stopped

2090
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,344
Thinking that later is approved

2091
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:18,720
President of all these enemies around know you did

2092
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:24,096
No you did not not even a little believer hydrostone 100%

2093
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:29,472
Every single word rogerstone whispered in your ear

2094
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,240
Rat f******

2095
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,520
Can you like a monster

2096
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,800
A******

2097
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,872
So they're sitting along

2098
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,920
Not contributing too much

2099
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:40,224
But

2100
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,504
According to his ability

2101
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:45,088
Sherp Alex I want some

2102
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:47,136
Culture issues at Hammond

2103
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,928
Owens got an interesting

2104
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,976
Take on why culture

2105
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:51,744
Was better

2106
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:55,072
In the past your eyes

2107
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:57,120
What is this nobody likes this

2108
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,168
Course nobody likes it

2109
01:33:59,424 --> 01:33:59,936
What you want

2110
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:00,704
About

2111
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,008
Groening that in

2112
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:06,592
Children's mind

2113
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:09,408
Growing up seeing the Clint Eastwood's or not growing

2114
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,176
Elvis

2115
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,224
Bradley's not growing up seeing the John Wayne

2116
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:15,040
They're growing up saying Nas in a

2117
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,576
Female Cowboy outfit

2118
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,160
He's not talk about.

2119
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
What are those

2120
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:27,840
3 old-time Role Models have in common they were all dead before Owen Shroyer with ever born

2121
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:30,656
Rhizome identifying

2122
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:35,776
Are there careers where at least some identifying characteristics

2123
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:36,800
So you got

2124
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
Clint Eastwood

2125
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,640
We've got Elvis Presley Elvis Presley

2126
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,432
John Wayne John Wayne

2127
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,480
Well

2128
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:47,296
One of them was gay

2129
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:52,672
The other ones still allows music from black people and then Clint Eastwood

2130
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:55,488
Talk to a chair I think we're good alright

2131
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,816
Something something tonight

2132
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,352
I'm not sure what it is

2133
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:04,192
Alex sells the silver war

2134
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:08,032
Since the last time we talked about this

2135
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,336
I got blasted we talk on this episode

2136
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,384
Male couple episodes Bancos mention

2137
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,944
Weird about this

2138
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,224
It's evolving

2139
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,832
Only authorized to do this week and a half ago

2140
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,696
Damn this

2141
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,512
Texas A&M University Health System

2142
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,048
This is

2143
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,352
Again confidential

2144
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,424
Security

2145
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,872
That they're looking at this US Department of army

2146
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,432
Operations Command

2147
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:52,064
The address

2148
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:57,952
And others

2149
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,720
I found

2150
01:35:58,976 --> 01:35:59,488
That

2151
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,024
The American biotech

2152
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,304
Labs LLC

2153
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,864
Nano silver has been founded

2154
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,656
Bashar's

2155
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:09,728
Saturday night at times 2007

2156
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,520
The coronavirus is in the hole

2157
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,288
SARS

2158
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:15,616
The antecedent of the Cumberland progenitor

2159
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,664
Know how that works

2160
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,712
Stop stuff we shall bring to you

2161
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,784
Michelle Burcham our research pal.

2162
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,320
This is your what

2163
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,088
Stop you're going to fight

2164
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,136
Infowars store

2165
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:31,488
I think he might be flying too close to the Sun

2166
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,536
That was pretty blatant because

2167
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:37,888
The documents

2168
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:40,192
It was not them saying

2169
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:42,240
The nano silver has been proven

2170
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,264
Product

2171
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,800
The gel had been

2172
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:45,824
You can't

2173
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:49,920
Supply claims just because they have the same ingredients

2174
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:50,688
In it

2175
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,736
Because the ingredients at different levels

2176
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,528
It's formulated different

2177
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:57,088
It's taking up in different parts of the body

2178
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:57,856
Might not

2179
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:01,440
Be according to the FDA according to trial

2180
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:07,584
Clinical trials it might not be internally effective it might only be topically effective

2181
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,120
Can't play this game

2182
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,912
It's a game Alex is playing

2183
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
Very clear

2184
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,472
I don't know we'll see what happens

2185
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,240
If you can

2186
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,032
The

2187
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,312
Nano silver

2188
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
Just

2189
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,104
Just start

2190
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,432
Eaton silver dollars that's not 100% silver probably won't

2191
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,456
Hell yeah you might pass

2192
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:27,296
Some date knowledge fight does not stand behind these medical plans

2193
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:31,904
So one of the phenomena that I see a lot is Alex

2194
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:36,768
Start going down some Road and then you'll see his callers mirror

2195
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,816
Often times it takes a couple of days

2196
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,096
When he starts doing some

2197
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:40,864
Something weird

2198
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,912
A college be like that you know what I like

2199
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:43,936
Who's case

2200
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:44,960
2 seconds

2201
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,728
It's pretty quick

2202
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,336
Like any self-respecting

2203
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,640
Game on

2204
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,712
So you see callers

2205
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,992
Calling in

2206
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:57,760
Sing

2207
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:03,136
I mean obviously he's using a metaphor he's not saying that something the Democrats

2208
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:05,440
Step on their throats and fire into their

2209
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:10,048
You should finish the job he's mirroring Alex's desire to see the elimination and

2210
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:13,120
Outlawing in banishing of the Democratic Party

2211
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,400
So

2212
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:17,472
Ucihs very it's very fast Alex's pushing

2213
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:19,264
Pretty hard on this episode

2214
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,568
Hear it and get it

2215
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,104
Now it's okay

2216
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:27,456
He's also has Owen Shroyer sitting in studio and he's got to guess

2217
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,504
I feel a little weird about that

2218
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:36,160
Tell Deanna Lorraine

2219
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:40,256
Awesome

2220
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:44,096
Bose that monster is just a moment

2221
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:48,192
So this candidate is running against Nancy Pelosi apparently as

2222
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,728
Is pretty much guarantee that she's

2223
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:50,752
He's not going to win

2224
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,288
Infowars

2225
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,312
This is not a good tactic

2226
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,336
Decision on her part

2227
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,128
What's a good way to get some attention

2228
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:56,896
In specific

2229
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:58,688
The community

2230
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,016
I don't know much about

2231
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,552
Deanna Lorraine

2232
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:09,440
But I do know the people have been gunning for the female Congress members in California for quite awhile namely dance

2233
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,208
Lowe's Yuma

2234
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:10,976
Maxine Waters

2235
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:15,840
What are people who is doing so is Omar Navarro who used to come on in for the bucks

2236
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,120
Talk about how he was going to be

2237
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,144
Beat Maxine Waters

2238
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,680
Which you never succeeded in doing

2239
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,472
And he's never going to

2240
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:26,336
Because Omar Navarro is currently in custody facing multiple charges for stalking his ex-girlfriend

2241
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,872
Who put out restraining order

2242
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:32,480
His ex-girlfriend is Diana Lorraine

2243
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:39,648
Obviously I am I a thighs with her for what she had to do endure the abuse that was subjected to her by

2244
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,416
Navarro

2245
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,696
None of that is her fault

2246
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:42,720
Now it's just

2247
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:46,560
Interesting to see her going the exact same route that Navarro did

2248
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:47,328
Politically

2249
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,352
She's running

2250
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,168
Sweetly Doom campaign against a long time

2251
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,704
Congressperson in California

2252
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,728
And promoting

2253
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:54,752
Herself on Infowars

2254
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,520
Which seems weird

2255
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,824
You can't possibly expect to win

2256
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,616
For the best I can tell it's got to be

2257
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,640
Some sort of

2258
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:03,968
Publicity stunt

2259
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,760
It might be a cash grab

2260
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:08,064
Maybe she learned that from Omar Navarro

2261
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,624
Talking about Navarro to The Daily Beast

2262
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,184
Lorraine said quote

2263
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:15,744
I think a lot of this power has gotten to his

2264
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,560
He has a lot of money now from campaign

2265
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,608
I think there's a

2266
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:22,400
The entire possibility that

2267
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:25,472
You recognize you run a doom campaign where you trying

2268
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,520
Yeah you try and get a little bit of mud

2269
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,288
Thrown on

2270
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:33,664
The arrivals of big political donors on the right we're going to fund you even though you know

2271
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,944
Didn't know you're going to lose

2272
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,712
It's

2273
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:41,344
Get a lot of money that way and the only way you get indicted for campaign finances of uses if

2274
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,392
If you make too much money or you ask

2275
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:44,416
Accidentally win

2276
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,464
Like I that dumb assholes Vaped

2277
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,512
Vapor

2278
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:53,120
I don't know it's really complicated for me because I obviously don't think

2279
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:55,680
That any of the negative

2280
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,704
Aspects

2281
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,032
Association with Omar Navarro are her fault

2282
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,360
Point the finger at her for that

2283
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,152
Jesus said assholes

2284
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:09,504
I just think it's fascinating that

2285
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,320
Both sides that equation are running against

2286
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,856
California

2287
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:16,160
Democratic Congress people

2288
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:19,744
And they both choose to promote themselves

2289
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,304
You get a grip you find the Griff

2290
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,584
And you keep it going

2291
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,376
That's the simple that's

2292
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,144
Simple tactic

2293
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:26,912
It's very strong

2294
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,960
I don't really know how to handle it

2295
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,240
Honestly

2296
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,776
I've start running against

2297
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:33,568
Candidates

2298
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,848
Warren Nancy Pelosi

2299
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,688
So Alex has Lorraine on and they talk

2300
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,736
A bit about how she's going to be

2301
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:41,760
Nancy Pelosi

2302
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:42,784
She's not

2303
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,576
Not a chance

2304
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,344
Nope

2305
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,880
I'm not saying it's someone

2306
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:49,440
Couldn't but it's not a Republican

2307
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:51,232
No it's not her

2308
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:53,792
I8

2309
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,560
Ic0

2310
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,120
So they talked about that a little bit

2311
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,400
It's blustery.

2312
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,704
But they end up taking

2313
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:05,824
Calls and just caller calls in and she is saying that she had a health situation

2314
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,848
In the past

2315
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,128
But you recovered from

2316
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,152
But now she

2317
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:12,480
She thinks that it might have been the Wuhan Coronavirus

2318
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:13,760
And that a lot of people

2319
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:14,528
Baby

2320
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,552
Just maybe

2321
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:18,368
Have been getting that if I coronavirus for a long time

2322
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,648
And recovering a week

2323
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,928
Didn't know it was here

2324
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,720
It's a long-term game

2325
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:23,744
And this

2326
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,536
Maybe the virus

2327
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,816
Been here already

2328
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:36,288
Operation

2329
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,824
Quarantine

2330
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,712
It's a bunch of weird

2331
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:47,040
My family Securus ago in 2 weeks

2332
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:52,416
Tell me I'm pretty

2333
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:54,208
Well and got really sick

2334
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:58,304
I don't know about the

2335
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,608
Precise details of Alex's family members

2336
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:01,632
Or anything like that

2337
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,680
I would just say that

2338
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,448
There's

2339
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,496
Some examples of people

2340
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:07,520
Leprechaun

2341
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,288
Things

2342
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,824
Alex is talking about

2343
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:13,920
And all of them are opposed to vaccine

2344
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:16,736
It's interesting

2345
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:19,296
Cross-section of like Alex's family

2346
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:21,344
And Owen Shroyer to works

2347
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:25,184
Aggressive anti-vaccination

2348
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,976
Community

2349
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:30,048
If you die of a disease that you could have been back

2350
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:30,816
Vaccinated against

2351
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:31,840
That's God

2352
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:32,608
Will

2353
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:35,680
You're not taking those globalist vaccines to live

2354
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,728
Past when God said that you should die

2355
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:42,848
Yeah ulcers were caused by Beck

2356
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:43,616
Bacteria

2357
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,920
Did so basically Buy

2358
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:48,992
Ingesting a s*** ton of bacteria and then Keurig

2359
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:52,832
I challenged her to infect herself

2360
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:53,856
Coronavirus

2361
01:43:54,112 --> 01:44:00,256
You mean this call absolutely I don't know if we'll be able to track her down to make this challenge

2362
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:02,304
Are you dumb

2363
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,840
So

2364
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,936
I wasn't all that interested

2365
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,728
Deanna Lorraine

2366
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,776
And her appearance on the show

2367
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:18,176
I almost would have just ignored it entirely probably I wouldn't even brought up the fact that

2368
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:21,248
Restraining orders against Omar Navarro

2369
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,784
All that I probably would have

2370
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,064
Just left it all alone

2371
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,368
Cuz she's someone who is running

2372
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,696
Against Nancy Pelosi as a republican in California

2373
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:31,232
It does not seem like it

2374
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,000
It's going to work

2375
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,048
I would have just been like

2376
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,840
But then she says a bunch of

2377
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:36,608
Stopping at my

2378
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,144
Nap got to talk about her

2379
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,680
Because she thinks

2380
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:41,216
Does Coronavirus

2381
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,288
Miz Lorraine please comment on the Coronavirus

2382
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:50,432
Absolutely

2383
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:54,016
Was it manufactured

2384
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,856
You know I mean

2385
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,768
And it happens to influence these areas

2386
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,448
Fractured

2387
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,288
Rarely

2388
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,312
Be conclusive

2389
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,848
I can tell you

2390
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,016
Delivery system

2391
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,552
Fractured

2392
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,392
Biological weapon tree author comes out and says it

2393
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,696
Always said that

2394
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:38,304
This is something this is something else

2395
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:42,656
So he's saying that this is Defenders based on this study of it's retracted

2396
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:45,216
An inconclusive not peer-reviewed

2397
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,008
Can't really use this as

2398
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,288
Proof of anything

2399
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,824
And Francis Boyle

2400
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,872
The guy who says this all the fun

2401
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,920
F****** time on your show

2402
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:54,944
No no

2403
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,224
So I don't know

2404
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,784
Like all this it's definitive it's

2405
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:02,112
It's concrete it is not none of the stuff you song about means

2406
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,160
It is interesting

2407
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,440
I think this might hurt Laura

2408
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,584
I bet you won't make it out of the primary

2409
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,608
No

2410
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:16,960
You can be a red wave that gets rid of Nancy Pelosi

2411
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:25,664
Pelosi is ripe for

2412
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,200
Certainly

2413
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:33,344
The fuckout there's a lot of things that certainly from the last name from the right people have a number of

2414
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,648
Complaints about her and

2415
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,696
That's tearing up the speech

2416
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,464
At the end

2417
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,744
End of the State of the Union

2418
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,048
I think I think

2419
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:43,584
Send a message

2420
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,144
I hate

2421
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:46,912
Paper

2422
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:47,680
So

2423
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,216
I think there's a lot of comply

2424
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:51,776
Some of them valid

2425
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:54,592
Some of them from Alex not so valid

2426
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,616
Here's one of those

2427
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:04,064
Bitter Pelosi claims Trump was drugged

2428
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:13,024
Oh how young we were when Alex and Rodger Stone were saying the Trump was

2429
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:17,120
Speaking weird at speeches and rallies because the globalist

2430
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:20,704
Slow-acting sedatives in his diet coke

2431
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:27,104
Oh how how innocent was expensive it is for Pelosi you suggest

2432
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:27,872
Yesterday

2433
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:29,152
USANA Center

2434
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:31,968
Arc save the thing that we said

2435
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,016
What are we doing

2436
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,296
What's the weather

2437
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,344
So I feel like you want to leave

2438
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,648
And if that's the case

2439
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,696
You and Owen Shroyer have something in common

2440
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:46,048
Cuz he doesn't want to be doing this later

2441
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,328
And Alex

2442
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,096
Not let him leave

2443
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:51,936
By the way you were trying to go

2444
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:56,544
Alice won't let me go on the war room for three hours from 3 to 6 at Alex's like

2445
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,896
Gastro

2446
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:04,736
Baroness James sensolo

2447
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,624
Again Alex

2448
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,672
Cannot frame what he's doing

2449
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,768
There's no

2450
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:19,072
Why wouldn't you be g.i. Joe

2451
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:23,424
You know who my favorite people

2452
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,448
In the show cap

2453
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,472
Planetware

2454
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,008
Pollution

2455
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:32,640
F****** who had their goddamn Rings or that guy he's blue get him out of here what more Global is proved

2456
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:33,408
Do you need that

2457
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:34,688
Looks like the globe

2458
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:35,712
The foot

2459
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,504
Was actually the good guy

2460
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,784
Ninja Turtle

2461
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:43,648
Like Alex

2462
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:45,184
Just being being

2463
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,464
And identifying

2464
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:53,888
Difference between antihero and the most evil person that could be

2465
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:57,472
Is Cobra is getting like that's another one of those like

2466
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:04,128
There's no ambiguity here this is a very cool

2467
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:07,712
You are a United States loving f****** Patriot you anything

2468
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:11,296
G.i. Joe would be your hero right now it's a small Factory

2469
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:13,600
I think

2470
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,648
This one

2471
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:17,440
I mean maybe even if

2472
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:20,256
The case with the Star Wars 12 just like

2473
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,560
Is only a few Impressions Alex can do

2474
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:24,864
So

2475
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:30,496
Maybe it doesn't I don't know you were really good Willy Wonka he be a nice man

2476
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,776
Yeah

2477
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:32,800
Just the impression

2478
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,336
Let him down this dark

2479
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,384
What if it is

2480
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:40,224
Scales I have Vicodin body these

2481
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,552
Or I go

2482
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,088
Tragic tragic

2483
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:49,184
Only told me someone would have taught him

2484
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,744
Obi-Wan Kenobi

2485
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:53,792
That would a man

2486
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:55,840
You really start to think about calvinist

2487
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:57,120
Whatever

2488
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:59,168
Are predetermination and at what time

2489
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,704
Abilities to do impression

2490
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:04,288
So Alex more calls after Owen leaves

2491
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:07,360
And I think this call is really interesting because I think it

2492
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,384
Alien bodies

2493
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,920
I'll call her

2494
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:11,456
Who is so close

2495
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,736
To understanding the

2496
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:15,808
The Trump is stringing people along to get reelected

2497
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,368
It's so close

2498
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,392
I love

2499
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:23,744
Is one hair away

2500
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,024
We're all like five

2501
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,304
Old white non-key

2502
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,864
Christmas for these guys

2503
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:34,240
Say is I I just

2504
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:37,568
He's waiting till

2505
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:42,432
He knows if he did so

2506
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:46,528
How

2507
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,320
He's holding out

2508
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,648
There's too many people on the fans

2509
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:55,488
I totally agree

2510
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,048
So he's so close to understanding that like

2511
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
There is

2512
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,656
Waiting until he gets re-elected to do anything

2513
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,448
That's neat.

2514
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:10,848
The classic things I get out of course I'll do that

2515
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:14,432
I think I'm going to do

2516
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:17,248
Political Capital until my second terabrite

2517
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,272
Cheese's

2518
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:21,600
Tragic

2519
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:22,368
To me though

2520
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,904
The way in which that's like

2521
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,464
You almost get it

2522
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:29,792
Does delude yourself into thinking

2523
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:30,816
Yeah this

2524
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,840
Time for real

2525
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,632
It'll be whenever he gets back

2526
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,400
Back in

2527
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,936
All going down

2528
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:36,704
Admit they got

2529
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:39,520
It is it reminds me of that like

2530
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:41,056
If you are okay

2531
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,336
When will you get

2532
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:43,360
To the line

2533
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,896
If every step you take

2534
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:45,920
Is halfway there

2535
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:48,480
You know it'll just never

2536
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,248
Going to get there

2537
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,528
It's just never going to happen

2538
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:51,552
And

2539
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,088
Turns out

2540
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:54,880
Deanna

2541
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:56,928
Is

2542
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,464
Also on this tip

2543
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,232
Of like

2544
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,792
Trump probably in the next turn

2545
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,328
You probably going to do it

2546
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,632
Specific things

2547
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:06,400
What you want

2548
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:08,192
Two happened to Trump's enemies

2549
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:11,264
And if you're aware of the larger

2550
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:13,568
Conspiracy ecosystem

2551
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,360
What you wants to happen

2552
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:17,152
It was you about what she believed

2553
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,712
I really hope

2554
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,992
And just as far as

2555
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,328
She's a cute one.

2556
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:37,632
Release

2557
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,168
Release those sealed

2558
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:43,008
Stan there's 23,000 have we moved up yet

2559
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:49,408
The did he not write anymore sealed indictments saying they need to be sent to get MO

2560
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:53,248
How is a educator is the indicator of

2561
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:59,136
Adam Schiff in the crystal

2562
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:03,488
Stalker whatever all these people are going to be

2563
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,792
Mueller they're all going to get mode

2564
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,560
Obama

2565
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:12,448
They're all going to Guantanamo and that's you know that's why I trumpstock closing Guantanamo to also

2566
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:14,496
I think you even knows how many cells there are in

2567
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,288
Plenty

2568
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,056
Probably

2569
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:18,592
I really don't think so

2570
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,384
Flanigan's

2571
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:24,480
When she says things like that it's just a queer ad

2572
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,040
Accused

2573
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,600
Play one last caller

2574
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:30,368
And I think

2575
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:31,648
It's interesting

2576
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:33,440
The way this caller phrases

2577
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:35,232
He wants Trump to do

2578
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:37,024
What do you want to see

2579
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,816
When Trump gets re-elected

2580
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:43,168
Unleash the kraken

2581
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:44,704
Yes

2582
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,472
I've heard that before

2583
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:46,752
Tampa.

2584
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,056
I think so

2585
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,848
Andy is out

2586
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,456
Weird

2587
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:57,248
Thank you for reelect

2588
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,392
If I understand correctly

2589
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:04,928
Dan vedonde

2590
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:06,464
Is the solution to the global

2591
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:08,768
I didn't know that but now it makes

2592
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:09,536
So much so

2593
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:16,704
Alex talks about this a little more and like it's so funny to me

2594
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:18,240
That is the way

2595
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,776
He talked about Dan batondy

2596
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:21,568
David Ortiz nickname was the cracker

2597
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,592
Alex

2598
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:26,176
Response to this guy is called without any

2599
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,200
Any awareness

2600
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:29,760
The fact that he's being sued right now

2601
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:35,136
Release the Kraken but that is not an employee of it

2602
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:36,672
That's exactly what I was

2603
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:39,744
The trumpet has release the Kraken once he's re-elected

2604
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:41,792
Close the present

2605
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,840
So when you're calling

2606
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:47,936
Destruction On Eagle's Wings

2607
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:50,496
No like Newtown

2608
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:56,128
Let's go have a crack in the Kraken is it cold unfeeling monster that tears

2609
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:56,896
Bart everything

2610
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,432
Right

2611
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:02,016
So Alex saying that he's heard this in the second

2612
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:03,552
Can term is now him.

2613
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:07,648
Just feeding into the exact same wish-fulfillment narratives that

2614
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:11,744
That other color was very close to recognizing is

2615
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,048
Is is characteristic of what's going on

2616
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:15,584
It's just very sad

2617
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:18,144
It's a it's a sad day it's sad day

2618
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,424
Such a thing that there

2619
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:21,216
Primed for an infant

2620
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:27,360
So long I think I did more than just Trump supporters are to it

2621
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:33,760
But I mean especially Infowars listeners just on the just on account of how many years have we have we been waiting for this

2622
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:35,040
Summer of Rage

2623
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:41,440
Summer of rage, right it's coming here okay well it didn't this time but next time it's coming there still

2624
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:43,488
You planning it there 10 years line

2625
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:49,632
Expressing the price of gold forever and yet

2626
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,680
Among other things

2627
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,472
It's so characteristic

2628
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:56,032
Hairstyle

2629
01:55:56,288 --> 01:56:02,432
Absolutely you're sitting ducks

2630
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:08,832
He's going to actually do something about the bankers he's going to actually do something about the buzz going to close

2631
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,856
Gitana Mobay

2632
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:12,160
Everything that we were just talking

2633
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:14,464
I think

2634
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:17,536
Think you could get wrapped up in that I think a lot of people did but

2635
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:23,424
And I'm sure they're parts of the right that you just never hear from the respond similarly

2636
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,704
Mulatto

2637
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,984
The left

2638
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:26,752
That I'm

2639
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:27,520
More

2640
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:29,056
Familiar with and

2641
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:33,408
There was more of a hoe

2642
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:37,760
But that was what was going to happen this is definite

2643
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:44,672
Like you used that time certain there are some Republican

2644
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:46,720
Publicans who are the same

2645
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,512
These things

2646
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:49,280
Like

2647
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:50,304
I don't know

2648
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:53,120
Medicare goes away

2649
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:57,472
Social Security when I'm older

2650
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:59,776
Vets Trump will accomplish those things

2651
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,824
But they don't look at it in the same way of life

2652
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,592
If you get through

2653
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:03,872
Re-elected he'll release the crack

2654
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:10,272
All I'm saying Dan is that I am on a fixed income and I would very much like my president to take it away from

2655
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:11,296
Usher

2656
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:15,904
So anyway we get to the end of this episode

2657
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,184
I think it's

2658
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,464
I think there's no

2659
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:21,024
There's a interesting thing that's going.

2660
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,304
Something is

2661
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,328
Certainly

2662
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:25,888
Continuing out there coronavirus death

2663
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,168
And the

2664
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:29,472
What's a consistent

2665
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:31,520
Thread of it all being soft

2666
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:32,544
10 weeks

2667
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,848
That's not that interesting

2668
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,384
My charge

2669
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:39,200
To keep keep tracking it as it goes along

2670
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:42,784
Also very sad that there wasn't the in studio surge

2671
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:46,368
Sorry that I got your hopes up.

2672
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,904
You really did

2673
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,208
I trusted you

2674
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:54,048
For that one moment

2675
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,584
3 year prayer

2676
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:02,752
And the other thing

2677
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:05,056
The continuing of the

2678
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:06,592
The food sales

2679
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:09,408
Clearly

2680
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:12,736
And the escalating

2681
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:17,600
I would say dangerous way he's selling the silver

2682
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:19,392
Not necessarily dangerous to

2683
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:20,160
People

2684
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:22,976
Cuz I don't know if it really would harm them

2685
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,000
To take it

2686
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:27,584
Maybe they're not the money to buy it and he's hurting the that way

2687
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:28,608
Possible yet

2688
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:29,632
It's not so much

2689
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:31,424
Did he's jeopardizing People's Health

2690
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:33,984
By promoting the suffix

2691
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:37,568
Opportunity cost

2692
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:41,408
And maybe that would be bad your last five bucks to a pro

2693
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,176
Prosperity God

2694
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:47,040
F*** you you are an evil person

2695
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:48,832
It's dangerous not the person giving the five.

2696
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:51,136
It's dangerous on that front

2697
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:55,488
Engaging in salesman

2698
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,792
Is dangerous to his own interests

2699
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:00,608
I do see that

2700
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:04,960
Trend continuing and maybe even getting worse I'm interested to see how bad it

2701
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:07,264
The camp

2702
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,568
Stick around this point for a while

2703
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,616
I think I don't know if she'll go in

2704
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:12,384
Further

2705
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:16,736
I don't know if you would like I don't even know if there would be any consequences if he did

2706
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:19,808
That's a good question I think the fact that he's so

2707
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:22,112
Public in such a high-profile person

2708
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:23,136
He might get in

2709
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:26,464
In trouble but I was reading some articles from like 2013

2710
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,256
Where a guy who is

2711
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:32,352
His name but he was a guy who's in the FDA and he was

2712
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:35,680
Business Insider

2713
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,240
Maybe the week

2714
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,288
Are you saying it like

2715
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:42,080
70% of

2716
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,128
Supplement

2717
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,152
Manufacturers

2718
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:46,688
Product

2719
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:48,992
Inappropriately

2720
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:51,296
There's a decent chance to so much of this

2721
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:53,856
Doesn't ever get anybody in any trouble

2722
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:55,136
I was going to say I was like

2723
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:57,952
How many cases in the past year has the FDA brought

2724
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:01,024
Probably time that you did never hurt me

2725
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,304
They also have a lot of issues

2726
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,120
Used to deal with that might not be the highest priority for them

2727
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:11,264
Right I don't know and so there's a decent chance that's another reason why I don't want to snitch

2728
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:13,824
Matter

2729
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,640
And yeah you want to still have some faith in the system work

2730
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:20,224
That's what I'm interested to see where that goes like even in the next like

2731
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:21,248
While

2732
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:24,320
It's entirely possible he could get worse on that or

2733
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:25,600
Stay in same place

2734
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,648
And then this trend

2735
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:30,208
The Democratic party has got to go

2736
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:30,976
Is

2737
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,000
Very disheartened

2738
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:34,816
Turn

2739
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:37,120
Most terrifying about it is

2740
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,400
This

2741
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:42,496
Propensity that we've seen for the right-wing news media to recycle

2742
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:44,800
Ir-2 like

2743
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,824
Take these

2744
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:51,712
Horrifying things from the hard right now I just kind of like Smooth M into rounded edges so

2745
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:58,112
People in the people in the in the middle

2746
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:00,672
The road Republican and somehow Tucker managed

2747
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:01,696
To use language in

2748
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:02,720
In such a way that they're like

2749
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:06,816
Well you know I used to think that the two party system required the den

2750
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,352
Democrats but now he's making

2751
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:10,144
In a good argument

2752
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:13,984
You know what I don't like those hard right guy

2753
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:18,848
Some of those guys are Nazis I think I'm the Democrat now as long as we get rid of

2754
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:20,128
All the Democrats

2755
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,152
Yeah yeah

2756
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:24,992
I mean there are other flaws to the two-party system that I let you know I have

2757
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:30,112
Other issues

2758
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,904
I think are important

2759
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:34,720
Right

2760
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:36,256
Yeah I mean

2761
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:38,560
It's a it is a it is worried

2762
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:40,864
I'm not entirely sure if this

2763
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:41,888
This is something that would trick

2764
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,168
Because it's

2765
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:45,216
So f****** over

2766
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:53,152
It's so out of line is that I think there is a valid way that you

2767
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:55,712
Can't Behave this way and not be authoritarian

2768
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:57,248
Like let's say

2769
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,528
We need to just

2770
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:04,160
Destroy this party by winning all of the election Ray we need to supercharge

2771
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,696
Organizing it right

2772
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:07,488
Looking down ballot

2773
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:08,512
To get to a point

2774
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:10,816
Where we make them irrelevant right

2775
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:14,656
Democracy are better than theirs are

2776
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:16,704
There is a way to

2777
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,264
Talk about destroying your opposition

2778
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,032
Without

2779
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:22,336
Saying Trump should outlaw

2780
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:28,736
It's not like the country was born with only Democrats and Republicans

2781
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:31,040
Political parties

2782
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:33,856
They know nothing cuz although they were

2783
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:35,648
More like a

2784
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,440
We've been here before

2785
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,024
It's not so much

2786
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,304
Clarify

2787
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:43,840
It's not so much

2788
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:45,120
The idea of getting

2789
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:45,888
Rid of

2790
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,656
This part

2791
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:48,192
That is the problem

2792
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:51,264
It's the means by which to do it yeah

2793
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:54,080
Markedly and specifically authoritarian

2794
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:59,200
What was the know-nothings used to beat the s*** out of their political above

2795
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:00,224
Sure there's that

2796
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,248
It's not surprising

2797
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:03,040
Likes but it is troubling

2798
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:04,320
And I worry about where at

2799
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:08,672
Cuz it'll be seeing for like at least

2800
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:09,696
Last couple months

2801
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:10,720
Has been like

2802
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,768
Everything is down

2803
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:14,560
Everything

2804
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:15,328
Thing is down

2805
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:16,096
And I wonder

2806
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:17,376
I'm spit ball

2807
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,680
I'm wondering

2808
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:21,216
If all of these sale

2809
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:22,752
Like that

2810
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:24,288
He's getting by way of

2811
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:25,312
The Coronavirus

2812
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:27,360
Sensationalism

2813
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:29,408
All the food buckets that he's moving

2814
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,944
Presume

2815
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,224
Increase silver sales

2816
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:33,760
I'm wondering

2817
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,552
If the thing that was driving

2818
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:37,344
Sing him towards being so much more

2819
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:43,744
Extreme was the desperation of running out of money and his numbers are looking better

2820
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,280
Will that trend

2821
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:46,304
Knockin

2822
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:52,448
I'm seeing the answer is no

2823
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,728
Clearly Office episode

2824
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:55,776
And now you saying Outlaw democratic

2825
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:57,056
Know what I mean

2826
02:03:57,312 --> 02:04:00,384
I was going to I was going to say that earlier is

2827
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:02,944
One reason that I think the the

2828
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,736
S*** about the viruses so weak

2829
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:05,760
Cuz the sales are

2830
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:06,528
So good

2831
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:07,296
Even if

2832
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:08,064
He's peddling

2833
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:08,832
I'd like

2834
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:10,368
Laziness

2835
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:13,952
Why would why would you even bother doing anymore

2836
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:17,024
You can just say coronavirus coming to kill you and

2837
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:17,792
I've got the

2838
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:20,608
By silver like it's so easy

2839
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:22,656
It does seem that way

2840
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:23,936
It's upsetting

2841
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:26,752
I'm bummed out

2842
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,824
But

2843
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,104
Even ask

2844
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,664
Much of a bummer is that is like it's still

2845
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:35,456
I hate to

2846
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:38,016
Go through all of this to do another episode

2847
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:40,576
Fast turnaround time

2848
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:42,368
Is Thursday's episode

2849
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:45,952
Stole big relief that Alex is back in studio

2850
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:52,096
Cuz then I know he's in Austin for what

2851
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:55,936
In our world for what

2852
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:58,240
A to all these other people so f******

2853
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,288
Even as terrible as

2854
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,312
He has he's still

2855
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:02,592
So much better at this

2856
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:05,152
Then the rest of the story

2857
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,968
Studio

2858
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:08,992
You got a fever

2859
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:10,784
Your silver did not cure

2860
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:16,160
I hope that VA doesn't come after you

2861
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:22,816
We aren't

2862
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:27,424

Dzx Clark

2868
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:43,808
I think Trump swearing is important

2869
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,368
Holding

2870
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:52,000
Alex
