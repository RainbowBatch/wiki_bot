Indeed we are Damned

9
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,680
Jordan's a question for you

10
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
Why don't you go first

11
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,104
Well my bright spot Dan and I never thought I would say this my bright spot today is

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
The DMV

13
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:24,736
You know what before you tell whatever story you're going to tell her I want to say I

14
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,296
Always enjoy going to the DMV in Chicago

15
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,832
When I was in Missouri

16
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,624
Always miserable

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,000
Chicago I haven't had nothing but positive experience the

18
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,072
The place on Diversey I had to go get my license renewed

19
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,376
Cuz it was expired by about a year

20
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
And I had no idea because I was getting all those texts

21
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,520
You know the scam text from the DMV where you like that

22
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,800
Is it expired you need to

23
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:53,664
I got that at the same time that I got the regular text for a little hard to tell the difference now

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,712
I don't and I think that I don't

25
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,016
Know anybody who keeps up

26
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,064
Looks like well I got 3 months

27
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,368
It's something you just kind of

28
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,440
Goes on the back of your mind

29
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
Infantile somebody's like you

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
You can't buy that

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
You need a valid license

32
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Yeah

33
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
So the

34
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
The DMV on Diversey

35
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
I went there

36
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
There was a line out the door

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
End it

38
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:24,384
Well I thought we were going to be there for like 23 hours were people who saw the line and then just left

39
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
They

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
Banged it out

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,504
In 25 minutes they got there like

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064

46
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
It was that the whole

47
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
Group of people there

48
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720

Into each other

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
I talked to three other people who couldn't

55
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Help would be like

56
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
This is the best DMV I've ever been to the times I've been there they've been pretty Pleasant people to

65
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,856

66
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,696

00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:11,136
So Jordan say we have an interesting episode to go over our last episode

75
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,208
That we were going to talk about Alex Jones as a response

76
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,512
To Tucker Carlson show

77
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
Docu-series

78
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
But you know what I kind of got to

79
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Thinking about it I'm like

80
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Why

81
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
We know what he said

82
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
He said he loves it

83
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:29,311
Is the best greatest thing ever and it's all just he made this possible

84
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
The truth it's all because Al

85
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,151
So instead we're going to do is when I get to look at

86
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,223

But my neck is free

111
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
Ida Claire

113
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
Yes thank you very much

114
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
I wanted to say one quick thing before we get into the episode and that is that

115
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
I got some feedback

116
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
Back on our last episode The Tucker Carlson Juan

117
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
About about

118
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,911
Using names of protesters

119
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,775
When I was making illustrations of people who have been arrested were like in protest

120
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,383
And I want to say thank you to the person who pointed this out on Twitter

121
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
And that

122
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
I didn't mean to you know I right

123
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
I reflected on a little bit and the statistics

124
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,599
That we talked about really do make the same point

125
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
And I didn't realize there's a bit of a blind spot

126
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:25,023
And the reason I'm calling this out is cuz I went back and I cut that out of the episode and reposted it

127
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
So that's not in the episode now but

128
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
It was

129
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,887
And in case anybody was

130
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
The curious about that or whatever

131
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,007
It wasn't removed secretly

132
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,335
I'm trying to do a little better

133
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,663
Future being aware of that you know till it's a little bit of a

134
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,503
He was caught up in the idea of like if I point out these spell

135
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
Pacific's

136
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,367
Then it really helps drive home the point right and in bed

137
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,183
Reality

138
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,511
That is totally fine in the current reality

139
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
You can't

140
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,839
So anyway that's

141
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
What's that

142
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,167
Morgan Stark here on November 8th

143
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
And I can't tell you how much

144
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,823
I'm excited to talk about the present-day Alex talking about some important business

145
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,175
And so here is where Alex's head is at on the this day

146
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
Big exclusive news ladies and gentlemen

147
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
I saw this last week

148
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:26,719
And I thought maybe he's just taking an unplanned vacation we're going to sit back and wait and see what happens

149
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
Friday and came out that

150
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
He had

151
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
Only gotten sick after the third

152
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,655
Pfizer shop because he's a good-looking obelisk

153
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Third round

154
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
That's when the scientist and I've heard tell you that the real

155
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
Side effects taking pretty much guaranteed

156
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
And we have a lot of different sources

157
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
A in Hollywood

158
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
But also in law enforcement

159
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
And they have reached out to us

160
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,767
Broadcast

161
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
How's it going

162
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Everybody who's

163
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Well I guess we

164
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
That doesn't sound like Alex

165
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,415
I guess we can't do an episode about the 8th the storm

166
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:34,815
I was really glad to do an episode to have a great episode of

167
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:40,703
Getting us to go 3 or 4 hours and Alex does come back and it turns out he's talking about Gavin Newsom

168
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
Is it that you was talking about

169
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
That's the whole thing

170
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
My God

171
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:53,759
Alex is in a very bad mood so it looks like I'm going to die for what

172
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
I am going to put him in the corner

173
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
What to do Jordan I guess

174
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
You know what we could do what could we do

175
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,487
You know we talked to Jon Ronson recently

176
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,815
We could we could play that for the people

177
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,119
I don't think anybody would want to hear that Dan

178
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
That doesn't sound like something

179
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:17,055
I'd like it Miss 80s broadcast I feel like the public would be interested

180
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,991
Let me say this real quick I'm glad that that went reasonably smoothly cuz I

181
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,087
As soon as I hit the theme song I realized that I forgot to tell you

182
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487

00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,399
But it has been treated

371
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
Which when we would meet

372
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
Bohemian Grove

373
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
We checked into the motel the night before

374
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
The Occidental loves

375
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151

Java

389
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,496
It's interesting that like that is kind of that that to me reads as something that's been

390
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,032
Consistent you know like just this

391
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,616
Preoccupation with everybody is looking at him and

392
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,688
Like it's not but nowadays it's transformed into like

393
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,272
He seems to believe that demons can jump into people

394
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:19,136
And so like when he's out in public you'll see somebody and then they'll go back at him

395
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,720
And it's a demon that has come into their body

396
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Austin hits

399
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
You know like that kind of offending of

400
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Everything

401
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,224
Revolves around

402
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
At a certain point

403
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:51,392
Yeah I mean it's it's almost like he has to become famous in order to justify believing that everybody's always staring at

404
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
Whoa you know that's that's

405
00:22:54,464 --> 00:23:00,608
I got to go

406
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984

You did and I am sorry to get off track here

421
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:46,432
Just real fast you didn't end up interviewing some people who went to Bilderberg

422
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:51,552
You you'd like to Jim Tucker his whole thing is like nobody who goes there will talk to anybody

423
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,160
Categorically isn't true I mean you interviewed some people even on film

424
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,488
Yeah yeah

425
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280

00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,112
The story about 2

431
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
Even even even if you do meet somebody was very willing to talk to you that's still like

432
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
You can still break in

433
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,520
What I meant when I said that what you told me about

434
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Confirm

435
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,992
To say that we would strive

436
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,040
Into a One World Government

437
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,576
Is exaggerated

438
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,880
Not totally unfair

439
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
That's what he said today

440
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696

The business was a good idea

445
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
So weird

446
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784

Video

456
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,808
It's just so much more banal because

457
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,880
It's really just been being like how can we make the most money

458
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Potentially

459
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,768
We would like to attract more money

460
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816

No I I I think

475
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
There is

476
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,888
There is that reality and then there's the

477
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,704
The reality of the stories that are told

478
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
About

479
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
Things

480
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:27,104
Like the distinction between like a one world government that is basically

481
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
Along the lines of

482
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,248
You're not not a total One World Government button idea of international agreement

483
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,552
Anybody that is able to

484
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,904
Step in when their crimes against humanity that our country is carrying out

485
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,464
Or something like that that's the distinction

486
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,024
The real world is generally the

487
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,096
Do you know International body they can enforce International laws

488
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
ND

Fairytale version of it

490
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,192
The conspiracy theories towel is

491
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
1

492
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:58,336

Webjoint. Long weekend what's the year they planted physical today yeah oh yeah

For the last 40 years they've just been

495
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
I'm preoccupied with

496
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,624
Taking away

497
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
Right-wing people's guns

498
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
They've been trying to do that and

499
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,488
Can't figure out how to do it

500
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,560
I'm accused the president's the keys

501
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Prime minister

502
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,448
Ipac Nissan

Chizek man

505
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
The presidency in the Bible

506
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
Privatization

507
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
Thanks for the

508
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,152
Took that as a compliment

509
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
Wicked

510
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,248
I'm coming politician from the idea

511
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
Is

512
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
African

513
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
What bacon should disappear should have wise words

514
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,184
One story I was told with

515
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,256
In the late 1970s

516
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
I think around that time.

517
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
First became prime minister

518
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,864
What's the Bilderberg

519
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
Waze

520
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
With quiet

521
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
Mouse didn't say anything

522
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
Dotty's

523
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,008
Magnum sabadito

524
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
I told her that

525
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,848
Lots of ruining a great opportunity for networking

526
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,176
The next day she gave like a Bixby

527
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,760
I got much she went to New York

528
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,296
I would see what's New York

529
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,624
Like other Bilderberg people that you drove around to introduce

530
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,976
Hot like so.

531
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,792
Have Million Miles Away

532
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
Iron Lady

533
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:27,936
You're going to really need to up your Evil game if you want to become prime minister so give a f****** speech

534
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,056
NOAA in the same ballpark as like

535
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
A business seminar

536
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
Like people or people who have

537
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,688
Lots of connections Within

538
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,784
Could talk to other people have connected to this person

539
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
Pretty cool

540
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
You know that that

541
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,136
That's not the same thing as

542
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,720
You know being like hahaha she will rule

543
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Or whatever

544
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,352
Yeah

545
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,264
Yeah and I think that that distinction is kind of tough to draw sometime

546
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,824
You know the area where the

547
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616
The themes of some of the things that

548
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
The conspiracy theorists say

549
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:12,480
Are no fairly spiritually accurate in some ways

550
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
But the

551
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,576
Particulars of the narratives in the details are generally

552
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Way off base

553
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:25,792
Well I mean you think you think of like all the billionaire he's evil billionaires choose the leaders of the world but then you look at the America

554
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
Consistent minutes like

555
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,424
What you can't become a an elected official without a lot of money behind

556
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,824
Find atleast on a high low level so who's giving them that money it's a small

557
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
Phone number of people

558
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:44,480
And it feels like oh well if we if they give you the most money than they have chosen that you will be the next

559
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
Elected official

560
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,856
You know what I'm saying

561
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,672
I think the reason why you have

562
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
You do boo

563
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,536
The substitute

564
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
What I said

565
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,144
If you can see the yield sign in the world

566
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,480
Jon Ronson would say you listen to too much f****** Infowars

567
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,648
American inventors

568
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,232
About face

569
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,280
Is the culture War

570
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:35,168
The distinction between Bilderberg Group actually is

571
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
Especially you

572
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,080
Weather today

573
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,504
Yeah I do have

574
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,064
Too many of my toes in

575
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
That like

576
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,440
I bet Alex Jones world

577
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,280
Then I've only been able to access a lot of these things through

578
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,888
Claims that are made and then looking at the specifics or looking at the documents

579
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,192
And things whereas you have

580
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,984
Open to people and you've been to the

581
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
These places

582
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:14,336
Yet so I don't have much more of a familiarity with

583
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:19,968
A lot of this than I do that allows a little bit easier speaker

584
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,248
Then tense up.

585
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
My

586
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,368
Yeah. I totally got it you're right I maybe I was a bit

587
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:32,512
460

588
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,936
Completely embarrassed and Alex as well

589
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,728
I show it I think it's the best thing

590
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,616
IBEW talentless gita-youbi-kamu boiled at spelling.

591
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
Text

592
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,432
Gp3 the one

593
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,136
Yeah well maybe I do something like that and then I move on to another one

594
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
But you've been in Alex's

595
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,488
Long time yeah yeah I didn't

596
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
Plan to

597
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:10,912
It was I think I probably intended something along the lines of what you're describing maybe like a year year

598
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Year-and-a-half

599
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,728
But he's just so fascinating

600
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:20,128
Used Rubik's cube of insanity and weirdness and he always surprises

601
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Like it

602
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,736
You know there'll be like just the other day he was talking about how Maybe

603
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,528
You know if your family

604
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,112
Is pro-vaccine maybe it's time for you to kill your family

605
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:38,560
Straight up in a bad mood

606
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
Fast food so we told you that maybe you should kill your family a better mood meter

607
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:50,080
Three fair you said things happen within a family it's a family man

608
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
The family

609
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,176
Questions to ask

610
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
Fast

611
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Do you think

612
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
Like like I'm stressing

613
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Fatheads

614
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
David.

615
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
It has gone

616
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,696
Oh yeah yeah

617
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,608
Yeah that's that's something we wanted to ask you a conquest

618
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,424
For sure

619
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,496
I jumped out to me when I re-watch the episode

620
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,056
Where you at him went to The Grove

621
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
And it's just

622
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,360
It was shocking

623
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
Much less dark Alex

624
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
You know

625
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,992
Yeah I'll be reminded of that

626
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
Yeah

627
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,064
Absolutely

628
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,624
Deprived

629
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,744
Nazi

630
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352
I'm going to say

631
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:50,752
The time I was spending all of my days with the Nazis we were severing together

632
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
Coming in

633
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,896
Alex

634
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Sapulpa

635
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
About

636
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,904
Oh please please

637
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Appetite

638
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
Easy person

639
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,096
Be around

640
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
I could be sober

641
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
Millard old

642
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,960
He's the one of the most tallest people

643
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,264
Seems like be annoying

644
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
Tiring to be like

645
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,128
Yeah I don't like that

646
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,528
Alex

647
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Stop

648
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,904
What a present

649
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
Call Leticia finding Alex

650
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,328
The only one

651
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,144
Raelynn

652
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:01,408
It's very funny very good qualities very as one

653
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,040
The one thing I would say is that

654
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,576
Arabic stop

655
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
Witch with me

656
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,720
I'm infiltration the Bohemian Grove which is one of the greatest

657
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,792
That's my last talked about fail

658
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:22,912
Tumnus towards capacity of course

659
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,496
What should I do

660
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
About

661
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
Democracy

662
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,824
Department

663
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,896
On a personal level

664
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
Isabel

665
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
The middle

666
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,952
Did you say archery skills

667
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,168
The great Bowman

668
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:06,688
I'm singing and son at 7-Eleven

669
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,480
Where we're from where America

670
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,552
Can sorry about that

671
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:16,672
The reason that it blew my mind that that was a possibility is that Alex has such a gun guy that

672
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,232
I feel like you're being hunted by a bow and arrow

673
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
All of those things

674
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,864
Black what are they come closer oh yeah

675
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
It's closer to a guy

676
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:32,032
Yeah and I agree with you 100% about the oratory skills like

677
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
I think

678
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,872
Even going back to our earliest episodes

679
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,688
Like a caveat that I always have to kind of

680
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,224
By myself

681
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,528
Very talented at a thing

682
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
And unfortunately the thing

683
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
Bad

684
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,160
In a very bad way

685
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
But

686
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
If you if you just

687
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,000
Take it as a ethically neutral thing

688
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:58,400
I don't know if I've ever seen anybody who has the ability to say nothing for so long

689
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,680
With so much passion

690
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Yeah

691
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Yeah

692
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Yeah

693
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,872
District 2001

694
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,408
I went on now

695
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,944
Wiesbaden showpo

696
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
Notes

697
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:16,064
I do talk about Alex Jones

698
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,368
I got the same thing I said like

699
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
Jesus

700
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
He just talented

701
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
Bill hats

702
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,256
Like crazy

703
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,560
People hacks

704
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
Ripple effect

705
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Play

706
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:51,392
I wanted to actually ask you about that C-SPAN interview because it's something that I have

707
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
Thought about it quite a bit

708
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,512
In that interview you save it

709
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,072
After going to Bohemian Grove

710
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:05,472
You told Alex that he was playing with fire because he was misrepresenting what you guys had experience there

711
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,312
And saying it was like this demonic thing and playing up those elements of it

712
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
Right yeah

713
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,968
Yeah that to me his response you said was I'm not going to tell the listeners that

714
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,808
Earnest

715
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,368
Right I think my whole

716
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
I did without it

717
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,720
Complications two decades after

718
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
At he's at

719
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
Playing with fire

720
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
Used

721
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,960
I heard you say things that we both know out true

722
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,520
I'm

723
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
Sad

724
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,152
That's awful

725
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:51,808
Welts

726
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,600
Like 13:11

727
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
If you fake

728
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,952
I think he's faking it and I would say

729
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,744
Example sometimes

730
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,072
When I met Jesse Owens like 5 years ago

731
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,144
Alexis cameraman

732
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,936
Whistleblower

733
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,472
I said that to him

734
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
Einstein

735
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,056
Was just completed

736
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,384
Ensenada

737
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
I think

738
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:23,808
I just was with that beam adonyx like it would be back Saturday to you

739
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
We got to think of it probably

740
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,464
You know that was back in 2003 when you went to Bohemian Grove new weather

741
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,744
Had this conversation

742
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
I bet he was

743
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
Much looser live

744
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:40,192
Maybe maybe he didn't even have that million-dollar Empire to protect

745
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,264
And at the same time who knows how

746
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
The years went on

747
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,384
Convincing yourself of your own story classic

748
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,736
We going to be careful what mask you wear because it might become your face kind of thing you know

749
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Yeah

750
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,344
At the hospital

751
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,368
Completely

752
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,672
Fully realize this dog

753
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,696
Which system

754
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,768
Alex's is a narcissist

755
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,816
Narcissist

756
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
Relationship

757
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
Truth

758
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,936
Then I think that the pizza people about NASA

759
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
Daughter

760
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,056
Stop mean

761
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,616
That would Jetson him by the Rob

762
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,920
Traxxas latrax

763
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:28,320
What is a f****** alien

764
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:34,720
Can only have 12 psychopath sitting there being like of course you kill your brother again so you can see that guy

765
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,024
We saw the psychopath test

766
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
It says no

767
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,312
Between truth and light in Alex's mind

768
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,384
Like if it's lying doesn't make him feel bad

769
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Then

770
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,295
Question 2 Davido 224 the shirt

771
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
That pushed it is

772
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,391
Elijah

773
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,415
Just like this

774
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,743
Is that expensive

775
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,071
Mine's wedding

776
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,911
Noggin ethical concern

777
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
At times

778
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,199
The budget is going down

779
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,367
That point you made though if the

780
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,463
The distinction between whether he knows he's lying or not like

781
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
Do the truth

782
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,559
I also think that that's probably the wrong

783
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,583
Place to look at it

784
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,375
Quartet

785
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
Pizza Hut

786
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
Then

787
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
Then the truth is

788
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,199
Truth is whatever matters to him right you know

789
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:05,599
The reason I brought up that point from the C-SPAN interview was that also in that interview talk about the

790
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:11,487
What was it the Phantom Patriot the guy who ended up a year later going to Bilderberg with a bunch

791
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Two guns

792
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,303
I'm sorry Yaya

793
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,095
As a result of

794
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,167
Being an Alex and it's being dark secrets

795
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,959
The documentary that Alex put out

796
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
That's kind of

797
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
Where

798
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,591
I think the most interesting part is like

799
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:31,967
Whether he's telling the truth or not actively or aware aware of what he's doing or not

800
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,783
He knows he knew enough

801
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,111
To know that he wasn't telling the whole story to his listeners

802
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
And

803
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,719
Probably was aware that this guy showed up

804
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
Bohemian Grove because of his comp

805
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,071
Like yeah

806
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
He's aware of that

807
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,887
That connection

808
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,495
He hasn't Staples

809
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:07,551
I said a lot of things

810
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,647
Grady surprise me

811
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
Lawyer

812
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,207
That he spoke about it

813
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
Yeah

814
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,607
He made a meal of of that

815
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:27,775
Someone needs to go check this out without was also what he said about pizzagate

816
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
So

817
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,591
Yeah

818
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
Yeah

819
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,575
Psychological

820
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
I'm sorry this

821
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:48,255
Here's to the Goldwater rule so we can't allow you to do that

822
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:06,687
I always just wonder like I think the most important question for me is always been

823
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,223
Vietbet level 2 witch

824
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,575
He's aware the influence that he has that leads people to do bad things

825
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,879
Like the Phantom Patriot or

826
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,671
Any number of other folks

827
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,511
Like a couple in Las Vegas who shot a cop

828
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,863
I always Emily

829
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,143
Curious

830
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,191
Because I don't know

831
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
B major

832
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,543
What is the capital of

833
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,383
Can I see you about

834
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:41,503
Ghetto how is and how could I figured one of those stories about it we think he was in Spotify

835
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,807
Try Road 7

836
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
Talk to his lawyer

837
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
I got your daddy didn't want to

838
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
Understandable

839
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:57,119
That connection is really into having you literally wrote the book on being publicly shame so

840
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:06,335
I think the feelings that one should have or one you'd expect to have a like

841
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
That was bad I shouldn't do that

842
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,663
I couldn't do that that was bad

843
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:13,503
Some guy went to the place I told the story about with guns

844
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,551
He's going to kill a bunch of old people

845
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,111
This is no good I should probably

846
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,135
That doesn't happen

847
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,951
And that's fascinating to me

848
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,255
Yeah I know I mean

849
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,815
I've not seen any evidence of

850
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
I've hidden cadogan

851
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Wow

852
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:36,543
No no but you know that's kind of why I was asking you I was wondering if

853
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,127
Well I mean

854
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,151
He lying about

855
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175

00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:55,999

857
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,959

858
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,311

860
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,943
If I Ruled the World

861
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,111
Completely unnecessarily

862
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,183
Amusingly okay goodbye

863
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095

Like

871
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,087
You can do that at a coffee shop

872
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,487
Actually just had a thought about your guys

873
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,279
Infiltration of a human growth like

874
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,863
You went in the front and Alex use a little bit of subterfuge

875
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,191
I've always thought like well he could have just walked in the front

876
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,727
But probably he couldn't

877
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,263
Like he probably couldn't

878
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
Control himself

879
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,847
Like probably like act

880
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,503
Really weird and I mean he would see the security guard be like you better kick me out of here otherwise

881
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:32,767

It's not great at Improv

923
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,335

00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,599
A doggies

940
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,951
Wow great good things happen again

941
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
Alex

942
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,239
Transportation around like

943
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:57,311
Even when there's a video that he posted of Alex

944
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Psych

945
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,615
I think you can pre

946
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:03,967
Or maybe during the like look like live TV.

947
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,527
You know the key they clearly

948
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
Had some

949
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
Long stand

950
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
The connection

951
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,391
But like I loved and I loved the two of them because

952
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,951
When they're doing this practicing being preppy

953
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,279
They're walking down like a porch

954
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:23,679
They're walking and they need to go back to where they started to do a second take hit your marks

955
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:30,335
Remarkable practicing Sorkin

956
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:34,431
Dialog okay

957
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,991
I said to them

958
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,831
Any contingency plan for

959
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
Stadium

960
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,023
Caught

961
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
I'm going to say

962
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:02,335
Runaway

963
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,711
I said so

964
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:12,319
I did I do think it was wise of you to advise him not to bring a gun

965
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,111
That was that was smart

966
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
Oh

967
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:21,535
About that time did you ever talk to Alex about like religion or any

968
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,351
Anything because he thinks that the people at

969
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,631
The Bohemian Grove

970
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,655
AR

971
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,703
Literally Satan worshipers who

972
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,751
Work for the literal Christian.

973
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,823
Like this isn't

974
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,127
Yeah the Java Jive

975
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:49,439
My friend Marty yells at me fairly regularly as a as a reference today

976
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,487
I got that loud

977
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Noxious person

978
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,239
But there was something about being with

979
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,263
Rick the lawyer

980
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:07,359
Live by art by Chris Raider with Without a Face

981
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,407
You telling me that I was going to be fine

982
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
Could this guy Rick

983
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,991
Looks so much like he belongs like

984
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,015
He couldn't look.

985
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,599
Antique Garden before he was obviously a lesser demon

986
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:22,975
Right there's no way that he wasn't a problem

987
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,447
410

988
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,591
Did I view the Alex I hope so

989
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,407
Galaxy filming at in the bag

990
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:49,087
Set navigation to f******

991
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:57,023
Traffic light

992
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,935
I don't think that's an Alex's film

993
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,775
Baby

994
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:18,015
Yeah maybe it's been awhile since I've Revisited at 2

995
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,063
Yes it that way

996
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,623
In My Memory that was a

997
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,671
There was like exchange cut houses

998
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,951
Giant redwood

999
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,231
Next to the

1000
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,279
Giant owl weapon bookkeeping

1001
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,815
Sacrifices about to happen

1002
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:34,143
I'd like it was like

1003
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,679
This isn't like a weird

1004
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:40,799
Sparklers sparkling flag

1005
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,151
John Williams

00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,743
Vacation it something you do that you do Broadway is weird

1007
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:10,751
Yeah so what movie

1008
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
Lighthouse

1009
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
Today Show.

1010
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,663
San Francisco

1011
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
Playing

1012
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,319
The office

1013
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:30,719
Just get two drink tickets you got to go

1014
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,743
Feel like I could get a setup

1015
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:35,071
The Bohemian Grove

1016
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,911
The passage to the underground tunnel

1017
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:45,055
Brett meatball man spend 10 minutes under the Getty and then

1018
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,687
Amazingly

1019
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,503
Reckless life

1020
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:54,783
Tesco

1021
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,439
Lynn inside

1022
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,607
Yeah

1023
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,143
So

1024
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,495
Hilarious

1025
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,799
Alexis Alexis Looking-Glass

1026
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:21,151
It has the XX in his life

1027
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,735
How is

1028
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:31,903
You had the perspective that there was a metaphor involved in

1029
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,231
Of course demons on the other side

1030
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,047
Which kind of leads back to work question you were asked

1031
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,095
Jason Jordan

1032
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:43,935
Zealotry that Alex demonstrates now

1033
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,471
He's so

1034
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,239
Bike

1035
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,799
Satan literal Satan Focus

1036
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,615
Like the globalist exist here is an umbrella

1037
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,943
I like if you had a flowchart it all goes up to the big guy

1038
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
Satan

1039
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:01,087
Could lead to the story about Alex

1040
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367
Good life

1041
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,671
I would think about it. So if

1042
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
Katagiri when he was a high school

1043
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,815
It would be cool to be high outside today

1044
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,631
Distinction is

1045
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:17,471
Was it hail Satan like rock and roll or what was it

1046
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,287
There is a literal Devil with hooves

1047
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,615
That walks around and possesses people

1048
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,151
And I must fight them

1049
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:29,247
That's a good question that I don't know the answer

1050
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,551
Namenda

1051
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,855
I don't remember

1052
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,903
If I need liability

1053
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,535
You do you spell Korean

1054
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,095
Korean physicist

1055
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,399
Yeah I'm done

1056
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,215
Kelly

1057
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,543
She said was to answer

1058
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,943
He's Pizza that she's Jewish on the show before

1059
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,247
He was one of those things that people would always

1060
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,063
Attack him about it was always really kind of gross

1061
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,391
Like

1062
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:12,511
Your wife's your Handler for Mossad or something you know like all that nonsense

1063
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:17,887
Well I mean what's the point

1064
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,471
Infection with

1065
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Austin

1066
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
Okay

1067
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
Yeah

1068
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,967
I think the word liberal means

1069
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,527
Conceived

1070
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,903
Mantra and concentric used to being Progressive

1071
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,791
Meaning like assertive

1072
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,327
Leaving Monterey

1073
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,863
I'm Alex

1074
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,215
Tommy

1075
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,199
Electric Bakula

1076
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:08,319
Yeah my son so so much of his earlier career seemed to

1077
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087
Like that like

1078
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,135
Regular guy kind of stuff

1079
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Heimlich

1080
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,231
I can't remember if it was in your documentary or another one I've seen

1081
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,815
He's talking about David Icke and he says the David Icke is like the

1082
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
The turd in a punch bowl

1083
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:29,311
Half from that to hanging out with David Icke and saying all the same stuff if they would like

1084
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,591
Like he does now

1085
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,895
It's it's that's really interesting

1086
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,919
To maim like

1087
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,199
Yeah

1088
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:38,783
It is right that control and that's where the presentation of

1089
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,063
II

1090
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,623
I may or may not believe crazy stuff

1091
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,647
But

1092
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:47,231
I'm going to talk to you about Banks I'm going to talk to you about communism

1093
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,535
And that's gone now it's just

1094
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,327
Exactly

1095
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,631
I'm not going to talk to you about

1096
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
You betcha

1097
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,215
You right that's all

1098
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,287
Gone

1099
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
Masa for Doria

1100
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,383
That's

1101
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,527
Woodmore

1102
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
Academic

1103
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,439
You will do that globalist government overreach

1104
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,975
Big black people

1105
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,023
The crazy bastard.

1106
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,815
Spanish favorite in Chester.

1107
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,607
Why didn't

1108
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,887
But it seems

1109
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,959
Plausible to believe that it was a metaphor

1110
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Back then

1111
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
You know

1112
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,823
Yeah that's something that I find like

1113
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,431
One of the things that I really enjoy looking at with with him is

1114
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,479
The things that are different from different

1115
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
.

1116
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,271
And that like

1117
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,575
Almost everything that I see

1118
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,879
From the earlier. Of his career

1119
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:50,207
Someone could make the argument that he's not being literal

1120
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
And I would believe

1121
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,023
I believe that like

1122
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,047
This is

1123
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,119
You know child sacrifice or whatever is

1124
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,911
It's still within the realm of like

1125
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
All right you're talkin you're talkin

1126
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,983
Metaphor here about being

1127
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,775
But now it's just not

1128
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,335
Definitely

1129
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,639
A gray area

1130
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,199
When I do them though because the way he was talking to

1131
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,735
Bohemian clothes with like

1132
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,527
Maybe they actually online

1133
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,319
Balenciaga band

1134
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,599
Maybe we really did say it

1135
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,623
An actual human

1136
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,695
I think the word baby was always in

1137
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,487
I think making out

1138
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,511
Black baby

1139
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,047
Chants of them

1140
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,191
I could I could be something maybe we saw with the adrenaline flowing through you that day

1141
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,471
I don't know

1142
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,775
I had one thing that I wanted to do

1143
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,799
And that is

1144
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,639
I wanted to tell you a few things that I would set about his early life

1145
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:44,223
And I want to see if you think that these lineup

1146
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,271
With the person that you knew

1147
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,063
When you guys went to Bohemian Grove

1148
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,111
Or things that you know

1149
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,647
Save a couple things here

1150
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,719
So the first is he believes he's psychic

1151
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,559
And that his career was preceded by prophetic dream

1152
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,119
B12

1153
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,399
The only

1154
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,215
Adobo Bowman

1155
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,031
You know what this wasn't

1156
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,591
It's something to do with the tape

1157
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,615
Application

1158
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,919
Los Angeles

1159
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,015
Caught with Alex

1160
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,039
Psychic

1161
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,575
What's hepatitis B

1162
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,623
Yeah yeah

1163
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,951
Translation something went wrong with the title

1164
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,767
Dina Rae

1165
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,071
I didn't watch the stereo

1166
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,119
I remember Alex

1167
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,007
Veering towards

1168
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,055
Did they somehow cycle

1169
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
Raised

1170
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,663
Or was there a magnet

1171
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,087
So that was

1172
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:53,855
I guess that's

1173
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,647
Very slightly into the hole

1174
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,671
Pappadeaux buffet

1175
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:03,839
Nothing I can maybe he's he's beat that up

1176
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:07,423
When you went to Bohemian Grove with Alex on 2,000

1177
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:12,031
Do you think the previous to that he had killed anybody

1178
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,151
I have seen some

1179
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,527
The catfish show

1180
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:27,903
I remember we came out and offended face was coming into the parking lot

1181
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,695
Expensive

1182
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,999
Freedom

1183
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,655
Yeah

1184
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,191
I did not believe Alec

1185
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,471
Defamation

1186
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,751
What he like

1187
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,735
Toe kick about goddess

1188
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
The guy who I

1189
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,319
This American Life

1190
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:59,647
Yeah I wouldn't be surprised like he

1191
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,415
Keeping

1192
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,999
Jared so badly that would permanently into

1193
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,119
Mr. calculation through

1194
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
Maybe.

1195
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:16,031
I killed that was kind of my theory for a bit but then he tells a story about how

1196
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,311
He's like.

1197
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:20,127
Someone's guts out and watch them die slowly

1198
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,687
And so I feel like that

1199
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,735
Doesn't quite match up with that other

1200
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,783
Even

1201
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,063
Further exaggeration

1202
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:28,831
Possibly

1203
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,855
But you know

1204
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
You know what I like

1205
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,159
Is

1206
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
The Munsters

1207
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,719
ProTech

1208
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,255
Extreme violence

1209
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
Black black

1210
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,047
What he did today

1211
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,119
Family Guy

1212
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:46,239
I have a I have another question

1213
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:56,479
Yeah if people want to hear that. Sorry that this American life is called the Jabberwocky is the name of the episode

1214
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:02,623
Alex in Wonderland

1215
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,695
Electric scooter with the Jabberwocky

1216
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:08,255
First two stories the first tortillas

1217
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,047
Add lollipop lollipop Natok

1218
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:10,815
About

1219
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,095
And I started in

1220
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,375
You know the hounding

1221
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
Ivan the second hostage

1222
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,983
StoryBots electricity

1223
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:22,335
Write as as as far as the teenage years goes

1224
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,919
One of the most interesting things now I think is

1225
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,943
How much Alex

1226
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
His dad has

1227
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,503
Become a part of the mythology

1228
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:33,343
Like his dad has been CIA dentist who talks to all these

1229
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:37,439
Lieutenant colonel's and who gets all this information that he can then pass on to

1230
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:43,839
The Alicante was the smartest kid in Texas and he was this smart and he was recruited by the FBI for UT

1231
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:50,239
Erwin spear exactly tried to get him into the globalist program cuz he was the smartest boy in Texas

1232
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,799
What is Dad said no this is evil I will not

1233
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,871
And then he told Alex all this stuff over the word actually

1234
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,943
He told someone else about it now it's overheard it at the dinner table

1235
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
This is

1236
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:06,367
More the human resource director for a while

1237
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,951
Rob Jacobson at quit

1238
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,511
Or got fired at weenie put that EEOC

1239
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,535
He complained in

1240
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:18,911
And Alex's dad was the Human Resources Director who replied to that

1241
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,215
Or was quoted in the empress

1242
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
That's about it

1243
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
I don't know if he hasn't

1244
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:26,847
Experience in Human Resources it seems like a Strange Fire

1245
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:35,295
2016

1246
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,391
Has to say about it

1247
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,303
Yeah we've been outside the studio before

1248
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,631
We've never gone in Belize gone to the building so to visit pilgrimage

1249
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,471
My parents live in Austin so it's Uno

1250
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,775
We've used that as an excuse to go in like

1251
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,311
I was really underwhelming

1252
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:00,639
I thought I would feel something being outside the studio

1253
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,175
I didn't feel anything

1254
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,991
Yeah it's funny joke until place

1255
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,783
Wish I could

1256
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,087
Smooth now but

1257
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,879
Pizza place

1258
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
For the outside

1259
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
Domestic

1260
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:16,255
That's probably for the best

1261
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,023
I mean

1262
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,583
You know what to put a neon sign up there

1263
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:24,959
Crazy conversations happened here in the middle of destroying the world

1264
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,495
Yeah

1265
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:30,591
Anyways questions I think you were getting at is did you ever meet Alex's dad

1266
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,639
Okay

1267
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
No

1268
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:42,623
It's something interesting I always want to try and unravel cuz my sense of it in the real world is just like

1269
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,671
Is that was a John Bircher from

1270
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,439
Wayback

1271
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,463
MN

1272
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,511
All the rest of the stories are basically

1273
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,047
That's kind of what I say

1274
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,839
But but I don't know

1275
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,143
I always I always like talking

1276
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,423
With people who have

1277
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,959
Some

1278
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,543
Interest in this stuff that I'm very interested in

1279
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,311
Because it's

1280
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,335
It's not

1281
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,359
Two common

1282
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,639
In my

1283
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,663
Let's a personal life

1284
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,967
Like to have people who are

1285
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,015
Willing to have an hour-long conversation

1286
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,551
About something like that

1287
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:15,391
You know a lot of times these topics are kind of

1288
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
Darker

1289
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:20,255
Uncomfortable and people Veer away from that Palazzo

1290
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:25,375
I actually had another question I wanted to to get to is this

1291
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,935
In preparation for this I like I said I re-watch

1292
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,727
The episode of The Secret rulers

1293
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,519
And one thing

1294
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,823
Really stuck out to me it's kind of chilling

1295
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,615
And it was at the end

1296
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,895
Of the of the

1297
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,663
The peace

1298
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,199
Alex is driving

1299
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,735
And he's talking normally

1300
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,039
And then he switches into performance

1301
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:43,807
It's mode

1302
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,111
Aw

1303
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,671
One time

1304
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,695
God could have caused

1305
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,719
Wasn't

1306
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,743
Dab

1307
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,815
David Barker

1308
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,631
So I can watch the wrestlers at 8

1309
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399

1310
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,495
David Goshen rail exhaustion

1311
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,031
Onyx is doing

That work ethic is insane

1341
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:23,135
The amount of work he had to put into

1342
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:28,255

01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:18,431
Anything cuz now that I think about it a number of his documentaries or just him sitting at a desk

I want to try and do a live podcast at Bohemian Grove but I don't think it's ever going to happen

1392
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:17,215
And I don't know too much about the place other than

1393

It's a connection between Bohemian Grove from the

1408
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:56,383

Connection

1414
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:17,375

Well it isn't

1424
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:32,991
Kind of

1425
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,551
Believe it almost as like a shark tank

1426
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:40,927
You know the Green Brothers like a shark tank for the powerful

1427
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:46,303
Picture ideas about power

Yeah I like most things it's actually really boring

1433
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:12,415
I just remembered one thing that stuck out to me to from Alex's obsession with the old people

1434
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,231
On the streets

1435
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,791
Now watch

1436
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:20,351

1438
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,567

PIX11

1464
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:37,151
Flashlight

1465
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:41,247
I see it is just

1466
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:47,647
One of the guys who made the whole thing they're a bunch of old dudes there's some prostate problems he doesn't want to tell everybody

1467
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,183
A part of the ritual

1468
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,327
The night before

1469
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,375
Cody's

1470
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,727
You remember why you still do those exercises you do

1471
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,263
Sadistic

1472
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,359
Crystal man

1473
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,711
Document

1474
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,991
Bacchanalia

1475
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,783
Little bit of distance

1476
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,087
The place where you can cut loose and do things like

1477
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,159
Little bit of away

1478
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,743
I hate I hate to go back to the pissing

1479
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:27,327
I mean I may need to just for the sake of like

1480
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:33,471
It's still it seems like a side thing of the ritual of like letting go of care

1481
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:37,311
You know like it's it's one of the manifestations of letting go of it's not like

1482
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
Hey

1483
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,895
Look rule number three is we piss everyone

1484
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,735
The reason that this sticks in my mind

1485
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:48,319
It's because every time Alex talks about the elites

1486
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,599
Mistreating us

1487
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:54,207
Not every time but very regularly he'll say they piss on us

1488
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
Edit

1489
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,535
Going back in and watching that

1490
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,095
Sticks out and he's had so much

1491
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,399
That these people were peeing on a street

1492
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,471
It seems like a preoccupation of his b pissed

1493
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,543
I think

1494
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:13,407
That painting is probably more appealing girlfriend

1495
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,687
The main thing

1496
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,343
Educated World reaction

1497
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,367
Procurement

1498
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:28,767
Now now I'm dreaming that it is the main thing yeah

1499
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:31,071
I'm sick of you right now

1500
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
Yeah

1501
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:34,143
I must be free to pee

1502
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:41,055
Well I'm willing to accept that it's more of a thing that I had then I realized

1503
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,591
That it's not

1504
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,663
Cisco's

1505
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,783
What other question I had was

1506
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:54,367
What what was your experience of seeing

1507
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,647
Like Alex

1508
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:56,927
Come

1509
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,951
That like

1510
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:00,767
Joining up with Trump like when he

1511
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,303
When he became a trump fan

1512
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,119
Seem

1513
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,423
Weird to you as it did

1514
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,191
Yeah

1515
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,983
It was

1516
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,263
I thought it was just

1517
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,031
Worse

1518
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,080
I felt lineup

1519
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,128
All the people I've interviewed over the edge

1520
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,968
Like if you said to be one of these people is going to have

1521
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,760
58

1522
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,320
I would definitely

1523
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
I hope it's not

1524
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,976
You hung out with knobs

1525
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,704
Lisinopril

1526
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:41,984
Of the BS

1527
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:45,824
Chuck

1528
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,592
Actually

1529
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
Yeah

1530
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:51,200
But even taking the proximity to power piece of it aside

1531
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,224
Like

1532
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,272
What are the things that I've always thought about Alex

1533
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:58,368
This is like he was Ron Paul guy for for many years you know like

1534
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:03,488
That's a really fun thing to do because Ron Paul is never going to win

1535
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,024
It's never going to

1536
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,584
To be an option for you to be the person

1537
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,144
Who is alongside the elected president

1538
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,168
You know and

1539
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,216
I wonder

1540
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:16,288
If the getting involved with Trump was because it seems like

1541
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,568
This is an impossibility

1542
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:20,640
Yeah and then they sort of backfire

1543
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,272
2016

1544
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,552
I don't know if she's happy

1545
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:31,904
Quickly or not so I can show he probably has

1546
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,184
In case you would want to be games

1547
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,000
Sure

1548
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:38,560
He was watching Alex the results

1549
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
We're coming in

1550
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,888
I'm looking more and more likely

1551
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,960
More more

1552
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,496
Worried

1553
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:47,776
Black

1554
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:48,800
Upset

1555
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,080
Overwhelmed

1556
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,944
Black history first insta

1557
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:02,624
I've made a very bad choice

1558
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:10,048
He was drunk and was like if the culmination of like a 52 hour marathon

1559
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,584
It was a disaster

1560
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,496
Yeah I did actually I did watch election Night Live

1561
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
And it was

1562
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,568
Was kind of heartbreaking

1563
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,360
For the reason

1564
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,128
That Lake

1565
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,408
It's like

1566
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:30,016
Owen Shroyer Alex Jones Rodger Stone of the up drinking champagne

1567
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:34,880
And what they were doing instead of celebrating Trump's win really was they were watching

1568
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,184
Video streams of Hillary event

1569
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,720
Where people were crying

1570
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,536
And like it was Multicultural group

1571
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,072
So folks crying

1572
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:46,144
And then it just a bunch of white people laughing and drinking champagne

1573
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,984
Juxtaposition of those images.

1574
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,776
It's something it's never really left

1575
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:56,384
Really ugly

1576
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,432
Yeah

1577
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,224
Yeah

1578
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,016
That's how you know that

1579
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:05,344
That tracks with the because they didn't enjoy Trump's win

1580
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:12,256
They had that they didn't want Trump to win but they enjoyed the winning so much as it created the same thing could laugh at

1581
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:16,352
The story that he just told about Alex getting increasingly nervous is

1582
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:19,424
Because whenever they again out later on when they're celebrating

1583
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,496
They can't just be like hooray Trump won they have to

1584
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,800
Fixate on something that they actually like

1585
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,616
Damages the tears of Multicultural curls

1586
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:28,896
God

1587
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,480
And it would have been a cash

1588
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:36,576
Bonanza if Hillary is locked

1589
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,624
Because thing in the world

1590
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,696
It was the same procedure

1591
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,000
And why did he did

1592
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,792
I'm at the

1593
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,168
What Alex is I could have watch it you and I can make more recent stories

1594
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,704
Chrysocolla

1595
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,008
Alex

1596
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,544
Let me to watch if you do that I feel like

1597
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
The domain

1598
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,408
Ready

1599
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,480
The stuff you said about

1600
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,760
Dhaka

1601
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,552
You know I just

1602
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:10,880
How to spell Eli

1603
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,672
He died I could call it still

1604
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,912
What stuff

1605
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,192
We got excited

1606
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,288
Call all boy

1607
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:34,688
Ball man get rid of it I mean it's part of the globalist plot to replace all white men

1608
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:41,088
Men with people who will always vote Democrat well that's that's just like

1609
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:45,440
Related issues

1610
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:49,024
Politician I can't talk. I'm under the

1611
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,328
Togetic cheelai

1612
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,656
Gymnast in the ballet and Sheila

1613
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,680
Lifting the other side

1614
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,960
Los Angeles

1615
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:00,032
Bus 26 hours a day so she could

1616
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,824
College

1617
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:02,848
Best

1618
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,896
It okay go to that setting

1619
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:19,744
Yeah man the amount of disgusting s*** he said in the intervening time. Between Billy mangrove

1620
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,560
7 is more than enough to justify

1621
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,120
Whatever consequences May Come

1622
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,144
Yeah

1623
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:26,912
Yeah

1624
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:33,312
I also remember him talking about you turning on him on his phone

1625
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
What email

1626
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,112
I'm not sure if he ever said

1627
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:49,696
If I called you out by name but there was stuff about like

1628
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:56,096
A journalist to lures you in with soft speaking and

1629
01:25:56,608 --> 01:26:01,728
That is stabbed him in the bathroom so it was

1630
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,520
Kind of discussion

1631
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:09,152
I always enjoy getting to tell people that Alex has talked about them

1632
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,992
Particular way

1633
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:17,344
We've got a lot of them

1634
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,368
To that I watch

1635
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:22,464
Watch too much of Sisyphus garbage

1636
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:25,536
Couple of emails deepest I got off of you.

1637
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:29,888
Waze

1638
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,704
Do that sand baby

1639
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:42,176
Loving you just heard about some of it here I mean that it clearly didn't impact you at all

1640
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:45,504
It doesn't several years later

1641
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,296
To do that

1642
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,856
The bassist

1643
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:54,464
Alex would it wouldn't be that big building David dresses

1644
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,488
Waco

1645
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
He was waiting

1646
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:59,584
Smoke right

1647
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:00,864
Melissa

1648
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:04,704
Xraw mirabai Ceiba said he had

1649
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,520
Inspired

1650
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,312
The cast of Rambo

1651
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:12,384
And he was like at your work

1652
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,456
So yes

1653
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,248
Lexington with all of that

1654
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,088

Christopher gartin the minister

1657
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,888
Yeah he would later turn on Bogue rights Alex definitely does not like that dude

1658
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,448
Little bit later on

1659
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,984
I think that there was a

1660
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,008
Strong suspicion

1661
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,848
I'm on a lot of people in The Patriot community that Beau was a fat

1662
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:47,200
Are or something along those lines you fell out of favor with a lot of

1663
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,992
The books

1664
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,808
What day was

1665
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,440
He's been on Alex's show quite a bit

1666
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
Yeah usually

1667
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,488
Apparently regular gas

1668
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,792
Indian poker

1669

Tool

1670
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,680
At the house during standoff

1671
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,984
Oh wow

1672
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,288
I didn't realize that Jack was one of them

1673
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:14,080
Let's Nacho

1674
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,896
How old is how I feel

1675
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:22,528
Which was Alexander Weber story

1676
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,856
I got to wait for check check today that he's never been to

1677
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,648
Wake up with them

1678
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,720
Local radio guy with

1679
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,256
Videotape

1680
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:35,584
Everybody on the road trip to Waco

1681
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,656
As we drove in

1682
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,680

Money and power

1701
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,720

Wow yeah

1706
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:49,824
I can totally see how you would get that impression but it's amazing to hear that but that was your

1707
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,592
Like what

1708
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:56,992
Were you were you aware like at the time I mean obviously you weren't like hey I'm meeting the end of democracy but

1709
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:00,576
Future you were you got the sense that this guy is going

1710
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:10,816
I could never do what he does

1711
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,192
Presumably improvised monologues

1712
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,752
Like how

1713
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:21,824
Always

1714
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,760
I think a lot of people who don't know like who just know from clips

1715
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:32,064
Some 700 listen to his actual she'll probably get the

Bouncing off the walls saying all kinds of

1717
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:37,952
He does repeat himself a bit and it's

1718
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,720
It's kind of

1719
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,768
But it was quite monotonous

1720
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:41,536
At times

1721
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,304
But

1722
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,632
He has the ability to make it feel kind of knew

1723
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,192
He sells the

1724
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,984
Feeling kind of

1725
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,264
Of excitement

1726
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,056
When he can

1727
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:55,616
And then sometimes you can't and he storms out of the studio

1728
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:58,432
Like that with no

1729
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,224

1749
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,376
You can made it back

1750
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:24,192
Just in time for internet

1751
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:27,264
Where was I I'm going to have to start it from

1752
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,848
I think was good

1753
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:36,480
He was he was a little less off the farm

1754
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:41,088
Then somebody's out there like Alex or her David Icke

1755
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:46,208
Humor those people do you have David I don't

1756
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,232
Alex Jones

1757
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,792
Mythological

1758
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,328
Think about that guy you wrote behold

1759
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,776
Play that the conspiracy world

1760
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:00,544
Waiting

1763
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:03,616
Yeah

1764
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:09,760
We we we covered a couple episodes of Bill Cooper's show The Hour of the time

1765
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,320
And I've listened to it number more of them

1766
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:14,624
And it was really interesting is

1767
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,416
Is that that heat

1768
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,208
He also Lacks

1769
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:21,024
A lot of that excitement that Alex brings to the table

1770
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,376
And so it's within the documentary conspiracy world the radio

1771
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,656
Conspiracy world

1772
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:30,240
It was a vacuum that nature aboard

1773
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,520
Alex

1774
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,336
Fluid

1775
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:36,896
Desperate

1776
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:37,664
Live

1777
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:42,528

1780
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,880
Being entertaining

1781
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,976
Yeah and I think that's one of the problems with the present day

1782
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:55,072
Is it now that there aren't those in impediment

1783
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:57,632
To beat your own content producer

1784
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,656
There are

1785
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:04,544
So many other people who has maybe flashy production or in the ability to

1786
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:09,152
Produce something quicker maybe to get a conspiracy theory out

1787
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,176
Any kind of

1788
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,992
Create a competition in the marketplace

1789
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,808
Of bad ideas that wasn't there before

1790
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:23,744
Yeah

1791
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:27,072
What one thought I had is

1792
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,120
Hear it hear it then I'll let you know when

1793
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,144
Even back

1794
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,168
Then he's going to

1795
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,960
Be huge or he's going to be

1796
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:33,984
I think

1797
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,544
I have a conviction

1798
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,360
But I think that there will never be another person like him

1799
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:44,480
Do you have a feeling about that like I don't think anyone could do what

1800
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,248
He's done

1801
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:51,648
I mean the whole isn't there anymore you know true

1802
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,720
Voices explained

1803
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,488
Futuristic

1804
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,280
Stop

Plasma is bad as Paul is he seems to have some restraint

1807
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,848
Like you to look at the

1808
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:15,712
Sandy Hook stuff like he was a voice who were saying stop cut this out

1809
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:24,160
Yeah I wouldn't believe that just based on people talking

1810
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,464
Cuz they're all liars but there's actually mail

1811
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,512
Alex Trebek then where Paul is trying to get him

1812
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:32,096
With it with that

1813
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:36,960
That governor on him you don't like not letting himself do these horrible things

1814
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,984
Don't know if he could

1815
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,776
Do what Alex

1816
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:45,664
I mean to a certain extent it's almost like you have to now that you have seen Alex

1817
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:50,272
Then you know the Faustian bargain of like removing all

1818
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,296
Governors

1819
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,368
Removing everything that would you know

1820
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:58,464
Inhibit you and that is going to lead to where we are now

1821
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:04,096
You know like there's so you already know how it's going to end if you choose to be Alex Jones

1822
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,888
Which is a fascinating thing for me

1823
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,192
Some people take that bargain

1824
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:13,312
Speaking of things ending maybe I

1825
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,992
Bye

1826
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:30,464
It's been an absolute Delight to talk to you today is that the idea of when we started the show that

1827
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,536
This would ever be something a conversation we would have

1828
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,816
Is its

1829
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:37,376
It's baffling to me that it wasn't even

1830
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:43,776
Close to something we thought was possible

1831
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,848
