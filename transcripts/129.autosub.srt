Frustrating

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,560

Towards rmj documentaries being released

21
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
This much time listening

23
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,048

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984

00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
My iTune

Anyways

00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776

Anyway

63
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
I was tempted

64
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,184
To do a project Camelot

65
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
Episode today

66
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
From Alex Jones

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
NeverEnding and games

68
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,448
Appropriate for us to do something like that

69
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Give a break

70
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Through the annals

71
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,080
Project Camelot

72
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,872
I don't remember which

73
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,200
Mark Richards episodes we've done

74
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
I don't want to do enough

75
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
I don't want to look through it I don't if I can do this

76
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
So I kept looking and I

77
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
How crazy is Mark Richards

78
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
Bet we could probably do one of the same episodes we did before I knew things things that are crazy but

79
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,447
Started

80
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Like because I was searching

81
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Project Camelot stuff

82
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,359
I started to find a bunch of like weird alien

83
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,759
Life affirmation

84
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,367
Maybe 20 minutes

85
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,607
I used the Power of Now is very important

86
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
Such a weird things

87
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
To discover about you

88
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215

90
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
Wait a second hold on

91
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,871
You're into motivational speakers okay

92
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
I mean let's

93
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Let's be

94
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Totally transparent

95
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Sort of

96
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
But with a grain of salt

97
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,903
I will say that burned down like sick

98
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,231
6 years ago I lost all of my books

99
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
All that was left

100
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
Eckhart Tolle

101
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
I was wandering around the streets

102
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,703
Cuz I had no home I know where to go

103
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,543
Bookstore as I am

104
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Real bumblebee

105
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
PetSmart Olathe Power of Now and I was like

106
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,759
Reeboks

107
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
You just

108
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,343
Describe how people join Scientology

109
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,743
Exactly what you just did like that but I guess I read that was right next to the power of now

110
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,071
We would never have seen you again I read it and I thought it was

111
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Define betray

112
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,751
NeverWet how much further

113
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
Respect some of the ideas

114
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Nobody puts out

115
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,175
Anyway let's not dwell too deeply in that I want

116
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,807
Have a good time I found an hour-long interview that Milo yiannopoulos

117
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
Did with Alex Jones

118
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,255
Will be fun I have to listen to him talk.

119
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
No cuz I'm not doing that

120
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
Blustery b*******

121
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
I thought it would be Alex actually opening up in

122
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,543
So weird weird thing was interviewing a

123
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Yes

124
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,639
Milo's YouTube channel

125
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,455
Gross

126
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
Just right now it's Jones

127
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,807
Relieve it being an interview was almost like his show

128
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
You know

129
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
You just spit narratives

130
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
Acted like it was organic

131
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Conversation between

132
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Two people

133
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Then

134
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,535
I stumbled on something that I

135
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
Long known as exist

136
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
But I forgot

137
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Probably

138
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
We talked about

139
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
Actually going to be an interesting lead in

140
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
Because this is something that is

141
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Mentioned

142
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
But not covered

143
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
In-N-Out

144
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
So when we do our

145
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
This what we're going to talk about today

146
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
Is referee

147
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
Preemptive

148
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Indeed

149
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
That's a great idea

150
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
In 2007

151
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,279
So what you're saying is if you listen to the show passively f***

152
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:36,447
Get on board right now otherwise be endgame documentaries going to make no sense no no

153
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
Trying to do

154
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,055
I'm trying to sell our goddamn

155
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,919
Everything is Standalone everything is fine

156
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
In 2007

157
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
I don't know if you recall

158
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
2000

159
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Not well

160
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
July 7th

161
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
2000

162
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,439
7707

163
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,679
Around the world Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio climate change

164
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
Live Earth

165
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
I was in Greece

166
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
When it happened

167
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
I was drunk on the

168
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Streets of Athens

169
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
Stumbling around

170
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,783
My brother was staying at a hostel

171
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,927
I have no idea that it was 7707

172
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Square

173
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
I made setup a giant

174
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Projector screen

175
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
The middle of Athens

176
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:39,167
Commons area

177
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Greece was still happy

178
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
Like that but

179
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Be that as it may

180
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,687
Stumbled

181
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
Whack rapper Teresa

182
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
I stumble into tons of Greeks

183
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Sitting around watching

184
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
Oh my God this is American pop culture

185
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,583
We got because I got to sleep. Those exact words

186
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,423
Okay because I saw like a Metallica in like

187
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:17,823
Thought this is not this is American pop culture

188
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,895
Any TV for like a month

189
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,735
Corinth this Tiny Town in Greece

190
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
My family

191
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
Until I was starved

192
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,623
Great

193
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,671
Nearby there's a little

194
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Like snacks and beers

195
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
And Eckhart Tolle books

196
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
Just to have beers and so I drink a bunch

197
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
Hyundai watch

198
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
Pop culture all night

199
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Scrape

200
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
At the beginning of the night

201
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
James Blunt

202
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,823
Yeah he sings baby baby it's a wild world

203
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
He covers Cat Stevens

204
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
I don't like this is terrible

205
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
Is terrible

206
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
The end of the night when it seems like most of the people are

207
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Leaving

208
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Two more beers

209
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,815
In order to help you find your way back to the house as I'm finishing up the last one

210
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
Real Cat Stevens

211
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
Comes on

212
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,615
Is Cat Stevens here I'm not entirely sure on the details powerful experience for me

213
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
Oh my God I think someone is.

214
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,015
Roy Jones jr. in the chat room

215
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
DriveTime

216
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,463
I assume he played father and son

217
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047
Tea for the Tillerman was a great album

218
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Great

219
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,703
First Cut is the Deepest

220
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Much better than Sheryl Crow

221
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Absolutely

222
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:57,919
Very powerfully moved by the entire spectacle of it and it's

223
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
In my mind

224
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Is one of the

225
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
The like

226
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
It really early beautiful mama

227
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
To my life being able to be in the middle of Greece

228
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
Among a bunch of strangers

229
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,487
Most of the number people talked to me and we had a great time

230
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
Performance by someone who I never thought I'd see

231
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Do you live again

232
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Because

233
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
Giving up on his music

234
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
This is my long way of saying that that concert

235
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,383
And now we're going to break down that concert snow

236
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,711
James Blunt also gave an interview with Milo yiannopoulos

237
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,039
We are zero calorie Arnold Palmer

238
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
To the chat room

239
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
Also

240
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
One of the

241
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Funders

242
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
And Packers

243
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,023
The Live Earth concert on 7707

244
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
Was a man by the name of David

245
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Rothschild

246
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Okay

247
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,495
He is a member of the Rothschild family

248
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,567
Son of one of the Rothschild errors

249
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
London

250
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,455
For reasons that are still unclear to me okay

251
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
He ended up going on in Fort Worth

252
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Yeah

253
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
Good goodbye

254
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,023
I don't know man how long ago

255
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,375
In preparation for it

256
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,447
Spell the unity of the world against

257
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
Climate change concert

258
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Alex

259
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
F****** John written a book about the dangers of climate change in ways that we can prepare and help

260
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Stuff like that

261
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,063
I'll give you full disclosure ahead of

262
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Getting into this

263
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Slides

264
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
And getting him onto the

265
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
Cuz I think he probably said we'll give you a platform

266
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
To promote your book

267
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,071
Or something like that

268
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
Alright

269
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Is

270
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,519
An interview between a Rothschilds are and Alex Jones

271
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
I am

272
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Stokes

273
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
She's going to

274
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
2bh

275
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
Trainwreck 70 prediction

276
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
About atonement

277
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
She's going to take

278
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
14 people are going to die

279
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,159
I think that's probably going to be the case

280
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
Is it just going to be like

281
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,559
Accusing him of all the world's ills

282
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
That'll come in

283
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,911
I don't know if uses the word think it does

284
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Use the hard drive

285
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Do now I don't

286
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
I can tell

287
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,895
David Rothschild David de Rothschild

288
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,199
Is like a really cool dude

289
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,527
Right around this time a little bit after he created a boat

290
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
Entirely made out of

291
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Recycle

292
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Plastic bottle

293
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
Okay to demonstrate

294
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,023
The

295
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
Just four more bottles or whatever

296
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,215
He seems like he's a pretty decent dude but even though I mean

297
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
Do you have enough wealth to avoid happen

298
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
I've been all that stuff

299
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,127
Fuller

300
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Necessarily mean that

301
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
The comfortable life

302
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
Like milk

303
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
I'm not.

304
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
Totally supporting him

305
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
He's an awesome

306
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,719
He did go and get like a natural path degree

307
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
You did

308
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,815
You started a couple minutes.

309
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
He was able to do all of those things

310
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
Because he had the luxury to

311
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
Middle Ground

312
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
He also

313
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
I have the possibility

314
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Just live on his ass

315
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,431
Not doing anything pretty good approach to

316
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,783
Being lucky enough to be born into wealth and it's only more people would do that

317
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
I'm just saying that

318
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
Set my prejudice against

319
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
What's the rich

320
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
Could not be higher

321
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,975
Yeah I know that

322
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
Paid for my cancer medication

323
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
That'll be like

324
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
Kill you

325
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,399
Disagree with that as a guiding principle but at the same time I think

326
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,727
You got to look at people as they are not as big

327
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Noting

328
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,639
Stanford

329
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
Yet

330
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
So

331
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
The other thing

332
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,319
I need to tell this very seriously to you ahead of

333
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
There's going to be a bunch of stuff about climate

334
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
Okay

335
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Hair trigger

336
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:34,911
Ever everyone everyone in the chat room so fat

337
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:39,775
I need for you to a year into months

338
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
Denialism makes you angry

339
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
I get that

340
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,943
But you're going to have to stay that anger

341
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
Because otherwise this isn't going to

342
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,343
Okay you're going to be screaming over these two men bickering

343
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
So so what you're asking

344
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Give me is not

345
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
To become a

346
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
1/3

347
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
Man bickering

348
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
Deal with her stupid

349
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Idiots I mean like

350
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
I know you're going to have

351
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
The feeling of wanting to scream this entire time

352
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
Read please

353
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,335
Try and let them into it's a rare occasion when a Rothschild

354
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:20,735
Are about Alex Jones Michelle with the level of risk

355
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
I appreciate that

356
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,367
Look for a 23 minutes from now

357
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
The first one

358
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Just get it out

359
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
I think you already have

360
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,399
Information War continues

361
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:50,175
Global pledge for the young people going to the concert

362
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
Wonderland

363
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,927
Child

364
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,023
Normcore

365
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
This weekend

366
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
77

367
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
4

368
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,455
Born in 1970

369
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,951
He's the youngest of the three children

370
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
Arrow shooting out

371
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Across the planet

372
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
Invigorating

373
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:00,063
Object sarcasm with witch

374
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
She said all of that stuff

375
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
Being a little bit of a dick

376
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
But it

377
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
You know it's restraint

378
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
Honestly

379
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
If I were listening

380
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
Like just

381
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
I would be like

382
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
How he's going to do a voice

383
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
David Rothschild

384
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,967
Not calling

385
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:35,135
Alex Jones is just doing his right

386
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
Over-the-air you here like

387
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,719
Oh hello it's nice

388
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
What the

389
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
Near over-the-top it

390
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Anaphora

391
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Alex Jones

392
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,423
It's are we get into we get into our adventure

393
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,983
With David Rothschild being very polite

394
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Yes

395
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,127
Phillips will eventually be his downfall

396
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,431
He's here I don't know what's going on

397
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
You must not have a Publix

398
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,759
Something like that I don't know

399
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
Yeah but let's see how the

400
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,855
Right now

401
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,279
Solideal diseasel complex

402
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Landscape

403
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
As we know it

404
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
Why I

405
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,327
I dedicated myself

406
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,703
The

407
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:30,079
Not going to eat at all

408
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,663
Alex's coming in

409
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Intubated

410
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Probably best

411
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Use your

412
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
Best or second-best

413
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
8 first

414
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,951
Who's your second-best point first leave the Haymaker for last

415
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:52,095
When you're setting up your set

416
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
In the middle you close with

417
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,471
Is first comes out there's a polls

418
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
But a lot of people aren't

419
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Convince

420
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Of climate

421
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
Yes

422
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
It's not because

423
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
Do you know

424
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,687
We talked a lot about and I think

425
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
I'm going to bring this up

426
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,759
Mislead people about it but the idea that there's a

427
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Consensus

428
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Scientists about climate

429
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Absolutely

430
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
Consistently

431
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,280
For years but there's even ExxonMobil

432
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,608
A study has ever found

433
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
Midterms us tracking

434
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
Consensus has been 91

435
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
Percent

436
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Suspicious study

437
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
Albeit one of the other thing

438
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
Things that they've studied

439
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
But there is a

440
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
Positive

441
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,664
Even the suspicious studies are above me

442
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Dim study

443
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
The correlation

444
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,064
The content

445
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
What does it there is

446
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
Positive relationship

447
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Between

448
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
He's in climate science

449
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
Believing

450
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
That they're being a

451
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,400
Experience you have

452
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
The more likely you are to

453
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
To believe that climb

454
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,080
Right right exactly

455
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
In theory

456
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,456
Course you're always going

457
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,992
To find the public doesn't

458
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
Necessarily have

459
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Step2 all of the

460
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,136
Understand

461
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,560
Basically what America says all the all the time

462
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,632
Sixty-seven percent of the population doesn't believe that

463
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Climate change

464
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
Just means that

465
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
Sixty-seven percent of the population

466
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,336
What is wrong

467
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Tobacco

468
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
Need to do a better job of

469
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Convincing people

470
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
Or the media has done everything

471
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
Impossible to keep

472
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,040
ExxonMobil

473
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,136
Spending millions of dollars at to sow dissent

474
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
Wonder why

475
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,232
Camp

476
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Climate change

477
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,624
Brain

478
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:45,408
Global warming or

479
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:56,672
So

480
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
No

481
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,304
Alex goes on to say like

482
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
It's

483
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
Hundreds of news

484
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
Pavers

485
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
White papers

486
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
Whatever Alex

487
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
What is the science

488
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
I feel like you should be asking

489
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
What is

490
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,944
He's asking I mean it goes back to what we talked about a lot like

491
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,248
It's a bad faith Quest

492
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
Cuz he doesn't want you to

493
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,624
Answer with science

494
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,440
You do right as a trap

495
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
Any question is asking as a trap

496
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,792
Course very very uncomfortable

497
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
So I don't know man

498
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
What are you

499
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,960
So far we have a very

500
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,776
Right now

501
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
The Rothschilds

502
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
Isabel and like

503
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,128
Okay I'm

504
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,968
Do my best to explain

505
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
To a child

506
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
What

507
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Climate scientists

508
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
How do I think he is coming to this

509
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,368
With nothing but the best in

510
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,928
Alex has an a

511
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
Until like

512
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
Bright sky is

513
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
This guy is a dick

514
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
That's just

515
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,912
Keep moving this is

516
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
Free video chat

517
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,752
There's no there's no Skype going

518
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
60s

519
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Free video chat

520
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,616
That. I'm saying that they're not

521
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,456
I believe so

522
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,808
Because if Rothschild could see Alex he would be like

523
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Clearly.

524
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
He's talking about like I was

525
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
The massive scandal

526
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
David robots

527
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,144
Sanaya reasonable with Alex

528
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,152
Places to eat

529
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,392
Clothing

530
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,184
Right now

531
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:14,656
England

532
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,728
Well there's always

533
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,104
When your family was so active

534
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
Already

535
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Accusatory

536
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Well

537
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
Already into

538
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
You're the reason that your family

539
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:43,072
Market

540
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,376
It's interesting that this is where Alex

541
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Ringo's

542
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
Cuz

543
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
This myth

544
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
About Nathan Ross

545
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
Child having

546
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Someone

547
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
Who could

548
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,408
You know who is at the Battle of Waterloo and then

549
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
Came

550
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,456
And told him this information

551
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,784
Not true historic

552
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Alex is bringing this up

553
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
My contacts

554
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
Of there being like

555
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
Heavy weather pattern

556
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,000
Like that

557
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,048
Bright even always driving Waterloo

558
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,144
Whenever you were causing all of the world's problems

559
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,936
Do you know why the weather

560
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
Severe triggers and

561
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
His mind

562
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
Because

563
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
He believes that the

564
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
The globalist

565
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
I've had weather weapons

566
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
Simply

567
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
No

568
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
Because

569
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
The narrative

570
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Is that

571
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
The messenger

572
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
Came to give Nathan Ross

573
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,832
Child

574
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,024
He had to bribe

575
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
A fisherman.

576
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,096
To take him through a very serious storm

577
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
That guy was

578
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
He's talking about

579
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:58,080
Yes climate change is it real

580
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,408
Because one of the Rothschilds Messengers

581
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
He's just

582
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,992
I've always been all the 6th

583
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,528
Extreme weather and stuff

584
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
Then make reference

585
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
To the Waterloo

586
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Situation

587
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,696
There is weather record

588
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,256
There wasn't a storm that day

589
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
There wasn't

590
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
Sandstorm

591
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,864
The only reference

592
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Through this

593
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,168
Is a

594
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
There is a

595
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
Periodical

596
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Periodic

597
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,104
A pamphlet that went around the Richmond

598
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
But the nom de plume Satan

599
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
It allegedly thing

600
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
Right

601
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
And

602
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
It was the basis

603
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,552
Of Nazi propaganda

604
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
Great it was the basis

605
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,184
The

606
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,768
The Rothschilds share in Waterloo

607
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,608
Alex is legitimately throwing Nazi proper

608
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,144
Buganda back in the face

609
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
Hafiz guess who is being

610
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
To me is onyx

611
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
Acceptable loss

612
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,592
So Alex has reference to Waterloo

613
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,128
Thing is clearly about

614
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,992
Storm that Nathan Rothschild or this messenger had to go through

615
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
Which version of the story

616
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
You end up

617
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Unfortunately

618
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,392
Insecure is not true

619
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
There wasn't the storm

620
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
This is

621
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,536
If I remember correctly

622
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
The messenger

623
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
Fell from the boat

624
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
And then was

625
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
That's true

626
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,264
Play Rhonda Lord allowed him to

627
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
End

628
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,336
That's why we

629
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
We have climate change

630
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
More or less

631
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,944
Bitterness and anger of the Gods

632
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,552
Not for nothing that well baby

633
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
That is the greatest

634
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
There's more.

635
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
Waterloo

636
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,680
When your family was so active all sorts of fires and storms and

637
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
Organizing

638
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,416
Taxation

639
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
Sensitive

640
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
650,000

641
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
Nathan

642
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,128
Sable weather

643
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:21,088
Or or what

644
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,920
So we have a foundational issue here

645
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
Mistake

646
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
Weather in

647
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Climate

648
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
But I mean even like I got

649
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
Westerly weather

650
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,232
Weather logical effect

651
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
Certainly

652
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:05,376
At all

653
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,216
Play a really good question for Alex to Havasu

654
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,520
And the answer to that is

655
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
Actually

656
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,104
Another explanation of how climate

657
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,152
So much

658
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
Was put into the app

659
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
Just

660
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Not the weather

661
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
But the climate

662
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
Temporary

663
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,160
Urban natural cycle

664
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,560
So much f****** debris end up in the atmosphere

665
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:39,424
Everything was much much colder immediately following

666
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Exactly

667
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
That is not

668
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,800
Weather whatever you talk about

669
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,664
Feeling sky with all of this b******* you're going to you're going

670
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
2 Chainz

671
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,480
The entire weather system

672
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
The weather

673
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,344
Absolutely climate

674
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
Is the larger issue

675
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
The volcano

676
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
Is a volcano

677
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,768
The climate is what the vault

678
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
Volcano put

679
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
To the app

680
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,632
Put all of that in the

681
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Emisphere

682
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,936
Consistently

683
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
Over and over and over again

684
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,288
Then you're going to wind up changing

685
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,312
The entire play

686
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,384
Introduce

687
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
Into the equation that already

688
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
Store balance

689
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
Nature Valley

690
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,600
On its own introduced all the

691
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
The coal-burning Oliver

692
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
You end up

693
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
Call settings

694
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:40,608
Anyway

695
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
Thanks for joining us

696
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,704
Temperature at room

697
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,568
But the situation that the first thing that I disagree with

698
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Yeah

699
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
With no with

700
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,688
Rothschild

701
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,224
In the way that he is

702
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
Describing

703
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
Picked as an ambassador

704
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,600
You have a good enough job of the simple the simple

705
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Is

706
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,952
The argument that a lot of

707
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
People say is that

708
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,280
We only have one planet so we need to take care of

709
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
The planet

710
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,840
And it's like

711
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
When is going to be fine

712
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
But I think

713
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,680
Going to

714
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:23,616
Way longer than we are here but like the ones we need to take care of

715
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,944
Is I would say

716
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:36,160
In the same way that Alex brings up the 67% in this pool don't believe in man-made climate change

717
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
You need to wait

718
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,976
Humanize it make it relatable

719
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,512
The ideas like these

720
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
Impending disasters

721
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
And stuff like that

722
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,120
People can easily dismiss that sort of stuff is like

723
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
Sensationalism

724
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,544
I don't see the proof of it happening and you make it very relatable and you make it like this

725
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,432
We need to take care of our home otherwise there's going to be a leak in the roof or whatever

726
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:04,832
Write to you understand what I'm saying maybe it's not the most accurate maybe it's not the most like

727
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
Tough talk

728
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,624
The people need

729
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
But it is

730
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
Possibly what peep

731
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
People could listen

732
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
Cookie

733
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,048
Right I feel like an appeal to Gaia

734
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
So to speak is

735
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,656
Not necessarily the best way

736
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,960
How about that

737
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:26,080
What is doing a better job of convincing people in regards to the climate change

738
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
The guys who are f******

739
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,248
Fear-mongering about how the climate change people are going to

740
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,296
To turn this into a global carbon tax

741
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,600
Or the people who are reasonably

742
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
We need to take care of the Earth

743
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,416
Who's more effect

744
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,488
Maybe the issue is climate scientist

745
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
This is

746
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,048
I think one of the big

747
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,864
I don't I don't want scientist

748
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,656
To become the other side

749
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:57,056
If that's what you're proposing

750
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
Maybe they should

751
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,152
You can lead a movement to be the other side and I think there is that voice

752
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,712
In the public sphere I think there are

753
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:07,040
Shockingly never talks about that there's all kinds

754
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
Climate Terror

755
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,624
And stuff like that

756
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
Who like

757
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
You know

758
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,256
Burning down a building or

759
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,280
Or just tag

760
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,144
There are those people who are out there

761
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Active

762
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,776
So I mean it's a smart idea

763
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,568
Weird that Alex never talked about that

764
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,640
We should all be bombing

765
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
Keystone pipe

766
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
Is that

767
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
That's a good

768
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
Nothing to say

769
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
Keystone Pipeline

770
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:41,088
Destruct on its own

771
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,624
That's clearly

772
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
Oh not the rest of us

773
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,488
I should be saying Native American

774
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Who cares

775
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:54,144
Amoebas go back to the wildlife preserve standoff

776
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
No just needed

777
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,288
Things that were sacred

778
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
Sitting next to a steak

779
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,480
Next

780
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,016
Yikes

781
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,368
I have a very difficult time cutting this into clip

782
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
Because the two of them

783
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
A bit of a back-and-forth

784
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
Define places

785
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
The cut

786
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,352
So somebody's clips

787
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
Going to be a little bit

788
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
I don't know

789
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
Little Walgreens

790
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,288
I want to present this

791
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:36,384
Contact David Rockefeller

792
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
Rockefeller

793
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
Too many David ours

794
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
Rothschild

795
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
Alex White

796
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
2

797
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,088
The idea of climbing

798
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
What's your what's your issue

799
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,440
Alex goes off on a rant

800
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,488
Doesn't really answer the question

801
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,168
What is the downed what is the downside why why don't you

802
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:09,152
I'd like to tell you number one I read the documents

803
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:19,136
Prince Bernhard was pushing before he died now course Prince Philip

804
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,464
They want to exterminate 80%

805
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,840
Misreading

806
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,192
Planet

807
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
Real quick

808
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
Just because

809
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,360
GameStop

810
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,408
Stuffies lying about right

811
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,016
Immediately thought of whenever he said

812
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,064
They're going to bring about neo-feudalism

813
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:54,720
If you recall the guy that we talked about the Russian guy who wrote for what's his face again

814
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,816
Who wrote for Duggan's propaganda website

815
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
Malthus

816
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,024
Real quick I want to talk about that for a second

817
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,072
Alex

818
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,608
Patriots

819
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
Created a

820
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,424
Boogeyman in the form of globalist

821
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,520
We all need to take care of this

822
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,104
Second president

823
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,672
Destroy your house they don't know.

824
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
Hellboy

825
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
That is

826
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,592
Way too soon to say

827
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:20,992
This is early in the interview correct a spoiler alert that I probably

828
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,016
They shouldn't give you

829
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,320
The interview goes like 40

830
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:28,416
How is that possible David Rothschild

831
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
This was supposed to be 10

832
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,536
So at this point

833
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
I think Alex

834
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,912
Of the Rothschild house

835
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,680
Brothers

836
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,216
But he's also

837
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
David Rothschild

838
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:49,152
He thinks it's a 10 minute interview and so he's got to get his licks in before it goes off

839
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,224
Cuz he can't have a Rothschild on his show and not attacking

840
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,296
Guy being completely polite

841
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,624
And just saying this is the reason why we believe in

842
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
Climate change

843
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
I've gone and

844
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,208
I got across the

845
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
The polls

846
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
Yeah if you look at the science

847
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
If you really look at it there

848
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,448
90 goes into complaining later about the idea of greenhouse gases

849
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
And all that stuff that

850
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,520
The rudimentary version of stuff out

851
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
What should understand

852
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,104
Cycle that's a tiny piece of it

853
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,176
Solar flares dad

854
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
I mean

855
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
It's not

856
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,784
Zennies it's always funny

857
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,832
Whenever you get this kind of

858
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
Is like

859
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,672
Okay this guy it has

860
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
Is traveled around the world

861
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
Turn people from many different

862
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,352
Science specialties

863
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
Who is spoken to

864
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Geologist

865
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
Spoken to climatology

866
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,728
Who is spoken to Ocean

867
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,032
Oceanologist like all of this stuff

868
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
So many different

869
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,640
Has stayed in Austin

870
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,223
Maybe read a book travel Alex Jones is in

871
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,295
Forget my dude

872
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
He is talk

873
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,855
Lord monckton right

874
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:09,279
Letter from the house with lower more specifically in the way the

875
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,303
These conversations

876
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,583
You know like Alex

877
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,375
Is a farm

878
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
Diversion

879
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,959
Guy in a small town saying that

880
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
Essentially global

881
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
Trying to

882
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,567
Access into

883
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
Slavery

884
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,127
Who is never gone

885
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:30,271
Section of the show

886
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:36,671
I'm not your slave Rothschild

887
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,487
It feels like he should have hung up there right

888
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,327
I'll be honest here you should have maybe

889
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:48,959
What I hung up if you hang up at that point you kind of give Alex Potter

890
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,519
Exactly

891
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
Cuz I think I would have hung up but

892
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,151
Before I hung up out of bed like

893
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,431
Yes you are at

894
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,455
And then hung up

895
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,247
Great

896
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,551
Rothschild

897
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
Sticks around

898
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,327
Any in the last clip for Alex

899
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,351
Ended up screaming

900
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,631
I'm not your slave

901
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,911
Music

902
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Your

903
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
You're peeing

904
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
You're into denial

905
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,031
This is Ludacris

906
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
So anyway

907
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,679
Teresa

908
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
You cannot deny

909
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,031
Species

910
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479
Community

911
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
And about maybe

912
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,071
Jason Brown

913
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,031
About how his family-owned oil well

914
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,871
And then I have a

915
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,687
And also ExxonMobil is paid a bunch

916
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,479
To the money to the organization

917
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
Works for the TSA

918
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
Paula CA

919
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,135
Advisor for or whatever so he has

920
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
Company money coming in

921
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,207
I'm supporting him

922
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,023
Alex Jones broadcast

923
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
The Genesis

924
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,375
Is Communications network resources

925
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
They also have

926
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
Oil wells

927
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,567
I'm not 100% sure on that but next time

928
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,895
I found some documents that indicate the

929
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,687
Midas resources own

930
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
Samoyed

931
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,015
I need

932
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,551
I need more documentation

933
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
I just found something

934
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
The foil.

935
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,719
Is there an outside possibility that

936
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
Another mighty

937
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Just resources

938
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,559
Maybe but I don't know why

939
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,119
I found another Midas resources

940
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
Remaining calm

941
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:27,935
Australia

942
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,727
I don't know why these for your

943
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
Come up with them

944
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,079
I don't know

945
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,127
Interest anyway

946
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:41,247
Alex

947
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,551
Chimeras are going to take you down

948
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
David Rothschild

949
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,111
I care about the environment

950
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
And how I care about it

951
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,207
Is warning you about that

952
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,535
And also I'm going to use Nazi propaganda

953
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,887
Whistler your family and then claim that is just about your family trying

954
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,423
To create social control

955
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,959
In order to create a.

956
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
You got a Nazi

957
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055
And like I said we'll go over in Greek

958
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
Detail those things

959
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
The Man games

960
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,407
Stuff about the elimination of 80% of the Paw

961
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
Population

962
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
Fleet horseshoe

963
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
And it's just Alex Jones

964
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Don't know how to read

965
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,623
One thing that we will talk about I can't explain any of this

966
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,927
One thing that we will talk about that game

967
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
I will say

968
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,023
Maybe it's not a bad idea

969
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,815
You will probably pause

970
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
Is it that and I will say

971
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
A little hasty

972
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:14,175
Bankrolling

973
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,495
I've been a lot of places

974
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Wolf

975
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
There's a lot of that

976
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
A lot of that going on

977
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,959
I got the quest

978
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
Also

979
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,687
Rothschild

980
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,223
Have you ever left Texas

981
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,271
Might be a little bit

982
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,927
Really projector

983
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,487
Sing his own insecurities about I haven't really done

984
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
You're projecting

985
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
So much

986
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,287
Hahaha

987
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:50,687
So at least you got that one in there David before you got

988
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711
Yeah

989
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:58,623
He made that boat out of recycled plastic

990
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,671
Something about chimera

991
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,719
You become part of the

992
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:06,559
David Rothschild is not dead he is just part of

993
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
Panther

994
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
Rothschild

995
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,471
What else you got

996
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,567
Yeah let him fly

997
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:25,247
Just getting done with a stupid rant about to how all these

998
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,271
Aldi's

999
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,063
Climate change

1000
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,599
People all want YouTube

1001
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
For the polar bears

1002
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,719
Propaganda

1003
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
12 vets

1004
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,631
Almost every man book

1005
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,959
Especially ones that are around water

1006
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,287
Booyakasha

1007
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,103
Well if the issue is also more than like

1008
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,639
As ice flows

1009
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Melt

1010
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,175
What have you

1011
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
They have less access

1012
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
To where they get there

1013
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,831
Destroy a habitat

1014
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,855
That usually that is

1015
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,135
Is more about destroying the

1016
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Disruptive

1017
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Skip

1018
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,023
I just got it.

1019
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,815
Because I can't have

1020
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,583
440

1021
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,655
This is right after that

1022
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,679
After his polar bear

1023
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,447
Riff

1024
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,199
Gorgeous

1025
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:34,367
Cross-species

1026
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:39,999
Forrest I am worried about

1027
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:01,759
Ancestors dead

1028
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,391
I think it's the common translation

1029
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Rothschild

1030
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,207
I believe

1031
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,023
I'm not entirely sure but

1032
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Conspiracy

1033
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,095
I don't know if it's actually the translation

1034
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,375
But I can tell you this

1035
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,447
When you're getting worked up and yelling at somebody

1036
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,751
Configure money changing ancestors

1037
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,775
That's f******

1038
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:59,359
That's worse than a hard Jew

1039
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,407
Really bad

1040
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
To me is like

1041
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
Oh boy

1042
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,575
I can't believe that they go to Commercial and Rothschild still

1043
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,623
After that

1044
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,695
We have to do The Merchant of Venice bci's to

1045
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:20,095
What is wrong with you

1046
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
Brittany

1047
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,239
I wish I had this kind of time on my hands

1048
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:31,103
I was supposed to do 10 minutes with Alex Jones you started screaming at me and like

1049
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
Temperature

1050
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,783
How many years

1051
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,087
Enikos

1052
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,207
You enjoy me red shield

1053
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,535
The big thing that Alex is doing their is appealing

1054
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,327
To like you're weak

1055
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,215
Like if you don't stay on the line that's because your weekend I'm just going to dunk on you for being weak

1056
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,239
Right

1057
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
You're too afraid of

1058
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,543
You're not a

1059
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,591
Semantics

1060
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,127
It just out-and-out Integra

1061
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,991
Which it doesn't work with David Rothschild there cuz he's not taking

1062
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:13,343
Yelling at him like you're stupid or anything

1063
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,879
But for some reason

1064
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,415
Patiently trying to

1065
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
Explain to it

1066
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,207
Child what is

1067
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,255
Is going on for some reason he still doesn't

1068
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,791
Hang up I don't understand

1069
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,327
So they go to commercial

1070
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,119
And then they Come Back Inn hours

1071
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,911
Go back from the break really Petty

1072
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,959
But then he gets conciliatory

1073
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
For unknown reasons

1074
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,567
Like I have to imagine over the break he was like

1075
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
I'm sorry

1076
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:39,711
Of course

1077
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,319
I don't know I think it's

1078
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:47,135
It's probably more like Alex had no idea

1079
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:47,903
Going to stick around

1080
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,463
This is not going to wait

1081
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:56,863
He didn't talk to him during a commercial break is 3 minutes

1082
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
During the commercial

1083
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,751
Alex did not expect this interview to go this

1084
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
Alex has been

1085
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,383
Yeah this entire time

1086
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,431
You are weak

1087
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,759
A look at how much of a man I am going to run away

1088
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,855
I really do

1089
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,135
Exactly

1090
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:25,023
I'm still here

1091
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,047
Keep this level of enter

1092
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,327
Energy up so

1093
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
Let's talk now

1094
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,495
Might be that might be a pretty good

1095
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,287
Something I'm coming back from

1096
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:43,455
Because there's a war on for your mind and I hate the Jews

1097
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,735
What most powerful

1098
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:51,135
Powerball

1099
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:03,423
Global ad campaign

1100
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:10,079
It's official.

1101
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,895
Pictures for them

1102
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,711
Rothschild

1103
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
Fluoride

1104
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,039
Go ahead

1105
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
This is

1106
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:27,999
Every British joke about how polite British people are

1107
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,047
Like this is every single

1108
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,327
Even there

1109
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,351
That's okay

1110
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
Alright

1111
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,215
You're going to act like a child so

1112
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:43,615
But I guess that's where we're going to that goes

1113
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,663
Why would you write a book

1114
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
Plan is

1115
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,223
Keep people from learn

1116
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,527
Is very counterintuitive

1117
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,367
Just for a little bit

1118
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:57,951
Facebook in a little bit

1119
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
Talking point

1120
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,511
And David tries

1121
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:06,655
I think you have to look at all the other things

1122
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,751
Music free

1123
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,735
Great job opportunity

1124
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,551
Have a win-win situation

1125
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,815
Is it

1126
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,823
Cuz we need to stop

1127
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,663
He's hitting that a little bit hard but at the same time

1128
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,711
Do that's that's the reason

1129
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:55,039
How many people

1130
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
Change game

1131
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:03,487
To all of this

1132
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:06,047
Opposition b******* is because like

1133
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,583
Oh I got a lot to lose like

1134
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,399
He's as Rothschild

1135
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,447
Before where we are now

1136
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:16,543
Even then cleanup you wasn't growing anywhere near as fast as

1137
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,311
Is it is right now

1138
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,591
And right now it's

1139
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
Bloating

1140
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:23,455
Of course the best thing economically is to invest in

1141
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Clean energy

1142
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,271
We're not doing that

1143
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,879
Instead Trump has gone so far backwards it is offense

1144
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
Beautiful

1145
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,695
Clean Coal

1146
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
Three words

1147
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,767
Three words

1148
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,327
We can't just continue to talk about

1149
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,375
How how Trump is

1150
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,655
Dealing

1151
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
It's from people

1152
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,727
Like if you want to talk about job creation

1153
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,799
F****** subsidized

1154
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,615
Creating all of these f****** jobs if that's going to be

1155
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:56,223
It's all about creating jobs or whatever it is you do anymore

1156
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,271
If your subsidized cleaners if you took

1157
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:03,135
Half of the subsidies that you give to boil and cold and all that b*******

1158
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,927
And gave it to clean energy

1159
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,463
Go banana

1160
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
Rebecca quick

1161
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,887
Your bottom line by incentivizing

1162
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,015
Let me be clear on this

1163
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:36,671
A renewable energy

1164
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,743
Carburetor

1165
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:25,823
Solar cycle

1166
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:03,199
By Major scientists of my Channel 4

1167
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,687
The glaciers on Greenland

1168
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
Your boy

1169
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,895
So that's actually a really interesting

1170
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,455
Funerals in increasing

1171
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,503
CO2

1172
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,807
Hey right now we're in the little ice age

1173
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,695
Coming up over and over again like recently was

1174
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,719
Steven

1175
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,511
Crowder on louder with Crowder

1176
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,167
Is it is a horrible

1177
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,775
He recently on his website

1178
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,311
Someone wrote about that

1179
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,591
About

1180
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,639
CO2

1181
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:46,879
They got their information from an article in a tabloid called

1182
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,903
The UK Express

1183
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,487
The satirical article

1184
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:57,631
Written by a guy who also wrote that such articles as moon is Hollow

1185
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,167
That sounds right

1186
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,263
97%

1187
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,311
Are aliens green or solar energy

1188
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,383
Images of monster UFOs circling son emerge

1189
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:09,919
Alright that's okay

1190
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:13,759
These claims

1191
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:19,135
We're source to Evan claimed it was NASA

1192
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
The Onion

1193
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
Is

1194
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:24,255
Reality there's

1195
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,535
Pretty decent

1196
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
Chance

1197
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,095
Alex got his sword

1198
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
Similar

1199
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,423
This piece from

1200
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,191
Express

1201
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,495
2015

1202
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,519
ESPYs

1203
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,055
They probably came from

1204
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,591
Proto satirical

1205
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,127
Using the same

1206
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,663
Tired premise

1207
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:46,783
Just misreading a an actual report

1208
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
Entirely

1209
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,599
Because there are there are sound

1210
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
There's some reports

1211
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
Come out that you could

1212
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,231
Misread but it'd be way too difficult

1213
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,255
Figure out exactly what

1214
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
How do you say

1215
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:57,791
It's just interesting

1216
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,583
Difficult

1217
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,607
The CO2 burning

1218
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
Causes Cooling

1219
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
And keeps coming

1220
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,567
But be that as it may

1221
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
Should so many

1222
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
It's it's

1223
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,943
Immensely frustrating

1224
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,503
Because and this is this is another

1225
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
This is another b*******

1226
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,319
Think about it

1227
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,343
Alex just says

1228
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,111
No

1229
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
2 facts

1230
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,159
Right

1231
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,463
Just look

1232
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,511
You got your science I've got mice

1233
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,327
My sinuses just

1234
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,095
She's good as yours

1235
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,399
My science is

1236
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
Made up

1237
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,447
Jim

1238
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,239
He's a lord

1239
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,519
What is science

1240
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
Is what Alex

1241
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,311
She's always ask

1242
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,639
It's like seriously what is it is it

1243
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:50,271
What what are we do are you studying things or are you just saying

1244
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,855
You know what's the problem is that the scientific process

1245
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,623
Requires like

1246
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,671
Repeatability

1247
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
Could ever imagine doing

1248
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,999
Something difficult

1249
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:03,839
Twice a review to my parents and that's

1250
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,143
I can do that

1251
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:11,007
So it is next by we learned that people is a scam created by British

1252
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,031
Petroleum

1253
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,151
Still struggle with why the f*** hasn't David Rothschild hung up the phone

1254
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:25,599
280

1255
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591
You just said

1256
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,639
Well that's because he doesn't know what he's argued

1257
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,759
What we're saying is CO2 elevated levels

1258
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:49,311
Please chicken out please again

1259
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,127
That would be the best thing that could happen for me

1260
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
Please do this don't

1261
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,479
Stick around please Alex is like so pissed off

1262
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:03,647
Come Around by this point he would have loved her perfect opportunity for us

1263
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,743
Chicken out

1264
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,559
They will tell you that

1265
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:13,119
Does a pretty terrible

1266
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,679
But there's no other way for this to go because

1267
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:20,287
I think you're totally right he has to escalate it and keep the

1268
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
I can't

1269
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,871
Not to have the upper hand whenever this

1270
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,735
Position that we're in

1271
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,015
But

1272
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,343
So when they go to Commercial and they come back

1273
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,623
Here is Whitley

1274
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:38,463
You can you can make whatever arguments you want they're about

1275
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,767
You know

1276
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,303
In terms of his rhetoric

1277
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,327
Rothschild

1278
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:47,679
You know you can say that that's fine there's an interesting conversation to have there

1279
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,959
I don't think it's wrong

1280
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:52,543
But I will say that I think he says

1281
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,335
Totally wrong in this neck

1282
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,895
He has to go to the play

1283
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,015
No it's just in passing and it's not

1284
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,439
I'm so like about that clip

1285
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,463
Play boys hymns

1286
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
Find me a science

1287
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,303
Because that is not a

1288
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
Textable

1289
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
Against

1290
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:16,863
These are

1291
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,983
There's always going to be right

1292
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,007
The scientist but

1293
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:26,591
But if you if you say that they're going to find

1294
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
And then

1295
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,127
You're going to have

1296
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,407
How to say okay well

1297
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
Here's their source

1298
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:34,015
This source is not pure review door if it is pure of you.

1299
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,807
It's been debunked boring girl talk

1300
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,831
Stuff

1301
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,647
The moment that you engage on

1302
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
Level

1303
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,279
But unfortunately because David Rothschild gets

1304
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,815
The order of the planets wrong in

1305
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,119
In passing

1306
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:53,983
He's going to go to town but it's the only thing that brings up whenever he discussed

1307
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,007
Is this interview

1308
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:58,079
He thinks Mercury is father

1309
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,407
Closer to the Sun than Earth

1310
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:02,943
Anyway

1311
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,903
Discovery Channel

1312
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,311
Faster than ours

1313
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,383
When I'm at the Moon to Saturn and Jupiter

1314
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:41,855
Rothschild

1315
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,863
Define right

1316
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:57,471
Continuous

1317
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,591
Found that there is

1318
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,359
Melting

1319
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,383
S*** on Mars

1320
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,223
Here's why it matters

1321
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:08,991
Because Alex

1322
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:13,855
To use this point as being like

1323
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,415
I'd like a we're causing that

1324
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,999
We're causing put stuff to Melton and it's stupid

1325
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:20,767
Because

1326
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,535
No one is

1327
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,071
Disputing the idea that the

1328
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,607
Causes

1329
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,911
You know like that that sort of thing

1330
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,751
Look

1331
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,287
The Sun causes heat

1332
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,823
He probably would say no.

1333
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,735
Songs Frozen

1334
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,319
The issue is

1335
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,671
Specific numbers in front of me and I don't think I could

1336
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,463
Explain this all the science

1337
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:51,999
I did

1338
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
Future climate scientist

1339
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,655
To figure out o this is the portion of increase the

1340
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
It's caused by

1341
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
The solar

1342
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,471
Affluent

1343
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:04,031
Here's the amount that's caused by CO2

1344
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,847
Here's what's caused by the increase in CO2

1345
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:11,455
No there's been deforestation that actually bumps us down weirdly

1346
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,807
Aerosolization

1347
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,367
Reflect light back into space

1348
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:24,767
It brings it down a little bit story out

1349
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,071
Figure out where the

1350
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:29,887
The stop is so this one here this beginning one

1351
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,655
First one

1352
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
The Sun

1353
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Part

1354
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
Check the other planet

1355
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,495
Right

1356
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,263
Tugboat

1357
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,055
Testable

1358
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,079
Minimal Park

1359
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,359
That is

1360
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
Besotted

1361
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,175
Who plays in our own

1362
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:42,943
Climate change

1363
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,479
As opposed to the other piece

1364
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,015
But have much more

1365
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:46,783
The consequences

1366
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,551
Cosby

1367
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,343
Are being affected

1368
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
The planet

1369
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,415
Also Mars

1370
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,463
An interesting planet

1371
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,791
Everything

1372
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,095
Atmosphere which means there's very little thermal inertia

1373
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,631
The climate is much more

1374
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,655
Susceptible to change

1375
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,679
Caused by

1376
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,215
External

1377
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,287
That's the reason

1378
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,591
Life exists here and not there

1379
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:13,151
Bright and also here's the other part like

1380
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:19,039
David Rothschild is wrong in terms of like the

1381
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
Orbitz

1382
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:22,879
Perfect Circle

1383
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,927
And so sometimes

1384
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,487
Planets are closer to the Sun than others

1385
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,279
And sometimes bars it

1386
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,071
Because it has an orbit

1387
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,863
Distance

1388
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,631
Between

1389
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,727
It's closer than

1390
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:41,823
We are too also means

1391
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,591
Is that certain

1392
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,639
Times are going to be much

1393
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,407
Warmer is it

1394
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,527
The Sun the Earth is going to be

1395
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,295
Hotter it's

1396
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:52,831
Call Dara.

1397
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
I had an Amana

1398
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,671
Make device to remember the order

1399
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:57,951
So I wouldn't have

1400
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:58,975
By David Ross

1401
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
Rothschild

1402
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,535
Really what was that

1403
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:05,119
I am ashamed of this but I came up with it in like 5th grade

1404
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:07,935
Is what was it

1405
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,983
I my very erotic monkey Jackson

1406
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,031
Best pillow

1407
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,567
It works

1408
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,663
And it just stuck with me

1409
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:22,527
But it's hard to forget once you hear that is that your brain

1410
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,367
Brake fuel line

1411
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:30,719
Mentality

1412
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
Respect your opinion

1413
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,311
If you look at the sign

1414
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:57,087
The police's about planet the company

1415
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,903
Definitely think

1416
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,583
Accompany

1417
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,399
That's a very important

1418
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,935
Pizza Vista Alex never

1419
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:12,959
Of course not

1420
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,239
The climatic stuff

1421
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,031
Carbontex Duffy's

1422
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,311
You

1423
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,615
What's another

1424
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,151
It's polluting business

1425
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,831
Assistant

1426
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,295
Your children

1427
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:18,495
Married

1428
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
What's your favorite song

1429
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:27,711
I think it's going to be something along the lines of

1430
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,271
You p**** ass holes says what

1431
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,647
But I heard him say that I'm like

1432
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:42,047
Man playground time is, childish

1433
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,863
We have 10 minutes of audio lag

1434
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,655
Haha into clips

1435
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,679
Cuz I just couldn't cut him off

1436
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,983
This is just

1437
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:53,311
The first one is labeled this is a such a mess

1438
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,871
Evan the next one is

1439
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,919
Disastrous M2 the call

1440
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:02,015
So you got to look forward to

1441
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:06,623
It's never it's never going to help me when I need to find

1442
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:11,999
Six months from now if I can find one of these clips what do they say this is a mess

1443
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:12,767
Don't help

1444
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,047
That's it.

1445
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
Argument

1446
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,143
He's always like

1447
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,679
Look at the Sun

1448
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
Look at the Sun

1449
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,727
If Alex

1450
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,263
Capable of looking at

1451
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,311
It would already be right

1452
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,663
Fifty-seven percent of people at this time who don't think man-made climate

1453
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,479
Of looking

1454
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,783
It wouldn't be an issue

1455
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,575
Be done

1456
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,855
That's why they are

1457
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
You can't

1458
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,719
Like there's no way

1459
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,791
Kicking and screaming

1460
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,815
To survive

1461
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,607
Because they're going

1462
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,423
Look

1463
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,191
That's

1464
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,543
For being more alarmist

1465
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
Is

1466
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,847
Less about

1467
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,871
This is how we should

1468
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,895
Convince

1469
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,687
My suspicions

1470
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
That beat

1471
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,991
Cuz scientist

1472
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,551
Have received

1473
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
Blowback

1474
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,879
Search of a fight all across the board

1475
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,415
They've been far more

1476
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,183
Conservative

1477
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,463
In the way that their couch

1478
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:20,863
What about of them when they're wrong about anything

1479
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,167
So sure and so conservative

1480
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,191
They wind up

1481
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,471
Underselling

1482
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
The issue

1483
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
Like if you say

1484
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:30,591
The climate is going to be destroyed

1485
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:34,431
What you should be saying is that the refugee issue in

1486
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:37,503
2015 or 2025

1487
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,527
Is going to be so on

1488
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,295
Untenable

1489
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,087
The world is going to

1490
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,367
Eat itself alive

1491
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:44,415
Population is not going to

1492
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,951
To be destroyed by

1493
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,719
Climate change

1494
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,999
It's going to be destroyed

1495
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:48,767
By the way

1496
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,791
Climate change

1497
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,583
Nexstar political set

1498
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,703
With a serious with all of the

1499
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,983
These places when you start

1500
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,263
Massive drought

1501
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
That last

1502
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,311
For a long time

1503
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,591
You end up seeing this place

1504
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,871
When you

1505
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,431
Displacement you see people being f***

1506
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
2 people who have

1507
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
Nobody likes

1508
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,575
Refugees apparently everybody hates immigrant

1509
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,599
Send this f****** country

1510
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,415
What is going to destroy it

1511
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,951
It's not going to be massive

1512
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,511
Weather patterns is going to be the small things

1513
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,559
That you don't rip not small things but

1514
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:25,375
These these long-term things that you don't really

1515
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:26,911
The main

1516
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,727
The main result of climate

1517
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,263
Change

1518
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,567
The

1519
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,335
Like

1520
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,615
Your set your talk

1521
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,663
Droughts and stuff like that

1522
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:40,223
If you look at the history of like let's say China

1523
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,247
Even in

1524
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,271
Non

1525
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:46,111
Climate change

1526
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,391
Massive drops that have left

1527
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,415
The millions and millions

1528
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:53,791
Now you see that pattern of weather shifting a little bit worse than it

1529
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,583
MC millions and millions

1530
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,607
Tens of Millions

1531
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,375
Dying

1532
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,959
That that extending into parts of Russia

1533
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,751
You know that's what those weather pattern

1534
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,287
I'm going to end up with

1535
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:05,823
Everyone's

1536
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,639
Do I get a really interesting

1537
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,199
Sing today about Finland

1538
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,527
And the way that they responded to

1539
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,295
The starvation

1540
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
Experience

1541
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,391
40 years ago something

1542
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,159
Along those lines

1543
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,719
And the way that they reacted to it is

1544
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,791
They're like the argument was there now

1545
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
Nationalist

1546
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,839
Much like

1547
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,119
You know

1548
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,655
Nationalism

1549
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,447
Born out of

1550
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,727
Destruction

1551
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,263
It's like we it's up to

1552
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,031
Against the world.

1553
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,079
Their nationalist however

1554
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,871
We're run by college professor

1555
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:44,479
And all the sudden in that time frame now Finland is

1556
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,807
In the top five in every possible category

1557
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,855
Successful

1558
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,391
Nation probably

1559
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:52,927
It's

1560
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:59,327
It's so it's so

1561
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,631
Bases you will wind up building something

1562
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,655
That is so much

1563
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,935
Much more solid

1564
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:06,239
And so much more

1565
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,007
Stable

1566
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,311
You could

1567
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
Let not

1568
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847
Please run the government

1569
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,127
That's also

1570
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,663
That's also a possibility

1571
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:16,991
Cuz this is the

1572
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,575
It's a little long

1573
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:25,951
One more question for you

1574
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,559
The fact that

1575
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,799
NASA

1576
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,223
Shower system warming and its

1577
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,927
Record show

1578
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,119
Sorry recording glitch

1579
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:08,959
Lots of carbon dioxide

1580
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,519
Muddying of the issue

1581
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:15,104
He gets into

1582
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,640
We are now in a carbon

1583
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,736
So that's that's what happened

1584
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,064
Really been in somewhat of a dead

1585
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,440
At the North Pole and the South Pole

1586
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:53,760
Ears

1587
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,040
Weekend

1588
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,112
Very stable

1589
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:42,400
Directions incredible

1590
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,936
Weld

1591
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,064
Differential differential

1592
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,520
We have one planet

1593
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:24,896
We know the office

1594
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,688
Change radio

1595
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,456
Here's working

1596
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:01,248
Real ugly

1597
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,016
This is where it's going to go

1598
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,160
He's calling

1599
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:15,072
I'm afraid I

1600
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,352
I just want to tell you something

1601
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,632
That is

1602
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,472
All of that

1603
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:57,824
Like that

1604
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,104
Not going to end well

1605
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,384
Tell you something

1606
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:06,784
You're great guy you know what I really think

1607
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,600
I love that he's been in a relationship

1608
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:13,696
He's been on the line for over half an hour and like just been putting up with Alex's

1609
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,720
Patty abuse

1610
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,744
And nonsense

1611
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,304
Circular thinking all this diversion

1612
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:22,656
In arguments whenever he's trying to make a point to some other nonsense

1613
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,472
I'm finally he's just like

1614
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,752
I got to go

1615
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,544
You don't have any common sense

1616
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,336
This is this is not worth it

1617
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,808
I've got a guy got to go

1618
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,088
Mallory tell you this

1619
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:41,856
He doesn't go

1620
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,768
You still on the line

1621
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,816
Until they go out to commercial break

1622
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:51,840
Which

1623
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:54,400
Is weird but he's I got to go and then here's why

1624
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:05,920
Your family has caused a lot of pain in this world

1625
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,016
Look what you're doing

1626
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:14,112
I love that he's like your family is caused a lot of problem

1627
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:15,904
The time in Napoleon

1628
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:20,512
Talking about and I loved David Rothschild

1629
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,280
Response was

1630
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,048
Okay

1631
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:27,680
He hasn't heard all this stuff before

1632
01:25:56,096 --> 01:26:00,704
Email

1633
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,728
Alarm

1634
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,752
You can come and join us

1635
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:11,968
He's coming family reunions

1636
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,736
Alex

1637
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,760
I will fucken take him up on

1638
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:15,040
Hilarious

1639
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
There is no

1640
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,624
Cannot do that

1641
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,672
Because if they were kind to him

1642
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:25,792
It would be just like if it like it's just like the Nation of Islam

1643
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:29,120
You know what they want if he went to the family reunions

1644
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:35,520
Are the Rothschilds

1645
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:41,664
I used to say they were globalists but I'll tell you what they're actually

1646
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:48,320
Secret infoworld secret Patriots who owns child

1647
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,624
Apply for the Patriot

1648
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:55,232
Flag entire worldview

1649
01:26:55,744 --> 01:27:00,864
Such nonsense so you know what I bet

1650
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,144
Which we all know he is

1651
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,680
He's actually

1652
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,776
I found the clip it I'm not playing here

1653
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,848
Estrella show I don't remember exactly what it was but

1654
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,640
It's definitely during the presidential

1655
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,408
Campaign

1656
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:15,456
And Alex has Daniel estulin

1657
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,760
Went on who's the guy who's a Bilderberg

1658
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,832
Researcher

1659
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:22,880
Games

1660
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,904
But I do

1661
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,952
I don't know how I didn't catch this interview

1662
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,232
But Daniel estulin

1663
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,048
Hillary Clinton

1664
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,096
Is back by the Rockefellers

1665
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,120
I'm Trump

1666
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,400
Is backed by the Rothschild

1667
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:37,728
Another Rothschilds are actually on the good side of things

1668
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,752
It's like

1669
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:41,056
Alex is nodding and being like you

1670
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,456
That's nonsense

1671
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,224
There's no

1672
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,016
Ruler

1673
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,296
Alright other than bigotry

1674
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,880
Coming to dinner

1675
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,648
But

1676
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,416
Alex

1677
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:58,720
Merryweather rocket

1678
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,488
Exactly

1679
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,512
Oh yeah

1680
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,560
So anyway

1681
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,840
I love this

1682
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,472
I think it's really interesting to point out I saw this in the chat room that

1683
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,496
David Rothschild

1684
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,520
Does making

1685
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,824
Do not hate the ultra-rich so much

1686
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,128
Right and I think it is important

1687
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:18,176
To remember that they are people

1688
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:18,944
Still

1689
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:25,344
And often people of good humor and I think on a case-by-case basis someone like David

1690
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,624
Could be

1691
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,904
Using his wealth

1692
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,184
And his time and effort

1693
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
It's in really good

1694
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,512
Soup like ways that you would support

1695
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,072
Probably have a really good

1696
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,864
Sense of humor about himself

1697
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,936
And be well-adjusted and a pretty cool guy

1698
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,984
It seems like that's possible

1699
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:42,752
Even if

1700
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,032
Unattainable

1701
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,056
Strata of

1702
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,848
I've been born into Billy

1703
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,384
You know it's not

1704
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,920
If it's not mutually exclusive

1705
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,504
It's a percent

1706
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,296
Percentage is bad

1707
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,064
Right

1708
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:56,832
Listen

1709
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,112
Find me a rich person

1710
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,392
And I'll look into it

1711
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
Lego

1712
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,976
97% of rich people agree that we

1713
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:07,584
Tell rich people is that what I'm saying

1714
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,352
Statistics from

1715
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:24,736
Northern California

1716
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:15,168
Your family

1717
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:20,800
The strictly speaking

1718
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:25,408
You guys are worth trillions of dollars

1719
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,272
So Alex is

1720
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:06,880
Belief that the Rothschilds run

1721
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:12,000
He's right into the 5G

1722
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,536
Do bankers conspiracy

1723
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:16,608
I found this really interesting breakdown

1724
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,656
Like these claims

1725
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,936
Things with the Rothschilds

1726
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,728
Own the

1727
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,008
Monetary fund

1728
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:26,592
And all that

1729
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,872
Will they keep

1730
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,640
Like

1731
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,176
The people who make these claims

1732
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:30,944
Keep reference

1733
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:33,504
Rothschild Bank

1734
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,320
Those Banks Donuts

1735
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:40,160
Do they keep referencing like these ads what they want

1736
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,184
Well they aren't

1737
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,208
Real real

1738
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:45,280
So is all of this stuff in it it does it does

1739
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,304
Sincerely come back

1740
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,072
2D 5

1741
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,608
Kind of ideas

1742
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,144
And the fact that Alex Jones is

1743
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,680
Repeating is Waterloo bulshit

1744
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:55,520
And this entire narrative memes

1745
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,544
Of course

1746
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:05,760
Bohemian Grove

1747
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:07,808
I want to know if we'd like to talk to her

1748
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,344
No

1749
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,624
Because

1750
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,952
I used to run an open-mic where people could

1751
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,232
Could just talk about whatever

1752
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,024
Me and my friend Matt

1753
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,304
Interrupt

1754
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,584
Ask for clarification

1755
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,864
I'm trying help improve their jokes

1756
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,168
And one of the guys who came to the open

1757
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,704
Said that he worked Boheme

1758
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,472
Mangrove

1759
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:32,640
Me and Marty DeRosa we're doing the show later he happened to be there

1760
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,712
He came onstage and we talked in bubble Union Grove

1761
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,760
Haven't seen

1762
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,880
I think you just moved

1763
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:48,000
That's entirely possible.

1764
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:54,400
Can any risk when talking to people who may know something they shouldn't know any of that stuff so anyway

1765
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,264
You think I'm sorry

1766
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,800
What was it

1767
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:17,184
Situation

1768
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:41,760
Infowars.com

1769
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:23,232
Any other information

1770
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,112
I was

1771
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:57,024
Good night.

1772
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:13,664
So anyway

1773
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:19,552
You've written a book for children

1774
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,600
Ridiculous what is

1775
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,136
Is that's so great

1776
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:26,464
So great

1777
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,000
F******

1778
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:31,328
Trying to Railroad somebody never speaking

1779
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:38,752
Trying to get someone to fight with you and they're just not playing it playing along

1780
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,288
Play the recording of him

1781
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:43,616
I'm talking like there's no reason for David Rothschild

1782
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:44,384
Be there

1783
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,176
Alex just wanted to yell at

1784
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,712
It's pretty weird though

1785
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,736
I mean

1786
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,528
There is a reason in the Granderson

1787
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,368
Can say that he has him on the Shelf boiler alert

1788
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,392
Endgame the only

1789
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,184
Miniclip they play which I don't

1790
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,208
Coincidence

1791
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:01,792
Is Alex Jones screaming your money changing ancestors

1792
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,352
That clip is what they play at

1793
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,376
That's the part that

1794
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:12,032
This is dog-whistle somatic literally anti-Semitic

1795
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:18,688
Just does not mean anything different no other different meaning to that other than

1796
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:22,016
But he can play like

1797
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:25,088
A couple of clips of like

1798
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:27,136
Screamed at a Rothschild have you

1799
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,696
That's her thing it now but I've written the children

1800
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:37,376
You can boost his stature in that Community because

1801
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:40,448
He has like I got the job

1802
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,728
If you listen to the whole thing

1803
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,056
He's being very reasonable and very polite

1804
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
This is

1805
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,152
I wasn't

1806
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,968
Whenever we started talking I was kind of hoping that

1807
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
This would be

1808
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:53,760
More fun

1809
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,576
This is really sad

1810
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:58,112
This is pathetic

1811
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,928
If you if you listen to

1812
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Listen to this

1813
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,560
Alex did a great job

1814
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,608
You're a sad person

1815
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:11,680
Like there's no other way to describe this other than

1816
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,704
A pathetic

1817
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:18,080
Weak-willed man easily yelling in fear if you if you buy into anything

1818
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:18,848
You saying like

1819
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:22,688
Like you're just either easily distractible you're not following

1820
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:23,456
Conversation

1821
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,480
Whatever

1822
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:26,272
I do support people putting

1823
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,576

1824
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:29,600
To the chat room

1825
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,904
But I will not make it knowledge fight

1826
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,696
Cigarettes cuz I don't have that kind of money

1827
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:41,632
I don't have that Rothschild money.

1828
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:51,104
Yeah let's finish up this the end of this clip

1829
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:34,112
Lord Rothschild you know that your house will fail in the end and you know

1830
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:40,512
I want to let you know that anyone who supports the New World Order

1831
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,800

0

1836
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,424
So that's how it ends

1837
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:24,288
You're going to prison I know that's pretty great

1838

Every time he read that he

1870
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:01,312

Alright

1963
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:30,368
What that bio is

1964
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,136
Is

1965
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,184
Kim Jong

1966
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:35,488
That's what that is

1967
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,768
Fearless leader

1968
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:37,792
Right there

1969
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:43,936

1970
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:44,704
Sprite

1971
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,288
I'm so Eva Springs

1972
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,104
Once again pushed us into an unfortunate territory of

1973
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,152
Defending someone who is a billionaire

1974
01:45:56,224 --> 01:46:00,064
Yeah I'm alright with it

1975
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:02,112
Like I believe

1976
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:02,880
In

1977
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,160
Organization of

1978
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:10,816
Like workers organizing and gaining power over political system

1979
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:12,864
Or workplace systems

1980
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:15,168
I believe in that wholeheartedly I believe in

1981
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,960
The average citizen being

1982
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,984
Mostly in

1983
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,264
Control

1984
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,056
With some exceptions

1985
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,592
You got to live in essence

1986
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:26,944
A political system if you are going to

1987
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:30,784
To build something along those lines but it's actually sustainable and that will a

1988
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:31,808
Provide

1989
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:33,344
BFF the incentive

1990
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,624
Search produce

1991
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:37,184
You wind up creating a system wherein

1992
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,976
You have a

1993
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:40,768
Very high bottom

1994
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,304
At a very low top

1995
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,840
But there is still a

1996
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:44,864
Between the two

1997
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,168
Like there's always going to be

1998
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:49,728
A division of

1999
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:50,752
You know

2000
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,544
The people who are

2001
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,312
The most

2002
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:55,872
What

2003
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:58,944
Celebrated or celebrity along those lines

2004
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:02,016
If you're talkin about

2005
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,552
Absolutely

2006
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:06,112
If you're talking about a sustainable

2007
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,392
Economy

2008
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,928
To be an incentive for you to

2009
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,696
To create things

2010
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:10,976
Incentive

2011
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:12,000
For you too

2012
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,792
Expand your business other the

2013
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:14,560
Them just like

2014
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,328
Status back

2015
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:19,424
Enter whatever it is you have that higher level

2016
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,472
The company

2017
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:24,032
But if the guy who owns the company is making

2018
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:25,568
580

2019
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,848
Times with the guy who works

2020
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:27,872
Search for the company is

2021
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:28,640
It's an unsafe

2022
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,664
Sustainable systems

2023
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,456
If the guy who owns the company makes

2024
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:34,784
Three times with the lowest what's the lowest guy is

2025
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,808
Then you have

2026
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,088
A separation

2027
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,392
That provides the incentive necessary to

2028
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,416
Want to make your own

2029
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:43,744
Company while at the same time giving you the Comfort necessary

2030
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,792
In order to make a sustainable economy

2031
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:50,400
Anyways what I'm saying is that it is not necessarily the fault of rich

2032
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:54,240
People that the rich are the single worst people that have ever existed

2033
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:56,544
But what I am saying is that

2034
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,592
Guillotine

2035
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,616
A great idea

2036
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,456
I wasn't how I wanted to end this

2037
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,224
It's

2038
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,248
No

2039
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:09,856
What

2040
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:11,136

2042
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:25,728

Experienced and I always

2045
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:33,152

2046
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:35,200
People that you scream about

2047
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,760

2048
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:40,064

Judging by your face

2094
