1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge babe I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
UniFirst okay my Brightspot then it's a little bit pedestrian but yesterday was such a nice day

6
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
In Chicago of all places we went out and we played tennis we did some outdoor things

7
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,528
Took the dogs on a long walk delightful

8
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,416
Be able to get out into

9
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:37,536
Feel the breeze

10
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
Until the day before

11
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,472
Is it going to snow tomorrow pretty sure is

12
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,776
Literally insane

13
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
Boy it is tough tough

14
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
To say

15
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
I guess it's my birthday

16
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,832
I'm so 8 38 38 38

17
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,672
I wasn't really want to look for it

18
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,256
I don't know but I mean like that you know I get to celebrate my birthday doing this

19
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
The things I love

20
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
Hanging out with you

21
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,872
We could have been in the air right now it's true Landing in Austin some barbecue and a whole thing

22
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,224
Ready for two weeks of no-holds-barred trial coverage

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
Yep going around finding the local ice cream Novelties and I-80

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Creamy summer being treated by all the ice cream places in Austin

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
The world is your oyster.

26
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,728
Extra ice cream novelties

27
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,800
Be on your way young man

28
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
I feel very nice to get some nice a birthday wish

29
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
And I appreciate

30
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
Of last week okay would be the April 22 to Hugh

31
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,048
32

32
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Okay

33
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
It's a

34
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
Hey it's a modern episode

35
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
Is it that huh yeah so Alex had to of course done his bankruptcy move

36
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
Hamby trial for the

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
Damages in detective Sandy Hook case got postponed

38
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
And then later on in the week

39
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,576
The u.s. trustee came out with a letter of opinion that's Alex's

40
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,648
Use of the bankruptcy process was not above board

41
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,744
Answer this all is still developing

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,048
No idea what's going to happen here but it seems

43
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Brought

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,984
Yeah it is it is it was nice to see somebody in in the position to write a letter

45
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,544
Say that thing that everybody knew which was

46
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,896
It's obvious you're exploiting this whole situation gave this looks

47
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,296
Shady as hell for of waiting for you to stop delaying this trial

48
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
Just now you decided that it would bankrupt

49
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
The company that has no money

50
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,976
So that's going on in the background

51
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
Will not come up on Today Show

52
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
6000 to talk about also

53
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,167
Thursday Alex decided to do a money bomb

54
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:28,287
That's really Thursday through Saturday money is bombing

55
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:33,407
No Friday came back to the studio and didn't interview with Mark Dice

56
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
DC

57
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,063
We have his show for the middle of the money Bob

58
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
Yeah you could argue that

59
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
I think in past years money bombs

60
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
He might

61
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
I think that

62
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
He's don't like drunk

63
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
Q and A's

64
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095
Yes true I remember that one

65
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,471
I don't know somebody the money bombs are just like

66
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,567
Alright Alex's show is watchable mm the rest of this b*******

67
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Is just

68
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Trying to fill space

69
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Let's show like

70
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
A little video that Larry Nichols put

71
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,599
Together it'll kill time I can go back and remember

72
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,903
The very first money bomb that we covered

73
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
And your I want to say

74
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:24,095
Childlike Glee yeah at the possibility of actually watching the entire thing

75
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,167
Two or succeeded in doing that twice

76
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
Is a money bomb

77
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,055
But they the marathons for free speech whatever the f*** he does.

78
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Yeah and

79
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,407
I really did kind of want to do that again this time

80
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,271
There was a part of me but it just the awareness of like all right what's going to be going on in

81
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
An hour

82
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
It is going to be

83
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
So useless is going to be sitting there talking to a guy who's on Rumble

84
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,583
100 and has a marginally popular Rumble account with a post videos

85
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Better supposed

86
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
The trigger the libs who aren't on Rumble

87
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,935
That's what they're going to do

88
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
So I took

89
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
I took a break on that one

90
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,103
And decided I will just talk about Friday see where he's at

91
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
See how things are going with the money bomb

92
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,807
The first just in time thank you so much and I apologize

93
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
Next

94
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,951
Bush did war crimes thank you so much

95
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
Thank you very much

96
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,071

102
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,887
I'm not Jordan did nothing wrong

00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,775

104
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,871
My little breaky heart thank you so much

105
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,223
Thank you very much

106
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
Jordan here

107
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,831
Episode proper

108
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
Is where Alex's head is at

109
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,767
This is a great money Bob

110
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
That we're dealing with

111
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
I mean look at you trying to raise money

112
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,447
You should say the most of the people who were in the audience probably deserve

113
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:41,055
I mean maybe it's weird to think of a regular normal Telethon

114
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:46,687
That we've all seen Jerry Lewis would regularly learn inside of people

115
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
Whatever it is you can $5 $10 you deserve death anyways because

116
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,255
When you die off you deserve to

117
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
I remember we are the world

118
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,679
Shuffle songs by

119
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
We are the world that should be blown up

120
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
Is it very different concert

121
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,639
We are the world was just better get ready to die

122
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Here's where we start

123
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,807
Alex has played a John bowne report

124
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,623
And besides he's going to applying on it a little bit of course

125
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Is

126
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:35,839
Ever done out of hundreds of critical reports the headline is

127
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,399
Powergrid Killswitch discovered now

128
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
I want to add it under the sea today

129
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Broadcast

130
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
Explain something

131
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
And be 100-percent clearly about this

132
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
There is no doubt

133
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Global

134
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Bashas corporate crime show

135
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,487
Has kill switches in all the phones all the power plants

136
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,863
Air traffic control and am all the Pentagon

137
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,055
It's been Declassified for decades Snowden exposed as well

138
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
And very same group

139
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
Power outages

140
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
Directions

141
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
We got to go to war with Iraq

142
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,743
The pipelines including Keystone

143
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
What is

144
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:42,143
The global corporations Waging War against every nation state on Earth

145
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
So this is kind of a summation of what you

146
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,799
I guess you'd call the primary thesis of the episode like

147
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,615
As much as there is content

148
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,175
This is kind of the content and that is that like

149
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
We found this Killswitch

150
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,039
He's always talked about like the internet kill switch

151
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
Apparently the entire power

152
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,391
Matrix Network

153
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
Infrastructure

154
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
He's found these Killswitch

155
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,255
So so what did he say

156
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Is that

157
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
The United States power

158
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
Is built in such a way

159
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,471
As to be 100-percent shut off a bowl by one dude

160
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
At any point in time

161
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
I think that that's

162
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
The premise

163
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Yeah that's not good

164
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
No I'll be bad

165
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Powergrid

166
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:29,503
I'm going to say that right now

167
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,575
Does not prove this in any way that's good that's good

168
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
A little bit light

169
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Terms of

170
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Evidence

171
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
Just just like

172
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,839
You know regular you don't want to have that kind of switch laying around what a few trips and Bun and then everybody has power

173
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,495
Redundancies in like a how you do something

174
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,799
Bright I Gotta gotta

175
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:58,687
What's the title of that video of the bound made was

176
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:04,063
Powergrid kill switches found

177
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Some might say

178
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,463
Also I love that Alex's Doling out all this praise

179
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
John Brown and Greg Reese or just

180
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,119
Constantly making the best video they've ever made crazy

181
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
I don't know how they up their game every single video they put out but

182
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Turn out with the

183
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,383
The stairs so low even so even if that were the

184
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,967
Impressive to just like

185
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
Incrementally

186
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
Dedicate yourself to like I'll be

187
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,135
5% better this time

188
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
Anyway

189
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:45,279
Biden's got a bill that they passed these Killswitch it course

190
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
What is in

191
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,399
The transportation building by Design

192
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
Killswitch in all cars by law

193
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
Cars by 2025

194
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
What

195
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
Major Police Department's been let in on it

196
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
Helicopters

197
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,695
That just send the frequency down

198
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
Car stops

199
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,047
This isn't true

200
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,167
This isn't about a transportation bill it has to do with the infrastructure investment and jobs act from last

201
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
December 20th

202
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Making stuff up about

203
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,055
The bill itself doesn't mandate the cars need to have kill switches put in them

204
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:34,943
The language in the bill says that to ensure the prevention of alcohol impair driving fatalities

205
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,783
Advance drunk impaired driving prevention technology must be standard equipment

206
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
In all new passenger motor vehicle

207
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,207
Definition of decided

208
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
To Define this as a kill switch

209
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
The New World Order will use take over your car

210
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
That's not necessarily accurate

211
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
It's just basically

212
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
What he decided to

213
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:59,007
Had to have this equipment

214
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,871
It was saying that the Department of Transportation was required to draft regulations regarding this issue with

215
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
3 years

216
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,223
Which many think will be extended probably due to Industry push

217
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,391
The freezing Alex is using his misleading and he's talking about regulations that have yet to be written in may not be anytime

218
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Time soon

219
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
I'm kind of just

220
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
Optima side

221
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
That being said

222
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:25,631
Almost any car that uses Wi-Fi or keyless entry or keyless ignition

223
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Can be hacked

224
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,751
Is just a reality of that kind of technology and it doesn't necessarily count

225
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Institute Achilles

226
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,615
If you're worried about this one of the things you should do is not buy Tesla

227
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,479
Because in 2020 consumer Watchdog named them the most vulnerable cars in terms of getting

228
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,783
You know I'm starting to think

229
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
An adverb

230
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Call me crazy

231
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:50,719
I'm starting to think that that company is not worth several thousand dollars per share or whatever it is

232
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:57,887
I mean might be overvalued I might even say might be overvalued what do you think about tunnels

233
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:04,287
I have them big we got to have them long and we got to have them never finished of real things and

234
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,871
And then just exaggerating annabella's thing them in order to make them

235
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
It is that he has going today which is these

236
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,551
The theme of these kill switches being able to turn off everything

237
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
At the push of a button

238
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,671
You know I almost think it might be a good idea to have

239
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Kill switches in cars

240
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,863
You know like flip for drunk driving basically if you if you were why we doing what are we doing

241
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,447
You know if I would rather

242
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Just turn the car off

243
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
Then chased it

244
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,847
Think that that would be prohibitively difficult

245
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479
Probably also would probably lend itself to a lot of

246
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
I think that would

247
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
You kind of come into with this

248
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
Would be some

249
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
Kind of

250
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:59,583
Driver Assistance or something you know like we're heading towards this world of like

251
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,423
Driverless cars being available in some fashion

252
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
Some sort of a temperature

253
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:12,383
Greenstate where if you're swerving or something like that the car is able to sense that and pull over or something like

254
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
I think that's more than

255
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
The discussion that's being

256
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,295
I would like these drunk driving safety mechanism

257
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
As opposed to like

258
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,903
The cop has a ray gun

259
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
Malagain

260
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:31,327
Supervillain style I would like that ray gun

261
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
Target

262
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
Got to be real good

263
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,959
But I looked another Killswitch

264
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
The human body

265
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:44,383
We have a kill switch the movie

266
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
Adaptation

267
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
Never heard of

268
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,735
Of that great book

269
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
Harkonnen

270
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
Sparkplug nearby

271
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
All the world

272
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Okay

273
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,175
That's what's going on here

274
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,063
Nicole tonight

275
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
What we are covering

276
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
And and what we are doing

277
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
He's on

278
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
The Damned

279
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Record

280
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
In Frank Herbert

281
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,959
Dune the movie is David Lynch's movie at the book

282
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:46,847
David Lynch

283
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,663
Between the book of dude and Lynch first

284
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Oh you bet

285
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
He is in deep

286
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
I'm telling you that let the bleach version is

287
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
One of the funniest movies

288
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,439
And also terrible but also great I don't even know what to tell you it's fantastic

289
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,999
Think I watched it when I was much younger but I

290
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
I don't know if I absorbed

291
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:10,143
Macho Man my friends and I you we used to get together and get high and like watch

292
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
It once a month

293
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
And make fun of it the entire

294
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
It's such a good terrible bad moon

295
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,847
Check it out sometime

296
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:23,455
Illustrating the reality of what America is dealing with

297
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
Give you an idea of the heart plugs in Baron heart is in Dune is it was like a little is like a little

298
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
Stopper is like a

299
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
He's such a bad strain

300
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
End

301
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Baron harkonnen

302
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
Just pulled it out in the guide

303
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
And then he died

304
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,839
Number is

305
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
Fiction to work

306
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
I'm familiar with the concept

307
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
There are easier ways to kill somebody sure

308
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
What you going to do

309
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,311
I'm so Alex gets off this topic

310
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
And starts complaining

311
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,663
As he is known to dupe money bombs

312
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
Traviesa

313
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Complaints about

314
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
Very relevant celebrity

315
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
Why their underlings

316
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,903
Running around story

317
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
From Shatner

318
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
What

319
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
Extinction Rebellion

320
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
Sing

321
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,263
The cataclysm the great disaster is about to come

322
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,127
And there's going to be so Much Death up there flying around with Jeff Bezos

323
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,759
I just saw John

324
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,255
Please stop telling people that

325
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,863
Sears everything on your shatter said that Jeff Bezos

326
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
I've been trying for

327
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Say that s***

328
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,775
He said that space made him appreciate how sensitive

329
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
Trailer life on Earth

330
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Skipping

331
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,503
We need to take care of the planet but it's so fragile there's a little tiny blue-skinned that's like 50 miles wide and

332
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
Polluted

333
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
It's our means of living

334
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,975
The feeling of looking into the seemingly empty expanse of space compared to looking down at

335
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,791
Oh my God it's under

336
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
It's indescribable

337
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,631
To see the blue color of the atmosphere shoot by like that

338
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,423
Tell Mary's mother comfort

339
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
And up there is death

340
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
Is that what death is

341
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
It's so moving

342
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
How to do making

343
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,895
Cheddar's, they're super benign but it seems like it's

344
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:33,247
Kind of close to like climate advocacy so Alex has to be mad at me

345
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
He's a little baby

346
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
I mean he can't just

347
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,903
You can't even be like I've what is he mad at Carl Sagan's little pale blue dot

348
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,975
Speech like is that also how Maddie is likely boys

349
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,815
It's a small planet what do you want from US versus big

350
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,375
So Alex has

351
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Complaints

352
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
I've already mentioned this

353
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
He has a lot of complaints

354
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
He's got issues

355
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,823
One of those B major issues is that the globalist

356
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,615
Going to kill everybody

357
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
We already deserve that

358
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
That's so true

359
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
Hey

360
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
Globalist don't like you

361
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
Do you like Alex

362
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
Steve McHugh School

363
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:14,207
Explain everybody

364
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,047
You understand when I say 90% dead

365
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Thaddeus

366
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,919
The dumbest thing you can believe in God you don't believe in karma

367
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
Which is totally real

368
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,759
Buddy music

369
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,319
They're going to kill you

370
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
Do you think you're going to leave a bunch of traitors and scum

371
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,487
And social climbers like when they finally dropped the hammer

372
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
Very focused

373
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,663
Once that cleanse the Earth of humans still be able to merge machine

374
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:13,343
Minions that open the drawbridge

375
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
You around later

376
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
They're going to scapegoat you with the survivors

377
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,816
I am highly respected

378
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Disagree with me

379
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
You know it's a private jet

380
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
I have chosen

381
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,624
Just take her on the surface with you

382
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,928
Because God's watching I'm not to be part of this

383
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,488
Wow that's something else

384
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,888
My imaginary enemy has nothing but the deepest respect for me when I call out by about

385
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,288
Marietta me for having so much respect for literally

386
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,336
Not even people know there's nothing there

387
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,992
Claimed that he is so respected by those books

388
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
I could be on their yachts

389
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
Bunkers as

390
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832

391
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,648
God demands I care about you so much

392
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672

Cuz I know that's what you relate to what you want

398
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,152
So that's one way Alex looks at it

399
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
Within a couple of minutes

400
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:48,320
You think something that like I don't notice doesn't drive with like Alex being really respectful

401
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
Affected by the globalists

402
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,904

Weird on the one hand the globalist up top really really respect Alex

429
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,640
But then at the same time they're giggling in

430
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
Chortling at him

431
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992

Burning their advance

433
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
I guess that's the way you might

434
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,856
Might look at it

435
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
That's about as good a

436
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,744
Is kind of the only way to make both of those

437
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
Congruent

438
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,816
They respect

439
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:41,216
He understands their plan but they laugh at him because he refuses to join because he wouldn't insist on staying

440
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
On the surface

441
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032

This is inappropriate

452
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,840
This is just there's no way to excuse this

453
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,144
Decision has been made

Serta via dramatizing moment for him

467
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
And what he

468
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
He's actually saying to the audience

469
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
If they believed it

470
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
They would

471
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,624
I don't know take up arms I mean based on what he has said

472
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,024
If it is gone from beta-2 operational that they are Marked for Death

473
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
You're already fighting

474
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:14,400
There's no reason not to go murder people because they're already starting the war with

There's there's there's a lot of really negative possibilities only negative possibilities

480
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368

481
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,416
Boilerplate nonsense

482
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208

00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
You see cigarettes go up

502
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
Couple dollars in a month

503
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
Maybe

504
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296

00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:09,856
If you're going Zimbabwe to Zimbabwe

511
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,256
It's just a fun Turtle phrase

512
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Gets into the news

513
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
Not really

514
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,680
I really don't want to miss the forest for the trees here

515
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,520
You understand Corporation Foothill switches

516
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
Russians are going to turn the power off

517
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
When are the ones who put the

518
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
This is not our government this year

519
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,320
Control freaks

520
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,392
Couldn't help do that cuz they want to control things

521
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
So is there a bigger issue

522
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
The other stuff crazy

523
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,560
Scary

524
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,680
That's the Nazis did to me that's what's crazy

525
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
Crazy people do really crazy stuff

526
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
Force

527
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
Jeff

528
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,248
Just say this right here I'm very thankful the listeners and everything

529
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm not sure

530
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,880
Our most important work at

531
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
Right now

532
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
So straight into decimal

533
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,280
Honestly like

534
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
So much f****** ads

535
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,264
Yeah and this is the same but I kind of treated a little bit more softly cuz it is a telephone.

536
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,592
I don't think it's as tasteless for him to just

537
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,640
Constantly be doing ads

538
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,712
The show

539
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:44,064
He came out and said beforehand so you know when you are listening to the show

540
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,112
That you are going to hear a s*** ton of ass

541
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,928
Not like a regular show where he just does that.

542
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,720
I mean I still think

543
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Like

544
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
It's an indictment of his show

545
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
That there's not much else

546
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,400
You know there's not really much else of value

547
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,984
Except for him rambling about nonsensical you're all going to die

548
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,800
You know what have you doing references of course

549
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,664
Baby you're going

550
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
Yeah it like

551
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,272
I just I was listening to this I was like

552
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,064
It's really telling

553
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,856
You'd like

554

But like yeah

561
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,080
These people who like maybe could have actually

562
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,872
Pulled big numbers for him

563
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,504

Mark Dice

565
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,624
Twitter following but still not impressive

566
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,952
I I just I kind of was overwhelmed by how underwhelming

567
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
The whole thing

568
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,328
I mean if this is your save our planet show

569
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,656
You would hope that people would treat it as though it was a

570
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:09,056
Pull on save your planet kind of situations instead of people being like next Monday

571
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,360
Imagine if

572
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,408
Like one of those Like We Are the World

573
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
Like

574
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
Nobody who had a number one hit

575
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,528
Yeah

576
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
He'll be G

577
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,136
I think this is G quite honestly drummers from

00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
Hair metal bands

579
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Going to do it man

580
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,256
Well I mean

581
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,144
Anyways Alex

582
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,032
I think I actually I kind of come close to agreeing with him about this next clip people

583
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,080
Misreported his

584
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,152
Offer to go to the FBI

585
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,968
I'm kind of close to agree with him until

586
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
Says more and then I completely just

587
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,600
That life

588
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
Be damned

589
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
Extinguished

590
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680

Owen Shroyer storm

592
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
I said yeah

593
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,552
Do you want to set me up

594
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
The deception

595
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
Ladies and gentlemen

596
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
I told you on here

597
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
They called I said yeah I'll talk to you

598
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
I'm going to ask you what you did

599
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
Yep

600
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,312

Desert Willow

604
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,448
The world was deprived of whatever that was going to be

605
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,824
The problem is obviously if you're the FBI you're not going to play Alex's game with him

606
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,920
Ultimately we don't get to see Alex

607
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,456
Evidently attempt

608
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,272
To investigate the FBI

609
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,880
So be awesome idea of him just being like okay

610
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Here's what I'll do

611
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
If I have somebody

612
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,720
A pickpocket their badge

613
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256

614
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
I am the

615
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,888
FBI that's how it works

616
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:48,288
With these people

617
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
It is international contract law

618
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
Interdimensional Kanter

619
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:56,992
I know that we've seen Alex do some sales type stuff some interesting

620
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Sales things

621
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,856
Certainly the silver they overpriced silver coins

622
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,696
That was a big one that failed recently

623
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,792
Going to be bad Daisy Daisy kind of thing

624
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216

A piece of culture a piece of resistance

635
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,304
The privilege to buy so they put a little piece of gold on a picture

636
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
How much is it cost

637
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,424
Oh my God I don't want to say $300 but I really feel

638
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216

Okay so it's it's

00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
It's less expensive than the gold leaf people

646
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,560
Conversation

647
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,608

648
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:22,240
Gotcha I feel very sad for anybody who buys this how I feel very sad collectible though and it's a battle

Side all this

665
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,856
Products that you can buy

666
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,864
Is it there's enough money to buy the seeds for next year

667
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
Everybody's got a side job on the farm

668
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,640
And then you work till 10 at night especially in the summer and spring in time

669
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
And I

670
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
Took care of the horses

671
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,296
And you enjoyed it but

672
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,952
Farm and Ranch

673
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816
It's the same thing

674
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
Of course it is

675
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,264
Vinology was I was going to get

676
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,664
Expert of weaving b******* metaphors

677
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,064
That was kind of a shocking moment for him to like realize like I could know where I was going with it.

678
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,368
Signs of the ventilator that is basically they like

679
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:21,024
Farmers quit when they don't have money for seeds right and if I don't have money to get product

680
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
Can't do this anymore

681
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:26,144
That was a metaphor used to activate but it got lost his own

682
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,960
Family to having side jobs the Great Depression

683
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,496
What do you do

684
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,264
I do

685
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,312
I don't think they had large-scale Farms

686
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,872
Probably not it's probably a little different than somebody who's like

687
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,176
Like a career farmer

688
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,224
But anyway

689
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,504
The issue here is that

690
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,552
The goal of the money bomb was $1000000

691
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
And there's a reason for that

692
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,112
It's cuz that's what he got tank

693
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,904
Toupee

694
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,768
What's up now says that he needs to million dollars

695
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,328
What he is saying to the audience

696
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
Is Victor

697
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
The gold of this money bomb

698
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,216
Is to get you to pay the legal fees that I got sanctioned to pay

699
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:07,616
The one million-dollar and sanction and then I need you to give me $1000000 to buy product that I was in

700
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Resale back

701
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Back to you

702
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,480
Purses at awesome scam

703
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
What I'm going to do

704
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,064
I'm going to ask you to give me money

705
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
So later I can

706
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Can sell you some

707
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,976
And make money on that cuz it's overpriced as hell like this stupid gold

708
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,280
You can't see through this

709
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,584
If you're giving your money to Alex

710
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,472
Specifically for the purpose of him buying stuff for you to buy yeah that's it just by the

711
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Stuff

712
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,568
That's what option that's what option yeah it's it's

713
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,920
I don't have any other way to put it the method amazing skinny I mean that's a scam on

714
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
Scams yeah

715
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,552
Raising my metaphorical hat

716
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,856
If you do believe in karma

717
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,928
That scam is going to come back on your real hair

718
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:57,536
Earlier this episode

719
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,400
I just think

720
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,704
It's so cynical

721
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,008
What he's doing

722
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,872
Darkly reaction of a person who believes in anything

723
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,664
No no that is the action of a person

724
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
And who wants

725
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
Money

726
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,504
He also might be

727
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
How to take the

728
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
This clip honestly.

729
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,088
It could be scary

730
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,160
Might be a weird metaphor

731
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
Keep fighting

732
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,840
Our most important work is here

733
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
But I I

734
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,504
Because I don't want to give up I don't want to roll over

735
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
And

736
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
Never Back Down

737
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
Always

738
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
Found my place

739
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,096
Blackout

740
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Perfect

741
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
I'm sorry what

742
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,216
I mean

743
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,008
Totally turning over

744
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,872
What you're in the shower

745
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
Feel

746
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
I am getting so close to that guy

747
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,320
That's a little worried

748
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,880
I'm feeling like he's getting close to Hartford

749
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
I just

750
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
I imagine

751
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
You know I mean it's a little bit right at this point

752
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
Just imagine like

753
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Stelter

754
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,632
Rambling about out

755
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,472
You got a blackout cuz that's when you understand all of the news man

756
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,056
What you do you go into a Fugue State and you dissociate

757
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,384
And then you wake up later having done a large number of things

758
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,432
That you don't have to take responsibility for

759
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
And cannot explain

760
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,784
Talk about turning into a werewolf

761
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
I think that's essentially that

762
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
Stop

763
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,136
I'm at my gig buddy

764
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
Apink

765
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,208
Similar to demon

766
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,792
Possession know that he couldn't be possessed by the

767
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
We know this

768
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,096
Because he is married

769
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
To God

770
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,144
That's quite literally

771
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,752
Other than carpet

772
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,824
Is when you do what you know is right

773
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
The God doesn't

774
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Rules live

775
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,712
People follow God

776
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,528
We we are to be married

777
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,808
The.

778
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
The Father the Son

779
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,904
We are married

780
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,696
Christ he is the Grimm

781
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
We are the bride

782
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
Hot

783
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
He's the man

784
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,120
This is a spiritual

785
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
Relationship

786
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
It's beyond sexual in nature

787
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,544
What is described as sexual

788
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,592
Okay

789
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,895
I'm upset

790
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,199
Sure

791
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
Alright I mean look

792
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,575
I don't understand this interpretation

793
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,599
Of the

794
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:06,463
Christ is the understand

795
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,511
The interpretation of it being like

796
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
Partially sexual

797
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
Yeah

798
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
I think

799
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
What happened

800
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:20,031
When you get a bunch of weird dudes a lot of power and religion all the sudden weird s*** starts happening in your life

801
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,335
Yeah I guess I am Jesus Christ's bride

802
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,359
And there you go

803
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,895
It's very strange

804
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,967
It's very strange but he's he's in this

805
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,623
Bit of work in terms of like bringing up the kill switches

806
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,583
Married to give the people what they want

807
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,351
And then

808
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
Getting to say

809
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,679
Satanism

810
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263

Is about being a Slave

814
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,039
The only time you get let out of your cages when you go out

815
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
Other people

00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,207
So ask your buddy are are you really

817
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,999

00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:17,887
What is 15 minutes for Sean Stones Rajasthan a nominated all the snooze

819
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799

820
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
Sake says Gyros

821
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687

It's nice for him to watch another media Outlet

829
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
False

830
00:43:55,007 --> 00:44:01,151
A good distraction from his media Empire falling

831
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,431
Loses

832
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:08,575
Cuz you're like ICC it in losses as you got a giant 10 million-dollar lawsuit hanging over your head

833
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:14,975
Ncn remains a multibillion-dollar National Corporation doesn't like come on their show

We all lost we all missed it

838
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
Nobody was watching

839
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,063
No disrespect to the stealth but I don't think you have the chops

840
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:46,719
He doesn't you got to be able to really get amped up for no reason got to be able to speak extemporaneously

841
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,767
We bought nothing for a long time

842
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
I'm not sure he

843
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
You could do it without it

844
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,119
Sean Stone

Weirdo

848
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:03,615
That's right cameo in the movie we watch

849
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
Savages

850
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,687
Directed by his dad

851
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:12,063
So yeah he's coming on and now it says a little bit of a suspicion about some

852
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
Stories

853
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
Urban habitat

854
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:20,255
Filmmaker researcher author shuts down joint that's coming up next segment to talk

855
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
All of these

856
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,351
Practicing

857
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,423
Blowing up and burning around the u.s. ward pull up yesterday

858
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:31,263
Explosion in Russia at their top chemical plant

859
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,871
There's a shadow war going on big time

860
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,455
Is it food processing plants in the past month

861
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,783
But a lot of them cause actual major damage

862
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
Dude Foods

863
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
Like maybe to some buildings

864
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
Urban damage

865
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,927
Some has not diminished

866
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,255
The capability of the the food processing

867
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:58,143
So he can look at the circumstances in these cases

868
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,703
And jumping to the conclusion that there's a shadow war going on

869
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
Some of these are

870
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,519
Clearly accidents

871
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,591
Like a plane crashed into the Gem State Processing Plant

872
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,639
Idaho which is almost certainly a 3K

873
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,455
That would be a difficult

874
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:15,807
Yeah cell making the argument that it wasn't

875
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,343
Is going to be tough for him so he's not even

876
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:24,511
Other instances you find on this on list of these processing plants that they seem like run-of-the-mill fires that happened

877
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Sometimes

878
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:30,399
These headlines do give the appearance that there are a lot of food processing plants that are catching fire witch

879
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,727
Conspiracy by the people to assume that must be connected

880
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,519
Then the work of some nefarious plot

881
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:39,615
We're all Steve Martin being like they hate these cans

882
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:45,503
They want to get rid of this food processing s*** in reality food processing plants catch fire

883
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
Regularly

884
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:52,671
In February 2020 there was a fire at the unibrow aska Center that was run by post Holdings which led to the deaths of

885
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,439
Thousands of

886
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:59,071
In March 2020 Econo Gro plant in Illinois caught fire and was having to leave heavily damaged

887
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
Andrew 20/20 Heights

888
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,423
Plant near Nashville caught fire and resulted in 2 in

889
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,263
In March 2021 the pride of Iowa sandwich

890
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,287
Complaint caught fire

891
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:14,431
In August 2019 to Tyson plant in Kansas had severe fire that left over 3,800 people out of

892
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:21,087
Cheese's this happens a lot pretty hard to definitively nail down exactly why this is the case but it seems that one

893
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,903
What are the dangers of large-scale production the way we do it

894
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,927
1025

895
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,743
Looking over these stories it seems like one

896
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,279
Concern is basically just equipped

897
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:36,447
There are a ton of machines running in these plants and if you don't catch a piece of faulty wiring That Could set off a fire fairly easily

898
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,263
Can you mix that with a high likelihood that these plants

899
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,311
They work with chemicals they could

900
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,895
Beautifier and you have a bit more of a risky situation

901
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,687
In residential buildings right

902
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,247
All kinds of questions about like regulations

903
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,807
Do I'm following a regulation Jack

904
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,135
This leads us to the story about the Russian chemical play

905
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:59,487
Alexandra brought up there with these two fighters one was at the

906
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,071
Demetrius key chemical plant and the other was at the defense

907
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,863
Institute one of the buildings

908
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
Run by the feds

909
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,655
Insta

910
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
So

911
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
This is

912
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
Kind of

913
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
A weird

914
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,615
Thing to do make assumptions about but also we should just say that chemical plants also

915
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
So catch on fire

916
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,175
Yeah they are made of camel

917
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:24,063
Rockton Illinois last year and a few months before that there's a fairly big one in Missouri

918
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:28,927
Sometimes this could be the result of regulations not being followed but in other times it's just bad luck

919
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,719
In August 2020 there was

920
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:35,839
Big fire at a chlorine plant in Louisiana that was traced back to a leak that was caused by Hurricane Laura

921
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:42,751
Bissell Street be important appointed as well like climate change has the potential to play into these already

922
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,519
System Dynamics

923
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
Send make them worse

924
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,847
I am too also you know

925
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:52,735
Widespread fires are also something you might associate with climate change

926
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
Forest

927
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
And not having them

928
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:59,647
So as it relates to the Russian chemical plant that definitely could be a war thing

929
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:06,047
Like there's not even a shadow war going on there's like a regular war going with their neighboring countries it seems like

930
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
That's a possibility

931
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,119
It could be sabotage but it also

932
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,143
Could be an accident

933
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,959
Alex doesn't know but he's decided that he does

934
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,031
The same Dynamic is true but even more so as it relates

935
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:16,799
The food plants

936
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:23,455
There's no reason for Alex to assume that these fires are connected in any way but one of his big narratives right now is at the globalist

937
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
Intentionally destroyed the food chains

938
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:31,391
You don't have any food pantries headlines can be used to help create that appearance so you just pretend that

939
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:34,975
There isn't a history of fires at food processing plant

940
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,839
ISO crazy Shadow War how is how do we get away with

941
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,607
With that s***

942
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,375
Capitalism

943
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Fuct

944
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,935
Man like that they're just

945
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:50,335
It's at their plants are just burning down and they like well you know we're not going to bother with any regulations

946
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,127
There are regulations

947
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:56,479
Keep in mind is that there are

948
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
100000

949
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,271
The food processor

950
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,551
Compliance around the country

951
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:05,439
So the idea that there were a couple of fires at a couple of them okay Sara Lee like

952
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:08,511
Oh my God they're burning down everywhere

953
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,791
Yeah I understand

954
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
Is that so

955
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,863
I don't I don't know if it's like

956
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
The biggest

957
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,191
Sauce

958
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,751
Some of that some of the instances have like

959
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:24,127
Nope

960
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
Bucked up

961
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,223
Maybe it's not the alike

962
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Scourge

963
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,319
Yeah I don't know the

964
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,855
Exact percentage of

965
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,927
Fires I mean it can't be a prophet

966
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:40,511
A profitable business if your plants are burning down all the

967
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
Time right

968
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:47,423
You know we just had a fire last week

969
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,959
PowerBack

970
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,751
Rip it off the wall

971
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,079
So we got another news story here about aeroplanes

972
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,919
Informative

973
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,503
Forex.com US airlines to allow

974
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,551
Violators

975
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,367
Return disguises mandates left so

976
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,439
Social credit score system

977
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,631
Now that the mask

978
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,655
Band-Aid

979
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,447
Is left

980
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
Applying pressure

981
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,663
Precept

982
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,015
Story makes total sense

983
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:40,671
People who refuse to follow the rules are in place were denied access to a service and now that the rule has been lifted they're allowed to use the service again

984
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,231
Because there isn't a reason to deny them anymore

985
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,255
Also this is

986
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
So cut-and-dry

987
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,303
Like for instance

988
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,399
Alaska Airlines is that they're still keeping some people whose Behavior was cooked

989
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,703
Particularly egregious on a banned list

990
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,519
The same is true of American Airlines who said quote

991
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:59,103
In cases where an incident may have started with face mask.

992
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,431
Comply it's an escalated into anything involving something more serious

993
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,783
Certainly assault or an assault on one of our team members are customers

994
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,623
Those passengers are going to remain on our permanent internal refuse list

995
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,671
And will never be allowed to travel with us

996
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:16,255
The same is true of Delta southwestern United Airlines

997
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:21,887
A case-by-case basis and if you were just denied service because you refuse to wear a mask

998
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,191
You're welcome to return and try to behave now

999
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:29,055
If you assaulted a flight attendant because you felt that masks were in a frontier Liberty you're still banned

1000
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,591
Susan on story

1001
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,151
But yeah they're training YouTube

1002
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:39,295
I mean you know it's a little bit like how Chicago wasn't mad at Steve Bartman anymore after

1003
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
2016

1004
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,087
And I like

1005
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,135
Whenever we won the World Series

1006
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,695
We didn't give a s*** about that you know he's back

1007
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,719
He's back in the fold

1008
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:50,815
Will you feel like in Chicago right now

1009
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:56,191
I would if I were him

1010
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,751
Yeah it's very similar

1011
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,519
It's very sad

1012
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,055
Another news story

1013
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
You ready

1014
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,967
Courthouse voted 6838 strip Disney

1015
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,527
Taxes self-governing status

1016
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,831
Raise the price

1017
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,111
Publicly

1018
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,647
DeSantis

1019
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,743
It's a dump

1020
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,863
No idea what that build other doesn't say

1021
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:31,007
He sold the whim of whatever far-right media is decided the talking points are they is no idea what's real at this point

1022
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,055
As for the Disney situation it's

1023
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,639
Kind of funny to hear people like Alex on the right-wing celebrating this is a victory

1024
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:43,039
In reality it could be a huge win for Disney and it runs the risk of setting a really dangerous precedent for Governors row

1025
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
Around the country

1026
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,623
It's a win for Disney this whole self-governing

1027
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:51,487
Saddest thing doesn't mean that they have a literal Magic Kingdom and it also doesn't mean that they don't pay tax

1028
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:59,679
It means that they have to handle their own civil infrastructure like having their own self-funded fire department sanitation and roll

1029
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:05,055
As I understand it this will now be the responsibility of neighboring counties which will cost a

1030
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,079
Huge amount of money

1031
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:10,175
Some estimate to put the burden that will be transferred to taxpayers in the billions

1032
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,199
Dollars

1033
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,223
That was just

1034
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,271
Because they had a self-governing

1035
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:18,367
Yeah area that they were allowed to have was all taken care of

1036
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:22,207
Yeah you know it really does seem f*****-up that I rich

1037
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:25,791
Billionaire like I don't know if he's building a but he's Rich As f***

1038
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,095
Governor can just be like okay

1039
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,631
I'm going to take these counties

1040
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,191
Is an impoverished them for the next 40 years

1041
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,775
I did not face any consequences for even electoral

1042
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:40,639
It's pretty bizarre but it feels good feels good to the base

1043
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,943
Right right to whine and lash out like a

1044
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:49,343
F****** moron you don't like

1045
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,623
Also has the potential to set

1046
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:57,023
Does bad precedent where Governor is clearly taking actions to attempt to punish a company for saying things that he doesn't like politically

1047
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,583
Like I don't think it's really hard to see how this

1048
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,887
Scooby prefix out before governors

1049
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,911
Started laughing out it

1050
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,215
Companies like this or where

1051
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,775
You know what where where does this lead

1052
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,079
This Behavior

1053
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,103
At least

1054
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
Do great things

1055
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
You know like a

1056
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,407
If

1057
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
Say Disney where to be like

1058
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:19,039
I think free speech and civil rights are good then you could destroy them

1059
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,575
You know that's good

1060
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,391
All this is got a mood though cuz

1061
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,951
According to the bill the past they have a year to figure out how to

1062
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:30,559
Dissolve the self-governing status and honestly I would be too surprised to see this never actually happen

1063
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:36,191
It kind of feels like a big publicity stunt that the scientist is running to excite the biggest bass in the right-wing but

1064
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
Something

1065
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:40,287
The ultimately knows is against his interest to follow through on

1066
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:46,687
I don't know the year

1067
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,735
A f****** Independence

1068
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:55,135
City-state OBD-II organization that would be required

1069
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,927
So we got Sean Stone

1070
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
Great,

1071
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,487
Great

1072
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,559
Stone on the show before

1073
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,351
Someone who Alex's head on

1074
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
A bit

1075
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:13,055
I didn't realize he was as big a s******* though really that much of a s*******

1076
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,079
Real

1077
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,919
Real interesting cat-boy he doesn't have a whole lot to say

1078
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,455
That sounds right

1079
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22,015
No just sort of vague Rambles about how

1080
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
Everybody is evil

1081
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,623
Concerns

1082
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,695
Cuz one of them

1083
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,999
How would you describe

1084
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,791
The current state of the world

1085
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,655
I would describe it as

1086
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
People waking up

1087
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,471
Process this away

1088
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
Process is just

1089
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,031
It's an inevitability

1090
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,311
How can you have

1091
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,847
Such an overly loss

1092
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,175
Presidents of the United States president of United States

1093
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
Advantix

1094
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,783
There's something seriously wrong

1095
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
How can you push

1096
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,855
Bills like they're doing

1097
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,159
California where you can literally murder a child

1098
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
Afterthewarning

1099
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,999
I mean

1100
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
Realized it

1101
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,071
The Darkside

1102
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,607
Is is is

1103
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,447
People in this direction to normalize what is always been

1104
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
Satanism

1105
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:19,871
Yeah so this is a reminder that even if you are the child of a no fairly famous film director

1106
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,919
You can still believe

1107
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,199
Dumbbells

1108
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,247
That flies around in right-wing media

1109
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:28,831
Yeah it's not hard especially whenever you know

1110
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:35,231
Probably isolated from regular people's concerns on account of being wealthy of s*** and ghetto cuz of your dad

1111
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,535
I didn't actually do anything to earn it so you're entitled

1112
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,375
Pretty easy to believe right-wing boscia

1113
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:46,751
It might be also if you're a sovereign citizen

1114
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,519
I don't know

1115
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:50,335
Because we know the bar system the bar association has a

1116
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
The system

1117
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,895
Is a self-regulating system

1118
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,431
It's in Alton

1119
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,247
Structures

1120
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,271
Wow

1121
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
The natural

1122
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,159
Individual

1123
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:04,927
Call Albertson

1124
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:09,023
He's out there

1125
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,071
Maritime I just can't get enough

1126
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,375
People screaming about maritime law

1127
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
Yep

1128
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Pretty cool

1129
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,751
Hellfire

1130
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,359
You know what

1131
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,407
I want to Oxford

1132
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:29,503
And I went to the caves

1133
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:35,647
It's like I've been there partying really I seen that so Alex needs to like really make clear

1134
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,927
Eden doodle

1135
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:41,535
This is just bizarre

1136
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,607
I know the inside baseball not just remember from others but

1137
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,655
Rodger Stone

1138
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,727
Richard Nixon

1139
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,919
Female Russian spy

1140
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:04,063
Level to this

1141
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,135
You're talking from experience you never did any illegal we talk

1142
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:12,255
Meaning some people

1143
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,047
They try to recruit others they don't

1144
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,887
I mean presumably

1145
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,799
We're basically looking with

1146
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Barry

1147
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,127
You know ancient structures right

1148
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
Masonry and

1149
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,455
Believe

1150
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
Washington

1151
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,295
You know it was amazing

1152
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:42,975
There are

1153
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,303
So I guess

1154
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,119
New wrinkle to Alex's whole story

1155
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:52,703
Where the real action is going on is a war within the Masons

1156
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,727
Yeah

1157
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,519
So apparently that's what's going on okay

1158
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
Alright

1159
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,567
So

1160
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,335
We can't

1161
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,615
Just be like

1162
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
Masons are bad

1163
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:07,551
Masons are the one of the few truly like nuanced groups that we can deal with right

1164
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,343
Because there's a war going on inside

1165
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,647
There's some Patriot Mesa

1166
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:19,071
Always a problem cuz they all wear the same silly outfit

1167
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,095
You know if there's

1168
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,911
Any organization that some of his gas

1169
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,215
Have been part of that he is

1170
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,495
Railed about in the past

1171
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,287
All the sudden whenever they're on

1172
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,079
Nuances entered the pic

1173
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,151
Who's making s*** up

1174
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,431
That's what's going on

1175
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:38,015
Shut up Sean

1176
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,063
Not only Sovereign citizen

1177
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,855
Not only right-wing

1178
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:44,159
Media believer and fear of Satan

1179
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,463
Also is clearly at the Cuban

1180
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
Operating I think

1181
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,559
There are good things

1182
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,095
Find the scenes

1183
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,447
That's why so much of this is

1184
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,471
Display

1185
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,287
Is 1

1186
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,567
Find out where is the

1187
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
Right I mean

1188
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,063
See how we got to 107 reference

1189
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:18,463
That's not something we're used to on Infowars that's a project

1190
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:24,863
To some of those episode the promoter guy who believes

1191
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,167
JFK jr.

1192
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,983
And she's not alone

1193
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,263
A number of folks

1194
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,543
In the apq world

1195
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,383
Influencer

1196
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,431
Stone is dropping his name

1197
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,455
That's a big

1198
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,271
That's a big sign pretty much all you need to know

1199
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:45,599
The only reason I would never want to know about that name

1200
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,647
If it weren't for this show

1201
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,927
Literally no other

1202
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,487
I don't think I would know about it and if it wasn't

1203
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,023
Carrie

1204
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:53,791
Yeah

1205
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,839
I think if you're referencing 107 and it

1206
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,679
It's not like in a joking way

1207
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,471
So the interview end

1208
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:05,567
Alex says goodbye to this is money bomb

1209
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,615
Very impressive hey

1210
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,919
Boston few months ago

1211
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,783
Open the boat or something

1212
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,063
Sell your boat

1213
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,623
Go out on the boat or something

1214
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,415
Go out on the boat or something

1215
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,487
Just cuz I'm in that just cuz I need

1216
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,535
An extra million dollars

1217
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,815
From my

1218
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,863
Supporters to pay my legal fees

1219
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,631
Right

1220
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,423
I'm going to keep that boat

1221
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:37,823
Of course why wouldn't you why wouldn't I why wouldn't you sell the boat I mean why would you ever not want to have a boat

1222
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,639
What is it what is life worth without a boat

1223
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,175
I mean it's almost like

1224
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,967
How can you live without a boat

1225
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:49,343
All of the luxuries I made it through I live

1226
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,111
If you don't have

1227
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:54,463
Alright billion-dollar Studio a mansion the boat

1228
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,743
Maybe a couple boats

1229
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:59,839
Regular stuff that middle-class stuff

1230
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,399
Everybody has their own boat

1231
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:08,287
And if we all go around we're all I got to go to the marina tomorrow

1232
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,335
Sean stone is

1233
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,407
Aleve is really funny is that

1234
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,199
Before he leaves this doesn't

1235
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:18,271
Come up but as soon as he leave Alex is like

1236
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,439
People try to recruit me to the devil also tried to return

1237
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:28,255
Of course he's on

1238
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:32,863
Absolutely uncomfortable conversation

1239
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,143
Talk about

1240
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:39,263
We had fun once the person leaves are able to fully control theory

1241
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,383
Are there a gyro that doesn't have to agree with all the lies I'm telling them

1242
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,175
Alex

1243
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,967
Master reset a little bit

1244
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,991
Cuz we always had a gas

1245
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,783
And now we got to reset by

1246
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,063
Rambling

1247
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,343
About how

1248
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,647
Alex can see the future

1249
01:03:55,903 --> 01:04:02,047
Once we discover who we really are

1250
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,983
Universal Neon

1251
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,287
Will succeed

1252
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,335
I know that

1253
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,895
I know

1254
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,759
All of our ancient people

1255
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,063
What

1256
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,343
Sea lion

1257
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,879
Hold on

1258
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
No

1259
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,023
But some of the pass

1260
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:33,791
Are involved

1261
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
Great Dane

1262
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,887
Millennia of slavery

1263
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,703
Sure we can bypass that together

1264
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,495
Can do it

1265
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:45,823
He's already been given to us a question is how

1266
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,103
Painful is it going to be

1267
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,711
Snooze

1268
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,039
Johnstone's are really smart guy

1269
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
Imagine he's like

1270
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,599
In over 100 movies

1271
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:04,511
I do like the I do like the sort of overlap but I was just thinking

1272
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:08,863
I think we've dance to that song everytime I know

1273
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,263
But apparently it's a dancing Alex wants to talk about how he can see the lines that go back through history

1274
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:20,895
Airbender he's connected to every avatar for the past 10,000 years going back to

1275
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:21,919
07

1276
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,039
Just think his track record to be better

1277
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,343
If there was even a colonel of day

1278
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,207
But yeah you can see future

1279
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:41,887
I want to be on a boat with Johnstone I have to go to a Fugue State I can see the future and I've got to get to

1280
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:48,287
To that boat and I need a million dollars right now

1281
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,359
So Alex got a headline

1282
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,431
A little bit more news this is dumb

1283
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,479
Associated Press

1284
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,783
Scientist mystified

1285
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,831
Mystified

1286
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,671
Weary as Africa avoids covid disaster

1287
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,719
And has 90

1288
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,535
6% less deaths and illnesses

1289
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,447
Because it's the vaccine

1290
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,983
Pink roses

1291
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,519
Protein and then sheds

1292
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
And they know that

1293
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,127
Maybe pour on average

1294
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,407
But they sure as hell no

1295
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:29,503
When the UN trucks pull up with the vaccine everybody gets sick and starts dying

1296
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:34,367
I don't know about 6 months old

1297
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,135
Fwiw

1298
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
Right on time

1299
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:41,279
The article isn't actually a story about complete befuddled until the part of doctors and

1300
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:48,191
If you read the whole thing there's actually a number of different theories about why much of Africa appeared to be doing better with covid spikes

1301
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,215
Access to vaccine

1302
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:53,311
Among these theories are the population is much younger on average

1303
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:56,127
20 versus the average age of 43 in Europe

1304
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
According to this art

1305
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:02,527
Another reason there are different residence patterns in much of Africa and people there are more custom

1306
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,807
I'm spending more time outside

1307
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:04,831
Good play Factor

1308
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:09,695
Theory discussed in the article is that some early research receiving to suggest

1309
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,743
The prior exposure to malaria may have a

1310
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,791
Protective effect on people in terms of covid

1311
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,327
And that's one

1312
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,607
Suggestion the people were think

1313
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,399
Another point

1314
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,447
It's brought up in the article by

1315
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:24,287
A Christian happy the director of the African center of excellence

1316
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:29,663
For genomics of infectious disease at Redeemer University in Nigeria

1317
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,967
He's dead people in much of Africa have

1318
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,991
Experience with outbreak

1319
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
Brakes and they don't take it as

1320
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783
Is flippantly

1321
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,807
As we have

1322
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,367
Before right

1323
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,951
Another very important aspect of this is that the health coverage is

1324
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:46,559
Spotty in many of the countries in Africa and that makes data a little more difficult

1325
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,583
Confidently report

1326
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:52,447
When is article was written a certain set of facts were known and it appeared that case numbers were

1327
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,727
Dramatically lower

1328
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,055
But a couple weeks ago World Health Organization

1329
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,079
Analysis was

1330
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:02,687
Release them, but as much as 65% of people in Africa had caught covid holy

1331
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:07,551
Which is 97 times higher than was previously confirmed

1332
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,831
Holy s*** yeah

1333
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:12,927
This analysis is still undergoing review and it shouldn't be taken as a concrete

1334
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:16,255
Number but there are some indications that some of the earliest options

1335
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,279
In terms of

1336
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,607
Lesser transmission ratings

1337
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,143
They might not have been fully Act

1338
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
Accurate there's more report

1339
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:26,751
Issues yeah we're going to learn borin

1340
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:27,775
We'll see

1341
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:31,615
Is that this aspect of public health is really complicated

1342
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,151
More so than Alex

1343
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,175
So capable of conveying

1344
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:40,831
The article is reading the headline of his six months old and it too is even more complicated than the knees presenting its

1345
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,111
Saturday

1346
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,135
This is just

1347
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,671
Blicky useless

1348
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,303
This is the guy making s*** up about articles he hasn't read that are

1349
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,583
Half a year old

1350
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:54,911
But

1351
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,447
It does lead in

1352
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
2

1353
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,031
I'm going to describe this as

1354
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,823
Deeply offensive

1355
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:05,919
You know if you have a nation that has very low covid rights

1356
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:06,943
Covid rates

1357
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:11,039
Uganda Zimbabwe baby

1358
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,575
Sorry I had to get there

1359
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,135
Be hard to resist

1360
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:18,975
This is deeply offensive

1361
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
I n

1362
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,767
Map

1363
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
They run

1364
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,095
When I say to you and bagel

1365
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,703
5067 years ago

1366
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,007
Those are real scientists real doctors

1367
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,543
Helping with malaria

1368
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,335
Open with diseases

1369
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
Suddenly

1370
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,687
Christian medicine man

1371
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,735
They didn't bring life anymore

1372
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:43,039
Starting in about 27 days

1373
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,063
Dysport years ago

1374
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,647
Oh just the 1970s

1375
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,511
Yeah

1376
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,215
Love medicine men love injections

1377
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,263
Icast

1378
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,823
I just

1379
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,063
Black medicine man

1380
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,367
We're giving them something made him sick.

1381
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
What does he think

1382
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:30,911
I don't hate the literally believes that Africa is like

1383
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,727
Cub Savannah 10,000 years ago

1384
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:40,127
Walking around there's no modern civilization whatsoever

1385
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
Yeah yeah

1386
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:46,271
Play defensive

1387
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,879
White medicine man I can't believe that

1388
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,927
CU medicine man is getting herbs

1389
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,279
Forgot they haven't even reached it yet

1390
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,327
Fuct

1391
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,607
Hayden so many ways

1392
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,631
Yeah that's

1393
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:05,727
Picketed on a level that I didn't even really think was possible

1394
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,775
It's a remarkably offensive

1395
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
It's prejudice

1396
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,615
Bigoted

1397
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:15,711
I think at this is too soft of a word but it's also

1398
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,991
Painfully not you

1399
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,527
Yeah like huge

1400
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:22,879
You would you would not want to take information from somebody who presents thing

1401
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,535
It is wild to me

1402
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:32,351
For him to be talkin

1403
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:37,471
Identically to Teddy Roosevelt immediately following murdering an elephant or whatever it is

1404
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,239
You know

1405
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,799
Like that's a level of

1406
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
F***** up now

1407
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:44,127
Miss that I just didn't think we would see anymore

1408
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,687
I really didn't Alex's a throwback

1409
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
Wow

1410
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,735
Jesus Christ

1411
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,551
Alex makes clear and very

1412
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,343
Explicit that this money bomb

1413
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,391
Is to pay his legal fees

1414
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,719
Nothing more frustrating to me

1415
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,767
Then knowing we've got ants

1416
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,303
And knowing

1417
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,327
We've got ways

1418
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,143
Help our listeners

1419
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,679
So easy to do

1420
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,215
And help us

1421
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,543
Mom because

1422
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:15,103
I got three or four of these rigged trials coming up

1423
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,199
But we got to do it

1424
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,319
He like a bill to repeal s***

1425
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:29,951
This makes me so much more confident that money bomb in 2015 was because

1426
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:35,071
Ted Anderson Las Vegas

1427
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
Sounds like it just seems like

1428
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,143
There is a very

1429
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:38,911
Clear

1430
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:42,495
Repetition of behavior at least

1431
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:46,079
In this like we're going to do this big Marathon sales thing because

1432
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,383
I have something good I'm on the hook for that

1433
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,431
I just want to make the audience pay for it

1434
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:56,063
Yeah and it's now it's going to a neat ATM that you have to dance in front of before it gives you 100

1435
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
Kind of sad

1436
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,951
So also said Alex

1437
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:05,535
Kind of slip implies that is gold

1438
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,095
Is maybe a little bit of a ripoff

1439
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,935
Feels so good

1440
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:15,263
These are really hot is little fractional gold pieces in art

1441
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,823
Everybody's buying them or sell them other folks to

1442
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:28,063
Has any money it's a good thing if he wants the force again

1443
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,367
With this

1444
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,695
I literally just feel a hundred percent

1445
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,231
This is you must

1446
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,255
Do it

1447
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,047
And then we would have met the payroll

1448
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,607
Black month without Alberta

1449
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,167
He came through you came through

1450
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,591
So for all you out there that hear him talk about it who don't call

1451
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:55,711
They are so nicer so professional they will cut right to the Chase and it will save you money

1452
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:58,015
And this is real service without the games

1453
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,807
Not the lawyer BS

1454
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:03,135
Taxcollect.com

1455
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,999
Basically overwhelming you got back there b was waited a week

1456
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:13,375
It's beautiful what's happening cuz it's a win-win for a buddy

1457
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,423
What do you talk about weather today

1458
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,007
It sure is Alex and let me just say I was about to

1459
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,543
To say the same thing that you said

1460
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:26,431
Tax season is over but the real work begins now and what is that mean it's audit season

1461
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,223
And that means the war is

1462
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:28,991
On

1463
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,527
The war against who

1464
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:34,879
The globalists in their Collection Agency the IRS because they want to get

1465
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,671
The most money as possible

1466
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,719
So they can find things that they want

1467
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,743
Oh boy

1468
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:42,815
The rest of the show is an infomercial with his attacks

1469
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,583
Jesus

1470
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,351
Yeah

1471
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,399
Wow we've got it

1472
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,167
Tax Guy

1473
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:50,495
We go from a sovereign citizen who believes it

1474
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,263
Texas shouldn't

1475
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:57,663
Even exist yeah probably either

1476
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:03,039
Sovereign Citizens need a tax preparer to they don't go to H&R Block and I like Hey listen

1477
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:06,367
Maritime law says that I don't have to dig up any of my goals for the governor

1478
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:10,207
They use people like Irwin Schiff he who tell them that like

1479
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:12,255
The 16th Amendment was ratified

1480
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
It so here's what you have

1481
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:13,791
To do

1482
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,327
Flood people with paperwork

1483
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:18,655
Yeah they just do that kind of like paper terrorism as they say

1484
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,215
This dude

1485
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,775
I don't know I get bad vibes off him

1486
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,311
I think anybody who's a

1487
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:29,663
Someone who Alex is using as a tax expert probably insane

1488
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,455
The track records not good

1489
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,247
In terms of people in the past

1490
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:36,063
What do you expect

1491
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,599
I mean I'm surprised

1492
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:43,999
She's not a chiropractor giving tax advice you never know

1493
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:49,119
If you work on a farm in order to afford the boat you got to have a job in town

1494
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,167
And that's why the Great Depression

1495
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:51,935
Definitely

1496
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:56,031
So is an exercise in Rambling

1497
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,127
For the most part this whole episode bears

1498
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,407
Not much

1499
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:06,271
Not a ton of meat on them bones know for a little bit of content

1500
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,087
Couple things

1501
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:15,487
Denigrated an entire continent in a way that is true

1502
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,535
Yeah I mean if you do that

1503
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,071
Uganda Zimbabwe baby

1504
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,631
You're doing it too much now

1505
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:26,239
We have one last clip here and I just want this does not make me feel

1506
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:29,567
Confident about signing up with Alex's Taxi

1507
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,407
Is all analog

1508
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,431
It's illegal

1509
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,991
You can do it all you got to do is call up

1510
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:42,367
Give me your details and they are over 100 designs a t-shirt

1511
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:44,927
Cut off by the bank or do I have to do

1512
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:50,559
By the break but like

1513
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:56,959
I think if Alex is talking to me about a shady tax guy he's like it's solely

1514
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,727
Legal

1515
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,519
Yeah I'm not doing it

1516
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,055
I'm walking away from that

1517
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,591
I think of someone says

1518
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,359
Legal

1519
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,895
I am blessed

1520
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,199
So legal

1521
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,479
I think it's illegal

1522
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:12,831
There is one thing you don't know how legal this is

1523
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,367
Right that's how legal it is

1524
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:19,487
I mean it's really illegal you do you think

1525
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,351
Dude it's not a crime until your car

1526
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,935
Like really emphasized that something's legal

1527
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,727
I'm out

1528
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
Goddamn

1529
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,847
I got to go is the most legal thing

1530
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,127
You have ever done

1531
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:44,063
Holyshit guys get in the car were following the law

1532
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:50,975
Hey let's go to Taco Bell and get dinner it's so late

1533
01:17:55,071 --> 01:18:01,215
You only say that when something looks really illegal Amtrak to reassure people

1534
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,495
I think that's what's going on

1535
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,335
This episode is

1536
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,359
Not great

1537
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,639
It is what it is

1538
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,919
Alex

1539
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,687
Need money

1540
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:13,503
And I think that might be the prevailing theme for a while

1541
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:17,087
I get the sense that he's

1542
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,879
I think it'll be

1543
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,671
The prevailing theme for the rest of his life

1544
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,951
Even when the show is over

1545
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:25,279
Sure has been for a while

1546
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,119
I think there's something really interesting going on and we're going to have

1547
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,655
Some stuff

1548
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,215
Playing out that I think will cause

1549
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,519
Drastic amounts of Chaos

1550
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
But

1551
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,079
Somehow

1552
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:38,847
This

1553
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
Episode

1554
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:40,895
Really

1555
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,663
Tatiana

1556
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:45,503
The the body balm aspect of it was really just I need money

1557
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:48,063
This is because

1558
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:51,391
Some of this stuff hasn't really come to the head yet you know like this

1559
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,927
Trustee letter

1560
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,975
Hasn't had it

1561
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,999
Direct effect

1562
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,351
And I think as that stuff starts to happen

1563
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,375
I think we'll see

1564
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,423
Hopefully some movement

1565
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,191
And Alex

1566
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,215
Actually

1567
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,495
Freak out

1568
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,031
I mean I would I would

1569
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,055
We just like

1570
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
4

1571
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,615
A I guess

1572
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,407
T-Mobile

1573
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,175
Bye

1574
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,735
I don't know different folks

1575
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:19,295
People a ragtag band of Heroes

1576
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,087
To get together and kind of

1577
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:21,855
Figure out

1578
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,671
What it is he's going to try and f******

1579
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,719
And then cut it off

1580
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,999
Before he can do it

1581
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:32,095
Like let's say this if I had known about the bankruptcy laws

1582
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:35,423
I would have gotten some people together and we would have Rewritten the laws

1583
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
Couple weeks before 8

1584
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:43,103
I'm at work this seems like a legislative superpower yogurt hoping someone can have

1585
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:47,455
My gun that sounds cars right it's legislative superpowers

1586
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,247
Unstoppable

1587
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:54,623
SeaWorld I would be nice that power to Baron harkonnen

1588
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,951
If you got my heart plug

1589
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,231
Yeah I think

1590
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,023
Play Tom Petty

1591
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,303
Now waiting is the hardest

1592
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,351
This part we're waiting

1593
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,887
For the shoe to drop

1594
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,911
And

1595
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,703
It's just going to be sales

1596
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,727
So

1597
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,799
Yep we'll see we'll see we'll see what happens but

1598
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,104
Mud walking through mud

1599
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,640
Will be back

1600
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,432
For another episode Bots

1601
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
I don't think

1602
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,736
Think you deserve to die

1603
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
Me neither

1604
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,784
And because

1605
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,808
Star of that

1606
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,344
We have a website

1607
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
I don't know

1608
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,904
Psycho Jordan

1609
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,976
And I like my family said in the Great Depression

1610
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,256
It's not right

1611
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Dot-com

1612
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:37,120
Croissant

1613
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,264
I happy dreamy creamy sauce

1614
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,568
What the sex robot

1615
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,872
Holding

1616
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,992
Alexandra Thurston color
