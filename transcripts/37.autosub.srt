I wanted to do previously on

44
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,600
I told you before we started recording that Alex's life is about to fall apart

45
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
And here's why

46
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
First of all he lost his

47
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,720
He lost custody of his children last week

48
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
That's going to

49
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
Slowly deteriorate is mine

50
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
Additionally

51
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
Chobani yogurt

52
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
Asthma put out a lawsuit on him

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,592
You didn't know about this so I put out a new story then the headline of it was

54
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,688
Idaho yogurt maker Imports migrant rapist

55
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,504
Which was about the guy who owns Chobani

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
Very big donator for Refugee, it was all such slander

57
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
Yo they're suing him

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Very bad

59
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
Forever recording

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
On Thursday

61
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Alex is

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
Just now wrapping up

63
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,824
836 hour or so live broadcast

64
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
Why is this a special occasion

65
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
AP need money

66
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,296
It's a 36-hour live infomercial it's like QVC bicycle

67
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
What is he in

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
Keeping him awake also caveman bone broth

69
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
That's a new product since you've been here and I kind of get into

70
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
You just desperately need money

71
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
It's clear he's going to get sued

72
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
So hard you going to lose every

73
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,943
And

74
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Like

75
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
Couple days back

76
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,831
He accidentally let slip on are that Mike cernovich has sources

77
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,623
And some of his sources

78
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Where Donald Trump's children

79
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
They were feeding them information

80
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
What is a crime

81
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
I can't believe Aaron was

82
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,679
Francoli

83
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,543
Flip on the air

84
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
Some pieces of it most of it was bulshit

85
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
I said Donald Junior was

86
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,223
Delphine crnkovich information at

87
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Listen

88
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
I had it wrong like okay

89
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Right

90
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Right buddy

91
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,207
I don't know what to believe it's completely lying about the retraction

92
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Or he could have been lying anyway

93
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
I have no f****** idea

94
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Thunderdome

95
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,655
Cruises out the window everything is possible

96
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Christine

97
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
So today we're going to be

98
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
A video that played during

99
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
The 30-hour broadcast

100
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,087
Who's the special report that Alex put out

101
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
On Monday

102
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
I'm a repurposed

103
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
I just played a bunch of time

104
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,999
It wasn't even a 30-hour live broadcast it just kept playing video

105
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
So anyway this video

106
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
Was it was

107
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Special Report

108
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
Facebook

109
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
Is targeting trendy's and cuc

110
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Trendys

111
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Trendy

112
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
I don't know what that means

113
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,663
Well you're one of them cuz you got a mustache

114
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,063
We're going to get into specifically what the trendy's are over the course of this video

115
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Incredibly pissed off

116
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
About Facebook

117
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
How many loses the thread and starts yelling about a bunch of other stuff

118
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,535
I'm pretty certain he's on some sort of amphetamine

119
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
He seems

120
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:30,911
Beats out of his mind he's shooting this in his bedroom

121
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
And it's gorgeous bedroom it's huge

122
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
He is very rich for now

123
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,823
Yeah for now he's going to lose that bet

124
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Very soon

125
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,151
Getting up

126
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
I'm sitting down and like pacing around

127
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
He's on some sort of

128
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
It's crazy

129
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Anyway

130
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
Millennium started off

131
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Okay this is how it begins the report

132
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
My friends

133
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,279
Zuckerberg working with the CIA

134
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Set up

135
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Facebook

136
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
Google was also set up by the CIA

137
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,239
Search CIA funding

138
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
12 master

139
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
For social engineering

140
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
4 control

141
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,527
That's come out the Wikileaks Democratic party Republican Party

142
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,087
Globalist

143
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
Zuckerberg was 6 years ago

144
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,255
Set a conference I can't believe our users trust us they're a bunch of dumb

145
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
And then I see

146
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
The difference

147
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,727
Facebook acts like they're open and free and follow the rules

148
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,311
Libertarian are nationalistic

149
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
Target

150
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
Facebook to share your post

151
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
Force-feed

152
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,855
Are they cut off are you was going to say they force-feed liberal ship

153
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
So

154
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,719
Here we go this is the beginning the introduction of his promise

155
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Facebook stock

156
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,351
You got to get out of Colonel there that I'm going to agree with him on

157
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
But then he goes on

158
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,007
That that whole thing about like Facebook isn't allowing us to share things

159
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
Misrepresenting how Facebook works

160
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,455
Post something to your fan page

161
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
You probably like

162
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
Couple thousand fans

163
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
I would assume

164
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,111
Call work

165
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
You post something on your fan page

166
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
And if you don't promote it

167
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Only

168
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
20 people will see

169
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,327
Because they want you to pay for it to be promoted

170
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Right they restrict

171
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,423
How many of your own fancy your s***

172
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
It's just how it works

173
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
It's an advertising platform

174
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Right

175
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
Masquerading as a social network

176
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Cher age

177
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,991
And you have to get multiple people to do it and if you do that then it starts to

178
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Spiral

179
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
I am to get posted on more people's walls cuz there's

180
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
Organic interest

181
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
Right so Alex doesn't understand

182
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
That's it that's the feature

183
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Social network

184
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
Make money

185
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
That's the game

186
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,911
So he thinks it's because he's spouting libertarian views

187
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
And all this put it

188
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
It just

189
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
Incredibly stupid

190
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
Some more bad stuff

191
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
About Facebook I didn't true

192
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
But

193
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
Before he does that man have to

194
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,015
I do think Facebook is bad

195
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Facebook

196
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
Return to solitude

197
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
You spout like bulshit opinions

198
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Often it's

199
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,695
Lightship the people are posting

200
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,023
The whole idea of virtue signalling that the alt-right likes

201
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Throw around

202
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,631
The idea of like you really believe the principal Post online

203
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
You're just doing that

204
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,471
To Signal your virtues to your like-minded friends

205
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Beyonce

206
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
Is that a crow

207
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Critique of the left

208
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Yes okay

209
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,895
They all of this stuff about like gay rights

210
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,223
Send

211
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,111
It's not sincere you're just trying to show your Bona fides

212
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
If your friends

213
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
I don't think that most of

214
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:10,815
Is that right

215
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
But

216
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Facebook does suck it it's

217
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Temperature

218
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519
I've got no Facebook I love it

219
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
I think I think people should leave it

220
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
Your life is better listening

221
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
Alex Jones

222
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,967
Look

223
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,039
There might be a one-to-one correlation

224
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,623
I got on Facebook and immediately started listen to Alex Jones everyday

225
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,719
And my mental state has never been better I barely leave the house

226
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,559
I think Facebook is awful if I was not

227
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
In the

228
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
If I was not

229
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,167
A person who pursuing comedy I'd I wouldn't

230
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Yeah

231
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
But it's weird to

232
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
It's weird to look at somebody be like

233
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Yahoo Facebook too

234
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
You headed for the wrong

235
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,247
Globalist

236
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
I'm sick of seeing other people's

237
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
Head-to-head game

238
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Yeah I'm psychodrama

239
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,975
Uncooked chicken cuz I might get sick

240
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:23,007
We're technically on the same side

241
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
But we're not on a team

242
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:30,175
It goes on to complain some more about Google and tell me about we talk about in the past

243
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
Hillary Clinton propaganda in garbage

244
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,343
Secret documents

245
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
Butter Google said yeah

246
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
We had Road contract

247
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,719
Multimillion-dollar contract

248
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,791
Delisting infowars.com

249
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
They said they stopped

250
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
Alex your fake news Sumi

251
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,055
Sumi I dare you

252
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
You're fake f****** news

253
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
I can prove it

254
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
And I have

255
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
Repeatedly

256
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,831
You dumb son of a b it's kind of the whole nature of the podcast

257
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
Fake news cuz they're afraid that he's going to put them

258
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
That's not true at all

259
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
Google has very weak lawyer

260
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,375
The streets further telling me about these documents we got from Mike cernovich

261
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
That were about

262
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
He is another one of these propaganda dickholes

263
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,311
He's a he's a guy he has his own

264
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,127
Call danger and play

265
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,479
Dynamiter and play

266
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,599
Oh yeah it's it it sounds way more like that than a right-wing bigots

267
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
That blog

268
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,463
But

269
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511
It was involved in like

270
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
He was involved in gamergate

271
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
All the current date recently broke the story about Susan Rice unmasking peep

272
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
Unmasking Trump

273
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Campaign people

274
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
In the intelligence reports that was the real story

275
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
That sort of s*** that's what he's on

276
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
Donald Trump's children

277
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
Yeah

278
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,463
One way or another

279
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Beginning of

280
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
First clip

281
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:31,007
Recover your own trasar

282
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,847
That's one thing that you're going to be does this a lot and especially in this episode

283
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
Whenever he says this public

284
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
This is been Declassified

285
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
Everyone knows this

286
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
It's in mainstream news

287
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,087
Any of those four things you know it's a lie

288
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,671
Just a hundred percent is a f****** lie

289
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,255
He's just making s*** up that maybe a caller told him a week early

290
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
That's basically

291
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
Before we got started

292
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
What is a friend

293
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
Rice

294
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
I'm starting to feel

295
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
It's not a possum

296
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Yeah I got

297
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
If this clip

298
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Explains

299
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,503
About is mostly about

300
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
So many explain

301
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,367
On specifically what they are

302
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
I meant he gives a dubious

303
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,695
Historical lesson about proper

304
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
The Democrat special

305
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
Need to understand this really affects

306
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Facebook

307
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,751
Has been caught with internal documents leaking

308
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
Systemcare

309
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
England and Australia

310
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,991
700

311
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
Young as the Press

312
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
As vulnerable and as trendy

313
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Turn

314
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
What is a friend

315
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
We'll get back to that

316
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
First

317
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
Example of what

318
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
No not really

319
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,615
The report came out recently a couple days ago about

320
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
Facebook

321
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Targeting

322
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
People that they

323
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
Viewed as sort of week

324
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
And

325
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
More impressionable more vulnerable

326
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
People

327
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:29,535
Alex is saying it is going to lay out is that they were doing this in order to make them liberal

328
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
Recruiting liberal

329
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
Vulnerable people on Facebook

330
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
The truth is

331
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
At worst

332
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
It's an advertising strategy

333
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
It's much like

334
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
Putting

335
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
Sugary cereal commercials during cartoons

336
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,479
City toy commercials during cartoon

337
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
You basically

338
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,087
So you going to make it seem really evil

339
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
Ears with

340
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
Actually was

341
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
The company

342
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,767
Facebook said claims made about targeting site users were quoting this

343
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,863
But his investigation would be launched into the matter

344
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
In the statement Facebook stock quote

345
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,519
The analysis done by an Australian researcher was intended to help marketers understand how people

346
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Express themselves on

347
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
It was never used to Target

348
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,919
It was based on data that was Anonymous and aggregated

349
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,527
I believe that but I also don't believe them wasn't for Market

350
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
You don't mean right it's off

351
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:30,975
Absolutely helping marketers understand how people Express themselves if it wasn't for marketing

352
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
Yeah that's insane

353
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,839
So that part II believe them and I don't believe them

354
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
And I don't believe

355
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,703
Now he also said that they targeted 700,000

356
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
That is

357
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031
Because that the specifics

358
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
But I can't rate

359
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
That is nothing to do with it

360
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,687
That has to do with Facebook what they did in 20

361
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
12

362
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
Do you remember that

363
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
So he pulled a number from

364
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Disassociating

365
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
Well they're both Facebook things that are kind of weird

366
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,231
But they're not the same thing he's leaving issues

367
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,535
The 700,000 users

368
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,631
Was when they were trying to see if they could sway people's moods

369
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,447
By posting positive or negative stories

370
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,823
Without people permission

371
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Weather

372
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Based on

373
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
Keywords that could determine where positive or negative

374
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
They would take people and they would post

375
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,319
Primarily negative things on their wall and see what things they would pose

376
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
To see if it would affect their mood

377
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
Now the research was done

378
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
Technically isn't illegal

379
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
It's f***** up

380

That has nothing to do with this

386
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,151
Alex is just an idiot and everything Facebook does is all one big

387
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
Kill people that dance

388
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,487

Probably

428
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,231
What what I'm saying really to

429
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Thing is

430
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,791
Are we so far it seems like

431
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
He has

432
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Attack

433
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:26,495
Basic capitalism like marketing

434
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,543
Religious conservatism a couple time

435
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:33,663
Is it normal for him but he doesn't realize

436
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,087
Wealthy thing but loves the free-market loves capitalism

437
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,391
Love's Christianity

438
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159

The church

440
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,791
But I don't think the things that you're picking up on

441
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
I don't think he even realizes

442
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,119
Are implied in his word

443
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Must not be

444
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,983
Being

445
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Like

446
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
People who gravitate

447
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
Towards

448
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
The mainstream thing

449
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,479
I'm 33 years old that is literally never been the case in my life

450
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:14,111
Cool are the people who break away right and are rebellious or have their own thing

451
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,440
He's like trying to describe

00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
Radical Main Street

455
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
I think so yeah

456
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,032
It's convoluted

457
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,592
This is starting out a little bit slow

458
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
In terms of what Alex's say

459
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,784
I promise you the ball is going to start rolling and it's going to speed up

460
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Standards of

461
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392

00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Trendy is

463
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,488
Yeah it's going to start almost immediately

464
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,304
Flip out

465
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,352
Get down to the brass tacks

00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
Like it's completely insane

484
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,864
What are you doing what are you doing

485
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,312
Do not be fooled by this but I really need you to pay for this nice bedroom with that

486
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,736

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,032
People that buy in the trendy culture

To get you to accept that

506
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,704
In the sixties ugly are

507
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,568
To make you confused and think will you don't know what's beautiful art and what's what's ugly

508
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,152
Scrambling of social mores

509
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,992
Ugly architecture

510
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
Austerity collapse

511
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:29,440

You can't have anything

517
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,336
Somebody else

00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
I Googled a minute

529
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,248
There's no evidence the people are trying to band masculine murals on campus

530
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:31,904
Because some people are as a pronoun

531
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
It isn't

532
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
Like saying that he or she is bad

533
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
It's just

534
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
Offering a third option

535
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
For people who identify another way

536
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,168
If you feel depressed by someone else's inclusion

537
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
That's your problem

538
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,800
That's not that's not the person who wishes to be seen a certain way of problem

539
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
So

540
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
I don't know man

541
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,664
I mean

542
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,736
Progressive issue and that is exactly

543
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
You know

00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552

Learn about think there is a piece of it.

548
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
I wish I was

549
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,352
Not specifically because he like Alex wants to be a z

550
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,376
Or whatever

551
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
But because

552
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
He's like I wish I had that

553
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Mention of being deaf

554
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520

I desire to be different a desire to

556
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
Be included

00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480

Regardless of where he lands anywhere gorgeous mansion

561
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,256
People Like Us don't understand

00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
My plate

563
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,936
Alex Jones in actuality

564
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
These aren't human

565
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
It's it's

00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,600
He's elated at what he think

572
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
This is about

573
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
Can get a little more specific in this next clip

574
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,768
I got to stay ahead of time I don't agree with him

575
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:19,680
I don't agree with his assessment

576
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Here

577
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,776
This is the total oppression of the hot mine

578
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,824
Are these documents where

579
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,736
I won't let you leave Facebook if you want to

580
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,552
They're selling your data they're calling you a dumbass

581
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
Iowa Facebook nonstop me

582
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,440
That thing about them calling you dumb a

583
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:46,560
He brings this up a bit is that in their condolences email whenever you quit

584
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,144
No just walked up when you leave Facebook pictures

585
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:54,752
And they're like they're going to miss you if you leave it sort of

586
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,824
It's a little manipulative but if you leave

587
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
They don't stop you

588
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:04,224
He claims

589
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
Summit

590
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,064
Mark Zuckerberg said the people who use Facebook are dumb sucker

591
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368
That's not true

592
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,672
What actually happened was when he was 26

593
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976
Facebook was still sort of growing

594
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
Abet

595
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,560
He told a friend in a private message

596
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,608
That he can't believe the people trust him

597
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
They're dumb Fox

598
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,192
She isn't gone on record

599
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,544
I was young I didn't know what's going on I definitely wouldn't

600
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
Say that sort of thing now

601
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
And maybe that's just good PR

602
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
But

603
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
Sure

604
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
Of course you're dumb

605
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,760
If you decide

606
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
Dumbfuckery for being on Facebook

607
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,720
Most people wouldn't believe all the stuff out there that I do

608
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,048
Hey they know a lot of s*** about me this private business

609
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,096
Too much information about

610
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
That's why I

611
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,448
Again he's misrepresenting s***

612
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Anyway

613
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,264
This moves into

614
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,568
We see what Islam

615
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,224
Really

616
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
So let me

617
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,672
Show me Australian

618
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,256
Facebook

619
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
When normally would meet

620
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
And some type of

621
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,480
Culturally successful group

622
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
To be successful

623
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,832
Cultural icons

624
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,648
Farms

625
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,000
Different globalist enclaves in the broken strategy

626
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
They're all scared

627
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,656
And always safe place your group

628
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
A lot of words

629
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
Oh yeah

630
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,568
What are you what are you really feel about that

631
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,872
Think think I've been cooked

632
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
Of course

633
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
That's the that's the overarching

634
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
You know conspiracy

635
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,904
Is being cocked by Islam

636
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,952
That's sort of a big thing is on

637
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
What is that I don't know what that mean

638
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
I feel like I know what cuckold

639
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,072
I know like it

640
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:33,216
The word

641
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:38,848
A guy whose wife is cheating on him and everyone knows it

642
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:44,992
How does a nation confrontation pornography

643
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,040
I don't care at all

644
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:53,440
That's the way he's using it more okay people are like white women are being taken over by mine

645
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,512
And the white man

646
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,352
Last time you were on you asked me if I thought Alex Jones was a supremacist

647
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,144
Yeah and I said I didn't know

648
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,448
In the last few months I'm pretty sure

649
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,288
Your is leaning one way towards supremacist

650
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
Yeah

651
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,384
Got shown a little bit of those flavors

652
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
He's referring to

653
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
You cock in

654
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
Fetishize

655
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040
Finley ND

656
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
Specifically racist

657
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,392
Specifically

658
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah the other thing I forgot to bring us up

659
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,072
He keeps trying to say that Facebook is trying to make you into

660
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,352
Secure and all this stuff

661
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,984
And maybe that is accurate based on that 2012 study that they did

662
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
Pitstop

663
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,800
Stop doing that

664
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
That one

665
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
Fairly accurate

666
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,896
Vishnu

667
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
Obviously marketing research

668
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,064
Already Express insecure vulnerable feeling

669
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
But again

670
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,648
Not targeted at anybody

671
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
Aggregated

672
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
Anonymous stuff

673
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Anyway

674
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Cocking

675
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
Islam

676
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,328
These are important

677
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
Thing

678
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
Then we'll come back out

679
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
But before they do

680
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,960
Alex's got to get into his next point

681
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Which

682
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
I did

683
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Highlights College

684
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
You didn't

685
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
Alex Jones

686
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
That's correct

687
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:20,224
Do you want to I think about a year of Community College and then dropped out

688
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
That's important

689
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,856
Because this next clip Alex Jones explains what's going on on college campuses

690
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,464
Perfect as an expert on the subject and haven't gone to a community college

691
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
This years ago

692
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Yeah

693
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,608
Major colleges in Europe

694
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:43,776
Scared kid show up from the countryside

695
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,592
Homophobe

696
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
Come to our group you'll be safe here

697
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,248
Disadvantage

698
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:05,024
Motorcycle game

699
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
Except

700
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:13,472
I mean your professors and their props and their assistants are the new boss

701
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
That's absurd

702
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
That's patently absurd

703
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,504
That's why I only have a few professors in my time at college that I interacted with in any meaningful way outside of

704
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,320
And they get no way swayed by

705
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,112
Political beliefs my

706
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,136
Sense of self

707
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,976
Inspired me and directions of that I was already interested

708
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
Didn't say ancient Greek

709
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,536
Or logic

710
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,096
These are things that I studied in college were because

711
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,424
Largely I responded to the teaching style of the professor

712
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,472
It was something I was already interested in

713
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
They have

714
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,544
Logic in college

715
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Paul Wyrick

716
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:55,200
Was just an update an amazing way of speaking about something so Bland and dry

717
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
As formal logic

718
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:01,600
I got really interested in it and I took it took like three years worth of classes

719
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,672
From him and then went on to study Game Theory

720
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
Free classes that you taught

721
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,488
I really like this style

722
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
I had

723
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:14,656
Couple Greek professors an awesome I ended up translating The Iliad in college

724
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,960
I had no intention of doing that because

725
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,776
I really like the professor that audit and

726
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
They didn't they were

727
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Bosses

728
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,664
My dad is a professor

729
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,712
I've grown up around

730
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,504
Academia

731
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,832
Professor

732
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
The Alex Jones

733
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,648
Is community college professor movie

734
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,464
Trump's doctor

735
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
If I'm lucky

736
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
But yeah

737
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,632
Experience with colleges Wyoming professors in

738
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,192
None of this is one of those Rings true

739
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
It's absurd it's fear

740
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,152
He's suggesting that like groups

741
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,432
Are the equivalent

742
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
If joining a

743
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
Race game

744
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,808
Yep

745
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:10,208
Missouri State University

746
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
That's the third most dangerous game

747
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,840
Yeah there's MS-13 up top does the blood

748
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,424
Lmsd Student Activity

749
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,216
And let me tell ya we

750
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:27,616
We killed some people over to Truman State and we threatened

751
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,296
Is going to come for you

752
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,904
You know what it is it all comes from

753
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,792
It comes from it he brings it up even people come from the countryside or whatever they go down

754
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:52,192
And when they do they shed a lot of their conservative values because they're exposed to diversity they meet people who are deaf

755
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
Different

756
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,080
It was a lot more

757
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,896
And you're now a rocket a trendy mustache

758
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,992
My main personality feet

759
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,832
This is the gateway to trendiness mustache

760
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,368
Oh yeah it's it's

761
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,184
Did the conservatives fear of losing your children

762
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
2

763
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,096
Well we would say reason

764
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Different

765
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,680
He's not nearly done

766
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
With explaining what's going on in college

767
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Of course not

768
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,824
Lisa liberal campus

769
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,920
Development

770
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
All the way up to that point

771
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,040
And then once you get to them at like 20 years old or so

772
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:43,648
You're allowed to develop

773
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,976
Don't like

774
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:57,216
What to be the wrong person system

775
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,264
Put them into the system

776
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,336
Take advantage

777
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
Bees

778
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,272
And who want to be part of the whole system you want to laugh at everyone is it part of orthodox

779
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,344
Are you starting to get the cosmology of bettas

780
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,512
Are going to become trendy

781
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
Alphabet

782
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,656
I I think there is a little bit of Baden this coming out in him

783
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
Shirt

784
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,336
Is an alpha being afraid of bettas

785
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,760
Right now it is just

786
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,088
Yap-yap

787
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
Ioi

788
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,904
I don't even know how to really

789
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
Address

790
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
His promise

791
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
Police let you

792
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:56,608
Beat up people and you go through a rite of passage according to their whims

793
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
He's just talking about Burke

794
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,472
He's just talkin about the bike

795
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,824
He's just imagining what happens

796
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,664
If you wanted a real case you should I mean

797
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,296
Something close about like having a jack off

798
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,464
He doesn't talk about that song

799
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
About as far as

800
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Missouri

801
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
There was

802
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
Yeah

803
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,920
Teo Yoo

804
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,016
While I was there to hillbilly dude

805
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
Are they

806
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,600
What do the Legion of black collegians building

807
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,208
Had a whole bunch of bottles of Tylenol took all the cotton out of them

808
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,000
And covered their yard with cotton

809
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,536
Anti-racist gesture

810
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:04,192
That's how I was pretty pretty bad

811
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
On a wall

812
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,944
There's tons of stuff like that that happens

813
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,272
Not everything is fake

814
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
Is what I'm getting out of

815
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,624
Yeah there's some assholes

816
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,672
Yeah and I am people who

817
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
Like

818
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
Gravitate towards liberal causes aren't

819
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Just mad about nothing

820
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
Right yeah

821
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
So

822
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,888
Alex you don't know what's going on on colleges

823
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
At this point

824
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,984
He gets back to his ideas about Islam

825
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
A little bit

826
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,312
Oh good I've been waiting

827
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,456
His hot takes this is very unfortunate

828
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,504
But he always calls

829
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
I noticed

830
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,856
It's I think it's very subtle disra

831
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Respect

832
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
I think

833
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,512
But he has a lot of real

834
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
Thoughts about them

835
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,584
In this next treating you

836
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
Look at that

837
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:11,008
They put a

838
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,848
Symbol of resistance

839
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,944
This is a few months ago

840
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
Eddie's women

841
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:34,048
Control over my image of myself within my own family

842
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:40,448
My mom started wearing the hijab when I was 13th

843
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,712
He's playing a video of Muslim girls in hijab

844
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,760
Talking about their relationship with it

845
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,600
And then he's going to once it's over just here in a second

846
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,672
Get back in.

847
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Which is the wife

848
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,864
Probably 13 or 14 at the time

849
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,264
Angel my mother did

850
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
This is the right to do this

851
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,088
You are put in prison or killed in almost every Islamic country

852
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
Iraq

853
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:36,512
And cereal you didn't have to wear them in women with a majority of college students doctors in science

854
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,816
Thunder

855
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,376
Leftist globalist Arab Springs

856
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,216
Again that's been Declassified

857
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,032
Also they're not implying that it's a choice

858
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
They're literally staying

859
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,336
It's a choice

860
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,616
Those girls in that video

861
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,919
Alex's is wrong on

862
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
Also I'm going to take their word

863
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
I think over Allison

864
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
Them

865
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,343
I think I think so

866
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,391
You know what this is been

867
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:09,023
This is not as wacky as I wanted to be

868
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,655
Yeah I'm passing

869
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
Fully

870
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,703
Disgusted

871
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Shock

872
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:24,639
I think that's the problem is there's a little bit of disgust a little bit of

873
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,223
August there's a lot of Islam

874
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,015
Right talk is never fun

875
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
It's a it's a little bit

876
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,647
That's hot

877
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,183
Haha

878
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,719
Area

879
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,255
This clip

880
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,791
Is Luna

881
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:46,143
Complaining about how he's being censored

882
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,191
And then it spins way off the rails

883
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,031
Nothing but he says in this clip is true

884
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,823
Keep that in mind

885
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,871
I think you'll know very clearly.

886
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,455
We got more visitors than blisters and ever

00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,247

You've got a hand posted on your site

892
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,399
You got a hand

893
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,823
With a whole fake liberal cosmology

894
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,871
Your smocks

895
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
They're laughing you

896
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,687
They think you're idiots

897
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,735

Always thinking

904
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,695
Give us 200000

905
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,975
35 million

906
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,279
Then you can come to the capital of Nigeria

907
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,375
The trendy bars

908
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,703
Judge years ago.

909
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,519

00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,391
It's all a con

913
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:21,023
That's what Trinity ism is all about Barack Obama New World Order

914
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,351
So there's a lot.

915
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,911
Okay so first of all saying if you're like

916
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:34,079
If I should have a Facebook

917
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,151
None of your friends would be in with that.

918
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
Hey Tyler you get it

919
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,503
They be like are you in a bit or are you okay with that

Are you not well

922
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:57,887
I love the idea that was a multi-phase scam

923
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:04,287
Where you give him $1,000 and he actually does give you $5,000

924
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823

Did he say he was with Mike Judge has one of those weirdos

00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:25,023
People like Joe Rogan hang out with him to this

927
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,679
I don't know if you likes his philosophies or anyting but their friends

928
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
Apparently

929
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
That's

930
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:43,711
About the fact that there were people pretending to be Rothschild going to Austin Community College

931
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:49,087
The hardest game in the world

932
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,647

00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,695
Pressure to party

Drapion

935
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,023

00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,639
No absolutely not

949
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
So stupid

950
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,991
What is like literally

951
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
Friend tells you happy

952
00:47:54,623 --> 00:48:00,767
It is like a weird bar never been to and like the outskirts of Austin even though I do

953
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,559
Brother in Everybody Loves

954
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:11,007
Which is weird because in my experience

955
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:17,663
I don't know where this guy was probably wasn't even Nigerian

956
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
So

957
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,807
Goddamn stupid I love it that's the kind of Alex Jones I love

958
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:28,159
I think that he's scatting around like that because he's on some sort of speed

959
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,975
But he's on something inside of me it's hard to do that

960
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
Normally

961
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,535
It's hard to do that just

962
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:38,143
It makes sense

963
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,215
The only other possibility is severe manic episode

964
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,335
Full of energy

965
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,383
But if you

966
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,967
In terms of wacky you know I did not ever weird stories

967
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,271
Rest assured this next clip

968
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,551
Is Justice crazy

969
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,367
He's going to start by talking about this story

970
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:03,231
Where to go that FBI translator ended up leaving the FBI

971
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,023
She married a nice

972
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,631
Alex is going to introduce that story

973
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,679
Talk nothing about it

974
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,263
Dunno analysis of it into none of the details

975
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,055
And then skip onto another

976
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,895
Wacky stories that I don't think is true

977
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,623
Liberal educated

978
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:35,743
She still fell in love with the Isis guys that sell sex slave to the slavery six-year-old girls

979
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,375
But she had to go.

980
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,039

982

He pushed the whole system

983
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:12,095

For sure

1014
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:22,911
People are finally

1015
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,775
Go to number website

1016
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,311
Quantcast or Alexa

Track traffic to websites for advertising purposes

1018
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:42,111
Infowars.com everybody is just watching The Colbert videos

1019
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:53,631
Like if you go to infowars.com you're just going to be overwhelmed by all my tickets so much b*******

1020
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:57,727
And the articles are funny and then if you watch the show it's not fun

1021
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,287
Is kind of fun cuz I cut out

1022
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,311
Like the

1023
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,359
Half an hour

1024
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,639

00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,407
The juice

1026
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,367
The world service I'll say it

1027
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,903
So let me ask you something

1028
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,999
Ask away what do you think the truth is about this running into two

1029
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:20,767
Target

1030
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,399
Well they probably were not dress

1031
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,519
I think he was born

1032
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,799
Their physique

1033
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,383
Look like a The Flintstones dude

1034
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:40,479
He's going to be there maybe Bears I would save their in the bear category

1035
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,087
Gay or not

1036
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
Who knows

1037
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,183
He's just decided they're gay

1038
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:55,839
Cuz of course

1039
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,119

1040
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,911

Sizing in Subway

1043
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,919
When you just had your kids taken away and I are buying one of them toys adorable

1044
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,223
But I think it is

1045
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,063
You got really self-conscious and probably

1046
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,367
Probably didn't yell at them cuz his kid was there

1047
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
I hope

1048
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:23,231
But you know everybody

1049
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
Continue

00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:31,935

Yes

1055
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,527
Japanese weird B12 s***

1056
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,647
I learned I actually was watching this and I get

1057
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:58,559
Woo because unfortunately we get to find out that Alex Jones has heard of the handmaid's

1058
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,863
And

1059
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,447
His review is not good

1060
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:09,055
Based on the trailer the Hulu trailer

1061
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:14,175
Play the Hulu trailer

1062
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,455
Yeah it looks great

1063
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,015
I want to watch the show

1064
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,295
But anyway

1065
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,367
Start by getting mad at friend

1066
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:27,999
He then complains about some other stuff and then he gets into his feelings about the handmaid's tale

1067
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,815
Yeah without having Reddit watched it or anyting

1068
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,839
At all

1069
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,191
Because we're

1070
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:42,591
Globalist

1071
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,991
Cool

1072
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:55,391
Super crazy

1073
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,095
I'd like to remind

1074
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:07,679
Everyone about how mad job

1075
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:14,847
The guy who just said I don't care I'm not obsessed with what you wear

1076
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:19,455
Is it pointed out the Flintstones look like

1077
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,039
10 minutes of this show and maybe 5% of his life complaining

1078
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,343
About Muslims being forced to wear hijabs

1079
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,647
So you do care

1080
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,719
I'll complain about this more in a minute

1081
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,983
Now what

1082
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:45,311
And they make all of the

1083
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,079
People

1084
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
Only have one husband

1085
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,711
Unwise and where do you have these gowns

1086
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,527
Hamburger places little chips

1087
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,831
First of all great

1088
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,111
Great plot synopsis

1089
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:02,719
Really really understanding the essence of what is in that

1090
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
That book

1091
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,607
The ultimate Evil that's going to make women

1092
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:13,215
Not wear skirts and Anna just be slaves to a patriarchal system

1093
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,151
Look at Ivanka Trump

1094
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,711
Look at piceous daughters look at his wife

1095
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,551
Got a different movie

1096
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:36,767
New York movies coming out

1097
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,839
Transformers

1098
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:45,727
This isn't reality is the mark of slavery

1099
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,551
So then he goes on to play the trailer right here for the handmaid's tale

1100
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,623
Different movie

1101
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,511
Nonsense action movie that Michael Bay is making

1102
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,047
But in addition

1103
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:14,143
Yeah and I I love this argument

1104
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,847
Little boys with dreads

1105
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,663
Give beauty pageant he's totally into women

1106
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:31,039
Really into this

1107
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,343
Especially on today of all days

1108
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,391
When a plan

1109
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,159
Pasta House

1110
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:41,535
The only reason I'm not serious about that because there's no

1111
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,655
I am I also said a number of

1112
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,215
Other political predictions in my life that have been wrong

1113
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:55,359
So

1114
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,151
And if it does

1115
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
We're burning the system

1116
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:03,807
So it's everything a riot

1117
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,879
You can sustain a system where you've never given people thing

1118
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,951
Like before people had access to healthcare

1119
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,743
People were mad

1120
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:15,839
But now with you take it away from people who would die without it

1121
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,143
That's they've Nothing Left to Lose

1122
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,727
And they know the system where they could have had their lives saved

1123
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,287
It's it's going to be f****** bedlam

1124
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,079
If it if it goes through

1125
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:26,847
Pennywise

1126
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
Alex plays this trailer of the handmaid's tale

1127
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,199
What's great

1128
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,063
But he comes back afterwards and this is his sort of

1129
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,087
Automation

1130
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,367
Which is

1131
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
Not great

1132
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,231
So there you go total inversion of reality

1133
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,535
The gentleman

1134
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,495
So there's no Chris

1135
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,775
Sounds like people do that I'd like to

1136
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,567
To think about

1137
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:06,271
Alex

1138
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:16,255
I would like to also cuz they're a sign of pride

1139
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,815
Get the f*** off at Alex

1140
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:22,143
You're just scared of Muslims and you don't want to admit it

1141
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,423
Yeah and he's

1142
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,959
He's calling what they wear

1143
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,519
But really a spot

1144
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,543
That they're wearing

1145
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,687
It's really I mean

1146
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,991
The way they are dressed very Amish

1147
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:45,695
I think that's more the point even of the it is war

1148
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:50,559
Harkening back to even American puritanical schitt's very Christian

1149
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,423
That's the whole thing is eight

1150
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,703
Baby all the time

1151
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,983
Prayers

1152
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
Very

1153
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,287
Schertzer but again

1154
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,335
Alex is using that

1155
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,383
Piece of fiction that is ominous

1156
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:08,991
No future we could be looking at earlier Court Savannah to stop it

1157
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,807
Yeah we could be close to that dystopia at some point

1158
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,831
If we aren't careful

1159
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:18,207
Using that as a reality

1160
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
That's like

1161
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,999
Come on man

1162
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:20,767
Stop trying

1163
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,815
Like I wish you would come out with it

1164
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,399
I wish you would just come out with it and be I'm scared of other cultures

1165
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,935
As opposed

1166
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,495
Couching it behind all this s***

1167
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
Resent his cowardice

1168
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,311
Debater move

1169
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,591
Real beta mu

1170
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,639
So this next clip

1171
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,431
Talks about a

1172
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
A story

1173
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,015
But he's misrepresenting about Russia

1174
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:44,063
Then he lies about how he's getting

1175
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,879
A little bit and then at the end

1176
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,439
I really think what I was just yelling about

1177
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,511
I think he gives up the game

1178
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:55,583
I think he is no longer able to sort of

1179
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,863
Mask is feeling

1180
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,143
And it slips out

1181
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,447
Washington Post total inversion of reality

1182
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:04,287
Guns and religion

1183
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:09,407
Now you see if you're pro-gun or Pro Christian

1184
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:16,063
And the Second Amendment is the Russian

1185
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,367
The 1776 and did all that

1186
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,719
No rush and become more Christian and more pro-gun had lower taxes

1187
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,655
Describe

1188
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,447
Shutdown

1189
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,519
Fellows are born New York

1190
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,223
Port Charlotte

1191
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,015
The first one

1192
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:53,183
1791 not 1776

1193
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,719
Secondarily

1194
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,999
He's not being sued

1195
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,559
Bye George soros's Law Firm that's just

1196
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:04,959
Complete made up in his mind by a member of the Federal Reserve board

1197
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,263
Chobani yogurt

1198
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:11,103
Who was a member of the upstate Regional committee

1199
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,639
Advisory Board

1200
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,431
For the Federal Reserve

1201
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,223
The upstate New York

1202
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
Advisory committee

1203
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,039
Where they had they have

1204
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:19,807
Group

1205
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,087
A business owners

1206
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:25,183
Advise the board on what the economy is like in their estimation

1207
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,999
He was part of that Alex's change that it was mine

1208
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,815
Dewey's on the board of the Federal Reserve New York

1209
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:34,143
Because he knows it'll spook people out and I'm not

1210
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
Anyway

1211
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:40,287
It's not a buffet

1212
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,175
Donkey Kong

1213
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,223
I think you're idiots they think

1214
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,527
They're selling Islam everywhere

1215
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:57,183
Nice here right waiting six years ago Islam taking over caliphate

1216
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,743
New Mexico

1217
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:03,327
Martial law

1218
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:07,679
Are setting up in Islamic State

1219
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,983
None of that's true

1220
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,367
The state department

1221
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,959
Incompatible oppressive people

1222
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,247
There's a couple things there at the end

1223
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,295
We are unfortunate

1224
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,831
Accidental

1225
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,623
Freudian slips possibly

1226
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,671
First one escaping Islam

1227
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,743
Vinology for people who have come to America

1228
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
Woefully inaccurate

1229
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,887
I think a lot of them bring their culture and their religion along

1230
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,191
Escaping dictatorships

1231
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,471
Repressive regimes

1232
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239
And stuff like that

1233
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,799
That I think is

1234
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,871
Just a clear idea of

1235
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,919
Incompatible people

1236
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,455
We're going to destroy the West

1237
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
That's real bad

1238
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
It's pretty shity

1239
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:33,695
That's pretty bad also he's not setting up an Islamic State for a religious

1240
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
Caliphate

1241
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,767
He's just setting up a horrible dictator

1242
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:41,631
It's not a religious dictator so

1243
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,167
Soca

1244
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
Doctors in

1245
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:52,383
Lawyers

1246
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,175
The

1247
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,455
There was a good one

1248
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,015
It's really fun it's really funny

1249
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,831
I miss all these Muslim Warriors

1250
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:06,719
By 1 probably

1251
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,791
I'll be so great if the Chobani guy's lawyer was a wreck

1252
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,559
Fuji

1253
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:16,959
That would be extra sweet

1254
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:23,359
Text Libby goes on to Al about things that aren't liberal that trendy think are liberal

1255
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:26,687
And every single one of them is nonsense

1256
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:31,807
No one really believes the things that he's claiming the trendy's believe

1257
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,367
And they're all based on fake stories

1258
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,391
He told in the past

1259
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,415
On his show

1260
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,439
It's passing a

1261
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,975
This is why he's fake news

1262
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:39,999
Legitimate

1263
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,535
This right here

1264
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,263
And the media acts like it's no big deal

1265
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,567
He's talking about liberals and Muslim

1266
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,967
I'm in Facebook comes out as targeting on people

1267
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:05,087
But you're alone and giving them fake liberal culture it's not real liberal

1268
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,279
That was based on a story out of Michigan there's a college

1269
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,607
That's in their dorms they took boards off the dorm

1270
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,631
Doors

1271
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,679
That's because people kept writing the n-word on

1272
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,983
And other racial slurs

1273
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:28,383
They decided that most communication was done through social media anyway and they didn't

1274
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
Spewing hate

1275
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,223
Hey wasn't it was just at this is

1276
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,503
More harm than good

1277
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,295
So that story is

1278
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,831
Evan band anyting

1279
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,391
Halloween costume parties

1280
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,439
Fiesta party system

1281
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,719
Cultural appropriation

1282
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:48,607
He specifically always complains about how people get in trouble for doing blackface at parties

1283
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,887
And stuff like that

1284
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:54,495
If you don't want to have fiesta parties no one cares

1285
01:07:54,751 --> 01:08:00,895
He wanted the Cinco de Mayo party no one really is all that mad about that but don't show up with like a brown

1286
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:05,247
Don't use ethnicity as a costume

1287
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
That's reasonable

1288
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,879
Having a fiesta party totally cool

1289
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:15,231
Anyway that's a weird take I mean I'll give him this

1290
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,791
Different approach to being

1291
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,095
Anti Halloween

1292
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,911
You know conservative or Christian

1293
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,703
It's not like it's demonic

1294
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,519
Yeah exactly

1295
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
Medieval

1296
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,175
The next one

1297
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,503
Oriental food is not

1298
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:42,623
San Francisco

1299
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,583
Orient

1300
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,631
Has it been

1301
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,471
Machinist

1302
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:03,359
What words

1303
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:06,687
It's about controlling this is

1304
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,039
Music

1305
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,063
The bat

1306
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,599
French cuisine

1307
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,463
This Means War

1308
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,583
Doesn't mean you are sick

1309
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,119
This means you'll upset

1310
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,703
Online

1311
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:34,079
So the rock and roll with the thumb tucked

1312
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,871
Yeah that's the protection of Satan

1313
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,407
For protection from Satan

1314
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,943
With the thumb out that

1315
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,735
Which is crazy

1316
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
Also

1317
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,087
Self

1318
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,647
No one cares if you call something an oriental rug

1319
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,719
Oriental is appropriate in terms of

1320
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,535
People it's not

1321
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,351
That is the line is very clear

1322
01:09:56,607 --> 01:10:01,727
Oriental was a pejorative term is used very degrading lead supposed to use it for them

1323
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:02,751
Calling

1324
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,287
Food Oriental

1325
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,847
Is different non-specific

1326
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,407
Like I could mean a whole lot of different cuisine

1327
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,711
I think it's a bad way to use language

1328
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,295
Oriental food

1329
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,831
I can't answer that question

1330
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,367
Cuz I do want tie

1331
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,903
But I don't want Chinese

1332
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,951
It's right so I don't know I don't know

1333
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,631
It seems like that was probably not based on

1334
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,167
Maybe somebody

1335
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
Don't say that

1336
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,519
And he just like

1337
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:41,407
Who is this

1338
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,223
Is it lodged

1339
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,247
Oh yeah

1340
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,551
That's not liberal

1341
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:52,927
So culture and what have you but you know he's a religious man

1342
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,207
You know that's right

1343
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,255
Christianity

1344
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,815
Would you believe

1345
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,119
But he doesn't have a good grasp on scripture

1346
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
Used to believe that

1347
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,263
Hear it to police

1348
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,567
I'm going to play for you him talking

1349
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,871
About one of the most Elementary scriptures

1350
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,919
In the entire biblical Canon

1351
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,735
The story of The Prodigal Son

1352
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,807
You know the parable of the Prodigal Son

1353
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,647
He has a good son that runs the farm runs the

1354
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,287
He runs off and all these fake friends screwing over

1355
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
Prostitutes drugs

1356
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,847
Alcohol

1357
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,247
My Sunshine

1358
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,575
SSI

1359
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,903
I never

1360
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,151
Thank God your brother.

1361
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,223
I care about Prince

1362
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,783
You're in a cult

1363
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,487
I don't I don't know if that's

1364
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
The point of

1365
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,047
The Prodigal Son

1366
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:43,007
Was just one just gambling and banging around you was doing some h

1367
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:50,431
Is getting to the hard stuff a couple of the finer points of that story that isn't he's missing are that the younger son went away

1368
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,991
Inheritance

1369
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,783
And then he became a slave

1370
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,343
If any like shitt I could just be a slave back at home

1371
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,391
I'm going to go apologize to my dad

1372
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,415
Apt2b

1373
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,463
Slaves at my family's house

1374
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:06,815
Eddie comes back and he offers that Miss other says we're having a party

1375
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,583
You're back

1376
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:13,471
A little bit you're so much better than him

1377
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:18,335
We got to throw parties to make this little b**** feel better it's not that

1378
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:21,919
Hey did the dad tells the older brother

1379
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,711
We Rejoice because

1380
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Our son

1381
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,271
Who was that is now alive again

1382
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,807
It isn't like

1383
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
You don't

1384
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,111
Party

1385
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,415
It has nothing to do with that

1386
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:37,791
Jerome story the story isn't about reinforcing the older brother

1387
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,583
It's not about that

1388
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,399
It's actually about taking the piss out of the older brother

1389
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,727
He is completely wrong

1390
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,263
Of course

1391
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,311
And I'm sure that this

1392
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:58,015
I'm interested what you thought I was just thinking like I'm sure that this is like a lot of people

1393
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,343
Is they like Miss

1394
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,111
Interpret

1395
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,135
They're contributing

1396
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,159
To themselves

1397
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,183
You know are there

1398
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:05,951
Contributing to be

1399
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,767
It's like my money's going to these

1400
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,327
The right bottom corner

1401
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,423
Probably thinks that way a little

1402
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,751
4 time constraint

1403
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,031
It's cuz you got to show this evening

1404
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:23,103
But this next clip we're get it we're coming into

1405
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,639
I'm here

1406
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:27,199
Okay just some Asian starts here

1407
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:30,271
Where else is going to talk about how it's getting real

1408
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,575
Facebook

1409
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,855
Right

1410
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,415
This whole thing was supposed to be about this Facebook

1411
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,279
A long detour

1412
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,559
Clip is about how

1413
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,839
A bad shift getting

1414
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,887
Emily's going to lose the thread on that real

1415
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,703
Energy

1416
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:54,847
The world I know you got inside as well just like a candle I can light you on fire and you can ride

1417
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:08,415
Statistically getting dumber and Secor way off the charts we all know this

1418
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,255
I told you they had the 60 cyborg

1419
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,535
Dog classified

1420
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
Is that the dent

1421
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,239
Understand

1422
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,847
Power lines

1423
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,919
Bulbs flickering

1424
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,479
I was at a press conference Friday

1425
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:36,063
Don't you understand the human animal clones

1426
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,623
Genetic engineering

1427
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:42,207
Everybody's getting sick from it is causing all these mutagenic virus

1428
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,839
ABC

1429
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,375
Lively

1430
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:52,447
Equalizer on for

1431
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,823
Aesthetic

1432
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,919
Piece of crap

1433
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:20,863
I pulled up the statistics from the CDC cancer rates are on the decline

1434
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,215
, decline

1435
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,751
Most of the cancers are

1436
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,823
With early detection are very treatable

1437
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,103
I'm saying fear-mongering

1438
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,127
IGoogle

1439
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:36,735
And searched as far as I could to cyborg cat

1440
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:40,063
What you talking about is that there was

1441
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:46,207
During the Cold War did they wanted to put listening devices inside cats and dogs

1442
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,511
I'm use them as like sort of

1443
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,327
Walkie talkies for recording device

1444
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:57,215
That's not a cyborg cat would never work you can't control the behavior of a cat

1445
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:00,287
Like that

1446
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:04,383
Oh no it's because it causes

1447
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,687
Chimeras

1448
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,991
Okay

1449
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:14,367
Did that is absurd and I love that

1450
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:18,975
I don't like it either I got a cat shoes

1451
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:25,631
Bionic

1452
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,399
But then

1453
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,935
In his post

1454
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,471
Custody hearing

1455
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,239
Press conference

1456
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,543
He did get into

1457
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,311
Chimeras

1458
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,847
And human-animal hybrid

1459
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,639
Now I'm familiar only with

1460
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,431
Mythological

1461
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:44,319
Which is like a being that has multiple species DNA

1462
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,599
Lion

1463
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:56,607
No that's a horse horse

1464
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,655
Hippogriff that the horse bird

1465
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,703
Horse

1466
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,239
I apologize

1467
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,615
Human-animal hybrid

1468
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:12,223
Human DNA is being placed with animals and being implanted into the bellies of cows

1469
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,527
He also won our last

1470
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:20,159
Like two episodes back you was talking about how a genetic researcher in London told him that there are fish people

1471
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,207
To crawl around in cages

1472
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:25,023
Human Horror in their faces

1473
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:32,191
Oh I love that sentence I've also research Vista bit there's literally no evidence or what he's talkin to

1474
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:34,751
That sounds like

1475
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:38,079
The only truth to it is that scientist

1476
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:41,407
Experimenting with the idea of growing human organs within animals

1477
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,711
Facilitate organ transfer

1478
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,015
Because there are a lot of organs that we were

1479
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:46,783
Jordan

1480
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,319
You could save a lot of people's lives

1481
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,135
Actually being done

1482
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,439
Harvesting organs within animals

1483
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,303
Yeah that's not chimera

1484
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,583
Has a different

1485
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
And everyone is laughing

1486
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,983
Yeah I understand where the burden of proof lies

1487
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:09,567
When he makes a crazy claim and I say nope

1488
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,359
I don't have to prove no

1489
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,151
Does he consider himself a journalist

1490
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,175
Yes

1491
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,479
In that certain

1492
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,015
Journalist

1493
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:18,783
He.

1494
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,575
He thinks he's doing Journal

1495
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,927
It's Dreadful press conference

1496
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,463
There was maybe like

1497
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,511
10 12 15 people there I would say

1498
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,047
Reporters

1499
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,327
And the number of them

1500
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,119
Probably were Infowars employees

1501
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,495
Working again

1502
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,519
Bear

1503
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,799
That's just paranoia

1504
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,591
That's just his paranoid

1505
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:45,151
I'm sure people

1506
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,039
Yeah it's just weird demon fantasy

1507
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,343
Next clip

1508
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,135
He actually

1509
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,695
Something that is kind of surprising

1510
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:02,303
And there's one of the first times I've heard him say something vaguely negative about Donald Trump

1511
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:06,655
He does let slip that he thinks Trump is going sideways

1512
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,703
A little bit as he puts it which is

1513
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,727
Real Jenner

1514
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,336
He gets into what I would do

1515
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,360
Described as

1516
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,384
How erase it

1517
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,664
Describes racism

1518
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,200
Which is really a

1519
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,760
I think I think he's wrestling with

1520
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,528
Some stuff

1521
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,088
And he doesn't understand that he's on the wrong side of it

1522
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,368
He's projecting

1523
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,392
Incredibly hard

1524
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
So

1525
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
Enjoy

1526
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,768
All the trendy garbage can wake up

1527
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,608
And understand why am I

1528
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:43,264
You still doing some good get this job stabilizing tanks

1529
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,336
He's going sideways because it's hard to go against this

1530
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,248
When I get in

1531
01:20:54,528 --> 01:21:00,672
Most people are in that position where they lie to themselves

1532
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:10,144
You're the one that doesn't

1533
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,960
Accused in court

1534
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,776
Is noclip no proof no nothing

1535
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:20,896
Never be able to go

1536
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:28,064
I was watching the coverage of the trial pretty closely that course that did not

1537
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,392
That was nowhere in anyone's reporting I don't think that

1538
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,440
Was hoping it was made in court I think he's

1539
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:37,024
Internalizing some comment that was made I would assume

1540
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,072
I meant all that other stuff that is

1541
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,096
Clearly

1542
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,400
What he thinks people are saying about him

1543
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,424
Because we are

1544
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:46,752
He is a racist

1545
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,288
He is a cult leader

1546
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,592
The clothes minded

1547
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,408
When he's saying

1548
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,200
But that's

1549
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,736
You know that's the game

1550
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:00,064
Hey brain control you to think that I'm the bad guy

1551
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,672
That's the manipulative bad guy

1552
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:10,560
It's a really really good trick you can play on dumb people but it doesn't work when anybody analyzes

1553
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,328
Anyting

1554
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:19,264
Conformist feel good and strong

1555
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:26,176
Sexism homophobia

1556
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,456
Even though you're not

1557
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,088
Other people

1558
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:39,488
They use it Master identity is a couple of terms you run around and used you have no family

1559
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:45,888
Will television and the latest

1560
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,424
Download

1561
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,216
Over and over again

1562
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,008
Year after year

1563
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,288
So

1564
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,568
He thinks

1565
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,360
Basically

1566
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,432
That accusations of racism sexism

1567
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,968
Homophobia

1568
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:00,992
Or not

1569
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:04,576
People understanding recognizing real world

1570
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:09,440
As much as it is the mainstream media tricking you into thinking these things are in Port

1571
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,720
Which

1572
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:15,328
Really sounds bad coming from like a straight white dude who's angry about Muslims

1573
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
All the time

1574
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,144
Well I mean there's nothing like

1575
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:19,936
A racist

1576
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,496
Self

1577
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,592
My racism is a real it's you projecting that onto me

1578
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:31,456
Write what a create event

1579
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:34,784
I think this is the sort of thing you only hear from races

1580
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,344
Yeah you do hear it from them quite frankly

1581
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:41,184
I've never heard that kind of excuse like

1582
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,232
Hey look B Dominica

1583
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,792
Give me the buzz words of racism

1584
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,584
I've never heard that come out of the mouth

1585
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,376
Oh somebody who I don't have question

1586
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,448
Right I do have some concern do you know

1587
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,752
People who are racist

1588
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,568
Where is this

1589
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:02,176
Actually I'm going to get the Joker

1590
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:03,968
Werewolf are alike

1591
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,088
Anderson

1592
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,136
But

1593
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,440
He mentioned some sort of joke he's like

1594
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,256
It's like we got to do this

1595
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,536
This Record good

1596
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,304
Because you

1597
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,864
It's harder to wash away any

1598
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:24,704
There's nothing harder to wash away than failure

1599
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,776
Except for being called a racist

1600
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,848
And Alex was completely on

1601
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,384
Jokingly agree with that

1602
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:36,992
It's just a word that they use and then what

1603
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,040
Your races

1604
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,904
I've been doing this show for we're in our 5th month now

1605
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,464
No doing this I listen to him everyday

1606
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:50,048
Words and I have the recording

1607
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:50,816
We have it all

1608
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,120
I use his words

1609
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,424
Paint him

1610
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,728
I don't bring anything

1611
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,752
To him

1612
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,544
Other than what he brings

1613
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,360
Right I have my own political beliefs

1614
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,408
And I have things that I think are also

1615
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,200
But I don't think he's

1616
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,480
Can't have those beliefs

1617
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:13,088
Like I'm not I'm not in any way or I've no interest

1618
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,880
In Quicken what he saying

1619
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,672
My worldview

1620
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,232
I can say that he's a racist

1621
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:21,536
Based on his own words

1622
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,376
Hundred percent

1623
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,400
Material

1624
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,936
Sometimes I will Dabble

1625
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,568
I don't know what the

1626
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,896
Poorly designed

1627
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:37,664
Find a conservative

1628
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,992
Websites

1629
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,552
Because our mutual friend

1630
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:48,160
Without my permission add me to close

1631
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,976
Groups on Facebook Facebook

1632
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,768
Look for like a bikers for Trump

1633
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:59,680
I had a little bit time or he was forcing that into my life as well before I left Facebook

1634
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:06,592
But I was miserable sod groups

1635
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:09,408
Because I'm so fascinated by

1636
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,688
I don't want to be totally

1637
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:16,320
I'm not getting a beer.

1638
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,368
I'm not getting write-ups

1639
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,136
I'm getting

1640
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,720
Another area

1641
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,024
But I saw this link that was like

1642
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,048
For the fire code

1643
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,680
Holster

1644
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,448
Said that

1645
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,240
And so this this website was like

1646
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,544
Seems like no real reason

1647
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,616
Has petitioned we're trying to get

1648
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:45,248
10000

1649
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,040
And

1650
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,344
Someone had written

1651
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,880
And there is this

1652
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:54,976
Like this anime

1653
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,256
Media always try to

1654
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,328
Minorities

1655
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,632
Days Inn

1656
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,680
Muslims in it like in

1657
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
Maybe Tuesday

1658
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,472
Slater

1659
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:11,104
And people who watch these shows have the gall to call us racist

1660
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,640
If I added an affected axe

1661
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:26,464
Yeah for sure

1662
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:30,560
Absolutely

1663
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,096
You're willing to own

1664
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,632
Even in the moment

1665
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:37,984
That affectation that you put on their eyes

1666
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,568
Contradicted themselves within a sentence

1667
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,360
On that website

1668
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:47,712
I think that's really what

1669
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,736
Separate

1670
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,552
I don't want to say us from them

1671
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:57,440
Because that's exactly

1672
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:02,816
People who are engaged with their own feelings and their beliefs and people who just sort of

1673
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,608
Have a rigid ideology

1674
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:10,240
And this is the sort of parting shot

1675
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,264
For the

1676
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,080
The 35-minute video that you put out

1677
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,360
Alright about to

1678
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:19,456
I think at this point we've proved he's proved his point that Facebook is

1679
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,760
Trying to turn people into Beethoven Cox

1680
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:25,856
I didn't cut anything out

1681
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:28,416
Substandard about that argument

1682
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,184
At all

1683
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,560
Piecing this together in a way that

1684
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,608
I am not

1685
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,656
If anything I'm being generous

1686
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:41,984
Gets into like

1687
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:45,568
You always have to end the middle and

1688
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:48,128
Start things with please for people to

1689
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,200
They'll promote his fight for him and give him money in

1690
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:51,968
And stuff like that

1691
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,808
He sort of doing that telling everybody is a crisis

1692
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,088
But the reason is Crisis

1693
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,880
It's cuz the enemies no

1694
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,184
His enemies

1695
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,464
Ifucking no

1696
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,304
The enemy

1697
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:12,448
Resetting us right now with everything they've got

1698
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,264
Doing it because they know

1699
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,544
We got the life force

1700
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:17,824
We have the will

1701
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,640
We understand global

1702
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,480
Military police in a lot of intellectualism

1703
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,040
Destroying

1704
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,072
We're getting

1705
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:39,840
Your support

1706
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,704
That's not why

1707
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,288
Absolutely that's his

1708
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,080
Religious pandering that he does

1709
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,872
Misinterpret

1710
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,688
The most basic allegory in the Bible

1711
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,808
There's no denying

1712
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,392
It's not because the enemy knows that

1713
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,928
He is the only person who can

1714
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:05,696
Stop them

1715
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:08,512
It's because he literally slandered yogurt

1716
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:17,216
But I can

1717
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,752
He's just going to

1718
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
Yeah

1719
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:26,432
He's going to take Alex to the Woodshed like it's going it's it's it's going to be a disaster

1720
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:35,136
The globalist plan they're worried about me because that's the only way he's going to be able to save face when he

1721
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,672
Does Luz

1722
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,464
Or they give him a

1723
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,232
Like

1724
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,512
Conciliatory

1725
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,536
Way out

1726
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,816
Like

1727
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,424
Couple million dollars and a formal apology and the suit can go away

1728
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:51,008
He has to pre-plan

1729
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,824
All this b*******

1730
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:54,848
Foundation

1731
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:59,968
Write 30 hour live broadcast

1732
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
For that

1733
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:03,552
Broadcast

1734
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,832
It's about raising money

1735
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,600
For your legal fees

1736
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,416
What do you think

1737
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,208
Prefer

1738
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,512
What you'll say

1739
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,536
She would prefer

1740
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:14,816
To be able to

1741
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,584
You still like Maine

1742
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,680
Keep it going

1743
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,448
Rather go.

1744
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,776
I think the ladder for sure

1745
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:28,128
I think that he's really obsessed with the idea of winning

1746
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,664
And destroying the globalist

1747
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:34,528
I'm not sure how aware he is but that's not a real group

1748
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,368
He's fighting an imaginary enemy Globetrotters

1749
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,952
He wants to join the general

1750
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:47,584
He's obsessed with winning this unwinnable battle it's like me trying to fight

1751
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,352
The Justice League

1752
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,376
Or something like that

1753
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:51,936
Superman's not real

1754
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,704
I can't beat him

1755
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,240
Do that that sort of thing

1756
01:31:56,032 --> 01:32:00,128
There's a part that if course he inevitably has to lose in a dramatic fashion

1757
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:02,944
The time

1758
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,992
He has air apparent

1759
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,296
Like he could go down

1760
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,576
And this movement

1761
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,344
This

1762
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:14,464
Very clearly subtly anti-semitic movement

1763
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,560
Can be held up by people like Mike cernovich people like Gavin McGinnis

1764
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,096
People

1765
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,656
Across-the-board some of his old employer

1766
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:23,680
21c goes down

1767
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:27,264
I think probably he would prefer to end up being a martyr

1768
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,568
As opposed to just grinding along

1769
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:32,384
Does it mean if he gets out of this

1770
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,176
There's just another lawsuit,

1771
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,968
You slandered so many people

1772
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:36,736
Yeah

1773
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:38,016
It's only a matter of time

1774
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,552
Hello

1775
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,368
We will say

1776
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:48,768
I don't time is moving forward we also don't think he's going to have a choice in the matter

1777
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:55,168
UP2U

1778

Sure television

1779
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:09,504
Kind of person you can video cam

1780

Yeah
