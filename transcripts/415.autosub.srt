00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan swetik

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge by I'm sick of imposing a good guy

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
About Alex Jones

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
Indeed we are Dan Jordan Jordan

6
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
What do you got for brakes

7
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,216
Shows how stupid I am

8
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
I didn't know that

9
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:20,384
Frozen hash brown patties existed and could be sold at the store and

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,456
Discovered that and they're fantastic

11
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,784
Really nice for breakfast item

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,088
Potatoes no I didn't realize

13
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,672
How many different shapes of potato they sell it before

14
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
Food section

15
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,488
I like that I like the way you put that

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
Shapes of

17
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816
A lot of presentations and

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
It's pretty wild I thought it was just like

19
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,216
We got crinkle fries you have chicken fries steak fries

20
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
Acquired so much more

21
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
Tots

22
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
Tots you got tots curly fries

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,432
Waffle fries at the hash brown patties

24
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,504
Except a pack of 10 of them cost like 4 bucks

25
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
You don't have to go to McDonald's

26
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
Browns mr. McDonald

27
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
Exactly your name maybe

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,048
A crock yeah that's a whole cracker s*** is what I'm

29
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,376
I will tell him

30
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
A book

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,448
Book series by Anne McCaffrey

32
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,800
Dragonsong and dragon singer and then there's a third one but

33
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
Play I love it so much

34
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,176
Because it's like that kind of magical girl story where

35
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,992
She's in a you know quiet remote place in

36
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
She's got a magical

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
Sure

38
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
Entirely about

39
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
Her wanting to become a music

40
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,184
And going to the school that doesn't allow women musician

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
And it's amazing is beautiful and it shows

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
A true and deep passion

43
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
A music that

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
I I care about bear

45
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,936
That sounds lovely

46
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,496
Recommendation

47
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
Souderton today we are going over

48
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,640
A little bit of an episode of Alex Jones Show for outside a we got

49
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,688
April Fool's Day episode

50
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
April 1st 2020

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
DMX

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,880
I'm so we're going to go over that it's really interesting there's some weird stuff

53
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
And then there's weirder stuff

54
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
Okay

55
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
I'm almost

56
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
Half of this episode is taken up with a

57
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,632
Source of conversation that is meaningless

58
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
Okay I like it so I'm thrilled to get into that

59
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080

Heroin

70
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Why you pimp so good

71
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
Is freakishly large

72
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
I declare

73
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
I like the show would like support these gents to do that

74
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,319
Finding a local charity in your area to help those who are in need

75
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
Please do one of the other they would be loved

76
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
So Jordan today like I said April 1st

77
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
April Fools

78
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,815
Alex starts off the show talking about a little bit of April Fool's business

79
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:57,471
Well ladies and gentlemen it is April Fool's Day and we got to April Fools

80
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
What

81
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,783
80000 in 2018

82
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,879
We have a total lockdown Society

83
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,439
No-sew first like

84
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
What's the

85
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
What's April Fools

86
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
Virus but it's not

87
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Is Fairy real

88
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,935
Is the April Fool's Day joke pretending like Adams original estimate was 80 tonight

89
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,495
Original estimate

90
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,639
So Alex is flu numbers are inaccurate there but you and sofu comparisons are by definition stupid some of that aside

91
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
What I want to focus on here is the claim that Mike Adams estimates

92
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
Are being shown to be

93
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
April Fools

94
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:47,391
This that's fair enough. Okay to say they so nice appearance has on Alex's show

95
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
Is it possible to say Witcher bikes estimates

96
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
Alex was talking about

97
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Michael's change projection

98
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
Quite a bit over the course of this. Very suspiciously in ways that seem to

99
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,399
Metacarpal Metallica's editorial tone

100
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
It's really helpful

101
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
On the day after China lockdown Wuhan

102
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
On January 24th

103
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:09,151
Famously get gastodon Alex's show and declare that it was over for Humanity and there would only be lone survivors

104
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
On that same show he literally said that most

105
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
People would not survive

106
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
Human race will not survive

107
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,671
I have this now there can be lone survivors or small groups

108
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
Survivors

109
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
We have to get to

110
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,839
Specific

111
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
But pretty high

112
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,495
On February 8th Mike returned to the show to misuse an estimate put up by Professor Neil Ferguson

113
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,127
Estimate that we would be seeing 7500 deaths a day in China from the virus

114
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
The death rate

115
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Is

116
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
6:45

117
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
10%

118
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Valet out here in a minute

119
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Anna has admitted it

120
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Accidentally admitted it

121
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
Neil Ferguson

122
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
Estimate

123
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Professor Ferguson

124
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
His estimates

125
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
50000 noon

126
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Directions a day

127
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Translate

128
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
7005

129
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
500 death

130
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
A day

131
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
Tryna over the neck

132
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,799
At the point of the writing of this episode China had experienced 3312 deaths from the virus a little more than

133
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
Of Mike Staley prediction

134
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,687
You take China's numbers with a grain of salt is still nowhere near what my

135
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Mike's talking about

136
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:22,111
Then on March 1st Mike and Alex been a considerable amount of time discussing Rush Limbaugh's comments about the virus having a

137
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
2% mortality rate

138
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
And how half the population

139
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
Iff population got infected

140
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
That would translate to approximately

141
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
3 million deaths

142
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,423
You mentioned rush so I'll bring this up okay rush says there's only a 2% mortality rate

143
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Map of America which is

144
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
Pretty typical for a flu

145
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
2% comes out

146
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
3.3 million dead

147
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Americans

148
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,735
Essentially just admitted there could be millions of deaths in America

149
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
The flu

150
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
Let's be clear we don't want that to happen it's terrible times larger than the flu

151
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Blue comparison

152
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
Did did Alex say that his projections were right

153
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:06,143
Meaning that there would only be 80 to 90 thousand people left on the planet or no

154
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
According to the universal one

155
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,311
By March 2nd Alex are completely fabricated to lieutenant-colonel sources who told him that

156
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
The Pentagon was predict

157
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
Approximately 3 million deaths

158
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Exactly what you and Mike

159
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
We could discuss when they were talking about Rush Limbaugh

160
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,343
Alex playing with the military have been ordered to contact him to let him know this because they needed hardcore Patriots to be prepared

161
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,487
Weirdly Alex is completely drop this 100% made-up story line now because it's not useful to him anymore

162
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
On March 6th

163
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
Mike return to the show with Anouk

164
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,143
Computer model that showed a possibility of about two million deaths

165
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
By July

166
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Which Alex

167
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Proceeded

168
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
To use incorrectly

169
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Donna models

170
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
Millions and millions dying or zanu

171
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
Computer model out

172
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
The shallows

173
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Bye

174
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
July

175
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
Again these are just models

176
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
Other lands at models

177
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
Alex was so out of line that Mike had to interrupt their interview to tell him to change the headline about his model on enforced reflect

178
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
The model is showing would happen in the unlikely

179
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,287
Possibly impossible scenario that literally nothing was done to slow down the virus

180
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,847
So it was a very good computer model yeah

181
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,687
There is no narrative you can make out of this that says the Mike Adams was accurate

182
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
Michael's all over

183
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,295
Over the place and generally airing strongly in the direction of Hysteria or Lyon

184
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,111
What Alex just did to start his show is

185
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Textbook gaslighting

186
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
Britannica Mike Adams has been

187
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
Super accurate

188
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,327
And his models they've always shown 80 to 90,000 and that's how I reported it

189
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,399
Straight down the middle complete Vindication for his prey

190
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
Complete Vindication it's abusive

191
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
It's so good to know when you're right

192
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
You know and I have a beacon

193
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,103
So there's a lot of rewriting of things in life

194
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
Creating this new episode

195
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,967
More solidified narrative and in this case

196
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
Alex lays it out here

197
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
It's essentially

198
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,855
You know what you need to know is that early on

199
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
The globalist said it was no big deal

200
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
In order to lure Trump

201
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,999
You know we've been down this road before but course

202
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
Here's how Alex explained

203
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
March 1st

204
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
I want to go

205
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:24,639
Because we're so they run the world

206
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,671
Alex's narrative his nonsensical about the progression through this matter really even care that much about how he decided to read

207
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
History

208
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,303
The story of his choosing

209
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
I'll just stick to

210
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
The claims that he's making

211
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:50,239
Alex claims that the US is engaging in more testing of the rest of the world combined and 100 times that of China

212
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
He further claims the China stop testing 2 weeks ago

213
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
On record that sounds like something China would do during the middle of the largest outbreak in their history

214
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,599
The claim the China stop texting people for Coronavirus is something that was making the rounds and some right-wing blogs

215
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
At which is undoubtedly where Alex got it from

216
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:14,303
So based on an article out of the Daily Apple which is a strongly anti-china tabloid from Hong Kong

217
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
Hasn't been

218
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:22,239
Substantiated by any other source and it seems unlikely that the case in China is still reporting new cases

219
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,895
No substantial questions about China's reporting about those things will be clearer in the future but this point

220
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,711
I wouldn't stake my credibility on this unfounded report

221
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,271
Unconfirmed report which Alex's just decided

222
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
Is on record totally accurate

223
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
A hundred percent

224
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
You got it

225
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,535
The u.s. is now done over 1.1 million coronavirus test and from what I can tell that is the most of any country in

226
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,863
However it's not more than all the countries combined

227
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,727
Italy's done more than 450,000 and South Korea is about 400

228
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
20000

229
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,079
Issues that the vast majority of these tests

230
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
In America haven't done research

231
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,687
Where is it would have been way more effective to have dumped him

232
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Earlier

233
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,759
Widespread testing is always helpful but

234
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,319
The point that they could have had the most impact has

235
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,647
Well testing now he's great but

236
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:16,511
Complaint is more the testing wasn't done when it was needed

237
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,655
But now it's real you just didn't notice that it turned from a hoax to react guess that's the way you explained it but

238
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,007
The other issue is that 1.1 billion test is good but

239
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,567
Per capita we're still far behind countries like Italy

240
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
In an article on NPR they they put the per capita testing at the United States at about 1 and 360

241
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,039
66 people compared to 1 and 130

242
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
3 + Italy

243
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
So when you know what do you adjust

244
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
For Countryside you can see the difference is a little bit more clearly

245
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
The numbers are kind of artist

246
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
To an extent

247
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Father stuff

248
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Nonsensical

249
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,351
Ways to try and defend Trump

250
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
Nonsense

251
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Big numbers

252
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,959
Quoting from places

253
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
It's always

254
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
Is always conveniently getting rid of the per capita

255
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Part of that you know

256
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,175
Chicago has the worst murders in the reservoir

257
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,991
Yeah that difference is is always

258
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
Start something he struggles with

259
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Yeah

260
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,183
So one of the things that I found particularly interesting about this an April Fool's joke

261
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
But turns out it's not

262
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,279
Is that Alex is very insistent that the

263
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
And like the Pentagon

264
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,423
They now all are sure that this was a bioweapon released

265
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Which

266
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
Getting to that from but okay

267
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,895
Senate intelligence and the Pentagon and again

268
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
People that are

269
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
Is it as he is a globalist

270
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,855
Because America was

271
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
New World Order

272
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,487
Americanizing it's 1776

273
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
Jerk plan that I have

274
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Forward

275
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
A thesis

276
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,679
Where you been so that's what you mean by mdcclxxvi worldwide

277
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:04,287
Is not getting rid of the new world order but americanizing

278
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,639
And it's your version of America I don't want that

279
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,455
It's a global One World Government that is

280
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,271
Is created by the oh no that's not good

281
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
Okay let's

282
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,671
See it's a good idea to have a one world

283
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
No I don't think Alex can save that

284
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
Right bro

285
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,351
So Trump and his his goons were taking over the

286
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
Discover Bank

287
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
And that was too bad

288
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:37,823
So there was a globalist biotech that's why

289
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
Absurd

290
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,735
The Senate is it a consensus in the in the intelligence Committee in the Pentagon

291
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
The f*** out of here in half and find seen in Loeffler all sold out of their sex right away week

292
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
Cuz they found out it was a bioweapon

293
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
And so they had to save their money for the future

294
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
It's not unethical Dan

295
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:02,655
I don't know I don't know that ain't going to work. It's picking it up now

296
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
So the

297
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
The globalist

298
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
Because they're doing this bio attack in

299
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
In all this

300
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
They need people to be hurt by it

301
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Or something

302
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,663
And so they don't want you to know that this Hydrochloric win

303
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
Is Bass

304
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Squeaky

305
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
The Game Change

306
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
Bright

307
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Really feel like it

308
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:23,391
We had all these these Governors like we talked about on the last episode of we're putting

309
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,975
Restrictions and regulations in place about frivolous prescription

310
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:31,071
Right because there's a concern about you know running into a complete

311
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
Shortage right customer

312
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:38,751
Enlisted everybody in a panic by other medication that could be otherwise very very helpful

313
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,079
Yeah so Alex has now learned that some of these

314
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,407
Senators and a senator's Governors are are requesting

315
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
Hydroxychloroquine

316
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
Decided that they flip

317
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
I have fought like the devil

318
00:15:54,623 --> 00:16:00,767
To tell you there is no internet connection

319
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,839
Telling you that

320
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
Sunshine and

321
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,359
Things like that that is very hard to get it

322
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
Medical doctors

323
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,135
Hydroxychloroquine was illegal or now begging for it

324
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,215
Blocking the medicine to the people that it shows they are psychotic

325
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,847
So Alex is implying that mission Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer

326
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,919
Did assist did request a hydroxychloroquine

327
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
But he's lying about

328
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:58,111
She did it at the request of the Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey who explained his actions to the Detroit news

329
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Who is Vasily

330
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,231
We needed something to prevent prevent chloroquine from becoming the next toilet

331
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:10,143
Prescribing hydroxychloroquine or Corcoran without further proof of efficacy for treating covid-19

332
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,959
With the intent to stockpile the drug May create a shortage

333
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
For patients with lupus

334
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,543
Rheumatoid arthritis or other ailments for which

335
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Chloroquine

336
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
And hydrochloric Wayne are proven

337
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Treatments

338
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Again

339
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:25,759
These are drugs that have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat covid-19

340
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
19

341
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,599
This is exactly the situation we're discussing to recent episode

342
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
People like Alex a romper

343
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:35,743
Pretending they found a miracle cure and because people look up to them they're making a run on this medication

344
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Which is leading to scarcity

345
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,935
To continue to serve the patients who have these conditions that this is actually used for people like the leadership in Michigan have had to try to get

346
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
More of it

347
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Give the appearance

348
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
But they're on board with

349
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
Being a coronavirus cure

350
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,615
When in reality they're just trying to mitigate the danger caused by Trump's Reckless

351
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,919
It makes me so mad

352
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
I'm just home

353
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
Tired of that

354
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
We are

355
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,367
Forcing people to act like this because we've been trapped them in this

356
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
Cult-like Behavior

357
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,719
They're doing all this stuff that's causing a shortage at the rest

358
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,791
To deal with the rest of us deal with their b*******

359
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
They cited as proof that they

360
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Succeed

361
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
Yeah

362
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Yep

363
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Yeah

364
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,495
Yeah I don't have a rebuttal

365
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
Just so f******

366
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Infuriated

367
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,711
That makes a little more interesting Lee is it simultaneously over the weekend the FDA issued an emergency

368
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,015
Usafa relation for Hydrox

369
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,319
Cork went to be used for Coronavirus

370
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,487
A couple of very important things to point out about this are they in their declaration the FDA makes it clear that the main reason for this

371
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
Emergency authorization

372
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Is 1

373
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
There's no available alternative

374
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
Into the sent that the

375
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
Possible benefits outweigh the

376
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Expected risks

377
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
By which

378
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
You know our

379
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,543
They're trying to get rid of

380
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Hope Dan

381
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,639
That's what they're trying to

382
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
Yeah it's it

383
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,575
A very clear that this is not an approved drug out of the science does not reach the non-emergency standard

384
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
For approval but

385
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,415
Where is an emergency situation today

386
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,487
Try it it probably won't kill as many people as it

387
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
Might help

388
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
?

389
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,095
That's

390
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,423
Glenda being really bad news but it also might not be

391
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
It's really hard to say

392
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
But it's important to remember that there's a big difference

393
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
This declaration

394
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,335
And the rest of the ship we've been seeing

395
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,991
A health official saying you know like this is improving but we're in an emergency and it might do more to help than hurt so doctors should use their tusks

396
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,551
Gretchen giving it to patients that do test positive

397
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,599
That's super different than Alex and Trump

398
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
Promoting it is accurate

399
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,975
99% effective in the studies they're suppressing it

400
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,303
Cfda going Trump won't f****** shut up so far

401
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Fine

402
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Will do that

403
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
Yeah

404
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:56,031
Well but I don't think it's entirely that if you read the Declaration there is like

405
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
If you did if you look at the science

406
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Under

407
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
Appropriate care

408
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
Odds of you dying

409
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
Are probably

410
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
Low

411
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,087
From the from the hydroxychloroquine appropriately with the assist

412
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
The doctor

413
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
There is

414
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:15,999
Not as unsafe as just everyone taking it or people doing it on their own

415
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,791
So trying to

416
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
Prove it

417
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
In that context

418
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,655
Makes more sense than running the risk

419
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,727
Of people trying to self Medicaid

420
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,055
So I think that their production Factor there

421
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,431
To the point that you're making it still is all all roads lead back to

422
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,711
Trumpets

423
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
Fit like a

424
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,319
Hyper-inflated expectations that are being created by Trump and his allies

425
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,159
That is still the root of where all of the impetus to trying

426
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
Self-medicate with it

427
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
Coming from but

428
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
It's like

429
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,815
It's like we're all sharing a car with

430
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,887
Toddlers And every now and again the toddlers get to

431
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
To drive and we just

432
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,775
Like I don't know where this is going to go there's a toddler driving it

433
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Good luck

434
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,151
Well if you're a toddler and do you hate the United Nation

435
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,063
You might say things like Alex says I'm his next clip about the 1992 Agenda 21

436
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
Oh here we go

437
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
And I'll say I need citation

438
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,952
On pretty much all of this

439
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,280
Ewan said back in 1992

440
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
Rio de Janeiro

441
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,496
You're going to bring in total

442
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:41,760
Single parents

443
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,160
I want

444
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
What I want

445
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
Public

446
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
On the UN website

447
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,656
IGoodbye now do you want to bite

448
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:05,056
I couldn't find it I will play with creative post Human Society is on the UN website

449
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
Doubt was the human psyche

450
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,640
Sacrifice part

451
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,200
I don't even care anymore they didn't say that

452
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
So Alex gets to playing a clip of trump talking about Trump Stone did take a pretty big chain

453
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,672
Over the last like couple days where he's like

454
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
Baby Alive

455
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,352
Right right are the areas we get 100,000 deaths that'll be a victory that kind of tone

456
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,680
Yeah let me recontextualizing from this is an entire hoax to

457
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,008
Don't you realize that I mean not doing anything up

458
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,544
Up until now and then doing so

459
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,640
Something means that I have saved probably millions of lives and I'm the hero

460
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,944
Outbreak that I definitely did not call a hoax a month

461
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
So in terms of

462
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,784
Alex talking about

463
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,600
That in leading leading into the club

464
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
He

465
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,744
He kind of ends up admitting that Mike Adams

466
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
Predictions

467
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,328
Work 8090 thousand

468
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,376
This is this is ridiculous

469
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
Let's hear from the president

470
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
Are for hard days ahead

471
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,824
As many as 250,000 dead by

472
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Middle of July

473
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,944
Mike Adams projector

474
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
About

475
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
Lockdown

476
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,608
So do he didn't he said to point something Million by July and is model that Alex was misusing the bottle was

477
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
If nobody does anything

478
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:39,008
If nobody does anything to something million

479
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,056
Right

480
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Even so

481
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
This is this is Dante

482
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Incubus stories

483
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
This is this is

484
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:54,624
So Alex is apparently a big Dow Jones guy now

485
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,024
He doesn't sell gold anymore he's got to buy stocks in Raytheon or whatever it is he does not leave the market is

486
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
Is like really important

487
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,608
Now Andy's you wants to check in

488
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
Finds out

489
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Markets down

490
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
Uh-oh

491
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,760
That creates more inflation on the road but

492
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
Depression-era things happening so

493
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,648
Stimulus

494
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Why

495
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
Cost of Praise from

496
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
Last night

497
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:39,168
We said okay we got to close two more weeks they went

498
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
My account

499
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
This is this is

500
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
While these

501
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
Did the gymnastics

502
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:06,816
It's required in order to make his make even something close to send

503
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
II

504
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
There's a mean there's no point

505
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
Again in pointing out Hip Hop

506
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
It's over with

507
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
The fact that piece

508
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,824
People on the right are saying like

509
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
This to trillion-dollar stimulus might not be enough

510
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,688
Makes me want to throw rocks

511
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
Speaker

512
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,856
When we hit the f****** last one there like all 101.5 trillion-dollar stimulus

513
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:35,232
We don't have the money to will never find it this is a bailout we need to it's definitely because of the balance.

514
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:41,376
That's why we're so mad

515
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,912
Package obviously 2-point trillion

516
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,728
Particularly with Alex

517
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,848
Berkeley surrounding the bailout was so

518
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:57,248
A lot of his coverage that like

519
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,064
Immediately and their money should go towards the civil

520
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,672
Like I realized that we can't do anything criminal

521
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,464
All of their assets

522
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,280
It's kind of a crime use civil asset for

523
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
I don't care

524
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,400
So Alex is really in a strange

525
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,936
Place that the beginning

526
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
In the first hour of the show

527
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,264
He's talking a bit about

528
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,384
Still the downplaying but also a trump saying

529
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
Like 100,000

530
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,064
A couple years ago there's still that sort of thing but he's also getting

531
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
I'm pretty deep into

532
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
Conspiracy s*** and like

533
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:41,792
It's a lot of stuff that we've gone over in the past like a lot of it is stuff that you'd find in our endgame coverage

534
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,352
Like he's just recycling a lot of weird

535
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
Old

536
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,680
Serta political conspiracy

537
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,496
It gets into talking about like the CIA man

538
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
I have a like

539
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Really

540
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
Screwed over Shanghai shek

541
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,152
The Nationalist mean okay

542
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:03,040
And it takes a really interesting road cuz he's trying to relate that

543
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,600
To the present day with China being the

544
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
Tools of the global

545
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
Does it work

546
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,744
Shadow organization

547
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
The CIA

548
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
Around two years of the time

549
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,704
Track down and murdered hundreds of army officers

550
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,776
Fighting with shang-chi Shack in China

551
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848
And the CIA sabotage d

552
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
Thousands of rifles and weapons

553
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,784
By removing the explosive grenades

554
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,600
Watch from

555
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
Long Beach

556
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
I was always read this

557
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,728
John Birch Society Congressional hearings when I was

558
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,824
Clamored

559
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
22 years ago

560
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,432
Watching History Channel

561
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,832
Yeah a lot of us thought I was going to really help shining so

562
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,392
The Rockefeller Foundation

563
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,440
Mechanic like a money on there

564
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Yes

565
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
Congress you know

566
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
Was great

567
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,728
It's a week

568
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,616
I'm sitting here on History Channel

569
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,408
Show Mouse a tongue

570
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:46,208
Alex goes down the road on this episode of rewriting history of the Chinese Civil War

571
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,256
World's I really need him to do better than

572
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:54,400
I can find no citations with the globalist sabotage weapons being sent to Shanghai Shaq nor any evidence

573
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,216
The CIA was hunting down prosec soldiers

574
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,544
That's how you know they did it cuz there's no evidence of the CIA

575
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
I can find plenty of evidence of the US assess

576
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,200
The Chiang Kai-shek was doomed to lose that war because he was very terribly

577
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
TJ

578
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,040
I need to terminate a full-on US

579
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:15,136
Involvement would lead to a gigantic War likely involving a bunch of other countries

580
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
You just couldn't be justified

581
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
That's that's not hard

582
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
Conclusion

583
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:24,608
I was going through the cia's for you Archive of documents about my land Shanghai Shack and none of the stuff Alex

584
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
Thanks squares

585
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
Any of the doctor

586
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Confine

587
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,568
However I did find an August 4th 1958 letter that Allen Dulles sent Shane kai-shek's wife thanking her for sending

588
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
A box of tea

589
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,896
It seems like they were on friendly relations

590
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:42,016
In 1958 was running the CIA that was drying

591
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
2

592
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,904
Kill people working with him and put now into power but whatever the jobs the job

593
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
Man it's not personal.

594
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,512
Cafe B Civil Wars

595
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
You would somebody but when it comes down to it

596
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,352
Depressed

597
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:03,008
I even thought of May 24th 1962 memo the details quote a result of a check with the old

598
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
China Han

599
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,824
Ants in the agency and the Department of State

600
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
They found that quote

601
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,712
The US has always held that the GRC the government

602
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
The Nationalist

603
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,040
Represents the legitimate government of China

604
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,368
However it also does saving in 1949 to 1950

605
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,672
Quote we did inform Chiang Kai-shek

606
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,464
Did the US did not intend to become

607
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,512
I'm further involved in the Chinese Civil War

608
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,168
Alex is making claims that I need to see more proof of any basti has is claiming it's in the books it's been Declassified and that's not good

609
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
I've heard him say 100 times

610
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,008
Is that kind of thing is just making those

611
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
Things up

612
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:41,152
I do believe that he read the stuff and John Birch Society text

613
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
No

614
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
What gives me no faith

615
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
And this whole thing

616
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,296
Is it foggy memory of some CIA section

617
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:53,440
Chief on an unnamed show on either the Discovery Channel or History Channel that Alex up 22 years ago

618
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,720
Hey you

619
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
Remember something whenever it's

620
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:00,352
True Dan that's how it works I have no idea if this alleged documentary exist

621
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
If it says

622
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
Thanks it does or anything

623
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,752
This is as good as providing no evidence quite frankly

624
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:12,128
All the information I can find about the CIA in the period around this time has to do with them doing covert actions

625
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,920
The train destabilize Mouse cover

626
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,480
I really need Alex to cite some sources

627
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,856
A couple things that are concerning about his memory is that there's no such thing as a CIA section

628
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
What's not real title

629
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:33,632
Is that Justin FB I think know the title whatever title is station cheese

630
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Know that

631
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
There's only one

632
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,472
CIA station chief

633
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:42,080
In China at that time

634
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
Now it should be really fun

635
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:48,736
Renton know that person's name and information about their careers some corroborating evidence anything

636
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
But he doesn't

637
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,088
All Alex has is probably completely false memory about something

638
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,672
He claims he saw on the Discovery Channel or History Channel two decades ago

639
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
This is what literally

640
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,768
Indistinguishable from not trying

641
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,608
He might as well just say that he saw this like history in a dream

642
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:10,752
And that would be hold as much weight as the document that he's making here

643
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Michelle

644
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,080
The section nine agency

645
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,176
There are sections in the Japanese law enforcement section 19

646
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,224
Chief aramaki done

647
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
Stop it that's where you got the idea

648
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
It's a great at the great movie

649
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
Scrape series

650
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
I'm sure

651
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:32,768
Okay

652
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,120
Until here's what I think is going on with this kind of narrative

653
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,448
Check was going to lose that war against Mal

654
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,752
And the US knew that there were only two options

655
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
In front of them

656
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:48,384
One was letting the war play out and probably allow the communist government to take power in

657
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,712
The other was becoming directly involved in the conflict

658
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:56,576
Risking a wider war in a best-case scenario installing Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist

659
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
The power

660
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
By virtue of our military support

661
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,232
Alex wants the u.s. of the past to do the ladder

662
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
But he's also invested in the hole

663
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,096
A whole lot of his career and beatley anti intervention guy

664
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
What are the only position

665
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,424
Never held that made people think

666
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,984
He's not a total lunatic as a strong aversion to

667
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
The Iraq War

668
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,544
In all these wars of regime

669
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:22,176
I suspect that he knows that it would be impossible for him to argue against regime change Wars

670
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:26,784
They claim that the US should have gotten directly involved in a country's Civil War in order to pick a winner

671
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
In order to avoid that cognitive dissonance

672
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,880
Netzkino is Extreme right-wing age

673
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,720
Communist types of created an entirely new story of what happened in that war

674
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,280
Look like they wish they were

675
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,608
Yeah what would have happened is exactly what they pretend to be against in the present

676
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,936
Instead of them retroactively calling for a war of regime change

677
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:49,568
They're really just against the secret regime-change that actually was going on where the globalist or sporting now

678
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,664
That seems like what it's going on but honestly I have no idea

679
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,480
This could all just be something Alex's dad told him when he was a

680
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
I don't really

681
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
It's

682
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
You really that right wing

683
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
Play book of

684
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,136
What I want to have I have no

685
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
Historical

686
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,184
Consistency whatsoever

687
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,000
So I am 100% against vaccines

688
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,536
And then you're like what what about

689
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
The polio vaccine

690
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Welbeck

691
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,632
Then polio vaccines were great

692
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:19,776
They solved everything I have to stop you later in this episode

693
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
He might not

694
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,360
A certain Health Ranger

695
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:29,760
Alright well then I guess I'll have to give it up to him like the Somali pirates for some sort of consist

696
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:35,904
Even your parody examples unfortunately

697
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,024
Unfortunately

698
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,168
You know he saw this stuff in the John Birch Society and I do believe

699
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
Sharks a little bit

700
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
About that

701
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:54,592
What is the John Birch Society

702
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,896
It wasn't Lobster

703
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,456
The Tricom captioning

704
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
Death

705
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,808
Secrets

706
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,856
So to be fair

707
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:10,976
Alex's dad was in the John Birch Society we don't know that 100%

708
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,768
That there were birchers around

709
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,352
Right and it seems very likely that his dad was a virtue

710
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:21,472
It seems it seems incredibly likely we don't have confirmation that it could have been that he had like

711
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
Uncle's or his grandfather or

712
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:28,640
Friends of his dad to basically uncles

713
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,688
He have a lot of influence

714
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,480
And his dad seems to have a lot of

715
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,552
Similar ideas as the transverse

716
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,856
I'm just saying that if you

717
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,672
Give your son John Bircher reading

718
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,328
Yeah regardless of whether or not you

719
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,656
Something like that when you're without the proper

720
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Maturity

721
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
It's so funny to hear Alex's

722
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,056
Is clip there though he's talking about these birchers always being right

723
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,944
Just a few years ago I was just trying to pretend that he wasn't into the jumper Society

724
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,760
You know the saying that he was into their s*** would prove that he was

725
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,320
Completely insane right-wing agent, is lunatic

726
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
Which would have hurt the crossover appeal that he was trying to cultivate and all those years and he's pretending he was above the left-right paradigm

727
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
I'm worried about that

728
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,072
All that time he was lying

729
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,608
He was a Bircher the whole time

730
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:25,216
I'm trying to push extreme right-wing s*** under the banner of pretending to be above this

731
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:30,592
The right-left it's just a lie man it's about freedom

732
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
In that sense

733
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,200
A lot of people really owe their careers to Alex Jones

734
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,760
Pave the way of that b*******

735
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,088
Horse and right-wing stuff

736
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,952
However it's hilarious to hear Alex say that everything the John Birch Society has put out

737
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
Is true

738
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:51,584
I've read a lot of the JBS materials and spice it's safe that almost none of it is true

739
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:55,424
I guess what I don't even have to get into any of their Publications to demonstrate

740
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,776
The John Birch Society was named they named themselves after John Birch

741
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,104
Who they claimed was the first US casualty of the Cold War

742
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,176
How to sing that he was tortured and he didn't give up and seek

743
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
And that part

744
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,248
Definitely isn't true

745
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
He was shot by a

746
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,576
Polar me

747
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,856
Chapcare contingent

748
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:18,208
On August 25th 1945 after refusing to disarm

749
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,000
He wasn't captured wasn't tortured

750
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,560
Ain't giving up his seat

751
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,352
Play the funniest part about that

752
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,888
Zimsec John burchett

753
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
What it's like

754
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,472
You didn't even get the truth of your own f****** name right

755
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,264
Nothing is true

756
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,336
Jumpers was definitely working in intelligence

757
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,128
China 1945

758
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:42,528
Which doesn't that make kind of mess up Alex's narrative at us intelligence working to install mount

759
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,856
The guy the John Birch Society was named after was plotting to

760
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,904
To portray shang-chi Shack hold on once

761
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,744
I encourage you not to think about it because Alex certainly has not you just hurt my brain

762
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:58,656
Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle serve with Birch in China and I should tell you he's an actual lieutenant-colonel unlike the ones out

763
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:04,032
It is 2009 Memoir entitled I could never be so lucky again

764
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,616
He has this to say about John Birch who he knew personally

765
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:14,528
He had no way of knowing that the John Birch Society a highly vocal post-war anti-communist organization

766
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
Would be named after him because of

767
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
Its founders believed

768
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
To be the first casualty

769
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
Of world World War 3

770
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
I feel sure he would not have approved

771
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
John Birch is a

772
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,072
Ping to the John Birch Society not a purse

773
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,192
He's taken out of their patron saint while you had no say in the matter and according to someone who knew him

774
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
Probably would not be into it

775
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,032
And then what Alex is doing is even worse

776
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:40,640
You created a fictional fictional story about torture to apply to birth to make a narrative better

777
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
These people are cool

778
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
They are awful

779
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,992
The LIE is

780
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,832
Bacon

781
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,160
You don't even need to get into any of their their publication

782
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
The Blue Book

783
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
Are any of that s*** so

784
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,280
No absolutely I'm starting a group called The Mary Poppins

785
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
In society because

786
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
Mary Poppins

787
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
The first woman to murder

788
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
6000 people in World War II

789
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:09,312
I knew her and I don't think she'd approve

790
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
Murder

791
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
She's the basis for the penguin

792
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
Okay

793
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,016
CIA put now into power and also John Birch

794
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Buzz

795
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,576
The hero

796
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,136
Silence is talking a bit about the CIA ship

797
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,440
And he seems to

798
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
Think that

799
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,512
The problem in the world and all

800
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,584
The Troubles of the Trump Administration

801
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,864
Are basically about

802
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
Trying to

803
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,168
To get his people

804
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,216
Into the leadership

805
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
Boy

806
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,776
Creating chaos

807
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
And this is

808
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,080
Stupid

809
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,360
CIA

810
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,664
He's just the biggest intelligence agency

811
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,896
You can see here again then Alex doesn't

812
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
Not like

813
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,432
The Deep state

814
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
You just wanted to be his

815
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,504
Saturday

816
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,808
Gina's time and time again minions uptalk

817
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,648
Too Loosely ends up revealing that the New World Order is probably good as long as Trump

818
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,952
He wants a One World Government like

819
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
We should all

820
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
Buy Greenland and all that s***

821
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
Just as long as

822
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,840
Victor one world government is in place

823
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
Is

824
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
Why bother you asked

825
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,520
And Trump is a jar until Pro as long as they're targeting right-wing Act

826
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,920
What if they're killing not a problem

827
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
Yelling about

828
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,296
The institutional rot of intelligence agencies being in control of the government means nothing

829
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,368
Because he wants the intelligence agencies to control the government

830
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,672
But only if his weirdos run the

831
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,440
Agency

832
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,744
This is exactly why political project

833
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,328
To the sort that Alex and his ilk engaging will never lead to real change

834
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
They scream about

835
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
Structural change but all they want

836
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:13,216
Is the kind of puts them in charge of the structure

837
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,776
The Superficial change online

838
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,080
Absolutely that way they can destroy the straw

839
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,384
Pictures and live I assume they become Duke

840
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,944
Call Larry

841
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,248
Also since Trump has been in office there been

842
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
Free heads up

843
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,040
The CIA appointed

844
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,088
Menlo Park was the actor

845
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:35,488
Sing head for 3 days at the beginning of the term Gina haspel has been in since May 2018

846
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,304
Previous the hospital who Trump appointed Trump

847
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,072
Appointed Mike

848
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
Pompeo is a headed

849
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,144
CIA for a good fifteen months

850
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
For making him that the Secretary of State

851
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
Will you have so much good practice

852
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,776
Practice is the head of CIA

853
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,568
Clearly ready for the promotion

854
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:55,967
The point is the Trump has clearly been able to put people in charge

855
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:02,623
Okay what about that Director of National Intelligence he's been killed for 30 years

856
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,439
Dempsey who's the acting head after Trump got rid of Clapper

857
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,743
And then Trump appointed Dan coats

858
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,047
Who was in the position for about two-and-a-half years

859
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
And then we got to act

860
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,423
There was Joseph Maguire who Trump appointed when Dan coats left

861
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,983
He was appointed because Trump didn't want the

862
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,799
The deputy director to take over probably cuz you didn't trust her

863
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:25,151
And then about five months later Trump fired Maguire because one of his subordinates

864
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
It's brief the house

865
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
Intel committee

866
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,551
About Russia's preference for Trump to win in 2020 which anger drop because drop is a baby

867
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
Pretty sure Trump said

868
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,855
You had me at good

869
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:39,743
Goodbye Trump replaced him with the former ambassador to Germany Richard grenell

870
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,791
It is time is Ambassador used

871
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:47,167
Describe a ABC News as quoted viewed as one of President Donald Trump's closest envoys in Europe

872
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,775
Which explains why he was involved in the negotiations to arrest Julian Assange

873
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,079
Alex should not be thrilled with but whatever

874
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:59,199
Grinnell was literally the person who made a verbal pledge that if Assange was handed over

875
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
He wouldn't get the death

876
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:06,367
And this is one closer Trump's closest allies we appointed Director of National Intelligence

877
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
What cost

878
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,791
That's all I got dropped has been dominating and appointing people to leadership position

879
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
Intelligence

880
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
Community

881
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,607
Any president would

882
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:20,447
Yeah but to be appointing bad people but that tends to create chaos

883
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,007
On that picture that Alex wants to pay here

884
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,591
Play bulshit the tries to rewrite why the chaos is happening

885
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
It's not sad

886
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663
AutoZone

887
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
How do I get

888
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,503
There's no intelligence head that isn't a

889
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,527
Bad person

890
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,343
Like everybody else

891
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,367
Bad person like

892
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
It's just how it is

893
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,207
That's a fair conversation but also

894
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,487
There are grades

895
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,791
I100 centigrade

896
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
I'm just not going to argue

897
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
Sherlock

898
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,191
Someone like Alex should recognize like

899
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:58,591
I got really drunk at my CPAC speech and try to lead the people at a pitchfork rally

900
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:04,991
Julian Assange no problem every guy who literally negotiated the arrest of Julie massage Trump rewarded with making

901
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,063
Okay

902
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
Now you're

903
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
Saying one thing

904
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,903
But let me counter with this

905
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
No and a different thing

906
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,743
But my point is that Alex doesn't know anything

907
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:20,351
Also the Office of Naval intelligence still exists and there's been to riches

908
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,911
Appointed the time since Trump has been in office

909
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,727
These aren't actually positions that the President appoints

910
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:30,847
But they are nominated by the defense secretary who is appointed by the president

911
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,175
Also Army intelligence still exist

912
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,711
It's a much wider entity

913
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,991
But generally speaking

914
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,527
Be US Army deputy chief

915
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
Chief of Staff G2

916
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,855
Is considered the head of Army intelligence

917
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
Oxymoron

918
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:51,583
F****** bad joke in that position and he's been

919
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,399
Been there since January 2018 within the time

920
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
Trump has been in office

921
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,007
These things like Naval intelligence in Army intelligence still exist

922
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
His head no problem appoint

923
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,847
People into positions

924
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
If you wanted to what are we doing

925
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,431
Love is made of b******* Alex

926
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,503
Who started the Trump is doing a terrible job and he needs a justification

927
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,831
It can't just be the Trump is profoundly stupid and abolition

928
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
This person who's not equipped being office

929
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,927
It has to be the everyone else is working again

930
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,231
In fact the only good

931
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,327
Again Tamara things I said in Wednesday's Bill Cooper episode

932
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,351
This is childish

933
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
Very

934
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
F****** childish

935
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,447
It's it's just

936
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,983
It's amazing

937
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,263
It really is amazing

938
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
How

939
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,823
How f*****-up the human brain

940
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
Can be how many

941
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
Twisted

942
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
Can take to get

943
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,407
Had to wear it once

944
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
To go speak

945
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,503
If you are if you're even an uninformed

946
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,527
Person

947
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,575
Can't look at what Trump has done and go

948
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
That's a good humor

949
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
It's just not possible

950
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
And I'm not even talking this present I'm talking to

951
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:54,047
Human it just a human being if you know Trump store you're like oh that's

952
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,655
Retired after the like apprenticeship

953
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:06,079
Is your fire sucks in Home Alone 2 what else do you want he wasn't even Richie Rich

954
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
Which I hate

955
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,871
You never really a chain

956
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,151
Cancel

957
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:16,063
You suck at WrestleMania Hitler

958
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
It's a really good a meaty roll

959
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159
In Home Alone 2 we wouldn't be

960
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,951
You really sucked

961
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,743
App

962
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,559
Stone cold stunner and he took

963
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,863
Very far

964
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,399
The Rock

965
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,935
Greater taking a stoner

966
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,519
I really don't like you reminding me that the president is in the world

967
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,591
Play Hall of Fame really don't like you're reminding me of that

968
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:43,711
When Vince McMahon and his family went to the White House

969
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,527
So what there was a beam that was like

970
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,367
Stone cold has stunned 60% of the people in this photo

971
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
God

972
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:59,327
So f***** up giving a stutter to Vince McMahon

973
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,655
It's not the children

974
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,543
That's a grim f****** hot alligator in f****** reality

975
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
Nation that we should stop wearing

976
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,455
Alex believes that the issue is

977
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:20,575
What Trump needs to do is he needs to come out very strongly endorse that everybody take

978
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,111
Hydroxychloroquine

979
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,391
Anthramycin

980
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
A z-pack

981
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
And everything will be cool

982
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,719
Counter that's a bad idea

983
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Well

984
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
Or not

985
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
Mexico everywhere

986
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:50,783
I want to sing through these studies out of Europe China and Mexico claiming super high recovery rates

987
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,575
It's from hydroxychloroquine being used

988
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,599
Tree Coronavirus

989
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
And he needs to be more careful

990
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,719
The study from Europe he's talking about was that French study

991
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,047
And this study should absolutely not be seen as conclusive.

992
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:07,167
For one and only included 42 patients in the trials and 6 of them did not complete

993
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,471
Study with one dying in the middle of treatment

994
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,567
Of the 42 patients 26 were given hydroxychloroquine

995
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,175
Six were given hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and 10 where the control group

996
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:23,295
All six of the patients who could not complete the trials were in the group that were given hydroxychloroquine

997
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,111
But only one was thought to have been unable to

998
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
Completed because of

999
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
The drug

1000
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,463
So maybe some of that is just circumstantial

1001
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,255
Because the samples so small

1002
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,791
And the controls are good

1003
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,071
Yeah you don't know

1004
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,351
It doesn't mean

1005
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,423
The six patients who were given the combined drugs

1006
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,471
Girl said to have recovered in 5 days

1007
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,287
Sunny study super dicey

1008
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,591
412 small number of participants

1009
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,151
Does not great and the fact they don't address that

1010
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,199
6 patients

1011
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,735
Complete the trial is unnerving

1012
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,759
They just don't address

1013
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,343
Well they don't give specifics into like what was going on

1014
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,903
It's not really factored in

1015
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,951
Well to the explanation of

1016
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,511
Wow this it should screw up their number

1017
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,095
Yeah the fact that they only provided data on the patient

1018
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,655
For seven days when the trial was supposed to have been 40

1019
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
Teen is also a huge problem

1020
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,751
Four people have looked into it

1021
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:20,383
There were a lot of problems with this study and it became even more troubling when the peer-review status was examined

1022
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:25,503
It was accepted by the Journal the register the day after the study was supposed to have ended

1023
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,783
Which is very suspicious

1024
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,575
As it turns out

1025
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:34,975
1800 authors of the study is the editor-in-chief of that damn what happened is with Rush

1026
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,279
Through the process and published as peer-reviewed

1027
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,815
Possibly prematurely

1028
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
This study may be

1029
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:44,447
Repeat with more rigorous standards and a larger randomized set of participants

1030
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:48,287
But from everything I can tell you should not take this Pacific finding too seriously

1031
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,335
Are way too many unanswered question

1032
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,639
Since about the study for it to be like okay

1033
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
So info

1034
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,199
Creating why would you do that

1035
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
Why would you release

1036
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
To study with only

1037
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
40

1038
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,295
Samad page

1039
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,087
I think it's worthless

1040
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,367
Of

1041
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
Like

1042
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:07,487
Actual people in the medical field it is worth wild data

1043
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,511
I get that

1044
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
I get there

1045
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,327
And I don't know enough about

1046
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,351
The person who did the

1047
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,935
This study tried to say that they were using it

1048
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Like wrong

1049
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,543
Maybe their intention was just to give this information

1050
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:26,431
Possibly hastily gathered together as it was

1051
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
Create the experiments

1052
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Possibly

1053
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:33,855
It does serve that function as one of the downsides of the interconnectedness of the internet and the

1054
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
Free

1055
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:39,743
Quick flow of information is a lot of stuff that's not meant for your eyes and

1056
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:45,887
Can only be a problem for you to see what other people make you

1057
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:46,911
It's just that the

1058
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,935
The editor-in-chief

1059
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
Also

1060
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,727
Alps right

1061
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,775
The study it ended a week early

1062
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:56,639
The day after might not have anybody thoroughly positive it's provided on threat

1063
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,175
The write-up

1064
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,479
And then it was rushed

1065
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,271
Through it just seems like that's

1066
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,551
Two glaring

1067
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,831
Anything to allowed

1068
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
To happen

1069
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,135
With that like I don't need the

1070
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,927
Contact you are the results of the study

1071
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,975
I just need to know that I'm like

1072
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
I can't trust you

1073
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,023
Well you know

1074
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,815
Yeah

1075
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,655
The way that I think is most appropriate to look at it is there's a lot of questions

1076
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,239
It's not necessarily evidence of malfeasance

1077
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:26,847
From the things that I've been able to tell questions that need to be addressed

1078
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,663
Before you know you want to really

1079
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,687
Look at the

1080
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,807
Gospel is really troubling

1081
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:42,207
For sure and I'm not arguing it like again maybe the results of the study are right on and maybe everything was followed to a tee

1082
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,743
There's too many different

1083
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,279
Turn things around there that's a

1084
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
I can't

1085
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,095
And so it's not

1086
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,911
That I'm going to dismiss the findings out of hand

1087
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,447
Buy but it's like

1088
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,727
I'm not even going to

1089
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
Pretendo

1090
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,287
Matter until I have something

1091
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,591
Weather interesting and you should

1092
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,663
They are data points that are worthwhile

1093
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,967
But I think when we get to the end of this

1094
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
Little chunk

1095
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
That I have to present for you

1096
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,367
You understand a little bit why some of this information might come out

1097
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,903
In the way that it does

1098
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,975
So answer the study from China at the worst exam

1099
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:21,887
This is the study was published by the Journal of Beijing University in China and the conclusion it reached was that hydroxychloroquine

1100
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,423
Was as effective as note

1101
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,031
Who was a really small study of only 30 patients

1102
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,847
15 were given the drug and after a week 13

1103
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,871
Team tested negative

1104
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,175
Of the 15 who work given the drug

1105
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,223
14 tested negative after a week

1106
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,527
The conclusion in the paper was Deez Nuts

1107
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,807
Statistically significant

1108
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,599
And further studies were required to

1109
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,903
Determine if there was any real benefit then

1110
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
Another

1111
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,975
Not yet. You'd study

1112
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
Out of China of

1113
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,047
62 patients did fine Daddy

1114
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,583
Time of recovery

1115
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
In patients treated with

1116
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,655
But this is unreviewed

1117
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:58,751
And it should not be taken as definitive as of yet

1118
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,079
So I can find no study

1119
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
Aeromexico

1120
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,407
As I was explaining that hydroxychloroquine

1121
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,687
Nqr Coronavirus

1122
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,247
However if you just Google those words

1123
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:15,391
You'll find a posting on clinicaltrials.gov which is recruiting patients for a double-blind study being put on

1124
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,463
By the National Institute of respiratory diseases in Mexico

1125
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,791
According to the posting the study is supposed to begin on March

1126
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,327
23rd 2020

1127
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
But would not

1128
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,887
Complete until March 21st

1129
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,447
I'm sorry March 22nd 2021

1130
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,519
The results of these trials will likely be far more Illuminating

1131
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,615
Even the small-scale studies we have access to at this point but the results are always off in the future

1132
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,431
There's no way Alex can know the results of the study

1133
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:43,039
If you was just reading headlines you might see something about a study about hydroxychloroquine

1134
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,599
Mexico and just make up the rest

1135
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,623
Is it in there yeah

1136
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,183
Now but this Mexico study is actually kind of

1137
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,231
Like the demonstrative of what I was saying

1138
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
It's like

1139
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,095
To do a real trial like this would take

1140
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,119
That long

1141
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,911
So the data would never really

1142
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,191
You never have

1143
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,983
The preliminary data

1144
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,007
People are

1145
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,287
Maybe needing

1146
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,591
In order to like for mother trials

1147
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,127
To do if you did it

1148
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,919
This rigorous standards

1149
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,479
With a large group of participants in

1150
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,807
And randomization double-blind all the all the standards

1151
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,111
The only started coming out of Mexico right now

1152
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
How long it take

1153
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
Coronavirus

1154
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
That guy's

1155
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
Nothing interesting

1156
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:28,351
Study are you conducting that well we're all just were all conducting

1157
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,887
It's like he's just not

1158
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,167
He's not doing good

1159
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
Like

1160
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:36,287
Emma was still traveling around flying commercially

1161
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,871
As much as possible denying that the situation is happening

1162
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:44,991
Shaking hands doing the whole thing like it's amazing Arthur Boris about the handshake

1163
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
Insane

1164
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:53,695
These 3 countries are against Europe's not a country but the three places that he said their studies from

1165
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
These are the specifics things

1166
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,255
Nvidia stock

1167
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,791
What is a French study that

1168
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:01,119
It's dubious but possible there needs to be more work done on that

1169
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,143
Before you can throw any kind

1170
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
Conclusion

1171
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,471
Chinese study the first one

1172
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,495
Said

1173
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,775
It is good as nothing

1174
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:13,919
I meant the other one that more recently came out from China is not pure reviewed and is unclear

1175
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:18,271
And at this point

1176
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,807
We have no results from

1177
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,831
Alex doesn't

1178
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:21,599
Have anything

1179
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,879
Things back any of this up

1180
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,231
Anyway but Trump needs to say I won't take this

1181
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,279
Course absolutely

1182
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,607
So Alex has Mike Adams on because his projections have always been Acura

1183
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,375
Okay

1184
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:38,495
80000

1185
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,543
Regional protection with everyone

1186
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:44,383
102

1187
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,711
The latest and why they're starting to up and numbers after lowering them before

1188
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:52,063
They're following the mathematics of where this goes

1189
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,855
This is deeply gaslighting

1190
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,879
This is a

1191
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
Like Mike should have been

1192
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,439
Like you know what no

1193
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,463
I was off

1194
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:04,095
Early I said I said most of the human race would not survive

1195
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:08,191
Just being just walking back a little bit you don't have to walk it back at unjust be like

1196
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,751
I was a little bit out of line at first

1197
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,055
I was panicking like everybody else

1198
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:17,151
And so I went back and I checked the numbers and I think it's more in line with what the

1199
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,455
Okay.

1200
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,039
I'm more than willing to admit that I didn't

1201
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:28,415
Does the situation nearly as seriously in liquid say January as

1202
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:32,767
I am now and that's because I had blind faith in the system

1203
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:38,143
Matter how often we are disabused enough

1204
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:41,471
Someday there will be adults in the room

1205
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:45,055
Are not misguided belief

1206
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,895
This this could be pretty bad but I have faith in the public health officials and everyone

1207
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,711
Will make the right decisions and

1208
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,759
So that's fine

1209
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,063
You can bet that some of your assumptions

1210
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:01,695
Were turned out to not be accurate and that's okay then like refuses to do that

1211
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,487
It's a good thing that leads to growth

1212
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,791
Perhaps

1213
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:10,911
So Mike's projection is now 45 to 90,000

1214
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
Sure

1215
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,239
My projections are currently between

1216
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,287
5 and 90000 deaths

1217
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,567
The end of July

1218
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:21,919
The White House is currently estimating 100,000 to 240,000 but look

1219
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,967
Solution is

1220
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,527
What solution I am convinced now

1221
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,063
Is more masks

1222
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,391
More zinc for everybody vitamin D3

1223
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
More testing

1224
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,439
Those

1225
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:37,535
Four elements in place I mean Nationwide emergency production of zinc

1226
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,351
Give it out for free to everybody flood the country

1227
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
Recommendations

1228
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:44,959
America

1229
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
Back to work

1230
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,495
By the end of

1231
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,311
It's going to go f*** around and give people heavy metal poison

1232
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,175
I would prefer it if you stuck with it

1233
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
The end of humanity

1234
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:59,295
Because now that he's going on this trip I'm more afraid that it's the end of humanity

1235
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:03,391
Like when he's like I think it'll be between 45 and 90000

1236
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,695
If we get all these testing in all these masks

1237
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:12,095
The thing that I said 2 weeks ago we don't need to do and then that we're all going to die but now we're going to be fine and all that

1238
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,375
Legit now I'm worried

1239
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:17,471
That's an interesting reaction that you're having to the health Ranger

1240
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:21,055
I also want to put him in the stocks and have people throw tomatoes at him

1241
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,871
Forever that's not an interesting reaction is very normal

1242
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,943
Queensryche so you got to get all the zinc

1243
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,759
Sing to me about this is that Mike is

1244
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,831
Presenting this is a very just like

1245
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
This is

1246
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,367
My

1247
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,391
Research

1248
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
Scholarly opinion

1249
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:40,767
As if Alex hadn't been doing recently a bad pitch

1250
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,303
Constantly about zinc

1251
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,583
In the real red pill

1252
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,399
What are the products didn't even know if it's in quiz in Port

1253
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,423
Dammit

1254
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:51,007
How did they how did they come to that conclusion independently of each

1255
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,287
It's just

1256
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:55,103
So constantly like

1257
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
Just

1258
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,687
Zinc zinc zinc is the answer

1259
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,271
They're not talking about it being in Alex's prod

1260
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,063
And I think that's intense

1261
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:09,183
Oh you think so are they sick of getting letters from attorneys

1262
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,231
The real issue is the doctor

1263
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:17,119
You know those doctors that are doctors who have degrees totally real doctors who are also Lieutenant Colonels in the military

1264
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
Doctor doctor doctor

1265
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,191
Meet at hospital

1266
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,495
Problem with their education Jordan

1267
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,543
They don't know

1268
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,151
Teachers you know medical doctors

1269
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:35,807
More than a few weeks on nutrition not talk about nutrition as I'm getting different numbers.

1270
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,327
Are you doing

1271
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,191
And and eating healthy foods

1272
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,519
Really I mean

1273
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,335
0

1274
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:02,175
There's a chronic Zone population

1275
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,967
Covid-19 disease

1276
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,015
Is really a chronic zinc.

1277
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,807
Deficiency disease that is

1278
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
Virus which

1279
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,135
Otherwise would not be very harmful to people

1280
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:16,511
Big swing wow that is a big swing

1281
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,655
Looking think isn't it everything but there's a lot of f****** foods that have zinc in it

1282
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,423
This is this

1283
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,471
Like I can't stress this enough

1284
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,007
What's interesting there is

1285
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,543
Mi Cocina

1286
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,591
What I do is I take this

1287
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,639
That's a testimonial

1288
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,407
Stats

1289
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
Fine

1290
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,455
Illegally

1291
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:41,855
This really feels like they're trying to sell zinc it really feels like hold on tight because they are

1292
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,647
It's insane

1293
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:47,487
Cold essential you don't have

1294
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:56,447
Some people don't get any robot him and see

1295
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,495
Galesburg.com

1296
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
As far as curvy goes

1297
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,871
Don't call it a comeback

1298
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:09,247
Scooby's not a comeback disease it's just a people who stuffy thing vitamin seed

1299
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,807
You can find headlines like one that I found for

1300
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,855
2018 quotes

1301
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,183
Read the article on 2.2

1302
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
There are people with malnutrition that may come down with scurvy but the numbers aren't nearly would Alex want you to think with a scurvy

1303
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
He's making a comeback

1304
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,471
A solution is always eat an orange

1305
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,287
Zinc deficiency can definitely be bad for

1306
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,591
People but also most people get enough zinc

1307
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,151
As long as their diets include red meat and poultry

1308
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,943
If you're a vegetarian

1309
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:44,319
Keys almonds and baked beans will give you plenty of zinc or you can take a multivitamin many of which

1310
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Zinc

1311
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,879
The more these dudes talk

1312
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,671
The more I think that this is

1313
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,975
Basically an unspoken sales pitch

1314
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,535
For the real red pill Alex's supplement the sink

1315
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,351
I think that Alex knows that if he makes it to overt

1316
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,143
He's going to get another letter

1317
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:04,031
So he's just hyper promoting zinc is the answer to the coronavirus and trusting that his listeners will put two and two together

1318
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,383
I did the sales pitch for the fact that real red pill has zinc in it in the past

1319
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,943
Yeah that was a different episode

1320
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,503
Attorney general to make an argument that I'm doing this

1321
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,575
They need use multiple episodes and I can argue that Accord

1322
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,879
Haha feels like that's the logic

1323
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:25,279
It's going really happened a few times and now I've changed up my primary sales method to strongly win

1324
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
Thinking at the

1325
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:30,399
The crowd also keep using testimonial

1326
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:33,727
Thanks Alex keeps saying like

1327
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,287
It good good for plants

1328
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,615
Intentional

1329
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:43,455
King shity honestly I wouldn't even be that suspicious about it

1330
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,247
Except for this thing that Mike's

1331
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,551
You have anything to sell

1332
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,415
Infowars has Incan in their slow for fucksake

1333
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,695
Minor ingredient in it

1334
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:56,255
Multi-vitamin mineral formula

1335
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:57,791
Really

1336
01:02:59,327 --> 01:02:59,839
Is

1337
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
Zinc is the

1338
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,143
The key

1339
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,167
Beginning America.

1340
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:03,935
Back to work

1341
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:06,495
What can save the economy

1342
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,079
A free Society

1343
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,151
Liberty

1344
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:16,479
We need to embrace nutrition which means we need knowledge

1345
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,039
End the big Pharma

1346
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:19,807
Stranglehold

1347
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,087
4r systems

1348
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,623
Big Pharma runs the media

1349
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,903
Big Pharma runs

1350
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,927
Washington d.c.

1351
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
Shurfine

1352
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,463
Homemakers

1353
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,535
Big Pharma runs the medical schools in a doctors and universities

1354
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,119
Bad as possible

1355
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,911
Imposition

1356
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
The drug companies and the vaccine companies

1357
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,263
In the end

1358
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:46,943
Fighting medical doctors

1359
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,015
Old Jeep drugs at work right

1360
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,831
Good news is they failed to suppress that treatment

1361
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:54,879
Okay

1362
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:58,463
Alright Health Ranger I don't even sell the product with zinc in it

1363
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,863
I've never even seen The Matrix so I wouldn't know that if there was a product with zinc in it they would be referencing the make

1364
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,471
Matrix and I definitely don't know if you Alex Jones the Infowars host

1365
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:14,847
I wish with also the red pill

1366
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,383
Did I even see my pillow

1367
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,175
It's a red pill you said red pill

1368
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
I wish

1369
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,479
Listen

1370
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,271
Come to the episodes like where Mike host

1371
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:28,671
I guarantee I could have found some audio of him selling the real redneck

1372
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:35,327
I believe it he doesn't sell isn't product but I don't believe that he's oblivious

1373
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,095
The fact that Alex

1374
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:39,423
Has been really trying to push the real red pill because of it having

1375
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:42,751
Aesthetic

1376
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
So

1377
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
They're really

1378
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,127
Ghetto the angle is very strongly in the pushing

1379
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,407
Hydroxychloroquine

1380
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,687
Which is an unproven

1381
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,503
Now it what makes

1382
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,783
This really difficult

1383
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,575
Has a pill to swallow

1384
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,111
Pun intended

1385
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:01,951
Is that Alex is also trying to pair this

1386
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,743
Narrative

1387
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,303
News about when they make a vaccine

1388
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,839
It will hurt you

1389
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,423
It'll be an unproven Max

1390
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,191
Right

1391
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:16,287
It's it's almost like two narratives that should not exist within the same

1392
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
Bran

1393
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:23,711
Virologist

1394
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,647
Do you have the warnings about Unruh

1395
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
I like

1396
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,719
Medical applications Withings that are

1397
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,511
Thoroughly tested and aren't ready to

1398
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,303
To go meanwhile

1399
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,375
Strong promotion of

1400
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,911
IPA

1401
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:46,751
Only emergency approved medication

1402
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
When was Alex

1403
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:53,151
Be promoting this if it's a prescription coil

1404
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,175
Score score

1405
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:57,247
He should be saying constantly talk to your doctor

1406
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,319
888

1407
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
Confusing

1408
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,391
Ideologically I want

1409
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,695
Testing available for everyone I want

1410
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:10,559
The eventual vaccine available available for everyone I want Treatment available for everyone

1411
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:13,119
But when I listen to Alex Jones sometimes I'm like

1412
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:17,471
What is the rest of us just covered our eyes for a little bit and then a few months they're gone

1413
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,007
Like it's that kind of

1414
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,055
Fury that I have at this liar

1415
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:22,847
I want

1416
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:23,871
To save his life

1417
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:26,943
And he is actively trying to kill himself in his

1418
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
Blisters dad

1419
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,247
It's infuriating

1420
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,039
It is infuriating it's it's it's

1421
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,831
Trial of empathy

1422
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,671
Really isn't pointless understanding

1423
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,975
Yes and it gets worse because of his next

1424
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
Is where Mike

1425
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:43,327
Gets into polio truth or ism

1426
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,887
It's it's pretty bad

1427
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:50,751
The way to beat the vaccine industry Alex is to get the word out about zinc

1428
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:55,359
I'm get America healthy and back to work again before the vaccine even comes into existence

1429
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,919
The vaccine

1430
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
Cause

1431
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,991
The virus

1432
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015
It was all a lie

1433
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,807
You know the vaccine didn't do anything

1434
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,855
The vaccine actually introduced more polio

1435
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:09,439
The number one cause of the polio vaccine

1436
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:12,255
Do the same thing with coronavirus if we give them a chance

1437
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,303
The word out about zinc

1438
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,583
Vitamin D3

1439
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,119
Parkland and masks

1440
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,399
Master the key

1441
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:23,519
Different from now on anybody riding on public transportation for the next few years

1442
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:29,151
I know it's fashion masks coming out is going to be cool looking mask

1443
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:34,527
All kinds of stuff

1444
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,063
Your bicycle be like okay

1445
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:36,831
It's over

1446
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,463
So it's really f****** easy for the health Ranger Mike Adams to sit here in 2020 and save it

1447
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,231
Polio vaccine

1448
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:43,999
She didn't do anything

1449
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,839
I think it's going to be a little f****** different if you were over 70 years old

1450
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:50,911
And live through the. Prior to the Advent That vaccine

1451
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:55,007
It's hard to remember this because most of us have lived our entire lives

1452
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,543
Anthony post-polio era

1453
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,567
Herbivore straight up

1454
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,871
Terrified of polio for good reason

1455
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,711
In 1894 the first outbreak of polio occurred in Vermont

1456
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:07,295
And call dr. The world but recorded in the United States

1457
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,319
And it called doctor

1458
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
Completely flat-footed

1459
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:13,695
18 people died in 132 were left permanently paralyzed

1460
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,743
At the time people work

1461
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:20,095
Fairly clueless about the origin of the disease and concluded based on preliminary information

1462
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,631
Play things like observing

1463
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,935
Family members not getting sick when

1464
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
Bunbuzz

1465
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,239
That they decided it was

1466
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,007
Contagious

1467
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:28,799
Omart

1468
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,847
11 years later Swedish scientist

1469
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:34,175
Ivar Wickman the Discover the polio wasn't that communicate

1470
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:37,503
Couple and their people could have it without developing these severe version

1471
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,783
Which often lead to death

1472
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
Paralysis

1473
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:45,695
In 1962 major outbreak struck New York leaving over 2,000 dead in New York City

1474
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
Cases spread across

1475
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,255
The country with the death toll reach

1476
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,535
About 6,000

1477
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,583
And also leaving thousands more paralyzed

1478
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,607
Permanently

1479
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,679
For decades scientists are trying to figure out if x

1480
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,703
To no avail

1481
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:58,751
It was just think that people lived with

1482
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:03,615
The weariness of a terrifying disease that could kill you leave you paralyzed or put you into an iron lung

1483
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:08,223
The March of Dimes was created as a way of funding Medical Research into a cure or vaccine

1484
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,271
And through contributions

1485
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,295
The millions of folks

1486
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,063
They did

1487
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,343
Makes progress

1488
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:18,207
In 1952 there were over 57,000 polio cases in the United States

1489
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:20,255
With over 21,000 of them results

1490
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,023
Chicken paralysis

1491
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,863
Naturally with those kinds of numbers we were pretty anxious for a cure

1492
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,935
And a few years later Jonas Salk would include

1493
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
Is Trials

1494
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,727
Leaving to the introduction

1495
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,007
The first polio vaccine

1496
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:36,895
Immediately from 1955 to 1957

1497
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,175
No

1498
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:42,783
United States drop between 85 and 90%

1499
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:49,183
Albert Sabin will come along a few years later with an improved vaccine can be taken orally and then phobia was essentially

1500
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,463
Eradicated

1501
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
In the country

1502
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,791
The last naturally occurring case was said to happen

1503
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,583
The 1979 but it wasn't

1504
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,607
An Amish community

1505
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,911
I don't mean that to say that Amish

1506
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:03,007
Are more likely to be Auntie vaccinated right because of these

1507
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,823
Secluded nature communities are

1508
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,103
More under

1509
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:07,871
Vaccinated

1510
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,199
Knock-Knock position to vaccine grinder sir

1511
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,223
Isolated

1512
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:18,623
Yeah many of the people who had Polio but survived they come down with post-polio syndrome

1513
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,415
CPS make up one of the largest blocks

1514
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
Pics of persons

1515
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,975
Living with disability in the world

1516
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,535
The landscape of disability rights

1517
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,071
Would be a lot different

1518
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,143
Without a lot of the activists in the polio Survivor community

1519
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,167
From Ed Robert

1520
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,703
The founder of the world in

1521
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,727
Institute on disability

1522
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,263
Who got polio at 14

1523
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,799
Had to be in an iron lung

1524
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,079
Do Judith human

1525
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:44,479
Zoo live basically her whole life of polio eventually becoming Bill Clinton's assistant secretary for education and

1526
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,247
Potato service

1527
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:50,623
What bike is engaging here in at 8 here is a shocking inoffensive Erasure of

1528
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,647
Millions of people's

1529
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,415
Experience

1530
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,975
His whole the polio vaccine created more cases

1531
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
Sapolio

1532
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,791
Is just him misrepresenting

1533
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,327
What stone is the Qatar in

1534
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:07,263
In 1955 a number of recently vaccinated children were coming down with polio and paralysis of the arm

1535
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,055
Where the vaccine was given to

1536
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,919
Where the cases were investigated they were found at these they trace back to Qatar Liebert

1537
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:18,271
It was awful and I'm not minimizing the experiences of the hundreds

1538
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,319
The people who were affected by the fuk up

1539
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,343
But this was a lavish

1540
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,111
Do not have X

1541
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:26,463
People were producing the vaccine they were not correctly preparing it

1542
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,303
And in the process the virus itself was not being fully inactivate

1543
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,607
This hurt public confidence

1544
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,631
The vaccine itself

1545
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:36,703
And it's used to this day by anti-vax weirdos like bike

1546
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,471
The drying

1547
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,751
Claim that the vaccine

1548
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,775
Gives you the disease

1549
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,567
Yeah it was

1550
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,359
A function of

1551
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,407
Bad business

1552
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
Being done

1553
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:51,039
The people have been more careful and actually that led to a lot of conversations about regulation of

1554
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:56,927
Production of medical stuff if you want to try and rewrite FDR's Legacy on the New Deal

1555
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,207
Naturally have to rewrite

1556
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,231
FDR's Legacy on

1557
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,767
Having polio

1558
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,399
So there's one other thing that might could be referencing

1559
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,191
But it also be lying about it

1560
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,495
I don't know if you know this

1561
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:15,871
But there's a condition that's called circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus

1562
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,895
That's the thing that I

1563
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,663
Folio

1564
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:18,943
Sounds like you're not

1565
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,271
It's super fascinating

1566
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,551
And honestly

1567
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:28,159
The more you know about it the better an argument is to vaccinate your children

1568
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:34,047
So in 2017 mostly because the number of naturally occurring polio cases was

1569
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,327
Very small

1570
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:39,679
There were actually more cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus

1571
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:45,055
When you get a vaccine you're getting a Wii conversion to that

1572
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,847
Disease put into your body so you can

1573
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:50,431
Can create an immune response to it which will give you an immunity sometime

1574
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,199
Spinato's

1575
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
Well yeah

1576
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,295
Fine this is the case with his polio vaccine

1577
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:59,391
But if you get the vaccine it's not you who could get back

1578
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,927
Derive poliovirus

1579
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:04,767
Unvaccinated people around you

1580
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:10,911
So in the time that the weakened viruses inside you creating the immune response you can end up excreting

1581
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,191
Desire ateez communic

1582
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,263
In the in the case

1583
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,799
But yeah

1584
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:20,127
In the case that you're in a population that is under vaccinated

1585
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:23,711
That virus could end up getting picked up by someone who hasn't been back since

1586
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,759
This person will likely be fine

1587
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:31,647
Because it's just a weekend version of the poliovirus and ultimately end up creating an immunity to it as well most of

1588
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,183
However

1589
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:35,999
If the population Uranus super under vaccinate

1590
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,815
It just might be that this virus can jump

1591
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,863
From person to person for a long time

1592
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:46,239
In the process mutate back into the form of polio virus that can cause serious problems like a paralysis

1593
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:51,359
The World Health Organization estimates that this process takes at least 12 months

1594
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,639
And

1595
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,455
Between 2000 and 2017 in that seven

1596
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,479
19 year span

1597
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,247
This occurred

1598
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,551
24 * in the entire world

1599
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:03,903
And it led to 760 cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus

1600
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Notion

1601
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:08,511
But that's compared to the estimated 13 million cases

1602
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,815
Did vaccination programs had prevented

1603
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,095
I don't understand that

1604
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,119
That's not a trade-off

1605
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,167
I'm not willing to make that trade-off

1606
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:19,007
Also this is only an issue with the orally-administered vaccine

1607
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:25,407
It's not the case which is what's used in the United States so it's not even relevant to our lives

1608
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,687
Here necessarily

1609
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,735
What do vaccine-derived

1610
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:32,831
Bentley poliovirus

1611
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:35,391
It can only really

1612
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,927
Be a problem

1613
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,999
Vaccinated

1614
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,303
Contrave the of the harmless virus right

1615
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,375
To each other to the point where I can

1616
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,655
Yeah that's that is

1617
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,679
Like

1618
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:51,007
That is that herd immunity Concept in

1619
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
God

1620
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:55,615
I just don't understand people who can honestly argue again

1621
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,175
It has to be

1622
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,455
Look I mean

1623
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,783
Not honestly I mean I get that people believe

1624
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
The anti-vax

1625
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,599
I get that they believe it

1626
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,391
The arguing of it

1627
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,159
Seems

1628
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:11,231
If you believe it just say that you think it

1629
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:14,047
It causes autism or whatever it is your b******* is

1630
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,583
And stop there

1631
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,631
The idea of arguing with me

1632
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,911
He's insane

1633
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,215
Yeah

1634
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,263
It seems especially when you're the health right

1635
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:28,127
Yeah it's Sovereign citizen bulshit looking for help

1636
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,967
I got big argue with a disease

1637
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:35,039
Mike says that there are more cases of polio to comfort

1638
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,319
Vaccine

1639
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087
He's talking

1640
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:40,415
He wants you to imagine a doctor giving you a shot

1641
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:44,511
That's going to give you Polly over the claim it's medicine

1642
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,095
Ultimately what I want to say is a big f*** you too Mike Adams

1643
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,143
Polio wasn't Israel

1644
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,167
And the vaccine is safe

1645
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,471
How was people in this country and around the world

1646
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,751
Paralysis and death

1647
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,519
Infinite

1648
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,823
People who survived

1649
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,847
I would beg

1650
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,639
Anyone who's interested go watch

1651
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,943
Some documentaries about polio survivors

1652
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,735
Like hear their stories

1653
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:07,039
It's what Mike is doing is

1654
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
Outrageous

1655
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:12,415
Avery had all that motherfuker Mike Adams has ever given the world

1656
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,999
Is a dumbass Ebola cure that would definitely give you ebola

1657
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:19,071
A couple of embarrassing rap song and this s***

1658
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,863
It's over for Humanity

1659
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,655
It will only be Lone Survivor

1660
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,215
Go fuc yourself McAdam serious

1661
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,519
He's he's got to be stopped

1662
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,799
Strongly

1663
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,591
Making an argument for himself as

1664
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,359
Feel like being

1665
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,383
The worst

1666
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,407
He is like

1667
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,431
He really is

1668
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,479
Alex will always have the

1669
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,527
Grandfathered position of the worst

1670
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,575
Write that number two spot is it

1671
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,111
It's constantly really close

1672
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:47,743
Yeah it is a holocaust denier

1673
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,023
And Steve

1674
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,583
Might always be in the number to stop it

1675
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:55,167
Might make a great case for a cell

1676
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,191
We're past

1677
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:59,263
It's like obviously the log can't help us

1678
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,287
But if we

1679
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,055
We had somebody

1680
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,079
Need to take Mike

1681
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,127
Arkham Asylum it would be okay

1682
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,407
Do you know what I mean

1683
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,943
Vigilante

1684
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:12,063
But Arkham Asylum is a different situation a lot of downtime

1685
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,159
I feel like you're good at

1686
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:20,255
Your girlfriend's condo is going to have a cave and it soon

1687
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,303
If only we had a butler

1688
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:25,119
I'm free

1689
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,911
You would be a great outfit

1690
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
I think I could be off

1691
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,215
You give me all kinds

1692
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,519
Targets in all the stuff in you be like Jordan don't

1693
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:38,687
Techno revered sensibilities to

1694
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,039
Mike is pushing really hard that everybody's going to get these masks

1695
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:43,807
And

1696
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:48,159
Great I get online I guess nothing else though

1697
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,951
They only people we need math

1698
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,999
Well unfortunately

1699
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,279
Keep talk

1700
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,815
Discussing how like

1701
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,583
Snopes

1702
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,607
The government

1703
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,423
Take basketball

1704
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:03,519
Because the Surgeon General

1705
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,383
Because the government

1706
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,175
Agencies had this information about

1707
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,503
And teach people know math

1708
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,783
Our good master

1709
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:19,647
What's on record

1710
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:31,167
We're fighting the disinformation Agents of the world which are most

1711
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:35,775
Do you think of Mike Adams is mad that the Surgeon General is take

1712
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:39,359
Technically a health Ranger named Adams

1713
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:44,991
I think he's mad that cbp's doesn't know that we have a Surgeon General

1714
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,039
I mean that was only like a month

1715
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,087
That Alex is fever like

1716
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:51,903
Trump

1717
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,183
We're all going to die

1718
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,999
I guess they're learning

1719
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,023
You know

1720
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,327
You got to give it up for that for that

1721
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,447
If it is true that the Surgeon General is putting out this information about whether or not masks

1722
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,751
They're helpful for people who don't have the virus

1723
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:10,847
It was only one person you should talk to you about that and it's the person who appointed him and

1724
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,383
Play some it anytime and that's

1725
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,015
On March 2nd Surgeon General Jerome Adams Twitter

1726
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:23,391
Seriously people stop buying masks they're not effective in preventing general public from Catching Coronavirus

1727
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:26,719
But if Healthcare Providers can't get them to care for sick patients

1728
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,487
What's them

1729
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,767
In our communities at risk

1730
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:32,863
Then on April 2nd there was a headline from CNBC

1731
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
Quotes

1732
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:40,287
In a U-turn US Surgeon General asks CDC to see a face mask and prevent coronavirus spread after all

1733
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:43,359
No matter what the reality of the situation is

1734
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:46,687
You kind of see how inept the people Trump surrounds himself with our

1735
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,479
And how you can't

1736
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,015
Really rely on them for

1737
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,039
Good messaging

1738
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,343
Just it's just such an

1739
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
Obvious thing

1740
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,647
That we're living through right now

1741
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,439
When we get past

1742
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,743
And we're all again capable of

1743
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:00,767
Congregate

1744
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,815
These people need to face charges

1745
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,119
They just need to face chart like

1746
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,935
It Is by their bungling of the system

1747
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:08,959
Directly

1748
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,519
Many more people are going to die

1749
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,848
Specifically and their actions

1750
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,872
Have killed

1751
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:19,968
That is I don't know how other to describe that then as a

1752
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
Prime

1753
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,272
A murder

1754
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,552
And they should face charges

1755
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,088
That's that

1756
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:29,184
It's not hard if you were truly I don't disagree with you functionally I don't know what that look

1757
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,000
But it's just

1758
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:32,768
Should happen

1759
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:39,424
So the big issue that I leaving that aside yes of course I don't know what to do with it

1760
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:44,544
Will ever be able to like sit here be like all right here is here's a step one

1761
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,592
Several million people together in the same place

1762
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,152
The issue that I have with

1763
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:51,712
Mike is that he's framing the situation with the masks

1764
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
Incorrectly

1765
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:59,136
There's a whole lot of debate about whether or not normal surgical masks are going to be helpful in stopping you from being exposed to the virus

1766
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:02,464
Particularly if you're in close proximity with someone who's sick

1767
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,232
And coughing

1768
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,072
Do not create an airtight seal on your face

1769
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:11,168
So if the virus is admitted in a way that could be transmitted through the air

1770
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,960
It was come around the side of the mat

1771
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:19,616
It's not yet cleared this is the means by which the virus is primarily or even the largely transmitted but if it is

1772
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,152
The master won't really help

1773
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:21,920
With that

1774
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,968
However they are very helpful

1775
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,248
If you're already sick

1776
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:28,832
As they will be pretty effective than catching droplets on the way out of your

1777
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,136
People who are sick should wear

1778
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,440
Sister out in public that is definitely true

1779
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:39,072
And if it's the case that people can be contagious when they are asymptomatic which looks like it may be the case

1780
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,632
Then it would make sense for people to wear masks

1781
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,656
Just in case

1782
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,472
The focus of Mike's angle is wrong

1783
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:52,128
If you're promoting people wearing masks for their own scent like as a self-defense mechanism

1784
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:52,896
Sensical

1785
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,176
It really only makes sense

1786
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,968
Is a public health measure

1787
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,504
Which seems

1788
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,784
Public Health

1789
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,368
I don't know he's a pencil but it seems to not be at all the way he's presenting

1790
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:07,488
You should wear mask because it'll make it less likely you give something to someone else

1791
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:14,400
Write what his messaging is is the same as the f****** chloroquine Scituate

1792
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,168
Nation where it's like

1793
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,960
All you're going to do right now

1794
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,752
Because we don't have enough

1795
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,312
Is dry large number of people who

1796
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,336
Who have a large

1797
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,104
Amount of resources

1798
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,640
Into buying masks

1799
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:27,200
Keeping them out of the hands of people who don't have the

1800
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,272
And then we wind up in a worse off switch

1801
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,040
Situation

1802
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,576
Quite quite likely

1803
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,648
F****** infuriated an idiot

1804
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,184
And I see this

1805
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:43,328
So there's a great piece in the Atlantic by Ed Yong that just came out about the mask issue and there's a lot of new one

1806
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:46,144
The medical record

1807
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:46,912
Invoice creator

1808
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:51,008
The medical necessity of Grandmasters not really Atkins

1809
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,056
Consensus but there are a lot of side issues

1810
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,592
They're positive

1811
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:57,408
It's to the unit like the idea of universal mask-wearing like

1812
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:03,808
Increasing the stigma that someone would feel wearing a mask if they are sick

1813
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,088
Take the disease seriously

1814
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,624
But they're also downside

1815
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,672
Like the fact that most people don't know how to wear

1816
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,720
And they often end up sconce

1817
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,000
Bentley adjusting InTouch

1818
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:12,768
No masks

1819
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,048
Which leads them

1820
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,376
To touch their face more which is one of the main things you're trying not to do

1821
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,936
It's more complicated as a picture

1822
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,240
Then just saying everyone should wear masks

1823
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:26,080
I'm being like I'm the help Ranger I did a great job Alex give me a check

1824
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:26,848
Prairie

1825
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,664
What's less up for discussion is that there are

1826
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688
Aren't Enough masks

1827
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,712
To go around right now

1828
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:38,624
Is there any advice that involves essential

1829
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:41,440
If medical workers are having a difficult time finding

1830
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,208
Masks

1831
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,488
Then it's not a great idea to

1832
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,792
Encourage everyone to continue buying up masks

1833
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,608
Unless you're also able to simultaneously

1834
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:51,680
Seriously boothby immediate supply of said mask

1835
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:58,080
One thing that I find very interesting is that there's no part of Infowars model they can really thrive in the

1836
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,872
The context of rational

1837
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:02,432
Everything needs to be pitched in a way that

1838
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,480
It's likely to create runs on product

1839
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,528
Alex else's food bucket

1840
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:10,112
By saying everyone's out of food which is meant to cause a hyperinflation

1841
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:10,880
Demand

1842
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:16,000
Alex's reported on chloroquine as a documented miracle cure Lucy no shortages of the drug

1843
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
Locked up

1844
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:20,608
In this episode alone Micah saying that the country needs to be flooded with zing

1845
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,144
But everybody needs to be running

1846
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:27,008
Richard everyone took his gospel would absolutely lead to runs on both product

1847
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,080
I'm not saying that these dudes are causing these runs

1848
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:36,480
But their business model is really only Built to be profitable when they're able to exploit and ride those way

1849
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,016
And I think that's something that's worth

1850
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:41,344
Maybe isn't all that clear except when you're in

1851
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,112
Situation

1852
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,136
Yeah it does

1853
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,672
That is a really really good point

1854
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:48,256
Because yeah it seems like they exist only

1855
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,792
To prop up Bubba

1856
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,840
And then float to the next

1857
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:57,984
Like they sit on top of the bubble it explodes and by the time it explodes they've already jumped onto the next

1858
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,288
They're they're the credit default

1859
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,568
Flops of human be

1860
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:04,384
Like they're disgusting and awful in their kill

1861
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:10,784
Yeah it's like it's like the wrong interpretation of that quote like a comes

1862
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:16,928
The Affairs of man that

1863
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:23,584
The tired I don't know exactly how it goes I know Shakespeare quote but I only know it from Woodhouse no I don't

1864
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
T Jefferson said

1865
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,376
About what

1866
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,168
So also Snopes didn't

1867
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,984
Say don't wear masks they were just reporting on what statement

1868
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,520
Since we're being made by officials

1869
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,592
One of the sources cited in the article is

1870
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,616
Not yet the biking

1871
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,152
Alex's hero Donald Trump

1872
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
Who said quote

1873
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,968
I'm sorry this really article quote

1874
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:46,368
Said Tuesday that his scientific advisers may clear the general public shouldn't be competing with hospitals and health worker

1875
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,160
Crews were scarce masks of any type

1876
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,184
His solution

1877
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,232
Use a scarf if you want

1878
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,280
Trump said at the daily White House briefing

1879
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,840
I don't know what was the twist

1880
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,864
25th Amendment

1881
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:03,776
This it was for this right I can't find any Snopes articles about hydroxychloroquine being bad

1882
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:06,336
Never say that because they are idiots and they realize the drug

1883
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,616
Has other real uses

1884
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:14,272
The only real article I could find to cover the subject is about Hannity and Rudy giuliani's claim that this mysterious.

1885
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:19,648
Doctor it successfully treated all of his coronavirus patients with hydroxychloroquine and z-pack and zinc

1886
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,440
Ncvps

1887
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,464
Google doesn't say that the

1888
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
The claim is not

1889
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,000
True

1890
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,536
Just that it's unproven

1891
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:30,400
Which is exactly what the doctor at the center of this claim dr. zelenko said

1892
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:36,032
In an interview with forward zelinka acknowledged that his regiment was new and untested

1893
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,848
It was too soon to assess its long-term effect

1894
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,480
So cool awesome great work man these guys

1895
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,552
Snopes isn't saying the word masks are bad

1896
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:49,344
Or that hydroxychloroquine

1897
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,880
His Bat just these are not

1898
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:51,904
Settled Quest

1899
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
And a new one

1900
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,208
We know Alex

1901
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,232
Fucken hates nuance

1902
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,512
It's really bad at it

1903
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,584
And this is how he behaves

1904
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,352
Concept of

1905
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,144
Anyone reporting something with

1906
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,704
Out making something up or

1907
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,472
Using it

1908
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,032
Is so horrific

1909
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:08,800
To him that he he

1910
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:09,568
Eat it like

1911
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,592
It's so off

1912
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,152
That he has this Burning hatred like

1913
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,432
The idea of Snopes

1914
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:18,016
Feeling like we're just going to quote people who say something in response

1915
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:19,808
That's all we're going

1916
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,880
We're not going to make up anything we're not even going to

1917
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:25,184
How to give a point of view or

1918
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,208
Like that

1919
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:29,536
I mean that's one part of it and then he's

1920
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,072
Constantly on the wrong side of it

1921
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:31,840
Yeah that's true

1922
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,704
His the scourge of his

1923
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:40,288
Existence is fact-checkers obviously

1924
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,312
They're always going

1925
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,848
Go to be animes

1926
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:46,432
Whatever the case we're done now with this sex

1927
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,736
We're going to get him something

1928
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,504
Completely different

1929
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,040
And as a transition

1930
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:52,576
We have Alex

1931
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,856
Coming back in from break

1932
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:58,464
And I'm going to apologize in advance for this because I think this

1933
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,792
It's going to traumatize some of our listeners because of the music choice

1934
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,816
Study hard using

1935
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:06,400
Cuz it's usually we've seen a lot of him doing the over

1936
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:09,216
The sax You Belong To The City doing a little speech

1937
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,568
This time he uses Policy of Truth

1938
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,848
RealFlight for the

1939
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,384
But

1940
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,408
Mike down for this

1941
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,968
Because Alex gets into a weird fantasy

1942
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:22,784
It makes me think that maybe he's been playing Castlevania

1943
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:08,096
Policy of Truth

1944
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:11,424
I love it I love it

1945
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:17,824
What you said

1946
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:29,856
Welcome back ladies and gentlemen welcome back.

1947
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:35,232
Like this stupid

1948
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:41,632
Stuckey's jerking off just mumbling to himself about fighting a vampire

1949
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:47,776
Oh my God I just watched The Ninth Gate

1950
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,360
How did The Policy of Truth

1951
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:53,152
I think he did just watch The Ninth Gate

1952
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:55,456
It could I was that girl who's the devil

1953
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,992
Yeah I had red eyes

1954
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,784
Are there are the castle at night

1955
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,576
He's not scared

1956
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:03,648
That movie is about books

1957
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:08,000
Castlevania the game

1958
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,792
The Netflix anime

1959
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:13,632
Based on the video cuz I totally end

1960
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:18,496
Absolutely

1961
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,824
That's just

1962
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,200
Castle in Highlander I'm going to mark that off on our big

1963
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:32,832
No not yet I just like the vibe there is like someone I wouldn't

1964
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:33,600
Want to hang out

1965
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,648
Baby

1966
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,024
Anyway

1967
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,584
We get into Alex

1968
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,888
Doing a part two of the

1969
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,448
And it's much

1970
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,472
Sillier

1971
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:59,712
Yes it is what's Billy because I see an overall

1972
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,552
Atar baby

1973
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:07,648
What the f*** I'm studying it

1974
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,792
No you don't

1975
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,840
The whole thing's bad

1976
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,400
Maine

1977
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:23,520
What it does is destructive in the end

1978
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,056
They're really into it

1979
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,360
Videos p***

1980
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,640
Because it's not what we doing

1981
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:50,400
Personally talked to a lot of other people and got love for you have amazing Sports

1982
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,168
And for

1983
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,960
Pee tape is real

1984
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,544
There's something about

1985
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,616
Fortune

1986
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:05,760
Treasure

1987
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:10,624
Y'all call it a fortune.

1988
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,256
Because it makes the air in this magic entry

1989
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:20,096
Always thought we just wake everybody up

1990
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,080
And

1991
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,640
It just sucks

1992
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,712
The energy and end the immediacy of everything

1993
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,648
What's the plan

1994
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:48,000
And as one goes we all go and all this stuff you'd imagine I'm called

1995
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,536
You'd be chanting

1996
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,816
So it's clearly queuing

1997
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:55,168
F****** funny

1998
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:57,728
Alex's apparently now mad

1999
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:04,128
And I checked in with the guys over qanon Anonymous to see if something that happened recently

2000
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,920
They had no idea

2001
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,992
It's really funny to be about this is how trance

2002
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:09,760
Paradis

2003
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:13,856
Alex wants his audience to think that the reason he's buys because

2004
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:17,440
Asiop it's working against these political goals but that's absurd

2005
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:21,792
I'm listen to Alex's show the whole stretch of time that you anons existed

2006
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:28,192
And it's very obvious that he hates qanon because he was unable to funnel them into his Revenue stream

2007
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,472
Starting a fight

2008
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:33,568
Like this right now or being like I'm going to start cover in this

2009
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,616
It leads me to believe

2010
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:37,152
That he wants

2011
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,176
Alphabets

2012
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,224
Yeah he wants he's looking

2013
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,272
For some attention out of this

2014
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,808
And he's going to try in

2015
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:47,904
Metaphorically cut a chip out of a homeless person's arm

2016
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,696
About this

2017
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,720
The feeling that I get

2018
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,488
This is a stock

2019
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,768
It seems a little bit like

2020
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:53,792
He's trying to start a fight

2021
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:57,120
Feud with Joe Rogan in order to get back on the podcast but

2022
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:01,472
He just ate like he's trying to call out whoever says they're cute and see

2023
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,008
We will get on it

2024
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:05,056
You need to hold on to those thoughts

2025
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:08,128
But what's interesting is like I've listened to the show like

2026
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:11,712
The forever and I know that back on January 6th

2027
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:15,040
Alex literally told his good buddy Joel skousen

2028
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:18,112
But he attempted to and wanted to co-op

2029
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,904
Qanon I remember didn't work

2030
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:22,720
Has ever come true

2031
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,280
This is a pure disinformation expert

2032
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,816
And

2033
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:33,472
Sammy a lot of trump supporters including mices with some of my subscribers

2034
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,776
Publicly

2035
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:43,456
Because before chapatis it's definitely a delusional

2036
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,504
Sucking up so many good people

2037
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,064
Yes

2038
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,088
Here is my Play

2039
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,160
I was going to take over Cuba

2040
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,440
Who is Kyo and then

2041
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:55,744
Until all of qanon dum-dum followers

2042
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,512
That it's my

2043
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:02,912
Yes I was just going to use the name that's very popular to put out by own things

2044
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,936
Straightforward

2045
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,960
Straight-shooting

2046
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,240
For sure

2047
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:11,360
Absolutely historically Alex has been able to piggyback and monetize all of the hard right

2048
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,384
Fringe movie

2049
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,712
That have come along because he's always been the biggest game in town

2050
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:19,296
And prior to social media he was able to be very secure in that position

2051
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,856
He situated himself as we head to the 9/11

2052
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:22,624
Truth folks

2053
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,672
He's able to use the Oath Keepers and

2054
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,464
Connection to them to co-op much of

2055
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,512
The Tea Party enthusiasm that bubbled up

2056
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,816
The 2009. And then purchase

2057
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,584
Top of it

2058
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,120
Who's able to frame himself

2059
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:35,168
The king of all sorts of reality defying

2060
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:37,472
Conspiracy theories that were popular online

2061
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,496
Like Sandy Hook

2062
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,520
In the Boston bombing

2063
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:40,800
But now

2064
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,080
Alex is not needed

2065
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,616
Do not exist

2066
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:45,664
Entirely outside of Alex's world

2067
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,944
And they don't like him

2068
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,248
Is there was a diamond it for Alex

2069
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:51,296
To support or play along with this s***

2070
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:54,112
You probably be doing that but since they're hostile to him

2071
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:56,928
He knows that this is not a fertile market so f******

2072
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,976
This is so funny to me

2073
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:04,864
I think it's probably mostly just a result of Alex's interview with Ted Nugent's wife

2074
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:11,520
I think there's Fallout do you think she got mad at him or he got mad

2075
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:17,920
So funny I think maybe

2076
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,688
Animals are real

2077
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,736
Wife is Super 8

2078
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:23,296
Might be

2079
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,576
Oh man

2080
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,368
What can you imagine

2081
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:31,488
Look this is the first time that I'm really feeling a lot of empathy for Ted

2082
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,328
Stuck between his wife and qanon on one side

2083
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:38,656
And Alex Jones in

2084
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,680
That's brutal

2085
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,728
What what relationship do you choose dad

2086
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:46,336
Neither is a Alien versus Predator situation

2087
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,616
Whoever

2088
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:51,968
Predator By the Light song

2089
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,016
Where you talk about Hobbies Frederick

2090
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:56,064
He is a sexual predator

2091
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,624
Accident care about that though

2092
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,392
No not important

2093
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,672
So Alex is

2094
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:03,488
Pretty mattock you and

2095
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,536
Good things about you

2096
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:09,120
Like it that you know people who are into it like to do research

2097
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,424
Which is laughable

2098
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,408
The whole cute thing cuz I know and it

2099
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,344
Don't give an

2100
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,112
Example

2101
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,136
Don't do it

2102
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,160
It's going to be bad

2103
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,184
Don't

2104
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:35,488
Stop

2105
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,304
Lockstep Rockefeller

2106
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,352
Billboard 200

2107
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,936
Population

2108
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:47,520
These are real things you going to Library read online

2109
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,800
Eco science

2110
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:52,384
You actually can

2111
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,200
Sterilization

2112
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
35 years later

2113
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,320
37 years later

2114
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,112
What else you got

2115
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,184
Me and

2116
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:10,048
So again it's the same sort of things like

2117
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:14,400
Yeah I looked this lot of enthusiasm among these people but they're not

2118
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,936
Pushing my you talkin

2119
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,984
Points

2120
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:18,752
Makes me angry

2121
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:23,872
Yes and there's a lot of meat and potatoes on that like there's a lot of meat and potatoes on the bowls and f***

2122
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:28,736
Pinhook 80's in their bank account

2123
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:32,576
Becoming a potato bowl and I'm pissed off

2124
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,368
I would like meat and potatoes

2125
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,904
But obviously that's one

2126
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:39,232
Very very clear piece of this thing

2127
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,256
It really piss

2128
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:46,656
But there's a second piece of this and I think it might actually be more what's driving him

2129
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:48,192
I think

2130
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,008
One of the reasons why I suspect

2131
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,800
But this has to do with Ted Nugent's wife

2132
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,592
Is that this seems

2133
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,872
Kind of personal okay

2134
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,152
Okay it seems like

2135
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:00,480
As we go through Alex's grievances with qanon

2136
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,016
A lot of it

2137
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:08,416
Seems to revolve around the idea that people think you anons real but Alex doesn't get enough respect

2138
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,976
It seems to be like

2139
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:13,024
Do it likes me as much as that

2140
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:16,096
The number one thing I hate about qanon is that they're trying to

2141
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,376
Co-op cat scratch

2142
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:22,752
Fever and I can't have that in my house look accused Stranglehold

2143
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:23,520
Doesn't Rock

2144
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,800
I cannot meet up with her

2145
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,848
It seems very Petty

2146
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:27,616
It's just

2147
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,152
Insanely Patty

2148
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,064
Reviews of Patti speech

2149
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,888
Satisfied on the street whatever

2150
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:56,288
Knowing that what I write when I say gets taken and put in the present speeches

2151
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,384
President called my wife

2152
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:06,016
Your husband's a real man got a lot of currently going through down

2154
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:19,840
And it's Tylenol

2155
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,376
Hanging out

2156
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,592
Play one America News Network

2157
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,360
So

2158
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,384
At what

2159
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:34,944
Call Patty Tucker

2160
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,992
Whatever man I don't give a s*** like

2161
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:39,808
The whole thing is all just like

2162
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,344
Comparing himself

2163
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,880
The qanon

2164
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,928
Crazy about it is the way

2165
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,208
That's start

2166
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:50,304
Is Alex being like I have people that I know come up to

2167
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,072
Tumi who are into

2168
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:53,120
You are not like you're not cute level

2169
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:55,424
These are your friends man

2170
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,984
Sure is your friend group better

2171
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,080
He's not capable of curating a

2172
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:08,224
Don't get mad that you're not as cool as Q with your friends

2173
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:11,808
Fridge

2174
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,856
Whole God

2175
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:19,744
But it's worse

2176
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,024
Oh no

2177
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:26,144
Asian people

2178
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:35,104
Are you still at Alex Jones but now I'm with the president

2179
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:41,760
90 Jones the hell does that mean

2180
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:43,296
Embassy to Jerusalem

2181
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:46,112
Exactly

2182
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,648
Criticism of Israel

2183
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,768
What two of them

2184
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,328
For Israel

2185
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,680
Proud of the fact that I am totally independent

2186
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:05,056
Modern Talking Points that were adopted

2187
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,872
President and his speech writers

2188
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,944
America

2189
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:19,392
Doc my house yesterday and called it a fake police

2190
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:25,024
Your address was in your DUI report

2191
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,216
Border

2192
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,288
Metro

2193
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:41,152
Audience of America

2194
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,688
Freedom like 50 dudes

2195
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,224
Give It Up

2196
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:50,880
We've changed the world 1776

2197
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:57,536
Bohemian Grove

2198
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:03,424
Information

2199
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,240
L.a. local

2200
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:12,128
Austin original

2201
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:20,320
Instructive but that does seem to be

2202
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,416
So I would

2203
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:26,720
Translate that entire thing by like

2204
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,512
Qanon says

2205
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:29,536
My dick small

2206
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,816
My dick

2207
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:31,584
Large

2208
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,120
Very much

2209
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:35,424
Trump and I talk all the time

2210
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,984
About how big my dog is

2211
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,264
This is just

2212
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:43,360
This is so personal there's something so personal to it

2213
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,128
Besides

2214
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,920
One complaint

2215
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:48,480
Gets into a petty grievance begins with like

2216
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:51,040
Friends around me are in 2 Q

2217
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,856
Cousin comes up to me

2218
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:56,928
Who knows

2219
01:43:57,184 --> 01:44:03,072
Who knows

2220
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,608
Man who's just pursuing his dream

2221
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:11,008
One can only hope he's somewhere in Chicago by the way

2222
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:13,312
Buckley

2223
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:17,152
I swear in this quarantine workout

2224
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:17,920
You're listening

2225
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,224
Scott hope you are

2226
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,016
Confused

2227
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:31,232
The fact that it's like so presented as like people in his immediate vicinity

2228
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,048
We think that he's really just mad

2229
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:36,864
At people around him not giving him the respect that

2230
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,144
He feels he deserves

2231
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:40,192
In comparison to this

2232
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:41,984
Internet

2233
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,520
Hoax yeah

2234
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,336
No does my note and let me let me

2235
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,104
Just read this for you

2236
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,408
This is just sad

2237
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,432
Double underline

2238
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:56,064
Sad

2239
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,088
Pathetic

2240
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:59,392
And I wish it was an April Fool's Day

2241
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:01,184
And I'm not positive it's

2242
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:01,952
Not

2243
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,000
By the way it is positive

2244
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,792
The feeling isn't right

2245
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:06,816
That's 100%

2246
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:07,584
Yeah

2247
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,888
He uses his Petty voice I love it when he gets that stick

2248
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,168
Mikado to him

2249
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:16,800
What he's with people

2250
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:17,568
So don't

2251
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,848
Man

2252
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:20,640
What people tell her

2253
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:22,688
Is that Alex's real

2254
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:27,552
Don't respect him enough not truly believe in you are being tricked by trolls

2255
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,088
In many of the same

2256
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:34,720
Internet message boards Alex gets tricked by trolls at

2257
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,256
Somebody could get hurt

2258
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:39,840
My biggest problem the two people isn't always you know

2259
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:44,960
Crazy

2260
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,568
Manipulative

2261
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:53,664
Mental illness

2262
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,784
Manipulate

2263
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:19,776
With a Q on his DeLand

2264
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:33,088
Father telling you not to this year and last year

2265
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:37,440
Robert

2266
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:40,768
Nothing

2267
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,304
Walking the president

2268
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,656
On your wife up telling her how great you are

2269
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:51,776
I am not God to a master of the universe but he's so mad

2270
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,056
Dan

2271
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:57,920
These people are all out here with these internet trolls they're all doing this for fun

2272
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:00,480
I do it for money

2273
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:02,528
I just

2274
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,296
Here

2275
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,856
Like it's always bad

2276
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:08,416
I guess what's really in

2277
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:11,744
Sing to me about this is like obviously there is a headline

2278
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,072
It's easy to write on this story and that is that Alex takes

2279
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,352
I am at 2 or not

2280
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:19,168
Alex is a loser little titty baby

2281
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:25,824
That's should be the headline headline explanation

2282
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:29,920
Take me to Alex feel slighted by internet conspiracy

2283
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,224
Alex

2284
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:36,320
Completely refused Paul Joseph Watson

2285
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:39,392
Buy something that he can't control

2286
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:45,536
This is outside of his ability and he's dealt with it okay to fact that you can't control it over the course of

2287
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,584
As long as you hear

2288
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:49,632
Seems like right now he

2289
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:53,216
Is coming up against something there's some sort of a crisis Maybe

2290
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:57,824
He needs a flashing attention-grabbing publicity stunt and

2291
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,616
Trying to get into a fight with a

2292
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,384
The fake

2293
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,408
Thing yeah

2294
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,432
Is probably

2295
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,224
Way to do it

2296
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,016
I don't know it is

2297
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:06,784
It seems death

2298
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,064
It seems attention

2299
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,344
Grabby

2300
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,136
In all rooted in

2301
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:12,416
I'm at

2302
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,952
It does it does get

2303
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:14,976
The feel of like the

2304
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:16,256
The young at the old

2305
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:17,024
Like it like

2306
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:18,816
Isn't it in Nevada

2307
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:21,376
If you are a conspiracy theorist

2308
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,400
Famous enough

2309
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,424
For long enough

2310
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,472
That eventually you will be

2311
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,496
The subject

2312
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,520
Checked of the very

2313
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,288
Conspiracy

2314
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,336
That you are pretending

2315
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:34,688
I'm not sure if ever later are going to be like

2316
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,480
You're nothing you're

2317
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,272
Part of the thing that arkan

2318
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:43,392
Yeah I'm not right is that Alex has ever turned Bill Cooper into like

2319
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:45,184
A villain it is

2320
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,976
Conspiracy narrative

2321
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:50,048
Yeah yeah and lied about their relation

2322
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:54,400
For sure it we talked about that in one of our past episode

2323
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:56,704
Yeah maybe maybe Alex have

2324
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:59,008
Used to have the class

2325
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:01,824
To not do that. Turn bill into like

2326
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:02,592
A villain

2327
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:04,640
But he's not getting that treatment

2328
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:09,504
Woman qanon like I said like it one of the most important

2329
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,272
Things about it is it

2330
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:12,576
Exist outside of Alex it doesn't need Alex

2331
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:14,880
And it has the freedom to be like

2332
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:16,160
Open Shelf

2333
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:18,208
That guy

2334
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,000
Pay

2335
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:21,536
Naive

2336
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:27,936
Actually the most accurate think you is ever done distressing Alex

2337
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:33,056
So as we get further through this when we went to commercial break their I thought like well he said his

2338
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,336
He's done

2339
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:36,896
Holyshit he's not even close to done

2340
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:39,968
He is so mad at Q

2341
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:45,600
You know I had the founders of cute at my house about two years ago I mean to you

2342
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,336
And

2343
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:13,248
Started out just as some guys having some fun that were authorized to engage show

2344
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:21,440
Us intelligence

2345
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:29,888
I'm just going to call him and ask him to come on it's on the song

2346
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:31,680
Yeah okay yes

2347
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:35,264
So Alex is here saying that the founder of Q on his

2348
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:41,664
He almost hired him reveal to anyone

2349
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:46,272
Alex has already claimed many times has fake intelligence whistleblowers act as part of

2350
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,808
Fatimid started Cuban.

2351
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:51,904
He's already solved this mystery according to the in-world reality

2352
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,184
Unless he's just trying to get

2353
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,744
Zack back on the show this doesn't make any sense

2354
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:56,512
Me too hard

2355
01:50:56,768 --> 01:51:00,608
This is not an open question I've already done this with Zach

2356
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:02,400
Of course but don't worry about that

2357
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:05,728
Woop woop exacticide I'm writing down people who could have been

2358
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,008
I'm I'm going to go with

2359
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,568
Rodger Stone

2360
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,384
Could be the only person that I think that Alex Wood

2361
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:15,456
If I can call him and get him on the ship

2362
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:19,552
But he's not going to actually call whomever fake

2363
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:21,344
The Q is now that's true

2364
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,624
So I think

2365
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,904
Who has the like

2366
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,440
I wouldn't be surprised if

2367
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,720
Steve pieczenik had the balls to

2368
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:27,744
Did you take that swing a bit

2369
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,048
You know Alex I started

2370
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,608
Soulmate

2371
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:36,960
Steve is one of those two guys

2372
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:44,128
Maybe it's time that we need to call inaara our friends over qanon anonymous

2373
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:47,200
Did they have an expertise in like who might be hated

2374
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:48,992
By qanon

2375
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:52,832
Who could possibly be the the people who started it right

2376
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:56,672
You know but then had it taken away three days

2377
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:59,232
The 3D

2378
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:01,792
Is very specific

2379
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:06,656
I don't have the kind of expertise that someone like Travis does we may need help

2380
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:08,192
You know why you don't have the

2381
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:15,872
Because Travis is cute that's what happened Travis went to Alex's house three days later to Worcester

2382
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:18,176
Stolen from him he started qanon anonymous

2383
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:23,808
Done I've solved it this Travis call it out this could be truthful it out Travis

2384
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:27,136
Baby we'll check in with them and see what happens

2385
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:29,952

2387
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:34,560
Alex knows who started qanon and

2388
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:37,888
Weird

2389
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,960
Gets job offer

2390
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:42,496
From him or something

2391
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,664
Who is wrong all the time now but work for those 3 days or something

2392
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:55,808
About to go off this week for 3 days

01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:01,696
The power go off in one town I can always go there

2394
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:04,256
No matter how many times I still plan

2395
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:07,072
Promoters going to come out and arrest everybody

2396
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:10,400
I started it

2397
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:13,472
Inside the White House on Air Force One

2398
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:22,944
What do you think about a tweet about you today

2399
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,272

2405
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,384
Why

2406
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:54,944
The very person.

2407
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,480
The devil

2408
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:58,784
Can't stand it

2409
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,600
I tip my hand a little bit early

2410
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:05,952
That I revealed that the person who created it now is attacks concert

2411
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,232
Play by Q

2412
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:12,608
Which is a clue to who it is and I don't f****** know who that I don't know cute excuse

2413
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:13,376
Just about everybody

2414
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:19,264
But anybody who's not to onboard with the quote Uncle plan

2415
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,544
Yeah I have to act

2416
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,872
It is so sad to

2417
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:25,664
Send to a man described his business

2418
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,224
This model angrily when somebody else is using

2419
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,320
Nothing that you say comes

2420
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:35,136
All of this stuff is a hoax perpetrated

2421
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:36,160
Pulpit

2422
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:42,816
Look at you

2423
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,096
Talking Mirror

2424
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:45,376
I think that's why he's mad

2425
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:49,472
That is because like they're just doing what I do and everyone liked is

2426
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,752
So into it they don't

2427
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:55,104
Respect me and I'm kicked off social media you have speculum

2428
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:58,944
But a dick

2429
01:54:59,200 --> 01:54:59,712
It is

2430
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:02,784
It is so much like the the older brother that

2431
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,552
Gets in trouble

2432
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:08,672
And what did he does stuff to he does stuff to why isn't he getting in trouble

2433
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:11,488
In my experience with the older brother that works

2434
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:17,376
Alex is not going to work

2435
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:20,704
Stickman Q lies

2436
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:22,240
Saul eyes

2437
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:23,776
Yeah but sometimes

2438
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:24,544
DJ clock

2439
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:29,920
I understand that it's not okay just information is sometimes necessary

2440
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:30,688
Exactly

2441
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,736
But you know what it turns out Alex's

2442
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:34,016
Not capable of that

2443
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,552
That's

2444
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:39,392
Physically incapable of lying

2445
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:40,672
He is just

2446
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:43,232
What naked balls walls

2447
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:45,536
We're on I mean it's just you know

2448
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,072
Cool swords artifact

2449
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:02,432
I see through fog

2450
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:05,248
Because I live in

2451
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:12,160
Sometimes I'll try to shelter TJ Clive for a counterintelligence

2452
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,952
What are you doing

2453
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:14,720
Nobody kurupt

2454
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:16,768

2455
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:19,072
Say things now

2456
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,864

2457
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,288
Filter or manipulate

2458
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:31,104

I can't I can't I can't

2460
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:34,688
Magic

2461
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:36,224
Alex thinking that he's on

2462
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:36,992
Honest about everything

2463
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,784
But whatever

2464
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:39,552
Proposed

2465
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,320
The news

Police force

2467
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:42,624

I feel like a king

2480
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:10,528
Feel like your fantasy is sort of out of The Phantom Tollbooth

2481
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:13,088
One of the Kingdom

2482
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:16,928
Alright okay

2483
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:19,232
The weather bu B

2484
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:23,072
I want have some bad words

2485
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,400
So Alex knows the secret of Q he knows

2486
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:27,680
He knows who's behind it

2487
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:28,704
He knows all this

2488
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,472
It's all good

2489
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:31,008
And

2490
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:36,384
In this clip Alex says something ends up saying something that I think is like shockingly

2491
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,920
Spiritually true

2492
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:38,688
What's so

2493
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:39,456
Stupid

2494
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:46,112
More than most people ever know

2495
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:49,696
Do you think Pentagon the CIA

2496
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,960
Almost everybody else couches what they're going to say

2497
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:05,312
People are scared

2498
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:10,176
Sting's and

2499
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:12,736
They think about think that's called preparing

2500
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:13,504
Yeah

2501
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,040
Work

2502
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:17,088
I mean I guess

2503
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:22,208
I was just saying that he's not afraid to not prepare

2504
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:25,024
I mean not to go even further

2505
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:28,096
That it you know I mean when

2506
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:31,936
I think I think of the the old that the adage

2507
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:35,776
Compassion cruelty

2508
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:37,312
Honesty without

2509
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,336
Compassion is cruelty

2510
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,664
Describing a lot of people

2511
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,968
Think about how this is going to make people feel

2512
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:46,016
And I'm a truth-teller I don't give a s***

2513
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:53,184
No you're a piece of s*** you're an a****** honesty

2514
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,976
Church was honesty without Grace

2515
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:56,000
Yeah

2516
01:58:57,024 --> 01:59:00,096
Cruelty absolutely

2517
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:04,448
On one level you're absolutely right that is manifesting

2518
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,520
Concrete level

2519
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:10,848
He's just trying to rationalize why he doesn't prepare

2520
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:16,992
I agree people come in and they think about what they're going to say now I just shoot from the hip cuz I'm not scared

2521
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:18,016
Like no you just

2522
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,296
Can't do work

2523
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,320
You can't

2524
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:24,672
If you did you'd have no excuse for why you're wrong all the time

2525
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,208
It's just nonsense

2526
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:29,024
Do you work if he wanted to be a

2527
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:30,304
Armor maybe he

2528
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,072
Could learn how to

2529
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:31,840
Hill

2530
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:33,632
I don't think he can do journalism

2531
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:37,728
Yeah sure every skateboard

2532
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:39,776
Manual labor

2533
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:43,360
Capable of the brain labor to just is unwilling

2534
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:44,128
Heidelberg

2535
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:47,456
You just unwilling I think maybe there was a time when he was

2536
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,040
I still think he's perfectly capable of it now we just

2537
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:54,624
Far more profitable to function the way he does

2538
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,648
Totally that this boy

2539
01:59:56,928 --> 02:00:00,512
So Alex talks more about how he knows the creators of cues about

2540
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:04,096
Two people we know that they're they hate what it's

2541
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:06,400
Become an are demonized

2542
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:08,192
Hillary by qanon

2543
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,472
And

2544
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:10,752
Is Realtors real trouble

2545
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,032
Two people that

2546
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,056
Created it

2547
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:17,920
Political operative one

2548
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,480
Zach

2549
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:26,112
Spanish

2550
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:28,928
Both of them

2551
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:39,680
Oh wow

2552
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:44,032
Imagine being the creator of it and watching it

2553
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:50,432
I feel like that is something Alex is very smelly

2554
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:55,296
Said right there eating a fan for you Alex

2555
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:01,184
Add stop

2556
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:04,768
I think if there's a lot of specifics there and

2557
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:08,864
We're not in a position to really know who who this is

2558
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:12,960
Hinting at but it's definitely him to get somebody that probably is very

2559
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:13,984
Well

2560
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:20,128
Determinable like if you weren't really into qanon I bet that you know almost exactly who Alex

2561
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,152
Probably talk

2562
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:21,920
I think it's

2563
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:22,944
Yeah

2564
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,480
I wish I had that kind of awareness

2565
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:26,272
But I don't have to call the boys

2566
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,808
So anyway

2567
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:29,600
F*** dude thing is that

2568
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,904
Trump doesn't like

2569
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:33,696
Right

2570
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,744
I could not

2571
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,792
Think of anything Trump cares less about

2572
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,072
He doesn't like

2573
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:41,120
I don't think he has an opinion about

2574
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:42,144
WhatsApp

2575
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:43,168
You love

2576
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:48,288
Enforce these operations

2577
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:55,968
Authorized to do it they were authorized to engage encounter operation

2578
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:56,736
Quickly

2579
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:59,040
3 days

2580
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:04,160
But people still go

2581
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:09,280
Looking for the magic moment that they're finally

2582
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:21,056
So and Alex's veritiv Q is real for 3 days and then it was co-opted and since then

2583
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:22,592
Trump is not supported

2584
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,384
Makes no sense

2585
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:28,480
As recently as March 8th trampas retweeting qanon related

2586
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,760
Content something is

2587
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:31,808
Really consistent habit of doing

2588
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:35,392
On January 2nd The Daily Beast reported on how in the

2589
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:39,232
The evening of December 27th 2019 Trump retweeted or quote

2590
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:41,280
Tweeted approximately 20 accounts

2591
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:42,560
Who promote qanon

2592
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:43,328
Conspiracies

2593
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:47,424
Trump invited qanon people to his social media Summit

2594
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:51,520
He invited Lionel to the White House and he's done basically everything he could

2595
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:54,592
Possibly do to amplify and encourage qanon followers

2596
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:56,896
Short of directly saying it

2597
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:57,664
True

2598
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:00,480
In terms of the things that drop is publicly signal

2599
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:03,296
He's giving away more tacit and direct support

2600
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:04,576
Do not then Alex

2601
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:07,392
And that's probably because Alex isn't useful

2602
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,160
Anymore

2603
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:09,696
If I were Alex I'd be pissed

2604
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:13,280
But I probably wouldn't have ever gotten into the stupid situation

2605
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:14,048
Ramekin

2606
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:14,816
Competing with Aiken

2607
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:16,864
Sweetly lunatic decentralized

2608
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:17,888
Conspiracy theory

2609
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:20,704
For the president's respect and attention

2610
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:24,288
That's a bad place to be even if you win that

2611
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:26,336
That's not a good time right now

2612
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:27,104
You know there's

2613
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:28,640
Just like

2614
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:32,992
There's no way to know there's no way for Alex to have known Trump

2615
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:34,784
Would just abandon people

2616
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,552
Play stop

2617
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:37,600
Yasser. Just no wait

2618
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:39,136
This is out of left

2619
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:43,488
It is not his catchphrase catchphrase

2620
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:44,768
This has been a

2621
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,048
Years-long

2622
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:49,376
Decades-long commitment to lying and f****** over peep

2623
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:50,656
No not at all

2624
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:52,704
You know what this feels like to me

2625
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:55,776
As I as we go through this instructor realizes a little more

2626
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:58,336
This feels a lot like

2627
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:02,688
Someone asking for a raise when they don't know if they're going to get

2628
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:06,528
You know like you should never go into your boss's office

2629
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:12,416
And ask for a raise if you're not confident enough that like they value you as an employee

2630
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,184
DM

2631
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:17,536
Do you know anybody who might have asked for a ring

2632
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,632
I was also fire

2633
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,400
Fired for asking

2634
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:25,472
Can you ask for raise for a co-worker of yours

2635
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:31,360
I was a little bit different

2636
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:37,504
For a union Ash 30 in my situation it was like you realize

2637
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,272
Is it like

2638
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:41,088
If you get into that position where if you don't think

2639
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:44,416
Like if you don't have a reasonable expectation that you have leverage

2640
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:45,952
To get that right

2641
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:47,488
You deserve

2642
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:49,280
If you ask for it

2643
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:50,816
And the answer is no

2644
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:52,096
Then you got to quit

2645
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:55,168
Or you got to accept it if you accept it

2646
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:57,728
You can ask again without them having

2647
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:58,496
That like

2648
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:00,544
Your sanity that's a no

2649
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:03,104
Cuz you're there but yeah there's that expectation

2650
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:06,432
You don't want to get yourself into that situation because

2651
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:07,456
The outcome

2652
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:10,016
Other than getting the raise

2653
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,064
Me and that you better be prepared

2654
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:14,368
And Alex

2655
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:17,184
Getting into a fight with Cuban on like this

2656
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:17,952
Which

2657
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:18,976
Is pointless

2658
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,536
Stupid number

2659
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:24,608
Situation where you're not going to

2660
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:25,632
To come out ahead

2661
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:27,936
Here cuz there is no coming out ahead

2662
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:29,728
You better be ready to quit

2663
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,776
Cuz you're going to end up looking like a dick

2664
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:37,408
It is it is very erotic than Alex

2665
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:42,784
For sure it's a running to me that Alex

2666
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:47,136
You don't have any organic side, he doesn't have the fake side cover

2667
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:49,696
Sorry I keep it

2668
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:51,232
I find interrupt

2669
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:52,000
Sing to be on except

2670
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:56,352
No it's a Ratatouille that for somebody who's

2671
02:05:56,864 --> 02:06:01,728
Professed ideology is almost entirely about decentralized conflict

2672
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:03,264
And the way that those

2673
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:06,080
Types of groups can resist

2674
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:09,920
Yeah leaderless resistance he has no concept of how to battle against

2675
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:11,456
A leaderless resistance

2676
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:14,016
He still thinks that there's a cute guy

2677
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,600
He still thinks that there's somebody

2678
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:19,136
To have a feud with

2679
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:22,720
Do you know what I mean hypothetically there is

2680
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:24,768
Cuz there's still someone posting

2681
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:25,536
Askew

2682
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:26,816
Really

2683
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:29,632
Still like a hypothetical

2684
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:30,656
Nothing but like

2685
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:37,056
The point at which were at now like that the reality of qanon is so insane

2686
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:37,824
Diverse

2687
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:38,848
That like

2688
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,664
You can't really take issue with like

2689
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:48,064
Cuz you could be like a you guys are a bunch of idiots who believe the j.f.k. jr. alive

2690
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:51,904
You still alive you got the wrong idea

2691
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:56,768
He's basically become libertarian

2692
02:06:57,024 --> 02:07:01,120
It's not real cute libertarianism

2693
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:03,424
Big EQ a bad name

2694
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:08,288
Start a fight with that end up like

2695
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:11,616
You're basically playing my God what if

2696
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:14,688
Qanon became its own political party and we got to watch the

2697
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:16,480
The primary qanon

2698
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:18,272
The primary debates of just

2699
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:20,320
Qanon people like we did with the Liberty

2700
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:21,856
During debates I want the

2701
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:22,624
Qanon

2702
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:25,952
I can't imagine anything being more wild than

2703
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:33,376
The most Libertarian debate driver's license

2704
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:43,872
You just saying that like hey I think it's some people may be old people who can't see maybe they shouldn't

2705
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:50,528
We want McAfee

2706
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,976
Who are off track a little bit how you can imagine how that

2707
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:01,024
Alex's just like

2708
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:01,792
Like this

2709
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:04,608
Losing gamble no matter what happened

2710
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:05,632
Also

2711
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:07,936
I don't believe him

2712
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:10,240
I don't believe the premise that

2713
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,008
He's

2714
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,544
Yeah absolutely

2715
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:18,944
But I feel like we haven't really been clear enough about that but I don't believe that he had the person who started

2716
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:22,784
He could have hired

2717
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:24,064
But anyway

2718
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:26,112
Tissue is the Q started

2719
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,160
Who is first 3 days

2720
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:29,440
As a really good

2721
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,512
Call up the guys

2722
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:33,792
Created

2723
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:39,680
Disability

2724
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:41,472
Wrong

2725
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:47,104
Like missed connections

2726
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:53,248
Club America

2727
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:00,928
And then

2728
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:02,208
When out of the globalist

2729
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:04,512
Tell you

2730
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:06,816
The Alex Jones the enemy

2731
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:08,352
Things like that

2732
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:09,632
Forget it

2733
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:11,936
It's just about how he doesn't like they don't like

2734
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:17,568
Here's the easiest way

2735
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:18,848
Here's the easiest way for me

2736
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,384
Sure if you did know

2737
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:22,432
Who actually created Q

2738
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:24,992
That name would be all over the

2739
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:27,296
While he's in a feud

2740
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:28,576
That's exactly what

2741
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:31,392
He would put the name out as soon as possible

2742
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,928
And try and start a few there

2743
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:33,952
Wow

2744
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:34,720
Maybe

2745
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:35,744
Baby

2746
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,840
I think I think that's the only way for it's the only way for him to

2747
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:42,656
Pruitt I cannot prove but like

2748
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:44,448
Win in this circumstance

2749
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,240
Have you been there

2750
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:47,520
Is 2

2751
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:48,544
Play that car

2752
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:52,896
That's an interesting Theory and we'll see how this plays out alright

2753
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:54,688
Alex

2754
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,736
I mean he ends up spending

2755
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:57,760
More than

2756
02:09:58,016 --> 02:09:58,784
Half of his'n

2757
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:03,904
Entire show complaining about Q

2758
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:06,208
That's kind of why I think it's an April Fools

2759
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:08,512
That's it

2760
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:10,816
It's a ridiculous amount of time he spends

2761
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:11,840
Play Rio by Kia

2762
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:13,376
To the point where he ends up going

2763
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:14,144
Nicole's

2764
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:15,424
And this caller that

2765
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,704
This first one did you get

2766
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:18,496
Kind of needs to reassure him that like

2767
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:21,056
Alex you were the real cute

2768
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:24,128
How old is if he take that definition therapy

2769
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:25,664
Patriot with two level

2770
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:29,760
Hey you're not far that is

2771
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:33,600
If anything you're the real q and you have been for 24 years

2772
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,392
Anonymous

2773
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:41,280
You're lucky said you need to take this over you're the one that's

2774
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:46,912
Okay

2775
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:49,728
I believe you want to retire

2776
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,336
Yeah no I mean he did

2777
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:55,104
Now this

2778
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:58,176
Bucket you need to destroy it

2779
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:59,456
Yeah that's true

2780
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,016
It's not it's not something

2781
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:03,040
That is

2782
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:07,648
Necessarily salvageable

2783
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:09,440
Well for you it's not something that's Co-op

2784
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:10,976
It has to be destroyed

2785
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:13,024
Wright Senior Spear and it hates

2786
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:18,912
It makes your a shell right maybe for Israel or maybe your intelligence or whatever

2787
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:22,496
You know you're something that is naked you're a patriot

2788
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:26,336
You know you have to destroy it you don't take that over now

2789
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:28,128
You can't I don't know

2790
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:28,896
It's too late

2791
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:35,808
I'm trying to think of a way for him I guess if he tried to reveal that he was the True Q but nobody

2792
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:37,088
Leave that

2793
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,624
That it's too late for that now

2794
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:41,952
Well I mean you already tried was that and don't cares

2795
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:44,000
It's probably going to pretend that didn't never happen

2796
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:44,768
But

2797
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:48,864
So we know that recently Alex put out a series of bumper stickers

2798
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:50,912
And one of them said I m q

2799
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:57,568
Go to infowars.com

2800
02:11:59,104 --> 02:11:59,872
And

2801
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,664
You talked about that a little bit here

2802
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:06,784
A imq

2803
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:07,552
Bored.com

2804
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:16,512
Is it exposed in hydroxychloroquine really great didn't want you to know and make about real stuff that's awesome

2805
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:19,328
Dungeons & Dragons

2806
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,888
Live action role play for everybody

2807
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:23,680
Kind of

2808
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:29,824
And the people that created it are Big Star Wars fans

2809
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:30,848
And they're real people

2810
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:34,944
Did you create it

2811
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:40,320
I like the idea that he sang this isn't live-action role-playing but

2812
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:45,440
I put up bumper stickers that said imq and if people went around it just used my narratives

2813
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:46,208
And apply them

2814
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:48,000
To this fictional character

2815
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:50,560
Richard kind of you live action role play

2816
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:53,888
That would be great and it's not live action role play

2817
02:12:55,424 --> 02:13:00,288
So you suggested that the only way this should play out is that Alex just says the name of the person

2818
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:01,056
If he knew it

2819
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:04,384
It turns out there's another way that you can

2820
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:05,408
Play this

2821
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:08,224
Especially if you're really just trying to get attention

2822
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:09,760
You know what

2823
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:11,296
I'll just expose it

2824
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:14,368
Deadline

2825
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:15,648
What are we doing

2826
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:23,072
Come out with it all or I'm going to expose the next Wednesday

2827
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:26,400
It's a homeless man with a chip in his arm

2828
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:27,168
Documents

2829
02:13:34,592 --> 02:13:37,152
What an apple pie released

2830
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:38,432
Obama ran

2831
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:41,760
Torture facilities inside China

2832
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:43,552
And that

2833
02:13:43,808 --> 02:13:44,832
Blackwater

2834
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:46,624
The time

2835
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,184
Who you hired services

2836
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:52,768
Secret information

2837
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:55,072
No one reported in

2838
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:58,144
Obama to prison for that

2839
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:20,672
This is the real world right here

2840
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:30,400
I think there was a five-second delay they

2841
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:36,800
No idea what story Alex is talking about about Obama using Blackwater to torture

2842
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:41,408
Cleveland China mostly because there is no story about this on infowars.com and I can find

2843
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:44,480
80 corroborating information anywhere

2844
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:49,600
Whoever assuming it's true why is Alex so into Erik prince who ran black

2845
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:53,440
Why does Alex brag about employing ex Blackwater security

2846
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:56,512
Everybody's got to work there were involved in clandestine torture sites

2847
02:14:56,768 --> 02:15:02,912
Shouldn't Alex be opposed to the people who are involved in that company blah blah blah who cares doesn't matter

2848
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:04,448
So you noticed that bleep

2849
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:07,776
And I went and found the video this here's what he actually

2850
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:11,616
I've heard of that

2851
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:13,664
This is the real world right here

2852
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:17,760
Iris my life doing this

2853
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:20,064
Breadcrumbs in horseshit

2854
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,368
This is a real world

2855
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:26,208
So eat the bread crumbs part is like a real

2856
02:15:26,464 --> 02:15:30,048
Specific you reference I think it's all just a big cuz he said horseshit

2857
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:32,864
The thing is like

2858
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:34,912
He can't

2859
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:35,680
Swear

2860
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,728
Radio feed

2861
02:15:37,984 --> 02:15:38,496
Right

2862
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:39,520
He can't do that

2863
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:40,288
Things like that

2864
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,848
That will cause a real problem

2865
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:44,896
And the fact that like

2866
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:46,688
It doesn't really matter

2867
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:47,968
Means he's not on that

2868
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:48,736
How many station

2869
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:53,856
I get the audio feeds to like pull these episodes from Genesis communication

2870
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:54,624
Network

2871
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:57,184
It is the fee that goes out on the radio

2872
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:00,512
Whatever there are things that are blurred like blind

2873
02:16:01,024 --> 02:16:01,536
Like this

2874
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:02,304
I check

2875
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:03,840
On his own

2876
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:04,864
A course

2877
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:07,424
Nothing like this every now and again but like

2878
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:12,800
There is also like the look on his face after he says wash it where it's like someone said in his ear

2879
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:13,824
Lights out dude

2880
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:16,128
Or something like that there is a look

2881
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:17,152
That is kind of like

2882
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:20,480
Cuz then he immediately jumps back

2883
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:22,784
Calls

2884
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:25,088
Go get office.

2885
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:28,928
So he goes to a call

2886
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:31,232
And this caller has a dumb Theory

2887
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:34,304
About why the Chinese would release this virus

2888
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,072
I like it

2889
02:16:36,608 --> 02:16:37,120
It's no secret

2890
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:38,144
The China does not

2891
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:39,424
President-trump

2892
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:40,960
I need to be president

2893
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:47,872
Successful way at

2894
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:48,896
Stopping

2895
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:51,200
From holding success

2896
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:52,992
O'Reilly's

2897
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:58,368
Mail-in ballots

2898
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:04,768
Mail-in ballots are fine in Most states of the country

2899
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:05,792
I don't

2900
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:09,120
Look if your theory is that this virus was released in order to

2901
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:10,912
Stop Trump's rallies man

2902
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:12,960
Dear gone man you are far gone

2903
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:18,592
I realize that we didn't even really take much of a moment to even talk about the fact that our

2904
02:17:18,848 --> 02:17:19,360
What's gave a week

2905
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:20,640
For the

2906
02:17:20,896 --> 02:17:25,504
I thought you were I thought you were your calendar

2907
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:26,528
Of course

2908
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:32,928
This is the homeless guy in the computer chip we're going to be listening to

2909
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:34,464
I guess

2910
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:39,328
We might be able to livestream it as a text

2911
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:46,496
This is my WrestleMania

2912
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:47,520
Alex

2913
02:17:47,776 --> 02:17:51,616
Next Wednesday this is this is Wimbledon the French

2914
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:52,896
Open and f******

2915
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,504
Things that aren't going to happen

2916
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:58,784
Wimbledon

2917
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,552
Maybe three things

2918
02:18:00,064 --> 02:18:06,208
The person who started qanon coming out and being like well Alex force my hand I must reveal myself that's not how

2919
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:09,536
Second thing that's not happening is Alex

2920
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:13,632
Having a big thing on next Wednesday show

2921
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:15,424
The reality and the truth

2922
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:18,752
About the first 3 days of cute and absolutely

2923
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:21,312
Good God that's so funny

2924
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:22,080
It's pretty amazing

2925
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:24,384
You're going to do it this

2926
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:28,224
I believe I believe what he says that he's finally going to take down Q

2927
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:29,504
And it's really nice of him

2928
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:30,272
To give you a week

2929
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:35,648
It's it's it's the exact same thing that you were you sore to touch down a bit earlier

2930
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:37,696
And that is the thing with Rogan

2931
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:39,488
And he even brings that up

2932
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:41,024
Cuz I gave Logan a chance

2933
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:43,328
Because you were trying to get

2934
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,888
A media stunt out of this

2935
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:49,216
The reason that you give that window as opposed to being like

2936
02:18:49,728 --> 02:18:52,544
F*** it here's the reality is because

2937
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:54,336
To get coverage from

2938
02:18:55,360 --> 02:19:01,248
I mean you want to get coverage from Media Matters you want to get covers coverage from rightwingwatch and when I get people tweeting about it

2939
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:02,528
You want to get people making

2940
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:03,552
Fun of the fact

2941
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:05,088
That you're doing this

2942
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:05,856
Organic

2943
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:07,136
Even if it's make

2944
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:08,160
In front of you it's still

2945
02:19:08,416 --> 02:19:11,744
Free Press people going to do it in such a desperate position right now

2946
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,816
I mean the position that we're in

2947
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:17,632
Because of the lives we live at this show

2948
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:18,912
I

2949
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:21,728
I've made peace with the fact that I'm very excite

2950
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:28,384
Mostly because I know it's going to be a duck

2951
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:32,480
It's going to be Geraldo opening that to Forever

2952
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:35,808
That says that's the perfect microcosm of Alex's

2953
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:36,576
Career

2954
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:38,880
We've got this big story coming up

2955
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:42,976
Alright hey we're on to the next thing nothing

2956
02:19:43,232 --> 02:19:46,048
The last example of that was the microchips

2957
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:48,864
In the people experiencing homelessness

2958
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:51,168
And that leads us nicely into this next

2959
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:51,936
Call

2960
02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:56,032
This caller asks about how we got how are we going to fight back

2961
02:19:56,544 --> 02:19:57,824
Against the microchipping

2962
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:00,128
Agenda

2963
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:03,200
Id2020

2964
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:06,528
You know with microchips and digital tattoos they want to put them in

2965
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:09,856
Is it anyway you can

2966
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:15,744
Thomas Jefferson was asked

2967
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:18,816
Virginia Commonwealth

2968
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:27,776
He said my dear fellow dear fellow

2969
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:29,312
Pacious

2970
02:20:29,568 --> 02:20:30,592
Repine

2971
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:33,664
Psychotic

2972
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:44,928
Make them feel good

2973
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:50,304
Dum dum dum dum

2974
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:56,704
He's editorializing on my court quite a bit and also that the Frederick Douglass quote

2975
02:20:56,960 --> 02:21:00,288
Because all the time we can't allow black

2976
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:02,080
I'm stolen

2977
02:21:02,336 --> 02:21:03,104
So now you

2978
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:05,152
Try to co-op my catchphrase

2979
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:05,920
Is there

2980
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:07,456
I didn't call out

2981
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:13,856
I'm changing my catchphrase

2982
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:14,624
I've danced

2983
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:15,392
Is 20

2984
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:16,672
Because I think

2985
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:19,744
Alex might give given me a better version

2986
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:23,584
We're now in the New World Order in the AI take over in the robot

2987
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:27,680
Clone world.

2988
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:34,336
Emerge

2989
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:38,176
Apologies

2990
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:42,016
Get rid of us to save the Earth

2991
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:45,856
Transmission

2992
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:50,464
Advanced knowledge

2993
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,744
Sheriff

2994
02:21:53,536 --> 02:21:56,096
It's the oldest trick in the book

2995
02:21:56,352 --> 02:21:57,888
Immortality

2996
02:21:58,144 --> 02:22:04,288
It's the oldest trick in the book how old is Troy Coronavirus

2997
02:22:06,848 --> 02:22:07,360
Jesus

2998
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:08,896
Alright

2999
02:22:09,152 --> 02:22:12,736
Alchemist Dan at the oldest trick in the book

3000
02:22:13,504 --> 02:22:14,528
The oldest trick in the book

3001
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:20,160
Book is like easy scam

3002
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:21,440
Selling something called

3003
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:24,000
A miracle cure Dan

3004
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:24,768
Wow

3005
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:26,048
There is that

3006
02:22:26,304 --> 02:22:30,656
Also I think Reed 2020 baby

3007
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:36,544
Maybe maybe better

3008
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:40,128
I like it I won't say a word

3009
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:42,688
It's up in the air I'm not sure how I'm going to go with it

3010
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:49,088
B I feel like Alex's I like to let him guide me over and over again

3011
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:52,672
Was prompted by my belief that Alex was going to

3012
02:22:58,816 --> 02:22:59,840
Which is evident

3013
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:01,376
Blister

3014
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:03,680
Putting something he did not do

3015
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:04,448
So

3016
02:23:04,704 --> 02:23:07,520
Hello

3017
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:09,568
I have the demons

3018
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:11,616
Got to kill you

3019
02:23:11,872 --> 02:23:13,408
Immortality which is the oldest

3020
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:16,480
But apparently it turns out

3021
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:18,272
Cuz we're wrinkled

3022
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:22,112
Cuz the demons don't need to just kill you or they

3023
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:23,904
You know the people who were working for the demon

3024
02:23:25,184 --> 02:23:25,696
They could kill

3025
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:27,232
Great

3026
02:23:29,536 --> 02:23:31,840
Get them all the way where they need to be

3027
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:35,424
There's another step they got to torture you first course

3028
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:41,824
Coming to kill you and your family today must kill you in a blood sacrifice

3029
02:23:48,224 --> 02:23:49,248
There's a lot of rules

3030
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:55,904
About how this have to go down

3031
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:56,672
Translate

3032
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:59,744
Actual process by which you take a soul

3033
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:01,024
I call that has to

3034
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:04,608
What happened in order for this immortality to be achieved

3035
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,400
Right but then you wind up in hell

3036
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:07,168
Anyways

3037
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:07,936
File

3038
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:09,728
So here's my biggest

3039
02:24:11,008 --> 02:24:11,776
Demons aren't real

3040
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:12,800
No

3041
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:13,824
That's easy

3042
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:17,664
Obviously there's a little pedestrian I apologize

3043
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,432
Las Vegas

3044
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:19,712
Is

3045
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:21,760
If These people aren't amore

3046
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:23,808
Then by definition

3047
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:26,112
That means that these people who have worked for

3048
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:27,392
Who are demons

3049
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:28,672
In the past have died

3050
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:31,488
So if you are working for the globalist

3051
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:32,256
Now

3052
02:24:32,512 --> 02:24:33,280
And you are where the

3053
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:35,072
People who have previously worked for the demon

3054
02:24:39,424 --> 02:24:42,496
Then you have to know that you are not going to

3055
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:43,520
Get immortality

3056
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:45,056
So why work for

3057
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:45,824
For the globe

3058
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:48,128
The problem with this

3059
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,176
Conspiracy living more than a life

3060
02:24:50,944 --> 02:24:53,504
Cuz you have all those examples of all the

3061
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:58,368
Rothschild's who have died

3062
02:24:58,624 --> 02:25:01,440
If you work for the glove us cuz you want immortality so

3063
02:25:01,696 --> 02:25:04,768
If you are now we're having I guess the way around it is

3064
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:08,608
They believe that their go get this immortality from the demon

3065
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:09,376
But it's all

3066
02:25:09,632 --> 02:25:10,144
Ally

3067
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,680
I was like what's been around

3068
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:16,800
I would like to say that that's an unreasonable response but knowing that we sees you

3069
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:17,824
Believe Alex Jones

3070
02:25:18,336 --> 02:25:21,408
I have to say that there would be enough people to believe that they would

3071
02:25:21,664 --> 02:25:22,688
Ghetto immortality regardless

3072
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:27,808
Given all this information that we have

3073
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:28,576
Access

3074
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:31,392
Very easy

3075
02:25:31,648 --> 02:25:32,160
B2

3076
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:35,488
You know I talked to a demon

3077
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,536
Then the demon be like hey

3078
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:38,304
I got

3079
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,328
Got 5 On It

3080
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:41,120
You know I got you

3081
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:42,144
I got you covered

3082
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:43,424
You could be like

3083
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:50,848
I don't believe you I don't think you're good for it. I think it'd be pretty easy at this point

3084
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:53,920
5

3085
02:25:54,176 --> 02:25:54,688
Can't do it

3086
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:56,480
You still holding five

3087
02:25:56,736 --> 02:25:58,528
Speaking about of people you shouldn't

3088
02:25:58,784 --> 02:25:59,296
AmTrust yes

3089
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:01,088
Francis Boyle

3090
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:03,136
Shows up here at the end of the episode

3091
02:26:03,392 --> 02:26:05,952
Cuz he has big breaking news right Sir Arthur Fry

3092
02:26:06,976 --> 02:26:08,256
Does not really have big breaking

3093
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:09,024
What is it

3094
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:10,304
He does really have much

3095
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:12,608
But they're talking about

3096
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:13,632
The

3097
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:19,008
Alex wants to start off a conversation asking about these various strains of

3098
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:20,288
Coronavirus

3099
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:22,080
Francis Boyle

3100
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:23,872
All of his information comes

3101
02:26:24,128 --> 02:26:26,176
From that Chapel Hill study from 2050

3102
02:26:26,944 --> 02:26:28,992
And he's so f****** out of line

3103
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:32,576
What about how it now

3104
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:36,928
Attack the testicles I mean they're learning more more

3105
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:44,864
I'll let you know I've read at least 5 or so right but if you go back and read that ritual you are

3106
02:26:46,912 --> 02:26:50,240
Wuhan

3107
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:01,504
So what

3108
02:27:02,272 --> 02:27:05,088
It has been weaponized

3109
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:10,208
Francis Boyle straight up making this up about the 2015 study from UNC Chapel Hill

3110
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:12,256
Title of that study is quote

3111
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:17,376
A sars-like cluster of circulating back coronavirus shows potential for human emerge

3112
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:24,032
You can easily find it on the website for the journal Nature medicine if you'd like to look at it yourself and Rita

3113
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:28,640
Boil is claiming that the study says that they admit they put HIV in the fire

3114
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:30,432
Pleat lie

3115
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:33,504
The only time HIV comes up at all in the text

3116
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:34,528
Is in this sense

3117
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:36,320
Pseudo type

3118
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:38,624
Experiments were similar to those used

3119
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:41,952
It's those using an HIV based pseudo-virus

3120
02:27:43,488 --> 02:27:49,120
This is a section about the methodology of the study where they describe how they use pseudo typing to create a pseudo-virus

3121
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:51,168
Which is to say that using exist

3122
02:27:51,424 --> 02:27:53,728
Backbone of a virus a new could affect human

3123
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:59,104
And then combined it with a circulating coronavirus to see if the viral material could infect humans

3124
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:01,152
If it was in a package that was known

3125
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:02,944
Humans were able to take in

3126
02:28:03,712 --> 02:28:05,760
The reference to HIV even has a footnote

3127
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:08,320
The boil could have followed if he was interested in under

3128
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:09,344
Understanding the study

3129
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:10,880
It goes to a 2014

3130
02:28:11,136 --> 02:28:16,000
Teen study titled quote reversion in advanced Ebola disease in non-human primates

3131
02:28:16,256 --> 02:28:16,768
With eczema

3132
02:28:17,536 --> 02:28:21,376
This is a study about if you both look it be reversed in monkeys with

3133
02:28:21,632 --> 02:28:22,400
The use of Z map

3134
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:25,472
A similarly pseudo typed combination of

3135
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:26,240
Antibiotics

3136
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:33,408
The 2015 Chapel Hill study in no way says they combined Hy-Vee into this coronavirus that's a complete fabrication

3137
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:35,712
Part of oil who should be stripped of his 10

3138
02:28:36,736 --> 02:28:38,272
This Behavior like

3139
02:28:38,528 --> 02:28:40,320
Really seriously reflect Horeb

3140
02:28:40,832 --> 02:28:42,112
On the University of Illinois

3141
02:28:42,368 --> 02:28:43,648
Who's still employees

3142
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:47,232
Francis Boyle

3143
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:52,864
Tenured man it's really hard to get rid of 10 years I'm pretty sure if you do this s*** it's not hard

3144
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:56,192
Darrell hamamoto that it's possible

3145
02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:04,384
So you're saying that if he was playing a pink guitar we'd be better off than if he's lying about coronavirus

3146
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:08,480
Memoto might have like agitated a lot more low-key

3147
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:10,528
Equally against

3148
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:15,136
Like I think he might have caused more trouble for the University

3149
02:29:15,392 --> 02:29:16,416
Yeah then like

3150
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:18,464
Francis Boyle doing is

3151
02:29:18,976 --> 02:29:20,000
F****** embarrassing

3152
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:22,048
Because he is an employee of the University

3153
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:24,608
But it doesn't necessarily cause as much

3154
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:26,656
The local tension Cher has

3155
02:29:26,912 --> 02:29:27,424
Whatever

3156
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:33,824
Darryl was up to calling for a an honorary degree from the University of Illinois

3157
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:37,152
For information leading to the loss

3158
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:38,688
Francis Boyle

3159
02:29:38,944 --> 02:29:41,248
I think that you're qualified to give out that

3160
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:43,296
Kyrie Freddy sure yeah

3161
02:29:43,552 --> 02:29:45,856
I didn't graduate from school myself butter

3162
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:49,184
Also this virus is not the same

3163
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:50,464
Is the current Coronavirus

3164
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,232
Cyrus the virus

3165
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:52,000
2015

3166
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:58,144
Study virus called shc014 Dash ma50

3167
02:29:58,656 --> 02:30:01,728
And if the current virus was similar to that one

3168
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:02,752
Painfully obvious

3169
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:06,592
Which is probably a good reason why no supervillain would do this

3170
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:10,432
Only imaginary evildoers dreamt up by Childish weirdos

3171
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:12,992
Whatever crap to plan this stupid

3172
02:30:14,016 --> 02:30:14,528
Which is

3173
02:30:16,576 --> 02:30:18,112
Yeah it's Sean Connery in the event

3174
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:22,464
So Francis Boyle he seems to believe

3175
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:23,744
That the United States

3176
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,304
Always knew that this was a Biomat

3177
02:30:27,072 --> 02:30:29,632
Of course they did and they get into that a little bit in Spokane

3178
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:30,912
Knox

3179
02:30:31,168 --> 02:30:33,728
Did Mario Kenyon RI believe

3180
02:30:34,496 --> 02:30:39,616
The National Security Agency and US military intelligence

3181
02:30:40,128 --> 02:30:40,896
Do right away

3182
02:30:41,408 --> 02:30:41,920
That

3183
02:30:42,176 --> 02:30:45,504
Offensive biological warfare agent

3184
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:47,808
I came out of that all mouhon

3185
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:50,368
Bsl-4

3186
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:52,160
Fauci do it right away

3187
02:30:52,672 --> 02:30:55,232
All he had to do was crawling up on his computer

3188
02:30:56,256 --> 02:30:59,840
To find that UNC contract

3189
02:31:00,608 --> 02:31:01,888
Because he funded

3190
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:08,544
98 his organization funded this along with NIH and FDA

3191
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:12,640
No problem

3192
02:31:15,968 --> 02:31:16,480
Alex

3193
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:17,504
That's over

3194
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:20,064
Dumb

3195
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:25,952
Poorly constructed poorly defended conspiracy that they're bitching

3196
02:31:26,976 --> 02:31:27,488
But

3197
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:28,768
I mean

3198
02:31:32,864 --> 02:31:35,680
It's not news though to this is this isn't like

3199
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:36,704
This isn't fresh

3200
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:39,008
Right right it's just that today

3201
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:40,288
There were reports

3202
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:42,080
Fauci had to ramp up his

3203
02:31:42,592 --> 02:31:43,360
Security sure

3204
02:31:43,616 --> 02:31:45,152
Because of threats from weirdos

3205
02:31:45,664 --> 02:31:46,432
Yeah I mean

3206
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:52,064
To be fair Francis boils be calling him a Nazi bio-weapon

3207
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:55,648
How to say we live in the world now where it's like

3208
02:31:55,904 --> 02:31:58,464
Look if fauci came out and he was like look

3209
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:01,280
I want all my critics to beef up bears

3210
02:32:01,536 --> 02:32:02,304
Security cuz I'm

3211
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,328
Coming for you

3212
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:04,096
That makes

3213
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:05,120
More sense to me

3214
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:08,704
That we're living in professional wrestling world

3215
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:09,728
Call out France

3216
02:32:09,984 --> 02:32:11,008
Boil

3217
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:11,776
Beefed-up you

3218
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:18,176
Security boil boil how about you and I deleting the rent have a celebrity box

3219
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:21,504
We live in what we have

3220
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:25,344
Incredibly celebrated expert epidemiology

3221
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,624
And we have Francis

3222
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:27,648
F****** Boyle

3223
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:29,184
You shouldn't even have teddy ready

3224
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:31,744
Greyhound is a weirdo

3225
02:32:32,256 --> 02:32:34,048
The thing is

3226
02:32:34,304 --> 02:32:34,816
They like

3227
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:37,120
I was really

3228
02:32:37,632 --> 02:32:38,400
Struggling

3229
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:40,448
At this point in the episode

3230
02:32:40,704 --> 02:32:46,592
Figure out why Francis Boyle is back on that is a good because there isn't new information he just keeps

3231
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:50,944
AccuWeather UNC Chapel Hill study another Cruise everything that it doesn't prove

3232
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:53,504
And I kind of realize that

3233
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,528
He's a prop

3234
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:55,552
Alex

3235
02:32:56,832 --> 02:32:58,368
Terrorism

3236
02:32:59,136 --> 02:33:00,928
He's on record as the author of that he's

3237
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:05,024
The whole nine yards so you want him inside her

3238
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:09,632
Bad system you've got it you're not some foggy thing on a 410 board

3239
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:14,752
This is almost like he's bringing them out to be like

3240
02:33:15,008 --> 02:33:17,568
This is what we got not like you're cute and all bulshit

3241
02:33:18,336 --> 02:33:20,896
It's it it really feels like he's

3242
02:33:21,152 --> 02:33:22,176
Look like

3243
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:24,992
The prop in this play that Alex is putting honorees

3244
02:33:25,248 --> 02:33:25,760
Mad about

3245
02:33:26,272 --> 02:33:29,088
Still mad about you or not

3246
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:32,416
Extension of Alex's anger Hakuna how long is boiled

3247
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:34,720
Not that long

3248
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:39,840
See this being like a five-minute interview and just being like hey

3249
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:42,656
We've got the guy who wrote The Thing

3250
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:43,424
Guys

3251
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,192
Q has a

3252
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:45,216
Brought you nothing

3253
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:46,752
And then you don't have to worry about

3254
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:50,336
Too long of course I'm sure

3255
02:33:50,592 --> 02:33:51,360
Loyalty

3256
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:54,944
They talked longer than 2 like the like

3257
02:33:55,456 --> 02:34:00,576
You'd you'd wanted to just be like a little smashed like a little

3258
02:34:00,832 --> 02:34:02,368
Yeah

3259
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:04,160
Feels like that

3260
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:06,464
Because none of the information is really new

3261
02:34:06,976 --> 02:34:07,744
And some of it

3262
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,024
F****** embarrassing

3263
02:34:10,048 --> 02:34:10,816
Like how

3264
02:34:12,608 --> 02:34:13,120
Boil

3265
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:14,144
And Alex

3266
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:16,960
Clearly understand the difference

3267
02:34:17,216 --> 02:34:18,240
Correlation

3268
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:20,800
And causation can't reveal that information

3269
02:34:21,312 --> 02:34:22,592
When you're discussing

3270
02:34:23,104 --> 02:34:25,920
The Chinese military's assertion

3271
02:34:26,176 --> 02:34:28,992
That maybe the United States military when they came over

3272
02:34:29,248 --> 02:34:30,016
For exercises

3273
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:31,808
Introduce the virus here

3274
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:33,600
They understand the

3275
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:35,904
NIH

3276
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:37,696
Now they've committed these crimes

3277
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:43,328
Another facing life in prison that's that's why they don't want the public to know the big No-No is that is man-made

3278
02:34:43,584 --> 02:34:45,888
The Chinese

3279
02:34:53,312 --> 02:34:56,128
Just for your viewers might have your viewers ask me about

3280
02:34:56,384 --> 02:34:59,200
US Army meet her over there and fed we discussing

3281
02:34:59,456 --> 02:35:00,736
Alex

3282
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:02,016
Correlation is not

3283
02:35:02,272 --> 02:35:02,784
Zacian

3284
02:35:03,808 --> 02:35:05,856
So far I have not seen a direct

3285
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:12,256
New York City

3286
02:35:17,632 --> 02:35:18,144
Interesting

3287
02:35:19,168 --> 02:35:20,192
This is so interesting

3288
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:20,960
Because

3289
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:22,240
No

3290
02:35:23,008 --> 02:35:25,824
These dudes are capable of this kind of thought if they want to

3291
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:30,688
If I were If I Were One if I were one of their

3292
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:32,992
Don't admit

3293
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:36,576
Anyway you like Rob do in a deposition

3294
02:35:36,832 --> 02:35:37,600
Pretend you have

3295
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:39,136
Have no idea what's going on

3296
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:44,000
There's this Chinese assertion that the US Army brought the virus over when they were

3297
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:48,608
Is there for an exercise Alex and Francis understand that the fact that the army people wear their dozen

3298
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:50,144
Prove that they started the Opera

3299
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:53,472
They realize it further proof is necessary because

3300
02:35:53,728 --> 02:35:54,240
Claim

3301
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:55,520
That they're opposed

3302
02:35:56,288 --> 02:35:58,080
Terms of Obama selling

3303
02:35:58,336 --> 02:35:59,616
China the virus

3304
02:35:59,872 --> 02:36:02,176
7 proof is weiwei f****** lower

3305
02:36:02,688 --> 02:36:07,296
It's weird how that works out these Dum Dums are capable of critical thinking when they want to be and look

3306
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:08,832
There's a pretty good example of

3307
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:09,856
Like this is

3308
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:11,392
Minutes later

3309
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:16,768
Engineer interview them just being like no correlation causation fuk it

3310
02:36:17,792 --> 02:36:19,840
Said years ago Lookout Bill Gates

3311
02:36:20,352 --> 02:36:24,192
They releasing they admitted

3312
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:25,472
Killing a bunch of people

3313
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:29,312
Messed up and kills people I mean obvious

3314
02:36:29,568 --> 02:36:30,592
Operation

3315
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:34,176
Certainly that.

3316
02:36:34,432 --> 02:36:35,968
Biowarfare

3317
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:37,248
Mosquitoes

3318
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:38,784
We coming out of

3319
02:36:40,064 --> 02:36:41,856
Fort Collins they special in u.s.

3320
02:36:42,112 --> 02:36:42,624
Labyrinth

3321
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:45,696
To be fair there's more than a

3322
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:48,512
Correlation causation problem with what they're putting

3323
02:36:48,768 --> 02:36:49,536
Unfortunate

3324
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:53,376
You see you see that they're capable of that kind of critical thought when it

3325
02:36:53,632 --> 02:36:54,400
Comes to like

3326
02:36:54,656 --> 02:36:55,168
Rebuffing

3327
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:56,704
Arguments

3328
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:58,496
But they're opposed to but when it's

3329
02:36:59,008 --> 02:37:00,544
Trying to sell a week

3330
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:01,568
F****** narrative

3331
02:37:01,824 --> 02:37:02,592
They're on board with

3332
02:37:03,104 --> 02:37:04,896
It doesn't matter there's no need for evidence

3333
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:05,920
It's all bulshit

3334
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:08,224
Yeah it is it is so much like

3335
02:37:08,992 --> 02:37:10,272
A very obvious

3336
02:37:10,784 --> 02:37:12,064
Asymmetrical Warfare game

3337
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:14,368
Being played against people who care about real

3338
02:37:15,648 --> 02:37:16,416
And they just don't

3339
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:18,720
So they get to they get to win

3340
02:37:18,976 --> 02:37:20,000
Because we're on their battle

3341
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:20,768
Field not ours

3342
02:37:21,536 --> 02:37:25,376
And we just pretend that we're not well I think that most people aren't

3343
02:37:25,632 --> 02:37:27,424
On their Battlefield we are

3344
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:29,984
A little baby got into

3345
02:37:30,496 --> 02:37:31,264
Dwell in this

3346
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:32,544
Ugly Siri

3347
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:35,872
I just mean in the far larger Outreach of right-wing

3348
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:37,664
Is that it is

3349
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:38,432
Never

3350
02:37:38,688 --> 02:37:41,760
Fully kind of comprehended by so many people that it is

3351
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:42,784
Your liege

3352
02:37:44,064 --> 02:37:45,344
You are not like

3353
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:48,160
When CNN has somebody on parenting

3354
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:48,928
Trump talking

3355
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:50,976
Climate denialism or whatever it is

3356
02:37:51,232 --> 02:37:52,768
You are not on equal footing

3357
02:37:53,024 --> 02:37:55,584
Doesn't matter if you're on single sure the matter of your on Fox

3358
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:56,352
Snooze

3359
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:57,376
They are going

3360
02:37:57,632 --> 02:37:58,400
To say Amy

3361
02:37:59,424 --> 02:37:59,936
Doesn't matter

3362
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:03,520
It doesn't matter and is you try and pretend the fact check

3363
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:04,288
King is important

3364
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:06,592
They are going to rape

3365
02:38:07,104 --> 02:38:07,872
How it is

3366
02:38:10,176 --> 02:38:10,688
You know

3367
02:38:14,528 --> 02:38:15,296
I think it we can all

3368
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:16,064
All agree

3369
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:18,112
That the evidence is overwhelming

3370
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:20,416
Bad sign about a bioweapon

3371
02:38:20,672 --> 02:38:21,952
From Barack Obama

3372
02:38:23,232 --> 02:38:26,304
You're a little bit after Francis is left

3373
02:38:27,584 --> 02:38:33,728
This is stupid

3374
02:38:33,984 --> 02:38:40,128
Economy has killed people it does

3375
02:38:40,384 --> 02:38:42,176
For not telling you the answer

3376
02:38:49,344 --> 02:38:51,136
We don't have these things

3377
02:38:55,744 --> 02:38:56,256
Thank

3378
02:38:56,512 --> 02:38:59,584
Americans are among children elderly people on the planet

3379
02:39:00,608 --> 02:39:03,424
The Democrats deep State attempt to suppress

3380
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:07,264
Fresh these facts especially with the approved drug for

3381
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,544
70 something years

3382
02:39:09,056 --> 02:39:10,080
Hydroxychloroquine

3383
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:24,672
Still feels like a sales pitch

3384
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:25,696
Search for the

3385
02:39:27,488 --> 02:39:28,000
I felt

3386
02:39:28,256 --> 02:39:29,024
Zink sales paper

3387
02:39:29,536 --> 02:39:34,144
Yeah it is has the same tenor in the same delivery that I was usually uses

3388
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:35,680
But it's just like

3389
02:39:36,192 --> 02:39:37,472
It's like he's learning

3390
02:39:37,984 --> 02:39:38,752
Yeah the boundary

3391
02:39:40,032 --> 02:39:42,848
I can't actually sell my product

3392
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:46,944
But I can do everything short of mention my product

3393
02:39:48,224 --> 02:39:48,736
I don't know if

3394
02:39:48,992 --> 02:39:49,504
Can

3395
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:51,808
Its internal be interesting to see if anyone cares

3396
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:53,856
I think would what fascinates me about

3397
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:55,904
One of the great joys

3398
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:57,440
We had early on in the podcast

3399
02:39:58,208 --> 02:40:01,536
You would play for me these things that I didn't know we're going to be at

3400
02:40:02,304 --> 02:40:04,096
Yeah and now what I'm enjoying

3401
02:40:04,352 --> 02:40:06,144
Is not knowing that there

3402
02:40:06,400 --> 02:40:06,912
Not going

3403
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:09,216
To be at pivot

3404
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:11,776
Yeah this is the this is the ad pivot that

3405
02:40:12,032 --> 02:40:13,312
Two years ago out of been like

3406
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:18,176
And now he's not doing it he's answering me

3407
02:40:19,968 --> 02:40:22,784
Yeah a little bit

3408
02:40:23,296 --> 02:40:26,880
Scorpio from our April Fool's episode

3409
02:40:28,672 --> 02:40:29,440
Which I mean

3410
02:40:30,976 --> 02:40:33,280
I wish this was all a joke but it's not

3411
02:40:34,048 --> 02:40:34,816
So we had this

3412
02:40:35,072 --> 02:40:35,584
Last clip

3413
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:38,656
Alex is earlier in the show said we're at war with China

3414
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:44,032
It turns out we're also at war with Saudi Arabia I didn't know about

3415
02:40:50,688 --> 02:40:53,760
Amor Amor amor

3416
02:40:55,808 --> 02:40:57,344
Production

3417
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:58,112
Production

3418
02:40:58,624 --> 02:41:01,184
Our oldest Ally in the world

3419
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:05,280
When I say

3420
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:13,472
It's possible you can cancel the election civil unrest

3421
02:41:13,984 --> 02:41:20,128
Did not catch you off-guard

3422
02:41:20,384 --> 02:41:22,944
Never know what it's going to come

3423
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:29,344
Almost exactly after you're talking about not being being able to see the activities, there's one

3424
02:41:31,648 --> 02:41:33,696
He snuck it in god dammit

3425
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:39,840
Anyway we come to the end of April Fool's Day episode and whatever the f*** they have

3426
02:41:40,096 --> 02:41:40,864
The stupid

3427
02:41:41,888 --> 02:41:44,192
Coronavirus rationalizations

3428
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:45,984
Incredibly

3429
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:47,776
Nonsensical rewriting of trump

3430
02:41:48,032 --> 02:41:48,544
Oh yeah

3431
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:49,312
Annie

3432
02:41:49,824 --> 02:41:50,848
F****** Cuban odd stuff

3433
02:41:51,104 --> 02:41:52,128
Is really where it's at

3434
02:41:52,384 --> 02:41:54,432
This is this is what I'm excited about

3435
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:56,736
I don't know

3436
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:59,808
That he was accused by doing the show sucks

3437
02:42:01,088 --> 02:42:02,112
I got really excited

3438
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:03,648
Like a month ago

3439
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:04,928
When Alex

3440
02:42:05,184 --> 02:42:08,256
It's for no reason decided he was going to start getting back into Seth rich

3441
02:42:08,512 --> 02:42:14,656
Yeah that was one day

3442
02:42:14,912 --> 02:42:17,216
Alex decided

3443
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:20,288
We're get back in

3444
02:42:20,544 --> 02:42:21,056
And then

3445
02:42:27,968 --> 02:42:30,016
Oh I know who you are restarted qanon

3446
02:42:30,528 --> 02:42:32,576
Of course I'm worried about that but I want it

3447
02:42:32,832 --> 02:42:33,856
To be like the next chapter

3448
02:42:34,368 --> 02:42:34,880
Because I

3449
02:42:35,136 --> 02:42:40,768
Definitely don't want to just talk about coronavirus lifetime

3450
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:41,792
Make about it

3451
02:42:42,048 --> 02:42:43,072
Interesting to talk of

3452
02:42:43,328 --> 02:42:43,840
About you

3453
02:42:44,096 --> 02:42:46,912
I also don't want to talk about all the same sort of

3454
02:42:47,168 --> 02:42:48,192
Arcade conspiracies

3455
02:42:48,448 --> 02:42:48,960
We talked about

3456
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:51,008
In past episodes I got to watch

3457
02:42:51,264 --> 02:42:53,056
Just keep retreating old territory

3458
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:55,360
Starting a feud

3459
02:42:55,616 --> 02:42:56,384
With a ghost

3460
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:57,152
Is

3461
02:42:57,408 --> 02:42:57,920
F******

3462
02:42:58,176 --> 02:42:59,456
Awesome yeah I like that

3463
02:42:59,712 --> 02:43:00,224
What is

3464
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:06,624
The kind of thing I want to see from Alex religious freedom angle on

3465
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:08,672
Pills all over again

3466
02:43:08,928 --> 02:43:09,696
Kenworth like that's the

3467
02:43:09,952 --> 02:43:12,512
Fun thing to do right and he's going to fail you

3468
02:43:13,024 --> 02:43:15,840
Well failed you

3469
02:43:16,096 --> 02:43:16,864
Everyday

3470
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:18,400
For three years

3471
02:43:18,656 --> 02:43:19,168
Standings

3472
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:19,936
1

3473
02:43:20,192 --> 02:43:20,960
I made clear

3474
02:43:21,216 --> 02:43:21,984
Discussion

3475
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:25,312
But I will never give up hope next time will be

3476
02:43:25,568 --> 02:43:28,640
The right time because otherwise it doesn't work

3477
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:32,992
He ends this episode still like

3478
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:33,760
Without

3479
02:43:34,016 --> 02:43:34,784
Negating

3480
02:43:35,296 --> 02:43:38,880
Ruining the whole idea that he's going to fight

3481
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:40,672
The other episodes

3482
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:41,952
That one

3483
02:43:42,208 --> 02:43:45,024
He blew it 5 minutes in it

3484
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:50,144
It still seems like a Live question when the show ended

3485
02:43:50,656 --> 02:43:51,680
So hopefully

3486
02:43:51,936 --> 02:43:53,216
Fingers crossed we got a chance

3487
02:43:53,472 --> 02:43:55,008
Turns into a falcon fight

3488
02:43:55,264 --> 02:43:56,288
And it gets so stupid

3489
02:43:56,544 --> 02:43:57,824
Alex yelling it

3490
02:43:58,336 --> 02:43:59,872
Nonexistent robot

3491
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:00,896
Twitter accounts

3492
02:44:01,152 --> 02:44:04,480
It turns into thing where they start f****** trolling him earlier

3493
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:05,248
God

3494
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:06,528
Can you imagine

3495
02:44:09,088 --> 02:44:11,648
Now I just want him to do a ghost

3496
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:13,184
I just wanted to fight

3497
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:15,232
Inna

3498
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:17,536
What do you like

3499
02:44:17,792 --> 02:44:18,304
West Coast

3500
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:19,584
I don't understand how you fight him

3501
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:20,864
See that's what Alex

3502
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:21,632
44

3503
02:44:21,888 --> 02:44:25,216
Busting ghost disease

3504
02:44:25,472 --> 02:44:26,752
Can bus go spell Marie

3505
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:27,520
Bosco's

3506
02:44:27,776 --> 02:44:28,800
But they didn't fight

3507
02:44:29,312 --> 02:44:30,848
You know they didn't get into the ring with

3508
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:33,408
Didn't really see what they were made

3509
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:35,456
Going up against ghost in a fair fight

3510
02:44:35,712 --> 02:44:39,552
I would like to see you Alec see if you could stop

3511
02:44:39,808 --> 02:44:40,320
Could do it

3512
02:44:40,576 --> 02:44:41,344
We'll see

3513
02:44:42,624 --> 02:44:44,928
I guess we'll find out what happens with this

3514
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:45,952
Amman

3515
02:44:46,976 --> 02:44:48,256
Next Friday's episode

3516
02:44:48,768 --> 02:44:50,304
Will cover his Wednesday episode

3517
02:44:51,584 --> 02:44:52,096
Going to be a mess

3518
02:44:52,608 --> 02:44:53,120
Disappointment

3519
02:44:53,632 --> 02:44:55,680
It just did this is like

3520
02:44:55,936 --> 02:44:58,240
Christmas for me

3521
02:44:58,496 --> 02:45:00,800
I want to speed up talking

3522
02:45:01,056 --> 02:45:01,824
I'm excited

3523
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:04,128
The problem is I am excited

3524
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:08,736
Even though I know it's going to be a disappointment

3525
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:15,392
I love The Pretty Reckless

3526
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:20,000
Really great if he pulled a computer chip out of a homeless man's arm

3527
02:45:21,024 --> 02:45:22,560
She does

3528
02:45:28,192 --> 02:45:30,240
I will retire I pray

3529
02:45:30,496 --> 02:45:36,384
I will retire but I will definitely give it up to my smelly pirate friend Alex Jones

3530
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:37,664
So we'll be back

3531
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:39,712
On Monday boo and we'll see what happens

3532
02:45:40,224 --> 02:45:41,248
With his show

3533
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:45,344
Where you at it's okay

3534
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:46,112
It's okay

3535
02:45:46,368 --> 02:45:52,512
Knocking at the window like Jiminy Cricket website

3536
02:45:52,768 --> 02:45:56,608
Girls on Twitter

3537
02:45:56,864 --> 02:46:00,448

3540
02:46:10,943 --> 02:46:13,247
Depeche Mode and I thought someone with red eyes but I wasn't

3541
02:46:13,503 --> 02:46:16,063
Scared

3542
02:46:18,111 --> 02:46:21,695
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
