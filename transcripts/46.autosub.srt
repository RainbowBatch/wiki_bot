00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,408
Of mr. Jones

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,456
If you're nasty

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,016
That was the reverse of Janet Jackson

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
That was very much

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,624
Mr Jatt

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
Sorry

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,696
There is a twist

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,024
There Is No Nonsense

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,424
Neither of us that we don't know what they know

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,496
F****** getting rx11

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,032
It's intro is

14
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,104
Wonder Woman

15
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,176
Getting out

16
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,248
A little more

17
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:58,880
I don't know everything about my friend I can tell you everything about it

18
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,280
And that is the rub we're going to be having a really fun episode that

19
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,352
Take us to

20
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,448
We're drinking a little wine by the name of the

21
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
Petition

22
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,752
Because this will be the beginning

23
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
Very important Expedition

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,736
We may very well uncover something that will get us killed

25
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,784
Okay

26
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:32,416
For you I would like to play out of context drop

27
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,488
From an episode 2015

28
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
But very much worth it

29
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,192
A peacock

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,288
Screech

31
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:57,760
I'll come in and check them out

32
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
Butter

33
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
Amazing

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,264
Powerline

35
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,360
Somebody

36
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
Rabbit

Apartment complex

38
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
Society

39
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,232
Deathstalker

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
He's laughing at the fact that these owls just murdered his neighbors peacocks in the middle of the night

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
But I'll murder that

42
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,928
Lamps

43
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,792
Congratulations on becoming a

44
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
Donated on the time-travel level

45
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,656
Fans will be doing the special episode

46
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
Time-traveling specifications

47
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Welcome to the fold

48
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
Going on my own time travel

49
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,480
Yes

50
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
I have

51
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
Undertaken

52
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
Something of

53
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
Investigation

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
This investigation is ongoing

55
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
But I'm currently ready to share the beginning of it and tell the listeners if this is Hillary's

56
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Emails all over

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
It's not

58
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,568
Decided at some point when I found an archive of old episodes

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
I decided that I wanted to

60
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,432
Figure out exactly where Alex Jones

61
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
That was something that is

62
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
Important

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
Consequence to me

64
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Because I'm afraid

65
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
It's going to happen

66
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
Batumi

67
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
Five-year-old like

68
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,047
Sell-by date is that what it's like that episode of lost where

69
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
Adjustment has to find his constant

70
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,679
I have to find Alex Jones far enough in the past where he was saying

71
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
Right before you get to that one

72
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:33,407
The signs will be up to meet

73
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,711
Kill you I spell 42

74
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
That's really the only option

75
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,111
I will cranberries

76
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,255
I have a lot of experience with Alex from the past

77
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
For entertainment

78
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
The same person

79
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
In 2017

80
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,447
So I wanted to know what the fuc

81
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
So I've gone back

82
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
You still

83
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
A bigot

84
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
An idiot

85
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
The Trump campaign has changed

86
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,295
Yeah that's what we speculated from

87
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
Have

88
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,671
Isolated a start date of my investigation

89
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
Doojoon

90
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
Pink 2015

91
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
Trump

92
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Descended that escalator

93
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
And Analysis canvas

94
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Candidacy for president

95
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,959
I am exploring

96
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Kill Baby Hitler

97
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,871
Not

98
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
That is where I am beginning my investigation

99
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,735
And I can say with absolute certainty

100
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
That Alex Jones is Not 2017 Alex Jones

101
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
On June

102
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Okay

103
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
No knowledge of Donald Trump

104
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
2nei

105
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
External Observer

106
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
If you listen to the show he doesn't bring him up one

107
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
He announces his candidacy

108
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:01,471
The 17th

109
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Start vet tech

110
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:11,711
He doesn't half hour interview with a lady who are the city of Visalia California tool.

111
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
But she couldn't keep goats in her house

112
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,599
He did a half-hour softener like them

113
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Then like

114
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,719
Communicating with each other on a farm base level just like

115
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:33,215
I'll pick my trained owls on them and guess what these are

116
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
For fun

117
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,431
Yes that was an offshoot of that conversation

118
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
21 s***

119
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
But that is also has a guest

120
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,071
She speculates that gold is going to be selling at $50,000 an ounce

121
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Shortly

122
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
Shortly shortly pretty big jump

123
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,239
$9,000 an oz

124
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,567
I can see it I'll tell you what it never happened

125
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
Wildest day in history since 2015 the highest gold has

126
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Has ever been is 30

127
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
So they

128
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
Really shot that Mark

129
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,439
It didn't destroy Global Currency

130
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,535
Like the entire world the entire world's economy would just

131
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,863
Everything would be kind of fun though

132
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
Could you destroy a weird way you have any gold

133
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
Worthless because it

134
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
Sports

135
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,503
You can't go to it's like going to

136
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
Corner store in

137
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Trying to break up

138
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:58,719
Whatever you have is only worth what someone is able or willing to give you for it

139
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:03,327
Back in 2015

140
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
Forever

141
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,911
Has been distributed by gcvm Genesis

142
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
Communications Network

143
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,263
Which is a company that's owned by a guy named Ted Anderson

144
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Midas resources

145
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
A gold grill

146
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:20,479
Gotcha

147
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,599
And then this agenda 21 years with the goat lady

148
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,159
And I'll also story about a guy

149
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Who lived

150
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,231
I believe Huntsville Alabama

151
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,863
He had a trailer that he set up on the outside of town but still within city limits

152
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
So he's the hero

153
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
No

154
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Nope no Heroes

155
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,775
You just wants to live off the grid

156
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
He's got solar panel

157
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
You claim that everything's cool

158
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
I am cities like you have to have

159
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Your home up to

160
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
The code

161
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
You don't have

162
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Consistent water

163
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,319
We don't know if you have like winter proof this house

164
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
So you just got to move outside Cityline

165
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,463
You can't live within the city especially if you have kids

166
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
If you don't have a home that's up to code

167
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
And he was like

168
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
Not being depressed

169
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:13,471
Alex's home

170
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
That's one day after Donald Trump announce

171
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
Unfortunately

172
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
On the night of the seven

173
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
Something very terrible

174
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
And that was the shootout

175
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Killed by a p

176
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
No

177
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,903
Shooting at the Charleston

178
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
F***

179
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,487
The Dylan roof

180
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,791
Went in and shot up

181
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,215
I was at the Emanuel African Methodist I don't want this to be an entire episode of

182
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,615
It's not going to be entirely that because I think there's interesting angles week

183
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
Can take to approach Alex's version of

184
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
And we're going to have to

185
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
Warren

186
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,119
I promise you this isn't a setup where I was like you to come over

187
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
You talk about this

188
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
Let's just get it out of the way up top

189
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
Yes horrifying event

190
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Terrible

191
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Doesn't really need to be sad

192
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,735
Everyone kind of knows where we

193
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
More than any other

194
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,111
Crystallizes the state of America

195
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
In the 20s

196
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
Really does

197
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,487
Because every thought that

198
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
People had a

199
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
That's racism

200
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
Every single moment

201
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Situation

202
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Is just

203
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
All of endemic

204
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Racism

205
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
In one

206
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,919
Cuckolding fears

207
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
People are taking over fears of a loose cigarette without being murdered by the cops if you're black

208
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
But if you murder people

209
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
Black people in a church

210
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
The cops will take you out to

211
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
F****** McGee

212
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
Certainly

213
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Beyond

214
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
F****** the pale

215
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
And you can

216
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
But here's the good news

217
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Good

218
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
I know that this is going to be difficult for you

219
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Especially Yours

220
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
Yes

221
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Similar field

222
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,815
Don't get me wrong as much as you do

223
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
I'm yelling on the info

224
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
But

225
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
I think this is an important document

226
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
And a very important piece of my investigation

227
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
How Alex went wrong

228
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Because

229
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
There is

230
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
An interview with a guy

231
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
At the end of this

232
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
That sort of I think is foundational

233
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
Election 26

234
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Teen Behavior

235
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Yeah

236
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,255
Episode

237
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
Very perfectly depicts

238
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
How Alec

239
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
Text Jones goes from ambivalence

240
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
True false flag

241
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
And it's very interesting

242
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,519
False flag

243
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,359
Sentinel thinking that the shooting was a false flag

244
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
Oh

245
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
So I'm going to lay it out

246
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
Experience

247
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Is

248
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
Episode

249
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
Iowa can't say one way or the other

250
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Because he knows

251
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,207
How racially-charged it would be

252
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
For him to

253
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,559
Yeah so he's like I don't know

254
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
I can't say

255
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
In the past

256
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
We know the operation gladio exist

257
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
August

258
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,055
He's just doing that likes putting his toe in the water

259
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Dababy

260
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Until

261
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,943
He has an interview at the end of the episode

262
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
With

263
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Preacher

264
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
A reverend Childress

265
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
Comes on

266
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
And basically just says

267
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Come on

268
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,695
Black preacher has said that Alex's

269
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Just freed up

270
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,559
Then why bring the narrative

271
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
He got

272
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,311
That's Earth no that's what he thinks he got from that

273
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
That gives him

274
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,687
Covering of his ass

275
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,991
It's the same as like I have black friends

276
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
Am I understood

277
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,695
I like I understand how kind of

278
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
Maybe races it is for me to even say

279
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071
Suggest that's what's going on

280
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
No

281
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
Going over the course of the episode

282
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,215
Feels very clear that that's what's going on

283
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Before Childress

284
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
The co-host with him once again

285
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,199
Because

286
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,271
Porter beer

287
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
Jakari Jackson says almost nothing

288
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
Ratso

289
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,719
Secondary element of my investigation is why

290
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
Jakari Jackson

291
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,583
I think there's one

292
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
There's a

293
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
There's just

294
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
So much a man can

295
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
Alex Jones makes me sick

296
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335
Silently interviews this picture

297
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
I don't know if

298
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
It's a little messed up

299
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,807
The first clip is how we start the episode

300
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,695
Deteriorates really quickly and then Alex

301
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
Introduces what

302
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
Is going to be his sword of driving narrative

303
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
About why

304
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,375
The shooting isn't the biggest deal in the world

305
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
And it's

306
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
Pretty it's in Freeport

307
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
I'm sorry

308
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
Charleston on the East Coast

309
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
Nail looking young man

310
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,815
Boston to church last night

311
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
Airport tower

312
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Before

313
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
Shooting and killing execution-style

314
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
On a

315
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
Racial attack

316
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,175
And this is one of these events

317
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,319
Stop

318
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
Sarcastic

319
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
Dylann roof

320
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Retire

321
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
And patches

322
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:26,623
Medical school

323
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
Racist

324
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,447
Death loving scum

325
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
In my opinion

326
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
Fallout 4

327
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,967
Within a minute of starting his show I

328
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
He said he could have just stopped

329
00:16:54,271 --> 00:17:00,415
With a fairly tasteful this guy is a crazy person that is awful it's a racial crime

330
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,303
Both died within a minute of just talkin he's like

331
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,423
But the bigger deal

332
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
I mean that's what sparked race

333
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Places that get rid of all this public racism and they go straight for the pre-race

334
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,039
Free racism that's really what that

335
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
Sure

336
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
Abortion rates

337
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,695
Are kind of interesting to look at minorities

338
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
Abortion rates

339
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,863
But populations have been dropping pretty consist

340
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
4 years

341
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,727
The reason that most experts who looked at the numbers game

342
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
Money access to healthcare contraception

343
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,223
What story is

344
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:00,831
It is not that people want to kill black children and so they

345
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Support

346
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
Abortion

347
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,023
Bulshit

348
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
Million times a day

349
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Shut the fuk up

350
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Then think for one second

351
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,751
What are you care more about

352
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,079
That these babies are born or that anybody can

353
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
F****** feet

354
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,943
And the answer to those anti-abortion people is always

355
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
Worth caring about

356
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Atkins

357
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
F****** monster

358
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,951
Happily willing to watch hundreds of thousands of children starve

359
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
Especially the United States where we have

360
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Hundreds of thousands

361
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,839
Children starving right now or going hungry

362
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
But no

363
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,167
It's f****** anti-abortionist

364
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,823
Need to f****** make sure that we get more and more goddamn babies in there and if you don't want that if

365
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
If you want abortion

366
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
Legalize than your f****** races

367
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,223
Because 50% of all black babies

368
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
I've been up for Sinead it or whatever the f*** they want to lie about

369
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:13,023
Babies are f****** aboard it's up to 51 on this episode

370
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,119
Well then

371
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:22,751
I don't know I don't know

372
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,311
If you take reality out of the equation

373
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,615
It's actually really good

374
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Because it would be in

375
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,735
Wrestle with the idea that this was

376
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
A white supremacist

377
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,831
Who celebrated apartheid Africa South Africa

378
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,135
Who celebrated

379
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,695
Express purpose of wanting to trigger

380
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,743
Like it would be very difficult

381
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
So his first volley is

382
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
9 people are dead

383
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
51%

384
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
A black children are aborted

385
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:57,567
What's the who's going in here for the greater good argument is

386
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,127
Look a lot of people have

387
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Ben

388
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Brain control

389
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
2

390
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
Commit crimes and he lifts off like

391
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
The Unabomber

392
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Timothy McVeigh

393
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,391
These these folks noted

394
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,927
Right wing

395
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:19,327
Racist murderer guy who wanted to start a race war specifically

396
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
Taxes were an act of War

397
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:28,543
And that flies by the government

398
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
They were controlling him

399
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Through that

400
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:43,135
That makes a little bit of research into that night did find an article written by a lady

401
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
Email address

402
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
I don't know if she actually taught you

403
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
UCLA or was

404
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,423
Hit a scholarly connection

405
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,519
Article

406
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
She is a

407
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,919
Incredibly active member of UFO conspiracy

408
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
Communities

409
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
Part and parcel with that well she wasn't

410
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,831
Until she wrote that article

411
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
To make sure that you would never believe the truth

412
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Right

413
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,304
Like the Unabomber is kind of a really really smart

414
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,680
Virginia's level Alex Jones

415
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,776
Would get rid of all of the racism stuff and be like

416
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Listen

417
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,944
It's actually all of society it's not a small group of it we all need to get out of here

418
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,320
And find out because they're stealing our peacock

419
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Yeah yeah

420
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:49,440
Imagine if Ted Kaczynski had to fill 4 hours a day

421
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,024
Like I know that manifestos Wong

422
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
Struggling

423
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
18000

424
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:08,640
That's as many emails does Hillary left come on now

425
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:15,296
Alex is struggling at this point to find the foothold of the what the narrative is going to be

426
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
Guard a little bit

427
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
He does know it ready

428
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:24,512
He doesn't know that coming out immediately and saying it's fake will open him up Jackie

429
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
So you can't do that

430
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Here is how he

431
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Sort of

432
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,656
Ambivalently talks about this post

433
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
Already knows

434
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
He also knows

435
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
I think he does know from

436
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,664
The jump that the narrative has to be

437
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
Cotton candy

438
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
Like they're going to take our guns

439
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,296
Doesn't know how to get there

440
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,624
And so he's struggling throughout the course of the episode

441
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
The ACT

442
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Today

443
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,184
Essentially

444
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
But its fake

445
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,024
In order for it to be like this is a plan to take our guns

446
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
But he can't do that

447
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,120
Like I said because it opens him up to

448
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
Way too much

449
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
Very justifiable

450
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
Abrasive

451
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
So we get into the next

452
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
Is it the first time

453
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
Volkswagen

454
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
Comes up

455
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:17,248
Well because

456
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,320
Operation Northwoods

457
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,232
As a pretext for war

458
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
Because

459
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
Operation

460
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
I don't think that's what this is

461
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,808
But we seen other demons

462
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Target

463
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:59,232
All lives matter

464
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,048
Fort Worth

465
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,360
And then it was under control

466
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,408
Public Kitchen

467
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,928
This is

468
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
And I did

469
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,984
Brooke

470
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,312
He on September 15th 1990

471
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,896
Kilz to post

472
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
See you at the pole rally

473
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,504
Featuring concert by the Christian rock

474
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,296
For committing suicide himself

475
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,624
Occurred at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth

476
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
In 1999

477
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,792
Is deep stuff about his neighbors saying that

478
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
He was dragged out by

479
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
Completely on confirmable

480
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
But we can confirm

481
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
His motivation

482
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
That he hated that

483
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
Oh

484
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
It's crime

485
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,712
Where he went in

486
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,272
Yeah he would have really specific

487
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:30,368
Well he was a member of a group

488
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,952
Private investigator just came out in

489
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,024
The most intriguing

490
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
Houston writer and private investigator John Craig

491
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,936
Interviewed Ashbrook in the presence of several Klu Klux Klan members

492
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
In Spring of 1997

493
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
The co-writer of the book on whites

494
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,592
Supremacist Craig's is membership in

495
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,408
Hallucinate

496
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,200
Really racist Boomin

497
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,504
The killing of minorities in Jews

498
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,600
Buford Furrow who allegedly shot up a Jewish Day Care Center in Los Angeles

499
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
In August is also believed to be a Phineas

500
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,976
He is a member of a group called The Phineas priest

501
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:11,072
They're also part of an offshoot of the group called Christian identity

502
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:15,168
They are group that are terrorists

503
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,472
It is a Christian

504
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:21,312
Christian beliefs were primarily developed

505
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,152
And promoted by two authors who regarded Europeans as the chosen people and Jews is

506
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
Accursed offspring of Cain

507
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:35,648
The juice yeah it's true they they also have a belief that

508
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:39,232
Version of Christianity

509
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
Because of their acceptance

510
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
Because

511
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,352
They don't

512
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
Nationalist

513
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,448
Supremacist ideal

514
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
Unitarians

515
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,824
Be loved like a guy

516
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
Who is f****** nuts

517
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
Just deciding like

518
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,736
At that f****** bapt

519
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
What is church

520
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
Didn't get my change right at

521
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,600
Grocery stores

522
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,928
They don't know

523
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:15,072
I think I think the more reasonable argument is that unitarians are too far gone they're not even Christian

524
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
These Baptist need to be Got Back

525
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,680
Can lying and maybe

526
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,728
Spell realized

527
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,752
And come back

528
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,544
Something like that

529
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848
Crazy hats

530
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
It's very difficult

531
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,736
There was a guy named

532
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
Jeremiah

533
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,368
Who survived the shooting year old for football

534
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,672
The conversation

535
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,720
He had during the shooting

536
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
And is a quote from him

537
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,328
I don't know why but I just sat there looking at him it came towards me

538
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,168
When you got within about one of his guns at me and just glared

539
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,216
I told him you don't have to be doing

540
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
He told me to shut the hell up

541
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
Then he asked me what my religion was and I told him I was a Christian

542
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
A Baptist

543
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
He said that sucks

544
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
And that it was a stupid religion

545
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
Replies no sir it doesn't

546
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,320
It's a wonderful thing God put me on this Earth for a reason

547
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Then I'm certain of that

548
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,440
Ashbrook fired several rounds of this religion is b*******

549
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Then he sat down

550
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
Said f*** off and shot him

551
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
Hey I use crazy person

552
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:30,080
Investigators after the fact when they were virtually destroyed the interior of his house

553
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,384
The walls of crowbars

554
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
The toilet was

555
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,224
Concrete in the fruit trees growing in the backyard had been poisoned

556
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,808
He's just a nut he was a completely crazy person

557
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,160
Organizations

558
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,952
Like these Phineas priest

559
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
Christian identity

560
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
Relationship

561
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,840
That was not elected was just about the after

562
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Like it wasn't

563
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,912
Well I mean it was

564
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,496
He was going to most likely

565
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Loaded gun

566
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
Like it wasn't

567
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
It wasn't he was

568
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
Specifically going out

569
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
After Baptist

570
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,480
I mean I know he was

571
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
He's a f****** lunatic

572
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
Who was

573
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Accepted

574
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
So this dude is crazy

575
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,976
Probably ran to the gills with p

576
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
PTSD

577
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
Meet up with

578
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
Ukkk guys who

579
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
You support everything he believes

580
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,632
Keeps getting kind of

581
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
Promoted into these

582
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,496
Cooler and cooler like little Inner Circle

583
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:36,896
And basically primum with all of this b******* just like hey it could have been anything

584
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,992
You could have been like the real problem is

585
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,784
It's f******

586
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
No pic

587
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,720
Disenchanted disenfranchised and they gradually lead them down the path

588
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
It's the same with cold

589
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:57,120
You know you don't know the end until you're too far into think about it

590
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,424
You getting indoctrinated into these hate group

591
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,240
And you maybe don't realize or hate group until

592
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,288
I'm already in

593
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:08,384
It's Alex

594
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
It's the same f****** thing

595
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
Yeah

596
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,504
He was a suicide bomber

597
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Yeah just because he

598
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
Had a gun

599
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
Instead of a bomb doesn't

600
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
Any less of a

601
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
They terrorists

602
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,184
Yeah he killed seven people four of which were

603
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
The point

604
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
He went to a white church

605
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,096
Super irrelevant mischief

606
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
So we get into the next

607
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
To confront

608
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,152
The fact that this whole goddamn

609
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:46,784
Fox Edward never going to be rid of it not the whole country but a lot of it

610
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Lot of it

611
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:52,928
Every part of the country

612
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
The internet

613
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
But

614
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,304
Actually kind of fun

615
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,608
Because Alex in his rambling

616
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,936
Trying to make sure everyone knows that he doesn't like dylann roof

617
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,496
Accidentally supports gun control

618
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,568
Douglas Mexico

619
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,896
WordGirl

620
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,576
That is true I do

621
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
But that's just common sense

622
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,048
So there

623
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:36,448
Now it's now extrapolate that is a parenting technique to AC

624
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:41,312
Or a better word

625
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,896
If you don't like mentally ill people having guns

626
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:49,504
This is where we have to get into where Alex Jones

627
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,808
Is really smart as a propaganda

628
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Because

629
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
His whole thing

630
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,672
Is that they want to take our guns

631
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,976
When the reality is

632
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
The people who are into

633
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,816
Interested in gun control your gun

634
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
You can have your gun

635
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,400
But we want to make it more Reggie

636
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
We want to make it safer

637
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,520
We want to make a world where it's harder to get a gun

638
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,568
Because people like this assholes

639
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
And

640
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,408
You know what

641
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,224
It doesn't matter if it's hard on or not

642
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,040
I want to live in a world where fewer people get shot

643
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Steph

644
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,904
It doesn't matter to me what the solution is

645
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,464
It seems obvious that the solution is gun

646
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512
Control solution

647
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,792
Truly was

648
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:40,192
Give everybody 10 guns

649
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,728
So long as fewer people

650
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,264
Forget f****** murder

651
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:48,640
I'm for it we want the end

652
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,016
The reason I was saying you smart is that every single thing

653
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,832
Come Out Swinging as if it was your afraid of

654
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,648
You are always on the offense

655
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
Even when you're being

656
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
So

657
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,328
In the same way that like this isn't it

658
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
Cuz if you don't

659
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
You give

660
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
A little bit

661
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
You show weakness

662
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,240
As long as you projected strength

663
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
Immigration at all time

664
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
People will

665
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,336
You know you can't really have an argument

666
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
Because

667
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,664
He does In that clip he agrees

668
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,224
If I was I would not let him have

669
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,040
Yeah but then his is come back to you

670
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,136
Because I

671
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:36,256
To do that over my son government I don't want to Manny's town and eggs

672
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,632
Yeah you know that church we just talked about

673
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,192
There's another one

674
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,496
Bring up

675
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:52,128
By the way did you hear or shot for shot and killed

676
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
Send white people

677
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Bye

678
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
5 blackgummy

679
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,832
Walmart

680
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,744
The news organized

681
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:12,352
London Telegraph

682
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,912
Reporting on what Mini

683
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:23,616
He has David Knight on to talk a little bit more about this but if they don't get into any detail or actually talk about what the X

684
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
Actual situation they're talking about is

685
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:30,272
1993 in South Africa is the st. James church masses

686
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,160
It's sort of split through the sands of time

687
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
Cuz it was real bad

688
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Indian South Africa

689
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,560
The end of Apartheid

690
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
For folks

691
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,912
So there was this one of four major attack

692
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,752
Between late 1992 all the way through 1993

693
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,080
Perpetrated by the Athenaeum people's Liberation Army

694
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
Who the group

695
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,248
Which was in 1960 I believe

696
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
There's nothing worth

697
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
69 people were killed

698
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
And 180 injured

699
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Many shot in the back

700
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Wien

701
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,976
Police reports claim that quote young and inexperienced

702
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
Police members

703
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,792
Panicked and opened fire on protesters

704
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,328
Setting off a chain reaction

705
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:20,960
This sharpeville massacre happened during a protest of what was known as path laws

706
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
Your pants laws

707
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
I've heard of them I

708
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,336
Don't quite remember entirely.

709
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:32,992
They were required South Africa

710
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:39,648
It was their movement and was one of the foundational aspects of the apartheid system

711
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
All day everyday

712
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
Absolutely

713
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,560
It's not a it's a reasonable thing

714
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:52,960
You don't want people just going anywhere they put one of their crazy what are there terrorist

715
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:58,848
We got to make sure we know who everybody is

716
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
Group of people doesn't

717
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,968
Joy 1967

718
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,440
Because originally it was just for men over 16

719
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,720
MMA

720
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Winkler women

721
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,304
And younger people and it was just too, nothing where

722
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
What the fuk guys

723
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,400
Right

724
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
Beauty scribe

725
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,544
Young and inexperienced cops just open fire on

726
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,384
Some people say the protesters were throwing rocks

727
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,176
But it's unclear

728
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
There are other sources

729
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
Does it say that they were completely peaceful

730
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
And the cops fired

731
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,184
So the a pladsen people's Liberation Army was formed in response

732
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
That Massacre

733
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488
Under the name Poco

734
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
But then change their name later

735
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,584
Let's be honest

736
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
But

737
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,704
I don't want a lot of people

738
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,264
Most of the p

739
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
People who were negatively affect

740
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
Probably did

741
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Actively

742
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,712
Probably actively

743
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
Worthy of what

744
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
But I am

745
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,856
Far more sympathetic

746
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
To the Azan

747
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
Liberation

748
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,352
Every white person was

749
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,632
Complicit in

750
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,424
How things were operator

751
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,800
There is an argument not a good enough argument that I would support killing them

752
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,640
But that's definitely true

753
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:41,248
I don't think for them

754
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
Hazmat

755
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,320
My empathy for the white

756
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:56,864
After all four men responsible were captured and arrested

757
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:01,984
They appealed for amnesty from Bishop Desmond Tutu Truth and Reconciliation committee

758
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,848
We don't want to do Nuremberg trials

759
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
Heal the wounds

760
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,320
And they ended up meeting with survivors and family members of victims

761
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
From the massacre that they

762
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
Carried out

763
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
They reconciled

764
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,000
They understood the ramifications of their actions

765
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:28,608
They repented

766
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,144
Society

767
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,544
They were all granted amnesty by The Truth and Reconciliation committee

768
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
Consider this

769
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,968
Only 849 out of

770
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,504
D7100

771
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,784
12 application

772
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
Framesi

773
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,344
Reconciliation committee

774
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,112
War except

775
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,904
Who was not a rubber stamps

776
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,488
Clearly they went through the process and found

777
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
Alright

778
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
Makes sense

779
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:02,912
Repeatable Behavior

780
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:06,752
It's not like it's not like a breaking-and-entering you get out of jail

781
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
You're going to break

782
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
We're going to commit larger crime

783
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,152
This was a you guys

784
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:17,248
Systematically oppressed and enslaved my people and we fought back

785
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,832
If you don't understand why we have at least

786
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,624
Song justification

787
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
For fighting like this

788
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
You're an insane

789
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,488
Carrying out orders

790
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
To some extent

791
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
From there

792
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
Apla organization

793
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,632
Soldiers

794
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,168
The Granary

795
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:39,520
The organization was created in response

796
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
2 police

797
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,944
I don't want it I would never come out and say I support

798
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:56,160
Conclusion of the Truth and Reconciliation committee something but if you don't

799
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
Have simple

800
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Before it

801
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,256
You're you're just being

802
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
Understand

803
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,840
The

804
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
The social dynamics

805
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
The create stuff

806
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
Like that

807
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
Intentionally

808
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,544
Like I was being intentionally obtuse

809
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,336
For the argument white nationalism

810
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
Trapped into this sis

811
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,408
That is

812
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Oppressing you and

813
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,200
Destroying you

814
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Everything

815
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
Single

816
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
There's no way that you can

817
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
Begin to feel

818
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
So helpless

819
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
What else is there

820
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,512
Acts of violence that idea of it is the

821
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,304
The voice of the oppressed

822
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
Does that make sense

823
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
You can't get recourse

824
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,680
4 grievances that are real

825
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,704
In court

826
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,752
If the system is so broken again

827
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,152
It sucks but the only thing you can do is burn down a building murder that kid

828
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
The Vic

829
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,224
Who murdered that

830
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
That kid

831
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
Amazon

832
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
Was just

833
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
F******

834
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,392
Like she was cleared of all charges

835
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,720
Cleared of all charges even though they had it on camera that she act

836
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
Cleared of all charges

837
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,912
Lady in Oklahoma

838
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
Shelby

839
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,752
Was a police officer

840
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,800
Who murdered Terence Crutcher

841
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
Straight up murderer

842
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,384
No murdered him

843
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
No other way to describe

844
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,968
And she was acquitted of all charges

845
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Just went straight back

846
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
Type of s*** happens

847
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,880
You look at that and you think

848
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
There is no justice

849
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
No there's no just

850
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,792
So why why would I want to go through these

851
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,328
Why would I want to

852
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,192
Because I am getting no justice anywhere else

853
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
I have to

854
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
Take justice into my own

855
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
Right

856
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,592
But like you said

857
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,872
Willfully obtuse

858
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,151
To think that

859
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
Riot

860
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,527
And the like are are some sort of

861
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
Philiac

862
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
The black lives matter protest

863
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,207
Just want to kill cops

864
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
They want Justice

865
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,535
You know what you get

866
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
You get jumped

867
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,631
So if it's only applied to you and not to them

868
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,679
Get ready for some s*** burning down

869
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:19,007
Alex would argue in favor of riot

870
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,079
For this perceived they're going to take our guns

871
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,943
It's just really unfair it logically inconsistent

872
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,087
Play here

873
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
I come

874
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,415
Almost immediately after he talks

875
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,719
It accurately about the South Africa

876
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,511
Situationally called The False Flags

877
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
Okay

878
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,375
I also they imply that it was white people who carried it out

879
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,655
And pretended they were black

880
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:53,311
Call directions

881
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:02,527
It's why people we're definitely not being racist about this not being racist

882
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,319
I don't buy his

883
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,855
At all it's so stupid

884
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,647
He comes back

885
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
Also laments

886
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
The state of being

887
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,447
24/7

888
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,263
Perception

889
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:28,639
That black sermons by white people

890
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:39,135
And don't even cover

891
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
This is being hyped

892
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:48,863
Foregoing

893
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:55,263
Mentally ill respond to build towards a crescendo

894
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:02,943
Pushing for this to federal police after a summer of Rage

895
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,223
Coming up this summer

896
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,015
This is it

897
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,063
This is the big one

898
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,111
What is left

899
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:14,463
Federalization gun control

900
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,999
So that's the dumb prediction

901
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:20,607
Are we can now 2 years after look back in that there was not a summer of Rage

902
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,335
Crackdown

903
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:36,735
There's not a federalization of the police what do you mean federalizing the

904
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
Play Store

905
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:44,927
Talking about specifically is responding to comments that like Al Sharp

906
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
Captain made after the Charleston shooting

907
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,279
He was talking about how

908
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
In

909
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
The Civil Rights

910
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,375
Are we needed to involve

911
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,911
The federal government

912
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
And states rights was

913
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,983
The bad guy

914
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,567
Because the idea that states could decide the blacks can't vote

915
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,127
Sort of thing was a real problem

916
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,175
I've never seen states rights

917
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,199
That kind

918
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,295
Acceptable

919
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:16,415
Generally yeah really really bad thing you really really bad

920
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:20,511
Even even Sharpton's argument about that isn't saying

921
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Staples

922
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
Anything

923
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
It's there any issues such as

924
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,119
Human rights

925
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,423
You need to have the federal government over

926
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,215
Oversee

927
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,287
Pretty much the only reason that we have

928
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
Because otherwise

929
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,895
I don't know Oklahoma could just be like

930
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
No blacks

931
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,967
Fallout

932
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Right

933
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,343
Flea markets

934
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,975
Oklahoma facts

935
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:51,999
So they wouldn't

936
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
God I hate

937
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
Would work out that way

938
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,911
Of course not

939
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:04,031
He was responding also two other incidents where

940
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,079
Much like that situation.

941
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,103
Cops kill

942
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
African-American

943
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:12,735
A slap on the wrist

944
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,063
He's talking about systematic racism the federal government needs

945
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
To get involved

946
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
Because otherwise

947
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
Local

948
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
State

949
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,975
Bodies are not taken care of the issue

950
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,535
Every major

951
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
Advance

952
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
Any kind of racial

953
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,911
As always,

954
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
From the top

955
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,983
Because quite frankly

956
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
From Federal

957
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
Governor

958
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,335
Quite frankly most people are for it

959
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:42,175
In small Pockets they're not right

960
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,599
Alex is Bixby is this idea federalization

961
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
That would be

962
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
The government

963
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,231
Evil government that he has in his head

964
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
Control of all police

965
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
I may use it

966
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
Police state

967
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,167
That ends up intake

968
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,471
An hour in a repressive regime

969
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
Be the reason that I

970
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,567
Fixated

971
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
I had never heard that before

972
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,407
And my instinct

973
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,431
Whatever he says

974
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,967
It's a bad thing it's good

975
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:21,599
Tell me about and I just had

976
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:27,999
This is a great idea you can know whatever the right thing is exactly the opposite of what Alex to say

977
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:34,399
Good thing I actually do kind of feel like would be much more likely to be on the negative cider

978
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,055
Inside the borders and the Army doesn't

979
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,103
Federal police system that was

980
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,895
Completely and utterly about that

981
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,431
Much larger

982
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,967
If everybody became

983
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,039
As we all know about the

984
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,319
There in 10

985
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:58,719
Asians are not always good and generally can be very bad I agree in principle

986
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,815
Any idea of a completely federalized

987
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,447
Federal imput to help

988
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:10,751
Contain

989
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,079
And deal with situations that local and state governments are unwilling to

990
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:18,687
It's the same thing with the misunderstanding

991
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Gun control

992
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,503
Versus taking your gun

993
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,295
Yeah it's a lack of nuance

994
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,367
Need York propagandist

995
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,791
A Paul Joseph Watson report

996
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,327
From this episode

997
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,375
Because I knew that you could

998
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,959
You couldn't handle excellent

999
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:44,031
Is all is all just about Hawaii

1000
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
I cut that out

1001
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Entirely

1002
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,431
But

1003
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,503
Charleston

1004
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Shooting was fake

1005
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
Again in wrestling

1006
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,391
And it's so clear to me

1007
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,671
In the clip what he wants

1008
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
To say it's fake

1009
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
Pull the trigger

1010
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,839
He's

1011
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,223
Criminal elements

1012
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:25,759
Done

1013
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,807
Things like this before

1014
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,111
The pastor was a state

1015
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
Charleston

1016
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,327
That's all I needed to know

1017
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,655
It's

1018
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:46,495
Very very very

1019
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,847
Suspicious

1020
00:49:54,175 --> 00:50:00,319
Citizens

1021
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:03,135
Add radio

1022
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,927
Such long pauses

1023
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,463
It's clear that you just like

1024
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
Can't

1025
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:12,351
F*** it said evil twin it's the same

1026
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,167
It's the same thing he did immediately following the pizzagate

1027
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,471
We have the new information about the

1028
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
Which was

1029
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,311
Our government has done stuff like this

1030
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
So it could have been

1031
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,383
I'm just asking question

1032
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,687
Yeah it's it's

1033
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:35,903
Broadcast because it's all just insinuation it's all

1034
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,207
He's like it's

1035
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,231
Suspicious

1036
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,511
This is the place that

1037
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
Was targeted

1038
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,351
Water is an incredibly estorick black church

1039
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,399
So it's not

1040
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:51,775
Suspicious if that was what was targeted by a racist

1041
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:56,127
It's a very sacred place to a lot of people and has a rich history

1042
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:00,735
So it's not it's not suspicious at all

1043
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
Argument

1044
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,295
People who think

1045
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,319
At the race Wars

1046
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
Most of them

1047
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,671
It will be all on

1048
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,255
People versus All Blacks

1049
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:16,607
Most people do not realize that there's a good chunk of a

1050
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:21,471
Nah dude we are not on the white races side on this what kind of look

1051
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,775
I'm late but I'm not real

1052
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:34,527
I'm not all the stuff is nice I think it's an important distinction to make two but neither of us are ashamed of the fact

1053
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
That's not the

1054
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,159
But we recognize the history

1055
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,999
White people in this country

1056
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,815
And throughout the world and not all of its bad

1057
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:51,423
But there is a very very serious history of depression

1058
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,959
Because if you ever read a history

1059
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:56,031
Book and the sentence to read is then

1060
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,335
And then white people showed up you go

1061
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:04,735
F*** no no no that's not going to end well mean even on our last episode we completely destroy Guatemala for

1062
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,271
Are bananas like it's

1063
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,111
It was about communism but it really wasn't

1064
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:14,463
Maybach

1065
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,279
Listen be white

1066
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,303
Is not

1067
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
Inherently better

1068
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,375
Inherent

1069
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,775
Play better is obviously better part of the Promenade

1070
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,591
Just raped and murdered our way into

1071
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,383
Like it's not a good sister

1072
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,455
Ultimately a good system for us either

1073
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,503
Of course

1074
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,295
If you have this kind of

1075
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Privilege

1076
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,391
The idea of somebody equalizing things

1077
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,951
Do you means they're taking away your

1078
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,255
It doesn't mean that everybody is

1079
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
You're being

1080
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,143
Lower

1081
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,191
People think of it as a

1082
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,287
This is being taken from me and given to them

1083
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,639
Does a zero-sum game your loss is my game

1084
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,199
Everybody

1085
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,015
It is always a good thing if more

1086
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,807
People have more

1087
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,391
The idea that specially the most fundamental things

1088
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:22,559
I'm saying about the the whole

1089
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:26,399
Well the rich people need as much as they can to give us some when it's

1090
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:33,823
If poor people had more money they would buy more s*** we'd all have more money

1091
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,127
With really good ideas would create business

1092
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:40,479
People like Hamdi ulukaya

1093
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
Oportun

1094
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,783
More available

1095
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,087
More are available for everyone

1096
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,671
It boggles my mind how you can't understand that

1097
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,719
Trickle-down

1098
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,815
Alex gets pretty defensive about

1099
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,583
His guns

1100
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,399
He says something

1101
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,983
I can't be a lot right

1102
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,287
This is

1103
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,359
Basically

1104
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,943
Please guilty to a crime he was not accused of

1105
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,607
Brown

1106
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:35,007
I don't watch

1107
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:35,775
Warfare

1108
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:45,759
But I assure you my Barrett 50 caliber rifle

1109
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,319
Any murders

1110
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,671
Kallax Shelf

1111
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:56,255
It's been used

1112
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,815
Hundreds of thousands

1113
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,863
Of the

1114
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,911
In circulation in the US

1115
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:07,007
I can't I couldn't figure out what that one crime was

1116
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:13,919
Buy guns weird

1117
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:16,735
She thinks of the bet

1118
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:33,119
And then he goes on to defend the gun

1119
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,471
The cow has never been used in murders

1120
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,263
He starts crying about Nam

1121
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,359
He killed not

1122
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,967
It'll put him down

1123
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,527
You know I kept trying to make him drown

1124
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
Or whatever

1125
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:58,207
So do you think about that that's slightly misleading is a Barrett 50 cal is a f****** huge gun

1126
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,071
Very large one of those guns that you have to like

1127
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:07,167
Prop up those guns

1128
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:12,287
Comical cartoon version of ammunition belt

1129
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,615
You set up a position and proper gun up on a tripod

1130
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:19,967
And you being it with you is impossible

1131
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,271
Is it

1132
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,855
No one has ever used

1133
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:32,255
Of course it's like Terminator 2 using the minigun

1134
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,047
Liquor store

1135
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
Call McDowell

1136
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:38,399
AK-47 can be stealthy hidden on your back

1137
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,423
To some extent

1138
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,215
And handguns are way more

1139
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,751
Useful than a f***

1140
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,287
Barrett 50 caliber

1141
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,591
So anyway

1142
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:54,015
Like unnecessary

1143
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,367
I use it to scare the government less they get out of control

1144
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,671
More of what it is

1145
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,255
Assault rifles are military

1146
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,327
To have an assault

1147
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,423
50/50 on it I do believe that

1148
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,447
Dumb

1149
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,519
Piece of the we should be armed

1150
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,567
In case the government gets out of line

1151
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,871
I think some of that argument is

1152
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,639
Yeah but

1153
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:24,735
We're all thinking it's more and more recent

1154
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,039
I know

1155
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,623
I know the point that whatever the government has is

1156
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:34,207
Bigger and badder than anything we could possibly have

1157
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,999
I do know that is true also

1158
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,047
But I have a number for

1159
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,119
Central Missouri

1160
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,911
They aren't crazy

1161
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,703
And they're very responsible

1162
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,495
I feel the fact that like

1163
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,543
That Community does exist

1164
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:52,383
I know that there are a pocket of people who are into guns

1165
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,175
And are just like

1166
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,711
I keep them cuz

1167
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,759
I'm interested in guns and

1168
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,295
I want to be armed

1169
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,831
In case I have to protect

1170
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
Guns make your dick

1171
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:10,559
Will make you feel like

1172
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,607
No that's fine

1173
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:21,311
Association

1174
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,335
But you need that

1175
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,639
I'm fine with that but for real

1176
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,199
There's no reason to have an assault

1177
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:33,087
No it's true but I do know some people who have them and they're responsible with them and I would trust them

1178
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,135
It's not

1179
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,927
It's not for hunting per day

1180
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,719
Retro defense

1181
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,255
Fantasy

1182
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:45,631
It is I disagree with it but at the same time I get the principal and I'm not

1183
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,471
Everyone shouldn't have assault rifle

1184
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,007
I think the

1185
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,311
Going to come down to work gun control

1186
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,615
Make sure that people who will use them

1187
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,639
4L

1188
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,407
Don't have

1189
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:02,271
Or make it harder for them to get them even though it's illegal

1190
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,551
Fort Lee

1191
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
Legally murky

1192
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
We study

1193
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
The results

1194
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,671
The guns

1195
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:13,023
Because our gun lobbies are so amazing

1196
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,327
You can't research

1197
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,607
They won't give you any funding for

1198
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,959
Can still kind of

1199
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:22,751
Go back through

1200
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,031
Police reports

1201
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,079
And in situations

1202
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,639
Where a gun was had and

1203
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,919
Potentially been used

1204
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,223
Find yourself good guy with a gun

1205
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,247
Never works

1206
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:37,343
Ever so very very very few situations

1207
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
F*** you man

1208
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:45,023
Do you have anecdotal evidence from this I don't need any

1209
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:52,703
Big picture you're totally right but it is actually kind of interesting that the Saint James Massacre

1210
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,055
He started shooting at them

1211
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,103
And because of that they ended up please

1212
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,127
Breath

1213
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,711
I hadn't been there and shot at them

1214
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,271
Petrol bomb

1215
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,295
But they were going to

1216
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,087
Killed

1217
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,111
So many

1218
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,671
Individual entity

1219
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:17,023
Brighton there are a couple really work out that way

1220
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,839
Yeah you know

1221
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,607
F******

1222
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,143
One-time something happen

1223
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,471
On the whole

1224
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,263
The good guy with the gun theory is

1225
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Complete and utter

1226
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:32,383
Let's get off this gun topic for a little bit cuz Alex wants to take a transition

1227
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,175
A talk a little bit about the eye

1228
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:39,807
The other black people are taking white people's women

1229
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,855
You know me I have

1230
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:47,487
Low opinions about this is Alex or responding to

1231
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,559
What dylann roof halves

1232
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,119
All that and Alex sort of

1233
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:57,471
Don't get the point and buys into the narrative a little bit too

1234
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,287
Control

1235
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,879
And taking over our women

1236
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:31,007
Attack

1237
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,847
Yes

1238
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,151
In a racist

1239
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
Idiot

1240
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,831
Girlfriend

1241
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
F*** you

1242
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:54,303
Because he's getting his women

1243
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:05,567
God damn you

1244
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,527
Got the thousand yard stare somebody who's been

1245
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,575
Alex is not nowhere to land

1246
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,599
Is going on

1247
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:22,975
The pilot was trying to come in for a landing at

1248
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:29,375
Don't do it don't know not here not here

1249
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,727
His argument like

1250
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,031
To a certain extent is

1251
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,871
He kind of just needed a girlfriend

1252
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:46,527
That's problematic because it does not a great argument but does have some Merit

1253
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,831
No because there's plenty of racist

1254
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:56,767
No I'm not saying that I'm taking this

1255
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,583
Is his logic

1256
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
Is

1257
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,751
I'll just because the other ones are so much

1258
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,055
Far off base

1259
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,847
I'm happier with him saying

1260
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,175
Hey the real problem is this guy needed to get f*****

1261
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,711
Then him staying at the Falls

1262
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,783
That sounds like something like a shock jock show

1263
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,623
Howard Stern's wife

1264
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,391
You know what

1265
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,159
That's dumb

1266
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:30,559
That's just dumped horrifyingly offensively productive but it is when you're using that as

1267
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,839
Rebuttal to

1268
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
Dylann roof

1269
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,679
Claims that black people are taking our women

1270
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,983
That sort of thing first

1271
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,311
Stupidest

1272
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,127
Using that as a rebuttal to that

1273
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,687
When you use that at in contacts

1274
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,455
There

1275
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
He is given

1276
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:48,991
Credence

1277
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,015
In many ways

1278

1279
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,063
Dylan roofs grievance

1280
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,343
Because he is

1281
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,903
He's responding to it Envy

1282
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,951
Girlfriend

1283
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,999
Like that sort of thing

1284
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:02,047
Well it's laying in the same bulb

1285
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,631
But it is his

1286
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,263
It's his version of being fair

1287
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,055
Like the idea of like

1288
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,335
To me it's not a race

1289
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,871
Tumi

1290
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,407
You're not mad at

1291
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,735
Race

1292
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
Just lashing out

1293
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,063
Can't get laid me off

1294
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,087
The Hook from saying

1295
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,623
It's about Race 2

1296
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:31,999
It's just about showing exactly but again we can talk about toxic masculinity

1297
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,071
Globalist

1298
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,119

Women

1303

Kind of like

1309
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:08,607
Racism and sexism are all tied up into one big.

1310
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,655

1311

Remember I was telling you about these things

1314
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:20,639
You donate $10,000 a month you can become a policy customer Rose

If you remember I was telling you about the st. James Massacre

1320
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:52,127
But Alex was pitching a tent

1321
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,175
But all the victims were white be there

1322
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,455
Alex

1323
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:57,503
Has the more thoughts about it

1324
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:03,903
Hear about it

1331
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,271
Was the opposite completely proven

1332
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:35,391
Kind of a true statement

1333
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,439
Completely proven

1334
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,487
Because of the obvious fake

1335
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,511
Fact that I was

1336
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
So stupid

1337
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:49,215
In this next clip Alex.

1338
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,775
Victim disarmament Zone

1339
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:57,663
That's up that's gun talk for we should allow guns in churches and schools

1340
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,599
Carino's the David Knight is super against abortion

1341
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,903
So he does this

1342
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,463
I swear to God he thinks it's like a bit

1343
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,255
He thinks he's doing a good bit

1344
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,023
Like

1345
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:17,375
But he's Dennis Miller some s*** coming on a conservative showing

1346
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,679
Raley's

1347
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,471
It basically what Dennis Miller

1348
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,823
Good night.

1349
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:32,735
But the other thing that we need to look at

1350
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,343
People area we don't want to have weapons

1351
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:43,743
Weapons and the whole second amendment is essentially about the right

1352
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,663
He can carry out the dead black babies

1353
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:16,511
How many wants to kill black people that's infected

1354
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,047
Real solid

1355
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,423
Real good argumentation emotional

1356
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,447
Strength

1357
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,263
To be this angry all day today

1358
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,799
I know

1359
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,591
Are you trying to suck

1360
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,127
The lifeblood out of me

1361
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:36,479
Yeah kind of but also

1362
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:40,575
That's unbelievably racist b******* and

1363
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,599
Spinning

1364
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,303
My life

1365
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,351
Absolutely insane anytime

1366
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:53,887
Anybody in my family

1367
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:54,911
When they have that

1368
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,031
What about what about

1369
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:04,127
The number one killer of black people is abortion

1370
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,431
So that means I can't be racist

1371
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,967
Because I know

1372
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,503
That even though that's not

1373
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,831
We can test the premise

1374
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,815
Right

1375
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,239
At the bane of the right-wing

1376
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,567
I have some interesting ideas about statistic

1377
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:36,895
I actually just listen very carefully to what he says

1378
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
Because he

1379
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:41,247
He let slip that he's aware that he's wrong

1380
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:45,087
But then minimizes the fact that he has just left

1381
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,111
But he knows he's wrong

1382
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,903
It's very interesting clip

1383
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:54,559
This empty leave my kingdom

1384
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,935
Look

1385
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,519
Paul Watson broken down

1386
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,199
Police report

1387
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,295
But

1388
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:21,439
You should have the mic sound because you missed the most important thing he said there

1389
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:25,279
I'm going to play it again or at least after he gets out of Paul Joseph Watson

1390
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,327
Because it's essential

1391
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,631
To hear him contradict himself within 4 seconds

1392
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,399
Okay

1393
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:35,519
Police report

1394
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,663
But

1395
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:46,015
So you saying the statistics are they don't lie and they say that 8 times

1396
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,575
More white people are attacked by black people

1397
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,623
Before that he said

1398
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,647
He thinks the

1399
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,439
Statistics are jilted towards

1400
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,231
Because of police reporting

1401
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,511
And that is 100%

1402
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,327
So prior to

1403
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,607
She's saying that the

1404
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,423
He said the statistics lie

1405
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
6 Arline

1406
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,471
Yes alright

1407
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,519
This is a very difficult thing

1408
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:14,175
This is a complicated enough to know

1409
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,039
Not necessarily true

1410
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,855
I mean I know it's

1411
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,647
I got to push it because

1412
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:27,999
I've done it I have a I have a Bedrock of racism has got a hold of

1413
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:35,167
I want to be totally clear I'm not cutting out stuff that like

1414
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,703
Makes all of this okay

1415
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:43,359
I don't know

1416
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:49,759
I just have to only way is if at the end of every clip that you have played for

1417
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:07,679
Whenever Alex

1418
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:13,823
I always get really self-conscious if people think that I'm strategically editing things and making it look like he's saying he's not

1419
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,615
I just want to be clear that like

1420
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,407
Most of the stuff that I've cut out is

1421
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,687
Is just diversion

1422
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,479
Down the road talking about like

1423
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:25,087
The Batman Aurora shooter and Ted Kaczynski

1424
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,903
He talks a lot about that

1425
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,207
Birkey's the issue a little bit

1426
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,559
Because he makes the argument that all those people were brain-controlled and used

1427
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
A false flag attack

1428
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,119
And stuff like that

1429
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,167
And I don't have the f****** energy

1430
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:43,775
Make this a 5-hour episode where we break down each and every one of those

1431
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,823
But most of those are

1432
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,591
Bulshit

1433
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:49,663
Hey you know how we're talking about this one

1434
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:54,271
Just apply all of the same stuff different

1435
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:59,647
Events in there than others

1436
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,463
In the sense that like Ted Kaczynski is way more interest

1437
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,255
Because he was part of

1438
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,303
MK Ultra studies

1439
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,887
He was

1440
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,447
Dosed with tons of hallucinogen

1441
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,519
Gone off

1442
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
Otherwise

1443
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,591
That's entirely possible

1444
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,383
But that does not mean he was being brain

1445
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
Controlled

1446
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,687
Radio that

1447
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,735
Be that as it may

1448
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,271
That's most of the stuff that I've cut out

1449
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,391
Let me see the other thing about that

1450
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,183
Golden tickets

1451
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,999
If we could mind control

1452
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,839
God dammit

1453
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:44,959
The thing that you would see all the time to solve all your problems

1454
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,007
Just mind control somebody in a box

1455
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:51,359
All the claims the globalist want Bush much harder

1456
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:56,735
Programs in place for hundreds

1457
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,039
Thousand people are being brain control

1458
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:02,111
Likespike innocent monkeys in Bastrop

1459
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:02,879
Exactly

1460
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Saving

1461
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
That

1462
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,231
Perspective

1463
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,255
No

1464
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,863
Follow me here

1465
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,679
Where would you keep

1466
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,703
The perfect

1467
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
Unbelievable

1468
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,383
I don't understand the question is phrased

1469
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,687
Okay

1470
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,479
Perimeter

1471
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,015
Okay

1472
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:34,111
Fish people

1473
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,647
How else

1474
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,439
Do you defeat nuclear submarine

1475
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:44,095
Fish-people exactly it all comes together now mind-controlled fish-people with Bob

1476
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,983
Destroy submarine I like talking about years ago

1477
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,007
This is because

1478
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,823
Back then they only had fish people

1479
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,127
They've been working on reptilian

1480
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:58,687
People

1481
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:02,783
Water an idiot

1482
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,855
So they're working on that

1483
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,903
I would go with your best bet though

1484
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,255
Jesus lizard people

1485
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,047
Lizard people

1486
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,071
There we go

1487
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,375
Stupid f****** stupid

1488
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,959
So I think we got screwed up whatever he stuck

1489
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
Great Clips

1490
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:28,639
Minimizes the deaths

1491
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
The people at that church

1492
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,527
Says something's that

1493
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,575
Is so not true about liberals

1494
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,647
Is it awesome thing that he always does

1495
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:42,463
Where he pretends there's a conversation he had with somebody

1496
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,999
I meant turns them into a d

1497
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,071
Itsfunneh

1498
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,095
But at the same time

1499
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:56,031
Hundreds of thousands of people died in auto accidents

1500
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:11,391
The meaning of plan on that

1501
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,975
What happened

1502
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:17,023
Impossible

1503
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:20,607
Well the folks are dead

1504
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,871
Wilderness

1505
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:46,719
I just don't get it

1506
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:56,447
F*** you Alex is missing the point at 3 Alex XM body

1507
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:00,287
The creation of racial division

1508
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,567
This is the worst

1509
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,591
Word

1510
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:07,199
You can you imagine these liberals that he talks to off camera

1511
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,343
What

1512
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,367
Direct

1513
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:19,743
I don't know who he's pretending to talk to Steven

1514
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:25,375
Bianchi

1515
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:28,959
Camera at some point

1516
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,495
Talk to Alex Jones

1517
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:34,847
And express their actual opinions off-camera

1518
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:40,991
You should listen to my opinions off of the show let me tell you some

1519
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:47,391
We're on camera right now

1520
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:53,791
Alien contact with Alex

1521
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,327
We just don't give anyone to link

1522
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,607
Intentional

1523
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,191
Exercise

1524
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:04,287
So a stupidest s*** there

1525
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,311
He does not

1526
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:08,895
You stand at all's at like my experience of the Charleston

1527
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,175
Some shooting was great

1528
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,455
And empathy

1529
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,783
And from everything that I experience

1530
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,343
Some people around me it was a

1531
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,391
It was it was not a

1532
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:23,231
F*** white kind of moment it wasn't evil

1533
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:26,559
Evil about it

1534
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,583
That you have to go

1535
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
Oh wait

1536
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,935
Just come out and bit like

1537
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,471
This is a horrible thing

1538
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,799
But I don't think it should be used as a

1539
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,079
Excuse

1540
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:41,151
At the very least you go

1541
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,967
That's up that's a thought we understand your position

1542
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,015
If that's what your position is that

1543
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,831
When you start justifying it by

1544
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:52,159
We're really proud because of black people

1545
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:58,559
It's a problem because you guys don't care about abortion

1546
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:04,447
Pass shooting you're the reason that I think white people are evil

1547
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,727
Because of you

1548
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,495
That was

1549
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,287
Like I said

1550
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,103
It was it was a unifying moment where I

1551
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
I think most

1552
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,455
People saw it as a as a call to

1553
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:19,807
Karen respect each other more as opposed to a

1554
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,599
Feud

1555
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,135
And I think that's most of

1556
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,903
The last

1557
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
Hopefully that's

1558
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,351
I mean I keep I keep saying like

1559
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,119
The difference

1560
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
The left and the right

1561
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:35,935
The Way We Were

1562
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,983
To stop and why

1563
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
Asos down

1564
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,079
Yeah

1565
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
Because

1566
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,895
The last always

1567
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,479
Empathize for at least that's one of the Hallmarks of being

1568
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:52,063
Is the idea of emphasizing with even the people

1569
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,087
You don't

1570
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,623
Agree with

1571
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,927
Like why are there so many thing

1572
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:03,071
Country we wanted to see how they feel about Trump right now as trumpet

1573
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,607
Is f****** over their lives.

1574
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,887
Like

1575
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
Right

1576
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,727
It's appetizing and understanding to a fault

1577
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:14,848
We're trying to understand them and to see if there's some way that we can get through to them

1578
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,408
Do you understand

1579
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:23,296
To June of 2015 to study Alex Jones from the moment Donald Trump

1580
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:27,392
It's exactly that I want understand

1581
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,928
I want understand what happened

1582
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,232
But if you're on the right

1583
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,512
You don't

1584
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,536
You don't want to

1585
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:36,096
Stand it

1586
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,800
It's something that you want to use to reinforce your black-and-white belief

1587
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,896
You know like that but if I can

1588
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
True or untrue

1589
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,736
Dichotomy absolute

1590
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,296
Yeah

1591
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,320
We are good

1592
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,088
And there

1593
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,904
Yeah and so anything that we determined

1594
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,488
Is so bad that we don't care

1595
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,376
I don't know why I'm supposed to care about

1596
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:15,776
I don't like it but why do I care

1597
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,312
I don't need to emphasize

1598
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:21,152
Show me to know how these people would feel I don't care

1599
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,432
Because he refuses to take things

1600
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,712
In their proper context

1601
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,992
Of course cuz he

1602
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,040
Lack reading comprehension

1603
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,088
Elac fact integration abilities

1604
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,976
Everybody mentioned at the top of this episode

1605
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:38,048
Episode is an exercise in Alex Jones trying to find his foot hole

1606
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,584
He climbing up a mountain

1607
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
Essentially

1608
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,912
The mountain that is propped up in front of him

1609
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,192
He had no idea

1610
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,776
It's the world

1611
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,056
His foot

1612
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:52,384
A giant roadblock he's got to get over it somehow

1613
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:56,736
He's trying to figure out is the argument going to be

1614
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
This is fake

1615
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,832
Is it going to be this guy is crazy

1616
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:03,904
Is it going to be about medication is it going to be all the

1617
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,672
Depressed

1618
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,952
Instances

1619
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,720
What am I going to do

1620
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,768
And nothing is really sticking

1621
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,816
Until at the end of the episode

1622
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,608
Towards the end of the episode

1623
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,936
He has Reverend Childress on for a

1624
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,704
An interview

1625
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,104
Exactly

1626
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:27,200
This clip is long and we are going to pause whenever you need to

1627
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,992
Long

1628
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:31,040
But the reason that I kept it as one clip

1629
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,064
Is because

1630
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,368
It shows a metamorphic

1631
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,416
You can hear Alex

1632
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,696
Figuring it out

1633
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,464
And being like

1634
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
Bissell

1635
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,512
Business plan

1636
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,328
Something is really interesting is that like

1637
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,888
He is at adaptable the in the moment

1638
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,080
At this point

1639
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,104
Completely silent

1640
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,896
He says maybe a couple words

1641
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:00,992
And whenever you start stalking Alex custom options

1642
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:04,064
Might be part of my ongoing study of why Jacari quit

1643
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,648
This is this is this is wild

1644
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,184
This I really think as revealing

1645
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,464
The trials and travails

1646
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,728
You will have the right

1647
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,800
Together

1648
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:31,200
A lot of it is basically

1649
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,224
Was ordered for our

1650
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,760
Issues and problems

1651
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:38,880
But

1652
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,936
And then use it as a weapon

1653
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:03,456
You have some of these speakers at these rallies that are basically was facing

1654
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,736
I'm an African-American

1655
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:16,000
And every celebration of America

1656
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,128
Race war

1657
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:42,112
But their hyping this Discord hyping this manipulation

1658
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:48,000
Amazon the Redguard website

1659
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,872
That idea of

1660
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:06,176
So they kind of brilliant

1661
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,480
That they've got

1662
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,248
Professors have

1663
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,088
Together it's not

1664
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,112
Look

1665
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:14,880
It again

1666
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
The elites

1667
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,208
It's the elites manipulating all of the

1668
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:21,024
These people

1669
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,560
Colleges are breathing

1670
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,888
Institution

1671
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,704
They're attending

1672
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,752
More cover

1673
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,032
Underneath that like

1674
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,568
No it's not a race

1675
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,360
These black p

1676
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,664
Would also be on our side

1677
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,992
If they weren't being funded and manipulated

1678
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,528
And all of these things

1679
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:44,576
I'm not

1680
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,344
Reese's

1681
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:49,696
I am against being manipulated in these people

1682
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,024
So that we can all come together

1683
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:57,888
Problems have nothing to do with race

1684
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:03,264
I would be remiss if I didn't point out there what he's talkin about is like the Red Guard and like

1685
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,312
These these organization

1686
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:06,848
Call Black

1687
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,408
There's also

1688
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,808
Wow

1689
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:19,392
Put underneath the surface

1690
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:25,792
That's the thing never quite cross that line

1691
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,072
Of understanding

1692
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,864
Hey this isn't about race

1693
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,888
But somehow

1694
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,680
I'm angrier

1695
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,496
Who aren't supporting me

1696
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:37,824
Premier

1697
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,104
Maybe

1698
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,384
If I think of these

1699
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,408
People is Trader

1700
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,200
I think of those people

1701
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,736
As the bad guy

1702
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:51,392
And conversely the people who were fighting against

1703
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:55,744
I guess even worse idea of you saying I don't like

1704
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,512
This more

1705
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:02,912
Priorities

1706
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:08,032
I think we should have a race war but I'm just angry or when my race is against me

1707
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,896
Yep that's a good step

1708
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:14,432
Also I want to say that I

1709
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,200
Love

1710
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:15,968
Jakari Jackson

1711
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,736
Voice

1712
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,784
He has got a great for it

1713
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,368
Like listening back to these episodes

1714
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:24,672
I'm pissed he's not still around

1715
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:27,744
Jude he has got a

1716
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,816
Radio voice

1717
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:31,584
And

1718
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:36,704
Ambivalently sit there silently while Alex

1719
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,776
Great because it seems like he wants to be like

1720
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:44,128
What does

1721
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,664
Tired

1722
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:50,016
And that's just a sign like a fever blister

1723
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:58,976
The sores are coming up and the super hardcore left is like active right now

1724
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:03,328
You're coming out

1725
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:29,184
Knowledge

1726
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:33,280
This just makes me nauseated to see whether it was staged or not

1727
01:28:54,016 --> 01:29:00,160
People are making their speeches now

1728
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,240
This is

1729
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:30,368
And are in a position to profit from it

1730
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:36,256
We discussed it thoroughly

1731
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:40,864
I said come on look at the time they look at look at who's doing it

1732
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,192
Speech he gave as he left

1733
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,032
Across

1734
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:54,432
America

1735
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:13,632
Whatever

1736
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:17,216
Mason Justin Bieber

1737
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:30,528
But months ago with plan

1738
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:34,624
Very very skilled

1739
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,184
Months ago this kid

1740
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,000
For this week

1741
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,584
And

1742
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:49,984
This weekend in every major

1743
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:04,576
You can see the whole roll out

1744
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:09,696
Is there a mean dude that was a f****** long clip and I apologize

1745
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,256
It's a spider who plays of the Hulk

1746
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:14,816
But you can see his mindset Transformer

1747
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,120
Entirely from

1748
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,144
Oh f*** we figure

1749
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:19,936
Here's how we do it

1750
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,984
This Reverend Childress

1751
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:22,752
Has given me

1752
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:27,104
A couple pieces of important information that I would have no way of knowing otherwise

1753
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,640
He's weaving them into a

1754
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,176
Conspiracy

1755
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:35,296
And I'm going to put that over by and make it to

1756
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:39,392
I lost myself

1757
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,720
I mean that's a hundred percent

1758
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,488
What's going on

1759
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,840
Trying to figure out how to make this cohesive

1760
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:50,400
And now he has an interview with the minister

1761
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,704
Who tells him Juneteenth is coming up

1762
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,032
Thursdays are when you fertilize your speeches

1763
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,872
Music off

1764
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:02,176
And I'll be honest is

1765
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:11,904
Like he's the one who is like I'm not saying that he's being manipulated to Alex's agenda

1766
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,256
Like they're spiraling together

1767
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:22,656
Yeah like each of them is coming at it from a different angle and they're just spinning towards each other like the toilet bowl of lunacy that

1768
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:23,680
Together

1769
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:27,776
For Alex to jump

1770
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:32,128
You run the website called black genocide. Org

1771
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:39,040
You just sure can throw genocide into whatever it is you want to say now

1772
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:43,904
I believe he is also one of us has a lot of feelings about the abortion

1773
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,696
Being a genocide whole thing

1774
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:53,376
I think that is super interesting because you get this Alex Jones

1775
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:56,960
Is all his brain is always working

1776
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,776
In terms of like trying to figure out how to

1777
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:00,544
How to spend

1778
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,128
Up to the interview

1779
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,920
He brought up these

1780
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:09,248
Other is Timothy McVeigh Unabomber

1781
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:11,040
Sirhan Sirhan

1782
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:14,112
And Cher

1783
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:17,184
She could but he couldn't quite figure out how to make it

1784
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,976
It like this instant

1785
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,256
Why

1786
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,584
What is what is going on other than the ideas

1787
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,680
Wanted to do

1788
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:31,008
So that would just be like

1789
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,056
Will the fascinating thing about his

1790
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,616
His bringing up all of those other things

1791
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,920
Is that they were all uniformly

1792
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,456
Right-wing Terror

1793
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:47,392
Okay what kind of Aurora shooter

1794
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,416
Is more Jay

1795
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:53,536
That didn't have political

1796
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:00,704
I don't think so but if I were

1797
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:05,824
You know what you might be right he was just trying to kill as many people as you could

1798
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:11,200
He chose that seat or not because of the Batman thing but because

1799
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:15,552
Yeah he played up the theme

1800
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,088
But

1801
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:24,000
The point that I want to make the Unabomber

1802
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,024
Is that

1803
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,560
Ruby Ridge

1804
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,840
With that

1805
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:30,144
You have the luxury of

1806
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:30,912
They

1807
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:34,752
General consciousness of thinking of those not as

1808
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,776
As right-wing terrorist

1809
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,080
Those are not

1810
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,872
The same thing as

1811
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:42,176
The way that we think about any kind of

1812
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,504
Mass shooting with a Muslim

1813
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,272
Involved with it

1814
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,296
It's always

1815
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,320
Terror

1816
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:51,648
White people can pull these right-wing terror attack

1817
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,184
Text which are the most

1818
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,000
Common form of terrorism in the United

1819
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,048
White people

1820
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,584
Doing right-wing murders

1821
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:04,448
Yap the most common form of terrorism pepin's a bit even though he brings up these

1822
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,984
Very similar

1823
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,520
Right-wing terror attack

1824
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,080
You don't associate the two together

1825
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:13,920
Because he gets to pull this stuff on dylann roof as

1826
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,320
A possible false flag

1827
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,112
But

1828
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,904
It's never then brought back

1829
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:24,672
Back to the fact that it

1830
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,952
What is the best camera

1831
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:26,976
Terrorism

1832
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,256
As

1833
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,816
It's the same bulshit

1834
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,120
But the luxury of

1835
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,936
Murdering is

1836
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:36,704
You get to

1837
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,984
Each one is if it's

1838
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:44,384
Individual

1839
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:48,224
Privilege to a certain extent but I also think I slightly disagree with you

1840
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,248
Okay

1841
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:53,600
Adjust in the sense that I don't think Dylan roof head evolve

1842
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:56,672
I think he from everything that I've read about him

1843
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,440
Was

1844
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:00,256
Is just a radicalized bigot

1845
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:03,072
Like I think he was just

1846
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:09,472
Not in the same way it was wrong about a lot of stuff

1847
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:12,032
Most of what motivated him was

1848
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,568
A feeling that most

1849
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,872
The work of the government

1850
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,664
Was oppressive

1851
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:24,320
Maybe it's just because it directly involves the government

1852
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:30,976
As it moves like just for cultural

1853
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,512
Situation

1854
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,840
More along the lines of

1855
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,680
Exactly

1856
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,984
I don't see any way that you can

1857
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,032
A specific

1858
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:46,080
If you can go into a black church

1859
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,360
And kill those p

1860
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,640
Without

1861
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,920
Having fall of

1862
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:50,944
The political connotations

1863
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:56,320
Is involved let me defend myself slightly on my

1864
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:59,392
I think that was second state

1865
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:01,696
Second stage in his motivation

1866
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:06,048
Cuz he wanted to start a race war but the reason he wanted to

1867
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,448
Clams

1868
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,984
How to start a race war

1869
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,752
But

1870
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:18,592
The Third Step Beyond that is to reform the government that

1871
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:21,408
Should be a pressing Blackmore or whatever

1872
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:24,480
But that's secondary to

1873
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,320
Where is with Timothy McVeigh ice

1874
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:30,368
Sincerely believe from everything I understand

1875
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,160
His primary motivation

1876
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:33,696
Against directly

1877
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:34,976
The state of the government

1878
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,256
And so

1879
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:41,888
Yep what's the point

1880
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:43,168
He's exactly that

1881
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,984
Okay you are looking into these things

1882
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,264
Specifically enough

1883
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,800
To find the difference

1884
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,104
Now

1885
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,408
You go to a new story today

1886
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,456
A Muslim person

1887
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,480
Kills Christian

1888
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,784
Or a Muslim person

1889
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,856
Blows up a

1890
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:04,928
Right

1891
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,488
Are those going to be research

1892
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,256
Thoroughly

1893
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,560
Or they both going to be tied to

1894
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:14,400
Islamic terrorism

1895
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:17,728
Reporting as a whole

1896
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:20,032
Certainly in the same way that I'm looking at

1897
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:25,408
That is but culturally you're right.

1898
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,200
Yes of course you would because

1899
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,224
Because I would

1900
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,760
In the same way

1901
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:32,320
But the point is in the larger consciousness

1902
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:35,648
They would be lumped together where is these two are not

1903
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:43,584
Because we have a slight disagreement but

1904
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,608
Mostly agree

1905
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,144
But let's

1906
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,680
Let's now

1907
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,216
Take a moment

1908
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:50,496
Ethan parsley

1909
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,824
Because we're done with the Charleston portion of the show

1910
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:58,432
Charleston future episode

1911
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,200
But

1912
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:01,504
For now for the rest of this episode

1913
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,552
To cleanse your palate

1914
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,088
I have a quip here

1915
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:08,928
We're just going to listen to owls murder peacocks

1916
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:15,840
A clip of Alex

1917
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:23,264
Breyer hour and 45 minutes of a show I just want to listen to this

1918
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:29,664
I don't think he's telling the truth about any of that but

1919
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:36,576
For no reason

1920
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:42,976
Go ahead

1921
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,840
Image lb-5 cops

1922
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:49,376
Do you want to do something

1923
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:52,960
Make a swing

1924
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:02,432
He watched the show

1925
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:08,832
No I think it's that scene with bird from The Wire

1926
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,720
Cannot tell the difference between

1927
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:18,048
It's not. But at the same time

1928
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:27,520
What does soda the movie

1929
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,288
Kelso

1930
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,592
You got a small dick Alex

1931
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,184
Department

1932
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:51,584
Take a rest assured

1933
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,912
Crime in sports

1934
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,264
But in the final equation

1935
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,592
The police

1936
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,152
Is about bringing chaos

1937
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,712
No one wants a war with the police

1938
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,528
Nobody

1939
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:15,136
Even militant groups don't want a war with the police

1940
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:19,488
No one wants

1941
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,768
If you push pee

1942
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,072
They will think

1943
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,608
This is the only

1944
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,376
Can I have

1945
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:26,912
That's it

1946
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:30,496
That's what it is nobody wants this what people want is justice

1947
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:33,056
Yeah if that f******

1948
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,592
Murderer

1949
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,384
Who killed Terrence crunch

1950
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,920
The terrorist

1951
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:39,968
Reply

1952
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:43,552
If you went to prison for life

1953
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,600
Nobody would be like

1954
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:49,952
Get all the cops people would be celebrating because they

1955
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,232
Feel like f***

1956
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:57,632
We can trust the justice system a little bit more that would be the celebration it wouldn't be

1957
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,400
Mitch goes to jail

1958
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:01,216
It would be that thankfully

1959
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:01,984
We can

1960
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:04,800
Finally trust the justice system a little bit

1961
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,592
That's it

1962
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,128
Nobody wants

1963
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,920
Nobody wants to kill cops

1964
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:12,736
Really don't want to be killed

1965
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:13,760
Yeah

1966
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:17,856
It's lacking in Alex Jones understand

1967
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:20,416
The world

1968
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,512
Phase of this

1969
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,792
June 18th

1970
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:26,560
Episode

1971
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,328
In 2050

1972
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:30,656
Every mention the reason that I went back

1973
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,960
Forgotten

1974
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,240
That trumps

1975
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,008
Announcement

1976
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:36,800
The Charleston shooting were so close

1977
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,080
Together

1978
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:40,384
Not as well as a real surprise to me

1979
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:43,968
Just something that I knew we needed to cover if we were going to be talking about

1980
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,344
Sacrifice

1981
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:51,648
Launch

1982
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,672
Trump into the

1983
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:57,792
16

1984
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,840
And then on the 17th was

1985
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:00,608
The Charleston

1986
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:03,168
And also on the 17th

1987
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:03,936
He said

1988
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:05,216
That comment

1989
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,496
What about the Mexican

1990
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,288
Yeah

1991
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,568
The bring the rapist

1992
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,592
I'm sure some of them

1993
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,944
I'm paraphrasing.

1994
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:20,320
The reason that I am the reason that I embarked on this

1995
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,600
Exploration

1996
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:25,184
Analysis is because I wanted to know where

1997
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:27,744
Down the line Alex

1998
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,560
Not as my primary

1999
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,328
Focus

2000
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:33,888
In this investigation I will find the exact day

2001
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,424
Haha

2002
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,192
Understand

2003
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,728
Maybe a little more

2004
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,520
Probably not but I'm going to try

2005
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,568
You will find the exact day

2006
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:47,968
You will also write the date and s*** on your way probably you will have luster my blood

2007
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:51,040
I'll have my people take you out of here

2008
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,600
Yeah then I'll be like I got it

2009
01:43:55,392 --> 01:44:01,536
So then the show will be very proud Alex Jones so mad

2010
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,560
Kobe Crazy

2011
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:07,936
What I did find in this episode which it like I said

2012
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,216
Is 2 days after

2013
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,008
Trump has announced his candidacy

2014
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:15,360
He ends the show with an interview with a guy named Larry Nichols

2015
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,152
Are you aware of Larry nickel

2016
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:20,480
I don't know

2017
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,064
Is

2018
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,600
Call f***

2019
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,392
Already

2020
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:30,208
Alright alright

2021
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,232
Let's do this

2022
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,376
I'll get to sit down I'm going to buckle into my chair and we're going to f****** make it through Clinton inside or both

2023
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:43,776
Let's go as Alex says maybe 20 to 30

2024
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,336
Because

2025
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,128
They

2026
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:53,248
Write the reason that I think this interview is incredibly important is because

2027
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,272
Hugh

2028
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,040
Support

2029
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:55,808
Trump

2030
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,344
Is clearly

2031
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,368
Face on a

2032
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,136
Hatred of hell

2033
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,184
Well that was

2034
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,768
Yeah but we can we can that was large-scale support

2035
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,840
Crystallized

2036
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:08,864
Trumpism Oz

2037
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,400
2 days before this

2038
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,424
He has no end

2039
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:16,544
He has not mentioned him at all now he has to Alex

2040
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,568
From Priscilla Joe

2041
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:21,920
In the same way that that interview with Reverend Childress

2042
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:23,712
With transformational

2043
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:26,272
And Alex is being able to call it a false flag

2044
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:27,808
This interview

2045
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,088
With Larry Nichols

2046
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,112
I believe

2047
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,160
Is fully transformative

2048
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,696
And sets the stage

2049
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:35,488
For Alex

2050
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,024
As a potential

2051
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,328
This interview isn't

2052
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,608
Credibly f*****-up

2053
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:43,936
Scary

2054
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:47,008
And throughout the course

2055
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,312
Just to Larry Nichols is

2056
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,080
It's going to

2057
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,104
To become even worse

2058
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:53,664
I'm going to let the first quit play

2059
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:57,248
You can see the beginnings of the interview

2060
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:59,296
What this guy is all about

2061
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:09,280
Years ago

2062
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,072
Another program

2063
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,376
Stop.

2064
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:18,240
Guillain-Barre was using if you'll recall Alex gets Jackson

2065
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:21,824
Jesse Jackson wants to smoke supposed to start

2066
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:24,896
Major city

2067
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:28,480
Marshall home

2068
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:34,880
Once I get the provisional government

2069
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,720
We've got problems

2070
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,840
You are so right it's not about race Alex

2071
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:51,520
It's going on is about

2072
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,296
What's going on today

2073
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:05,344
You have to be so careful

2074
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,672
So very careful because anytime

2075
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,696
You know

2076
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:19,168
Total chaos

2077
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:22,240
All bets are off

2078
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,032
And whoever

2079
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:32,480
Collapses they become king or queen

2080
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:35,040
His

2081
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:36,576
So

2082
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:38,112
That is like

2083
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:39,648
Whoever's in power

2084
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,208
Finally

2085
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:44,000
Trump is in power

2086
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:47,072
What's not yet that's not there

2087
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:49,120
Larry Nichols

2088
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:54,496
Southern Accents telling me it's not about race

2089
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,176
Yeah I have a Southern accent at the very least

2090
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,200
Hide

2091
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:11,392
Foghorn Leghorn telling you it's not about the chickenpox

2092
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,672
If the ice always

2093
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,208
F******

2094
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:16,000
Want that race war

2095
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,280
So much to say

2096
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,048
Oh well

2097
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,328
It's going to start the tit-for-tat

2098
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:25,472
Then we're going to be justified it's just going to start the war and its back and forth and then

2099
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,752
We don't have a choice

2100
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:31,616
In the way they always presented his black do something

2101
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:34,688
Respond whenever it's

2102
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:38,272
It's never about the systematic racism what's going on

2103
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,552
What causes

2104
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,344
Black people too

2105
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:42,880
Mostly

2106
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:44,416
Just Pro

2107
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:49,024
It doesn't cause murders but it causes

2108
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:50,560
Essentially Proto

2109
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:51,584
Nobody is

2110
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:55,424
Protest because she is going so great

2111
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:59,264
I know it's protesting because they want

2112
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:02,080
No sew

2113
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:04,640
I agree with you Larry is bad opt

2114
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:14,112
Because it was nonsense insist but like Vince Foster getting hurt

2115
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:21,536
Doubt about like Vince Foster's murder

2116
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,584
Larry Nichols along

2117
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:29,472
We need to stop calling it Vince Foster

2118
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,496
Murder

2119
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:31,520
Sorry

2120
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:33,824
Ci3

2121
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:40,224
Yeah you're already on the defensive by calling it Vince Foster's murder

2122
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,504
Vince Foster

2123
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:47,904
Your suicide is very suspicious not suspicious at all suicide

2124
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:54,048
We're in the same ways of making that one dude

2125
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:55,328
I wasn't going to say his name

2126
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:57,120
F*** you if you think that matter

2127
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:59,680
But it's the same way that there

2128
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:01,984
Once you frame the conversation that way

2129
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:05,056
Before I even start talking to you

2130
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:08,128
I'm on the defense

2131
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,152
Did kill himself

2132
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:13,760
Seth Rich was murdered was murdered

2133
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:16,320
Seth Rich was murdered

2134
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:19,392
I agree middle different

2135
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:22,976
Either contextualizing his actual murder in a bad way

2136
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:25,280
As opposed to invented

2137
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:28,352
Conspiracy

2138
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:31,424
It was a murder because of

2139
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:38,336
What's more important is that Larry is coming on the show and a very specific

2140
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,360
For Alex

2141
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:44,992
It's incredibly f***** up and I think it's

2142
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:47,296
You can see it if you watch the video

2143
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,320
Of this episode

2144
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:50,624
You can see Alex start

2145
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,392
To get it

2146
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,928
You can see the pieces in

2147
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,208
The cogs in his brain

2148
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,744
Start to

2149
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,024
Move

2150
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:59,072
This clip

2151
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,608
Is really where

2152
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,656
Like you can you can see it in the

2153
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,472
Timer

2154
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,520
I am the savior of the world

2155
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,080
So you think this is a full-on Jesus comp

2156
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:15,456
Listen to this clip and tell me I'm wrong

2157
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:21,856
These people have certain goals they want in their going to get them and the reason Alex I think contesta

2158
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:38,496
For where they're going

2159
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:44,384
Right now what they want is to get absolute

2160
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,664
Government

2161
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:48,992
Because once you control

2162
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:53,600
They want to move us

2163
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:59,232
YouTube.

2164
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:05,632
Bernie Sanders a socialist

2165
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:16,896
Take the Middle East

2166
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:23,296
20 years ago

2167
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:26,624
Stabilize the Middle East

2168
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,928
That was a hard sell

2169
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:35,328
Let's pause there for just a second

2170
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:39,424
Figure out how to achieve that goal

2171
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:45,824
Automation

2172
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:55,552
Stephen Miller is writing that speech

2173
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:56,832
That's insane I don't

2174
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:57,600
Nothing is real

2175
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:01,952
So I mean

2176
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:02,720
Which is going to bring

2177
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,488
Is altogether

2178
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,304
Noted

2179
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,352
Race-baiting Muslim hater

2180
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:11,168
Boys in the Middle East

2181
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:12,448
That's their end goal

2182
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:17,568
Congratulations you can just do nothing even started

2183
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,872
Before America was even like

2184
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:23,456
Kernel of an idea people's mind the Middle East

2185
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:24,224
In trouble

2186
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,016
Like in the Bible is in trouble

2187
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,832
In the Quran

2188
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:29,600
Contrived

2189
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:35,232
But now the end of this clip get to my point

2190
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:36,000
About Alex

2191
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,536
And his

2192
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,328
Supposed place in the world

2193
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:42,400
Moving our way

2194
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:45,984
Hillary

2195
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:52,384
Republican nomination for the Republican

2196
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,200

Ready get on the bowl of lightning

2198
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:02,112
Get the Tea Party

2199

Together

2200
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:04,928
Stop it

2201
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,208
Jesus

2202
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:07,232
F****** Christ

2203
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:08,256
Sleazy there

2204
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:10,304
That was that was the call to action

2205
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,840
Ferrara

2206
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:14,400
Hero's journey

2207
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:15,936
That was the called action

2208
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:21,056
Joseph Campbell straight out of the f****** Central Casting

2209
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,872
So now it's time to talk about Larry

2210
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,408
Who is this

2211
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,480
The old man on the phone

2212
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:29,248
F******

2213
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:32,064
Just personification of old white

2214
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:36,672
Southern privileged white was with

2215
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:41,536
Bill Clinton from the beginning from before he was ever in office

2216
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:43,584
Right so he's Arkansas.

2217
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,192
That

2218
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:49,472
There's no evidence

2219
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,264
Set his relationship with

2220
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,592
Of Arkansas

2221
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:57,920
He was hired by Bill Clinton

2222
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:59,712
In 1988

2223
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:03,808
He was hired as the marketing director for the Arkansas development Finance

2224
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:04,576
Authority

2225
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,136
The Associated Press reported that

2226
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:07,904
He made

2227
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:08,928
600

2228
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:12,000
42 long distance calls on State

2229
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:13,024
On behalf of

2230
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,560
Nicaragua

2231
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:21,984
These calls were to Nicaragua

2232
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:26,080
Two senators and politicians who supported the contras

2233
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,616
For real

2234
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:31,456
Cheap 142 calls that are easily trained

2235
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,992
Because of this

2236
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,016
Clinton fired

2237
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:38,624
Immediately

2238
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:43,232
Insider Nichols Insider Nichols

2239
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:46,560
Making too many clothes phone calls

2240
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:49,888
Nichols Clinton for improper dismissal

2241
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,680
And use this as a platform

2242
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:53,984
During his 1990 re-election

2243
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:57,824
Much of what we know now is the Clinton conspiracies

2244
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,104
Come directly

2245
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,384
From Larry nickel

2246
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,176
Almost all of

2247
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:04,736
Really

2248
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:10,880
Yep the idea of the Mena Arkansas airport the drug-running that was going through that at all came from him

2249
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:16,256
He brought forth a bunch of women who bill was having affairs with some of them real some of them not

2250
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:19,584
On January 10th which before we go any further

2251
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,608
Nobody's

2252
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:27,008
Nobody here between the two of you between the two of us is going to say that Phil Clinton is not

2253
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,824
Mostly

2254
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:30,848
Yeah totally

2255
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:36,224
Super arepas

2256
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,808
Even really terrible people can be the victims of misinformation

2257
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:46,208
Hi I would like to be responsible for the things that he has done

2258
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:46,976
To be held responsible

2259
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:50,048
Possible

2260
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,840
The stuff that's not true is

2261
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:55,936
Absolutely irresponsible

2262
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:56,704
Absolutely

2263
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:03,104
So in January or January 25th 1990

2264
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:03,872
Bill Clinton

2265
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:09,248
He said it is time to call the fight I have with Bill Clinton over

2266
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:12,320
I set out to destroy him for what I believed happened

2267
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:14,368
Interesting

2268
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:17,696
And wound up with

2269
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:20,000
In the long run certainly

2270
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:27,936
Yeah that's right

2271
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:29,984
Right-wing radio show

2272
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:36,384
Pete Santilli for Bill and Hillary

2273
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:39,712
Committed murders

2274
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:40,736
So hold on

2275
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,624
They sent me overseas to kill people for them

2276
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:48,672
I'm told me it was for the good of the country

2277
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:52,768
So when they asked me to do it for them in the states it's no different

2278
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,328
The real truth is I Did It For The Money

2279
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:58,912
And I didn't even give a s*** about the women I beat in the man I murdered

2280
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:03,520
The clintons are bad people hold on

2281
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:06,592
Sports

2282
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:09,408
The clintons are bad people and bad things for them

2283
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:14,528
I had to live with all the with that for all these years and I just don't care anymore who knows it

2284
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:17,856
How's that quote grab you

2285
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:19,904
Struggle with that internal

2286
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:20,928
Problem

2287
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:25,792
You killed a bunch of oversees the then I didn't hear it I don't really care

2288
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:30,656
Yeah I assume

2289
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:31,936
But he was in the military

2290
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:39,872
Sure exactly but that's straight-up murders

2291
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:42,944
He didn't care

2292
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:45,760
But until then

2293
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:47,040
I had to live with

2294
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:49,088
No clearly you did not

2295
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:53,184
Event that was on that was in 2013 on a right-wing radio show

2296
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:56,512
He was interviewed by Mother Jones

2297
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:58,048
2050

2298
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,352
April 21st

2299
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:02,912
Physical

2300
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:05,216
Of the original band of Clinton hunt

2301
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:07,264
There's only nickels kept up the ruse

2302
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:09,824
Doing interviews with fringe right-wing radio host

2303
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:13,152
Even posting in 2013 that he had been bills personal Hitman

2304
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:15,200
Which

2305
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:17,248
And wouldn't have said if he hadn't been on

2306
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:28,768
Mario's has not taken a few Vicodin and then admitted

2307
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:32,864
What look

2308
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:35,936
He who is without

2309
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:42,848
That's really the first pill right

2310
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:45,408
Oh God

2311
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:52,832
Infuriating she is a murderer

2312
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:54,880
Who are the pill problem

2313
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,416
BB

2314
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,488
Worst case scenario

2315
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:00,256
Which is the most

2316
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:01,024
Realistic

2317
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:05,888
Scenario he's a complete liar and a drug addict

2318
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:09,216
Who was fired by Bill Clinton

2319
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:10,496
Mmm started

2320
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:12,032
Trying to ruin his life

2321
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,568
Ain't because everyone

2322
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:16,384
Not everyone but a lot of people hate him

2323
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:18,176
Liberalism

2324
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:18,944
Hate Hillary

2325
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:24,320
Because of that they

2326
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,696
Oh no yeah all this s*** is true

2327
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:30,464
Vince Foster

2328
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:31,488
Mina

2329
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:32,768
All this

2330
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:34,048
And it's all coming from

2331
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:34,816
This a******

2332
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:36,608
I want to see if

2333
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:37,376
Two more things

2334
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:41,216
So I read this entire motherjones

2335
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:41,984
Article

2336
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:45,568
This article was from

2337
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:46,848
April 2015

2338
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,896
Which if you're keeping track

2339
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,176
Is 2 months

2340
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:52,736
Before the episode of Alex Jones Show that weird

2341
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,016
I am keeping

2342
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,880
The things that we've heard him say on Alex Jones Show up till this point

2343
02:00:59,136 --> 02:00:59,648
Have been

2344
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:02,208
I'm pretty harshly anti Hillary Clinton

2345
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:05,536
Yes very much about how they're going to destroy the world

2346
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:09,888
It's him keeping up the and a couple of the other clips that I'm going to play later

2347
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:10,656
Really

2348
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:11,680
Bring into Focus

2349
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:14,752
How he thinks that Hillary Clinton is going to destroy the world

2350
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:15,776
Now

2351
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:19,360
And it's April 5th 2015 article

2352
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:20,896
Few months before

2353
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:21,920
Here is a quote

2354
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:23,712
This is just a direct quote from the Arctic

2355
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:26,016
But something strange

2356
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:26,784
Larry

2357
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:31,904
After six years of watching Barack Hussein Obama cower in the face of islamist

2358
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:34,464
Nichols believes the family he spent

2359
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,232
Two decades

2360
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,768
Touring is cold-blooded crook

2361
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:38,816
Might just be the only people who

2362
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:39,584
Can save the country

2363
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:43,168
I'm not saying I like Hillary

2364
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:43,936
You hear me

2365
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:45,216
He said defensively

2366
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:47,520
I'm not saying I like Hillary Rodham Clinton

2367
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:50,080
I'm not saying anything I've said I take back

2368
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,104
But God help me

2369
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:56,992
I'm going to have to stand up and tell conservative Patriots we have no choice but to give Hillary her shot

2370
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:59,552
I know she won't flinch

2371
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:00,320
He continued

2372
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:04,672
That's a mean son-of-a-b**** woman that can be laying over for people and say

2373
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:06,720
He paraphrased her now Infamous response

2374
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:10,048
Austell Congressional questioning

2375
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:10,816
Olivia

2376
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:12,352
What the hell difference does it make

2377
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:14,144
He was against

2378
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,680
Clinton because of Whitewater

2379
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:18,496
He's not voting for her because of Benghazi

2380
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:22,080
Because she was so cold-blooded about

2381
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:24,128
He thinks you'll be able to take out Muslim

2382
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,944
This is a farce

2383
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:28,992
Beyonce

2384
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:33,088
2 months before this b******* and a publication

2385
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:36,160
Holyshit

2386
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:38,976
Yeah this is the Thin Man with Nick and Nora

2387
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:40,256
This is just f******

2388
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:41,024
Ridiculous

2389
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:43,584
Through the Looking-Glass propaganda

2390
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:46,912
We're not even

2391
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:54,080
They just say whatever is politically expedient whatever like

2392
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,408
I shouldn't

2393
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:59,456
Bring psychopath into it because that's a very

2394
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:00,480
Cific diagnosis

2395
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:02,016
Record label

2396
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:04,576
What's a jackalope

2397
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:06,368
It is this type of Opera

2398
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,160
To have no con

2399
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:09,696
Nope not at all

2400
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:12,768
Who will just like if you're getting any press

2401
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,304
Say whatever it is

2402
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,352
You think the Press wants to hear

2403
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:17,376
To bring

2404
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:20,448
Back to you

2405
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:23,264
Even if it's not positive because

2406
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,056
This Mother Jones reporter cam

2407
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:32,480
Hotels

2408
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:38,880
Toby it's not even a positive light it's just how do I sell my personal brand

2409
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:41,952
I just want to I just want you to talk about

2410
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,512
And so I'm going to do whatever it is that

2411
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:45,280
Makes you talk about

2412
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,864
You don't think

2413
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:49,632
The the clintons

2414
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:50,656
AR

2415
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:51,680
Great

2416
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:53,728
Whole Lotta problems

2417
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:56,544
And we have said this even on the show

2418
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:57,824
Bill Clinton deserve

2419
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,104
Do we charge for war cry

2420
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:00,128
Absolutely

2421
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:04,224
Presidents for the last 40 years

2422
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:06,528
But at the same time

2423
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,576
He doesn't deserve the touring

2424
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:09,600
But he's gotten

2425
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:10,880
Because of all of the

2426
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:11,648
He's fake

2427
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:13,952
It's August fiction fiction

2428
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:14,720
And Hillary

2429
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:16,768
Get it way worse

2430
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,560
Because she's a woman

2431
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:19,840
And because

2432
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:20,864
She's irrelevant

2433
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:22,400
The bills not relevant

2434
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:26,752
He can't become president kind of a neutral threat

2435
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,056
Hillary is the one

2436
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:30,080
And in the 20s

2437
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:30,848
16 election

2438
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:31,872
She was

2439
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:32,896
Basically

2440
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:34,176
The one who took

2441
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:35,200
All the Brunt

2442
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:37,760
For all of these conspiracies that mostly

2443
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:38,528
Had to do a bell

2444
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,552
Ryan Moses

2445
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:40,576
Confirm Larry Nichols

2446
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:43,904
Well the fact

2447
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:44,672
The fascinating

2448
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:45,952
Everything is that

2449
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:46,976
Part of the reason

2450
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:48,256
Who invent so much

2451
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:51,328
Is because most of the real s*** that

2452
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:53,120
That you would complain about Hillary like

2453
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:55,424
Part of the reason that you have to invent

2454
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:58,752
Is because

2455
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:00,032
The real stuff

2456
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,824
That you and I just like to

2457
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:05,408
That stuff that your guy is guilty

2458
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:10,784
True disliked about Hillary the the super predators

2459
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:12,064
The racism

2460
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:14,112
All of this

2461
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,232
The dollar store

2462
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:21,024
That kind of

2463
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,072
Yeah

2464
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:23,840
Dislike

2465
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:25,632
Because it is the legitimate credit

2466
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:28,192
And if you're on the right

2467
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:29,728
You dislike that stuff

2468
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,264
That is a legitimate credit

2469
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:35,104
But you have to take her because

2470
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:35,872
Your guy

2471
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:40,736
Did all of that and more you have to find ways around

2472
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:41,504
Logical

2473
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:44,832
To say like

2474
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:45,600
Look

2475
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:47,904
They all did that

2476
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:51,232
These Clinton's did worse

2477
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:55,840
Hillary took millions of dollars from

2478
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,984
But Trump

2479
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:06,592
So so it's that kind of it's that extra thing because if you just

2480
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:09,408
If you just criticizing Hillary for the reasons that she

2481
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:10,432
Criticize

2482
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:13,248
Your guy doesn't look as good

2483
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:14,272
He doesn't look as good

2484
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,296
Kind of falls apart

2485
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,320
It does

2486
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:19,392
Because

2487
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:22,976
We laid out Larry Nichols

2488
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:25,280
Alex

2489
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:26,048
You

2490
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:28,352
You have to do it

2491
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:30,144
If it isn't for you mobilizing

2492
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:32,960
All of the Patriots

2493
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:36,544
Will die the rest of this just becomes

2494
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:38,592
A Obi-Wan

2495
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:39,360
You're only

2496
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:40,896
Yeah only hope

2497
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:43,456
Like I really think

2498
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:44,224
This is foundation

2499
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:46,784
This is a moment where Alex

2500
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:47,808
Kind of

2501
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,624
Gets it going to listen to this clip

2502
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:52,928
Okay here's the next one

2503
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:57,024
This is Larry Nichols explaining that everything comes down to

2504
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:57,792
This

2505
02:06:58,048 --> 02:06:58,560
26

2506
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:04,704
15 election

2507
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:08,288
How do you win an election you control your opposition

2508
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:11,360
4 players

2509
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:58,208
I got you got to fight I got to do what I don't want to do

2510
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:04,608
I'm 65 years old I want to stay somewhere and say hey

2511
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:08,960
Richard

2512
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:15,360
Dialogue

2513
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:28,672
Another election Alice

2514
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,744
Free they're not

2515
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:35,072
Either vote for who they say

2516
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:40,960
Got it

2517
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:42,496
Two similar to what happen

2518
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,640
Like it here

2519
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:49,920
Here's the thing that

2520
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:50,688
Did happen

2521
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:51,456
Today

2522
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:54,272
In Iran's reformist party

2523
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,320
Destroy

2524
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:59,136
Murdered

2525
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:02,720
Be a close election

2526
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:05,024
What they found out was that

2527
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,048
People came

2528
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:07,584
And vote

2529
02:09:08,096 --> 02:09:08,608
Droves

2530
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:10,144
To make sure that

2531
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:13,472
Iran opened up like they wanted and and Iran

2532
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:19,872
Similar to pre-1982 influencer

2533
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:23,200
Call Mike Wells

2534
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:25,760
But but that is that is the interest

2535
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:27,296
Is it there is that

2536
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:28,576
Liver of Hope

2537
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:30,880
Dang that's

2538
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:31,648
The 2018

2539
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:35,744
But

2540
02:09:36,512 --> 02:09:39,584
There is no part of cynical that doesn't think

2541
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:40,864
Gerrymandering

2542
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:42,144
Has only gotten stronger

2543
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,192
Them they will still retain

2544
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:48,800
No matter what regardless of whether or not we're going to kill you with a bow

2545
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:49,824
It's more just like

2546
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:52,384
Nope you're not allowed to vote we're going to resist

2547
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:56,480
This very strategically how to make sure our party

2548
02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:00,320
Let's be clear

2549
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:03,648
In some ways both parties are very guilty of

2550
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,672
What is

2551
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:06,208
If you look at the history

2552
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:07,488
Black conservative

2553
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:08,256
Republican

2554
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:09,024
Have

2555
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,304
Been way more

2556
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:13,120
Of course but both parties do it

2557
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:17,472
So

2558
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,240
Venice

2559
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:20,032
Another important thing that needs to be said

2560
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:21,824
Neither of us are

2561
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:23,104
Lovers of democrat

2562
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:24,640
Regency

2563
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:25,664
Hate

2564
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:27,712
The state of the Republic

2565
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:28,992
We're

2566
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:31,552
Weird I'm not going to say

2567
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:35,136
Because as much as our politics overlap

2568
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:36,160
I know there are plenty

2569
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:38,720
Things that I believe

2570
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:42,048
Privately

2571
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:46,656
To me it is that

2572
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:48,704
The Democratic Party

2573
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:49,472
To off

2574
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:52,032
Allows themselves

2575
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:52,800
Tubi

2576
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:54,336
Drawn

2577
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:55,360
Further right

2578
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:58,944
As the Redcoats further right

2579
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:05,600
Get that window rather rather than in the tug of war

2580
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:08,416
They get closer and closer to the middle

2581
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:09,440
And think that's fine

2582
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:13,280
Yeah but that's exactly the that same thing about

2583
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:14,816
The last

2584
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,120
Be overly empathic

2585
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:19,424
I think it's more like

2586
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,472
Not not with the left I mean with

2587
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:22,240
The Democrats

2588
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:24,032
With the Democratic Party

2589
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:25,824
There is the idea of

2590
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:26,848
Pragmatism

2591
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:29,664
As being more important

2592
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:34,272
As opposed to

2593
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:35,296
Becomes a twisted

2594
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:36,064
Warped version

2595
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:36,832
Pragmatism

2596
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:38,112
Like

2597
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:39,648
That nationalistic

2598
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:42,208
You know disenfranchised boat

2599
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,232
That whole thing

2600
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,840
Like there's a reason that Bernie captured a lot of those

2601
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:49,120
People

2602
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:49,888
Because

2603
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:51,168
We were primed

2604
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:52,448
For that kind of

2605
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:53,472
Hey

2606
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:54,496
We've been f*****

2607
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:55,520
Dover

2608
02:11:55,776 --> 02:11:57,824
And you've helped us f***** people over

2609
02:11:58,336 --> 02:11:59,104
Delta

2610
02:11:59,360 --> 02:11:59,872
Get f*****

2611
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:03,200
So if you had actual

2612
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:04,224
We laid out

2613
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:05,760
A progressive vision

2614
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:08,832
Just like the Obamacare Provisions that people

2615
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:09,600
Keep like

2616
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:11,904
So long as you don't put it next to Obamacare

2617
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,440
A majority of people say

2618
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:22,144
Leo

2619
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:27,776
Far more pragmatic to getting you elected than this imaginary idea of what

2620
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:29,312
Pragmatic

2621
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:31,104
And so that's why we have

2622
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,896
Such a huge disconnect with

2623
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:33,664
The Democratic

2624
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:35,456
Party or perhaps the Democratic

2625
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:36,224
Leadership

2626
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:38,528
I think I think you're correct

2627
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,320
Here's the question

2628
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,880
Nichols you think

2629
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:43,648
Is that

2630
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,232
Germ

2631
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:48,256
That starts

2632
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:52,096
Navigate to the Old Jedi who's coming inside

2633
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:53,632
You're the one who has

2634
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:59,264
You're helping you honestly think it's in the next clip I'm going to play

2635
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:00,800
It's it's

2636
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:02,336
It's a message that's like

2637
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:05,920
You thought your work is done

2638
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:08,736
Nichols nose

2639
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:10,016
How influential Ally

2640
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:14,368
Throwing darts as a wall sang this

2641
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:16,160
Do anybody who may be influential

2642
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:19,488
Or is he just jerking Alex off to be on the show

2643
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:23,840
I know I think Alex considers him

2644
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:24,864
To be a lumen

2645
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:27,680
Alex Nichols

2646
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:29,472
What is my name

2647
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:30,752
I understand

2648
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:37,408
I only explained the dynamic from the other direction right to express that I think

2649
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:38,176
Kono's

2650
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:39,200
Give big dog

2651
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:40,992
Alex

2652
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:42,272
In terms of

2653
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:43,552
Credibility

2654
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:46,880
Okay but at the same time he absolutely knows that Alex has

2655
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:47,904
Does a huge platform

2656
02:13:48,928 --> 02:13:49,952
I'm sure like

2657
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:52,512
He went on that other guys show and said that he was

2658
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:55,072
Trucking killer when he was on pills

2659
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:58,400
Go on anybody's show

2660
02:13:58,656 --> 02:14:01,216
Clearly as Alex inhibitor

2661
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:02,240
Have a

2662
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,776
Decades-long relation

2663
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:10,688
He knows he's watched Infowars grow to the point that it is

2664
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:11,712
As

2665
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:14,272
But maybe maybe the better distillation of

2666
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:17,344
Do you think he

2667
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:20,160
Trying to use Alex

2668
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:23,744
Do you think he's actually do you think he actually believes

2669
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:27,840
Is he is he jerking Alex off

2670
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:33,472
Now I can manipulate Alex's follower

2671
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:36,032
Or is he saying Alex

2672
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:40,384
You really do have this influence and I am

2673
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,176
Believe in you

2674
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:42,944
That kind of

2675
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:46,272
This is something that only his therapist could probably answer

2676
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:48,064
If he has a therapist I don't

2677
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:52,160
But

2678
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:55,232
Their global

2679
02:14:55,488 --> 02:15:01,632
Therapist vaccines

2680
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:04,448
Ali is because we look

2681
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:05,728
Like I said

2682
02:15:05,984 --> 02:15:06,496
He

2683
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:07,776
Did Bill Clinton

2684
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:08,800
I meant said

2685
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:11,872
I dropped the lawsuit because

2686
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:15,712
I wanted to destroy him for what I believe happened to me

2687
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:19,040
He claimed to be a hitman

2688
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:21,856
Later was like

2689
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:25,696
Who knows where his actual Center is

2690
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:28,000
Larry is a person who

2691
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:29,280
Lacks credibility

2692
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,048
Because he's

2693
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:31,584
Clearly alive

2694
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,352
In public

2695
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:35,168
Conservative radio shows

2696
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:36,704
I would say

2697
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:39,264
Absolute

2698
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:41,568
I would say that he

2699
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:43,104
Here's why it's difficult

2700
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:45,152
4 months before this

2701
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:46,688
3 months before this

2702
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:51,040
He did that interview got to give Hillary

2703
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:53,088
So who knows

2704
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:53,856
F****** head is at

2705
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:55,136
I think you might

2706
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:55,904
Sylveon

2707
02:15:56,160 --> 02:16:00,256
Quite frankly I have no idea maybe something better

2708
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:02,048
Do we know where he's at now

2709
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:07,168
No I've no idea I wonder if you sound better pills do know that

2710
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:08,448
Quick contradiction

2711
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:10,240
A couple months just

2712
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:11,776
100-percent contradiction

2713
02:16:12,288 --> 02:16:13,568
I have no idea what

2714
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:15,872
But

2715
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:17,920
Igreen

2716
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:19,200
From the interview

2717
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:22,528
Respect Alex Jones is audience

2718
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:23,296
As much

2719
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:25,344
As they can possibly

2720
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:27,392
Help him work towards

2721
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:30,464
His decades-long goal of destroying the Clinton

2722
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:32,256
Okay

2723
02:16:32,512 --> 02:16:35,328
And I think that's

2724
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:36,352
Yeah

2725
02:16:36,608 --> 02:16:39,936
So he said in a previous interview

2726
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:41,472
We should give Hillary

2727
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:46,080
He's still going on Alex Jones with that kind of

2728
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:46,848
In the back of

2729
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:47,616
His head like

2730
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:52,480
Well here's the only reason I'm going to give him a little bit of a wide berth

2731
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:53,504
About that

2732
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,296
Supporting Hillary in the interview

2733
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:59,648
But he believes that she's

2734
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:01,440
Cutthroat cold-blooded

2735
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:02,208
Could

2736
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:02,976
Destroy

2737
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:04,768
These Islamic

2738
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:08,096
But he seems to be afraid of now

2739
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:13,728
If that is rationalization for in that interview

2740
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:15,520
Supporting Hillary

2741
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:17,312
Still does

2742
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:22,432
Kind of match up philosophically with what he saying in his interview what are you saying that like

2743
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:25,248
They're going to try and get Jeb Bush in

2744
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:28,320
If there was an alternative that was

2745
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:32,416
The person who is going to be Cutthroat with these islamist that he imagined

2746
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:35,232
I think he would be on their side

2747
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:38,048
If Trump

2748
02:17:38,304 --> 02:17:40,864
Existed as a logical

2749
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:42,400
Counterexample

2750
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:43,168
On

2751
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:47,008
Exactly so

2752
02:17:47,264 --> 02:17:47,776
Dirt bike

2753
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:50,336
That part doesn't seem to me to be a logical Kanter

2754
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:54,944
Does it does discredit Larry Nichols a bit

2755
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:55,968
Yeah but

2756
02:17:56,224 --> 02:18:02,368
Only in so much as it's like OK Google are just really afraid of Muslims ideological

2757
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:03,392
Somebody who hates mother

2758
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:06,464
It would make sense for him to

2759
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:09,536
Is going to accomplish

2760
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:10,304
The goal

2761
02:18:11,328 --> 02:18:12,096
F****** over my

2762
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:15,424
And at the same time he will accept a deal with the Devil

2763
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:19,776
Cute because he does believe that the clintons are the devil

2764
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:22,592
Accomplish that goal a non-white

2765
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:29,248
Yeah I'd rather deal with these white people I really hate which we all know

2766
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:31,296
The bush is better than to non-whites

2767
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:32,576
And I have no I

2768
02:18:32,832 --> 02:18:34,368
That's from the Farmers Almanac

2769
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:38,976
So like I'm going to play the rest of these clips

2770
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:40,000
Cuz I really think

2771
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:43,840
Most of them are just reinforcing this

2772
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:44,864
Alex Jones

2773
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:45,632
Just getting

2774
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:46,400
His

2775
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:47,424
Mike Brewster

2776
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,960
Sure Shot of I have to say

2777
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:51,264
Save the world

2778
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,824
Inasmuch as he barely interrupt Slayer

2779
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:55,616
Larry just gets

2780
02:18:56,384 --> 02:18:57,408
Free birth to talk

2781
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:58,688
Where is he interrupts

2782
02:18:58,944 --> 02:18:59,456
Everybody

2783
02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:05,344
The only way you get a free birth certificate as if you are sucking Alex Jones

2784
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:06,112
This complex.

2785
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:10,976
You're the one who can save us you are the one I think I cut it out earlier

2786
02:19:11,232 --> 02:19:13,280
Larry Nichols says

2787
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:15,584
You're the only reason I'm alive

2788
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:18,912
Because I came on your show years ago

2789
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:20,192
And I made public

2790
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:24,800
And otherwise the clintons would have killed me

2791
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:28,640
2.0 hide in the sunlight

2792
02:19:28,896 --> 02:19:30,944
Playing into Alex's worst impulse

2793
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:33,504
Anyway

2794
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:35,808
This next clip is actually

2795
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:37,344
Philosophical

2796
02:19:38,112 --> 02:19:38,880
Consistent and

2797
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:48,352
But he is trying to express basically the idea of like this scenario 20 years ago

2798
02:19:49,632 --> 02:19:50,144
Is premise

2799
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,936
Now let him play it out

2800
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:54,496
Because it's a couple months later

2801
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:55,264
Weekend

2802
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:58,848
But also we can be like

2803
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:08,576
That's been dedicated

2804
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:28,032
That's problematic for that

2805
02:20:28,288 --> 02:20:32,896
But again he's not supporting Trump at this point I don't even know what to do

2806
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:35,200
Anymore because

2807
02:20:35,456 --> 02:20:36,992
Exact search

2808
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:40,832
Because just like with everything Trump does

2809
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,880
You can pull a tweet

2810
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:43,648
From 24

2811
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:47,232
Literally

2812
02:20:47,488 --> 02:20:48,256
Everything

2813
02:20:48,768 --> 02:20:49,280
Banana

2814
02:20:49,536 --> 02:20:53,632
Damn so there's no like hypocrisy is no longer an

2815
02:20:55,424 --> 02:20:57,216
It's not really about hypocrisy

2816
02:20:57,472 --> 02:21:00,288
This thing that I find really fascinating about this interview

2817
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,336
Is it lays the foundation

2818
02:21:02,592 --> 02:21:03,104
And for

2819
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:05,664
Alex realizing cancer save the world

2820
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:08,224
To me to me listen to this right now

2821
02:21:08,736 --> 02:21:09,760
It really does

2822
02:21:10,016 --> 02:21:10,784
Crystallize

2823
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:12,576
The facts

2824
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:14,624
And it can no longer be

2825
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:15,648
Speculation

2826
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:16,672
It is the

2827
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:17,440
That

2828
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:18,976
There are

2829
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:22,816
Fleet

2830
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:25,888
Complete full break

2831
02:21:26,144 --> 02:21:26,912
Between reality

2832
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:31,264
Like there's no there's no bridging those gaps

2833
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:34,592
Live in a completely

2834
02:21:34,848 --> 02:21:35,360
Reality

2835
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:37,152
That that idea of like

2836
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:38,176
Well

2837
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:40,224
When Clinton does it it's evil

2838
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:42,016
Even though Trump is doing it

2839
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:43,040
He's not really doing

2840
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:47,392
It was only evil if Clinton did it it's really evil of trump does it

2841
02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:49,696
And Trump does it it's because it's in service

2842
02:21:49,952 --> 02:21:51,232
To this larger thing

2843
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:55,584
Which means that it doesn't matter what he's doing so long as it's in service

2844
02:21:56,864 --> 02:22:00,448
But Clinton was doing what Trump is doing but in service to this other

2845
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:01,984
Like

2846
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:05,056
Breakdown

2847
02:22:05,312 --> 02:22:05,824
He's really interests

2848
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:07,104
Because

2849
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:13,504
The people who were listening to Alex Jones because they listen to him

2850
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:14,528
Alex

2851
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:17,088
Is reporting these things

2852
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:19,648
From sources Like Larry Nichols

2853
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:22,464
Or in the past we talked about Larry C Johnson

2854
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:24,512
Discredited

2855
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:31,168
Hilarious

2856
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:36,800
And this is where the board with thread

2857
02:22:37,056 --> 02:22:40,128
Is going to come in eventually once I put it on my wall

2858
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:45,248
Erase markers are is

2859
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:47,552
It's going

2860
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:49,088
To come down to like

2861
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:52,416
This is a false reality but who's exploiting it

2862
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:54,464
Who's being exploited by it

2863
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:58,048
Right to a certain extent I know Alex Jones is making billions of dollars off

2864
02:22:58,816 --> 02:23:02,144
Nickel

2865
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:03,680
Larry Nichols

2866
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:04,704
Got f*****

2867
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:05,728
Clinton

2868
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:06,496
And fired

2869
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:08,288
For him calling the contras

2870
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,080
Retro

2871
02:23:12,896 --> 02:23:14,176
He took it very personally

2872
02:23:14,432 --> 02:23:19,296
And it's been on a 30-year campaign to destroy them

2873
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:25,696
Yeah sorry this just popped in my head I have various various axes to grind

2874
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:26,976
But if you looked

2875
02:23:29,536 --> 02:23:31,072
Right

2876
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:32,352
Right

2877
02:23:35,424 --> 02:23:36,448
Okay with

2878
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:37,984
The agenda they're pushing

2879
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:39,520
He becomes calm

2880
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:41,056
Listen in that false real

2881
02:23:41,312 --> 02:23:47,456
Well he's happy with their agenda because the reality is created by these weird

2882
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:53,088
Is the facilitator of the false reality

2883
02:23:53,344 --> 02:23:55,136
That exists in the mind of his listener

2884
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:57,184
So basically the people who are they

2885
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:57,952
Do you like

2886
02:23:58,208 --> 02:23:59,744
Progenitors of the virus

2887
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,280
Or the People Like Larry

2888
02:24:05,888 --> 02:24:07,680
I will never forget

2889
02:24:07,936 --> 02:24:08,704
That that's

2890
02:24:09,984 --> 02:24:12,032
Just learn to pronounce words

2891
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:12,800
Meme

2892
02:24:13,056 --> 02:24:13,824
So

2893
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:18,176
I'm becoming ultimately way more fascinated in the idea of

2894
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:19,968
The information funnel

2895
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:22,528
Sources these things come from

2896
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:23,296
2 Outlet

2897
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:25,344
Now granted

2898
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:27,648
Like I'm never going to let him off

2899
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:28,928
The hookies complicit

2900
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:30,208
And a lot of it falls in

2901
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:32,256
Prepackaged narrative

2902
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:35,840
But he would not be able to push it at all

2903
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:36,608
Without

2904
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:39,168
Spain and credibility for people like

2905
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:40,192
The Tulare

2906
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:41,984
Or

2907
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,800
Even foresee pieczenik to Larry's in a pizza

2908
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,128
To Larry's in a play

2909
02:24:50,688 --> 02:24:51,200
Next question

2910
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:54,016
Blows my mind

2911
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:55,296
That I haven't asked

2912
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:57,856
Is Larry Nichols being paid

2913
02:24:59,136 --> 02:25:00,416
Being paid to come on the show

2914
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:05,024
Yeah like

2915
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,048
I've no idea

2916
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:08,864
Does that not does that not change everything

2917
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:10,912
I bet they at least have to sign

2918
02:25:11,424 --> 02:25:12,448
Brightness

2919
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:13,984
There should be making money

2920
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:18,336
So of course

2921
02:25:18,592 --> 02:25:20,128
Nickels would say something

2922
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:22,688
Super positive to Alex Jones

2923
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:23,968
If he's getting paid because

2924
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:25,504
It's a gay man

2925
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:28,064
Maybe I'll get paid down down the line

2926
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,880
I am not I'm not ready to agree with that cuz

2927
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:33,184
Just because I have no evidence of it I don't know

2928
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:37,024
I want now that's the only thing I want I've been on radio shows for

2929
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:37,792
For free

2930
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:38,816
I've signed thing

2931
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:40,096
I have

2932
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:41,120
Have you been on

2933
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:41,888
My name is

2934
02:25:42,144 --> 02:25:48,288
Is Larry Nichols I've been lying the whole time

2935
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:49,056
Southern accent

2936
02:25:49,312 --> 02:25:52,128
Are you actually jhacari

2937
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,688
I've become an animator

2938
02:25:58,784 --> 02:25:59,552
I really want to talk to

2939
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:05,696
I do Nae know what is crazy one of his creator-owned comics

2940
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:11,584
As soon as his voice came up after I said he has a great voice

2941
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:15,168
Your eyebrows both just went well

2942
02:26:17,984 --> 02:26:24,128
Angry boys

2943
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:25,152
Is a comic book

2944
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:28,480
Ryder now

2945
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:29,760
Seems really cool

2946
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:32,064
One of his

2947
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:33,600
Creator-owned comics

2948
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:34,624
Daydream

2949
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:36,928
Which is about

2950
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:37,952
A kid learning to

2951
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:38,720
To deal with this

2952
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,024
And

2953
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:44,096
Like I8 cost

2954
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:49,216
Way more money than I'm willing to give somebody who's been whose works for Infowars

2955
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:49,984
Which is

2956
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,520
Any money at all I'm buying it

2957
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:57,920
Adjusting like a really fascinating for a guy like jhacari

2958
02:26:58,432 --> 02:27:04,576
Lived in the Spanish place now I'm going to buy and we're going to critically deconstructed

2959
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:06,112
MC Cara

2960
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:09,696
Knowledge fight at gmail.com

2961
02:27:10,464 --> 02:27:12,000
Really think he's pretty

2962
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:13,280
Like I Isaac

2963
02:27:13,792 --> 02:27:14,304
Bass

2964
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:16,096
On very little evidence

2965
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:18,656
I think he has a way better head on his shoulders

2966
02:27:18,912 --> 02:27:19,936
Than anybody else

2967
02:27:20,448 --> 02:27:22,496
Thailand

2968
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:24,800
Through most of that interview I just looking like

2969
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:33,504
But if that takes us back to kind of realize the gig Mandy kind of realizes being used as a

2970
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:35,552
Am I might be

2971
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:38,624
Sing a bunch

2972
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:40,416
I think we're all hoping that

2973
02:27:41,184 --> 02:27:42,464
Somebody here in Fort Worth

2974
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,232
And see what's going on

2975
02:27:45,536 --> 02:27:48,608
Well I mean there was that guy who came out on Twitter and said that Alex Jones

2976
02:27:48,864 --> 02:27:49,376
The fraud

2977
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:51,424
All that s***

2978
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:52,448
Those that do it again

2979
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:56,800
Certainly just a matter of the

2980
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:59,616
Clips West Jordan

2981
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:01,920
A couple more clips from O'Leary

2982
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:03,200
What's next

2983
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:04,992
About

2984
02:28:05,504 --> 02:28:06,528
Tyranny

2985
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:07,808
Is about to hit

2986
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:08,832
It's happening

2987
02:28:09,344 --> 02:28:09,856
How so

2988
02:28:10,112 --> 02:28:13,184
Illegals are going to vote

2989
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:19,584
Which is really interesting giving of the 3 million illegals voted

2990
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:21,120
Name from Twitter

2991
02:28:21,376 --> 02:28:23,168
Hey an a****** on Twitter would like

2992
02:28:23,424 --> 02:28:25,472
Buy followers who exploded because of this

2993
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:28,544
But even before

2994
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:29,824
There was this

2995
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:30,848
Laying out of

2996
02:28:31,104 --> 02:28:31,872
Potential

2997
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:34,432
Yes and I think it's really interesting to hear this

2998
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:35,200
From this

2999
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:36,736
Thoroughly be credited

3000
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:39,296
Discredited obvious pill head

3001
02:28:39,552 --> 02:28:40,832
Who's on Alex's show

3002
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:44,160
20 years ago

3003
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:46,976
Could you have believed this could happen

3004
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:57,216
That one other problem one of the things he elements in iron

3005
02:28:59,264 --> 02:29:02,080
Which what we called the broken coalition

3006
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:10,016
In Arkansas

3007
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:19,744
Any people that came out said they were openly gay

3008
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:36,384
What if we got all those little birds together

3009
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:42,528
Immediate

3010
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:49,184
Yeah like a f****** garbage Tyler

3011
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,424
Is working Shaklee like clockwork

3012
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:04,544
The American people Alex all of you

3013
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:07,360
American people

3014
02:30:09,152 --> 02:30:10,688
American

3015
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:17,088
You don't have stood up

3016
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:25,024
Are you going to lose it

3017
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:26,560
Understand

3018
02:30:27,072 --> 02:30:33,216
Stand Tall in going to tell the truth

3019
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:38,848
Forever

3020
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:42,944
Domesticated

3021
02:30:44,736 --> 02:30:48,576
Boss Hog hair neglect

3022
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,816
We've been over those two lies

3023
02:30:59,072 --> 02:31:02,400
Alex is unable to even really engaged

3024
02:31:02,656 --> 02:31:04,960
With the lies that Larry Nichols

3025
02:31:05,472 --> 02:31:08,800
He's only able to go back to his waypoints that we've discussed

3026
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:12,128
Obama went overseas

3027
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:14,176
You guys can't have

3028
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:15,712
Air conditioning

3029
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:19,040
Literally about how

3030
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:23,136
Modernization in the third world has to go better than it has gone

3031
02:31:23,648 --> 02:31:26,976
Unsustainable

3032
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:29,792
And we need to do this smarter

3033
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:31,584
You shouldn't

3034
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:33,120
Do all this

3035
02:31:33,376 --> 02:31:35,168
Carpenter

3036
02:31:35,424 --> 02:31:39,520
And the same way you didn't build your business isn't about how hey you dumbass

3037
02:31:39,776 --> 02:31:40,800
Your business

3038
02:31:41,312 --> 02:31:46,176
F*** you in about how hey you dumbass people got to your business by driving on roads

3039
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:50,016
So how they got those f****** roads

3040
02:31:50,272 --> 02:31:51,552
Everything exists within a

3041
02:31:51,808 --> 02:31:53,344
Yeah

3042
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:56,928
This is such a moment where I'm at

3043
02:31:58,208 --> 02:32:00,256
Who the f*** is Alex Jones

3044
02:32:00,512 --> 02:32:01,280
And how is that

3045
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:02,304
Constantly

3046
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,584
See this orbit of

3047
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:04,864
People around Alex

3048
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:06,400
And yet we can't

3049
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:07,936
At least I can

3050
02:32:08,192 --> 02:32:09,728
I can't ever quite

3051
02:32:09,984 --> 02:32:11,520
Pin down where Alex

3052
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:12,544
Is

3053
02:32:13,824 --> 02:32:18,176
I got a better sense of him than you I don't mean that I mean more like

3054
02:32:19,712 --> 02:32:20,992
This this Nichols do

3055
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:22,784
He's pulling some

3056
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:24,064
Some obvious bulshit

3057
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:27,392
Very good like manipulative

3058
02:32:27,648 --> 02:32:33,536
Like all of these different things where you planting these ideas Facehugger style right into Alex Jones

3059
02:32:34,048 --> 02:32:35,840
Charlie and Alex Jones

3060
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:37,120
At this moment

3061
02:32:37,632 --> 02:32:39,424
Is unable to

3062
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:41,984
Like he can't understand

3063
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:46,336
He's taking it in he's taking it

3064
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,088
Yeah

3065
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:01,952
I don't want to compare to like that Chris Farley Show sketch where it's

3066
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:06,816
What about

3067
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:13,216
That like I have these waypoints that I have in my mind

3068
02:33:13,472 --> 02:33:15,264
Already built

3069
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:16,288
And so like

3070
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:19,616
6 months from now

3071
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:23,200
With these same ideas being expressed

3072
02:33:23,712 --> 02:33:27,040
So it's fascinating to me because it again it again makes me

3073
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:27,808
Feel like

3074
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:29,344
Alex is not

3075
02:33:30,112 --> 02:33:34,464
Alex is like the evil child from The Twilight Zone where it's

3076
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:37,280
Just somehow he has magic powers he's just a

3077
02:33:38,304 --> 02:33:41,120
He doesn't understand anything of what he's doing

3078
02:33:41,376 --> 02:33:41,888
He's just got these

3079
02:33:43,424 --> 02:33:45,216
And he's using them to hurt people

3080
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:51,616
Let me be clear

3081
02:33:51,872 --> 02:33:52,384
Here's what I

3082
02:33:52,896 --> 02:33:53,408
Okay

3083
02:33:53,664 --> 02:33:59,552
If you have that we're on like episode 10 million and 9 + H 4 billion forever

3084
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:02,880
Who is Alex

3085
02:34:03,136 --> 02:34:06,976
It's so hard cuz every single episode we talk about there's new evidence

3086
02:34:07,232 --> 02:34:09,792
Throws everything

3087
02:34:10,048 --> 02:34:10,560
But I think

3088
02:34:10,816 --> 02:34:11,840
My sort of

3089
02:34:12,096 --> 02:34:15,680
Rosetta Stone if I can use that on my Marvel card

3090
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:20,800
Or is that guy and have him here's his superpowers and I deficiency

3091
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:24,128
Give a shout out to the best Marvel comic ever

3092
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:25,920
He's a terrible interviewer

3093
02:34:26,176 --> 02:34:26,944
He's s***

3094
02:34:27,456 --> 02:34:28,736
He interrupts his gas

3095
02:34:28,992 --> 02:34:30,016
He says nothing

3096
02:34:30,784 --> 02:34:32,576
Depending on how much you respect

3097
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:36,160
Or how weird is it faces on

3098
02:34:36,416 --> 02:34:39,488
He does not engage with input

3099
02:34:39,744 --> 02:34:42,304
It comes to him that God disagrees with his neighbor

3100
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:43,840
Right

3101
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:45,120
But so that's like

3102
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:48,448
On the lake 1210

3103
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:49,472
Chart

3104
02:34:49,728 --> 02:34:50,496
Interview skills

3105
02:34:50,752 --> 02:34:51,264
Yes to

3106
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:56,128
Yes but then in his NBA Jam

3107
02:34:56,384 --> 02:34:59,456
Yeah lion but then if you go down to the neck

3108
02:35:00,736 --> 02:35:03,552
The ability to talk about nothing aggressively

3109
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:05,088
He's a 10

3110
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:06,880
Like he can just

3111
02:35:07,904 --> 02:35:08,928
He would be the

3112
02:35:09,184 --> 02:35:10,464
He would be the world

3113
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:11,232
Best

3114
02:35:11,744 --> 02:35:12,256
Senator

3115
02:35:13,024 --> 02:35:14,560
Her like a bad cause

3116
02:35:14,816 --> 02:35:18,912
Cuz he could filibuster for 20 hours the f****** hilarious

3117
02:35:19,168 --> 02:35:25,312
It'll be engaged book in front of him

3118
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:30,176
Where to star in the movie mr. Jones

3119
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:34,784
Mr. Jones in Austin

3120
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:37,600
It would but that's that is where he shine

3121
02:35:37,856 --> 02:35:41,952
Able to talk about nothing engagingly for real

3122
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:43,488
I'm bringing

3123
02:35:43,744 --> 02:35:44,512
Disparate

3124
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:45,280
Detail

3125
02:35:46,048 --> 02:35:49,120
From things that really involved but sound just

3126
02:35:49,376 --> 02:35:49,888
Good enough

3127
02:35:50,144 --> 02:35:51,424
That it makes his arguments

3128
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:52,704
To make sense

3129
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:54,496
Amazing

3130
02:35:57,568 --> 02:36:00,128
I think in one of the First episodes

3131
02:36:00,384 --> 02:36:01,408
You and I were talking about like

3132
02:36:02,176 --> 02:36:03,456
You said I couldn't do

3133
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:11,904
You absolutely and I'm starting to come around to that I could not do

3134
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:13,696
I could talk

3135
02:36:13,952 --> 02:36:14,464
For 4 hours

3136
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:15,232
For sure

3137
02:36:15,488 --> 02:36:17,024
We've proved that

3138
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:19,840
Couldn't been aggressive

3139
02:36:20,352 --> 02:36:21,120
About nothing

3140
02:36:21,632 --> 02:36:22,400
For 4 hours

3141
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:27,008
He has no preparation he has no real details but he is able to manometry

3142
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:34,944
It is it is kind of like

3143
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:35,968
Nothing until

3144
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:39,296
He is like a guy who's just like

3145
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:45,952
Check out Marty and Sarah's podcast about wrestling him enter the studio I'm

3146
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:47,232
Sure if you were

3147
02:36:47,488 --> 02:36:48,000
Is producer

3148
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:49,024
I don't know

3149
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:50,560
He's going to do

3150
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:54,144
Rocket ship

3151
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:55,424
Hematology

3152
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:56,704
This for half an hour

3153
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:58,496
Comes up with some b*******

3154
02:36:58,752 --> 02:36:59,264
Then get

3155
02:36:59,776 --> 02:37:00,544
It interview

3156
02:37:01,056 --> 02:37:03,104
They say some s*** he doesn't really listen

3157
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:09,504
Gloms onto something they say

3158
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:10,272
Farther with this

3159
02:37:11,808 --> 02:37:12,320
Right now

3160
02:37:13,856 --> 02:37:16,928
It's like a connotation for

3161
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:17,696
Spiders

3162
02:37:18,976 --> 02:37:19,488
When we

3163
02:37:19,744 --> 02:37:20,256
Kind of

3164
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:22,048
Apply them to

3165
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:23,584
Propaganda

3166
02:37:24,608 --> 02:37:26,144
Who are completely

3167
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:27,168
Control

3168
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:30,240
He is like a spider on.lsd was just

3169
02:37:30,752 --> 02:37:33,568
Maybe this

3170
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:36,896
Spinning this weird web that doesn't make any goddamn sense

3171
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:39,968
Cuz you seen those

3172
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:41,760
As opposed to Alice

3173
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:43,552
Because the lse ones they make

3174
02:37:43,808 --> 02:37:49,952
Eerily perfect strike pattern

3175
02:37:50,208 --> 02:37:51,488
The f*****-up spider

3176
02:37:51,744 --> 02:37:53,792
He's making a web that he knows

3177
02:37:54,816 --> 02:37:55,840
There's a reason I'm doing this

3178
02:37:56,608 --> 02:38:02,752
But I'm not sure I know the current even play that clip I wish I could pull it up but

3179
02:38:03,264 --> 02:38:07,104
Somewhere buried in my phone

3180
02:38:07,616 --> 02:38:08,896
I know what's going on

3181
02:38:09,664 --> 02:38:15,808
But the details

3182
02:38:16,064 --> 02:38:16,576
Headspace

3183
02:38:16,832 --> 02:38:20,160
Narrative you supposed to push

3184
02:38:21,184 --> 02:38:21,952
Coming from

3185
02:38:22,208 --> 02:38:24,768
The People Like Larry Nichols

3186
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:26,048
Steve pieczenik

3187
02:38:26,304 --> 02:38:27,072
Rodger Stone

3188
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:29,120
These guys were feeding him

3189
02:38:29,376 --> 02:38:32,192
Or even now like Mike cernovich has become

3190
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:35,008
Even grandfathered into that sir

3191
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:36,288
Right cuz he

3192
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:38,080
Without using the word

3193
02:38:38,336 --> 02:38:39,872
Talked heathcock

3194
02:38:40,384 --> 02:38:41,664
Alex Jones

3195
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:45,760
He's way more popular than

3196
02:38:46,016 --> 02:38:46,784
Media companies

3197
02:38:47,808 --> 02:38:51,648
It's all fun and games until the reality sets in that these people are

3198
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:58,816
Intentionally

3199
02:38:59,072 --> 02:39:00,096
The other thing about that

3200
02:39:00,864 --> 02:39:01,888
Again

3201
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:04,448
Today really

3202
02:39:05,216 --> 02:39:05,984
Was filled with

3203
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:06,752
What's hope for me

3204
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:07,776
And you see this

3205
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:09,056
Especially with the local

3206
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:10,592
Because

3207
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:12,640
I believe it's

3208
02:39:12,896 --> 02:39:14,432
I think it's rumani I'm not sure how to

3209
02:39:14,688 --> 02:39:15,200
Pronounce

3210
02:39:15,968 --> 02:39:16,480
Properly

3211
02:39:16,736 --> 02:39:18,016
Lukulos sites

3212
02:39:18,784 --> 02:39:20,832
He won and he'd already been in office

3213
02:39:21,856 --> 02:39:22,368
He'd already served

3214
02:39:23,648 --> 02:39:24,160
The fact

3215
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:24,928
That

3216
02:39:25,184 --> 02:39:26,464
Many of those local

3217
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:29,024
Games where it is

3218
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:30,560
Ruled by the same

3219
02:39:30,816 --> 02:39:31,584
Conservative

3220
02:39:32,864 --> 02:39:33,888
Council members

3221
02:39:34,144 --> 02:39:35,936
For forever and ever and ever

3222
02:39:36,448 --> 02:39:37,728
Are suddenly now being over take

3223
02:39:39,008 --> 02:39:39,520
Because it

3224
02:39:39,776 --> 02:39:40,544
The local Ali

3225
02:39:41,312 --> 02:39:41,824
It's that

3226
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:43,104
Is that kind of that

3227
02:39:43,872 --> 02:39:45,408
That the ground game that

3228
02:39:45,664 --> 02:39:46,944
The Democratic party has gotten

3229
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:47,712
Their ass kicked

3230
02:39:48,224 --> 02:39:49,504
For so long how many governors

3231
02:39:50,016 --> 02:39:51,296
Are Republican

3232
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:52,320
How many

3233
02:39:52,576 --> 02:39:53,088
City Council

3234
02:39:53,344 --> 02:39:54,112
How many states

3235
02:39:54,368 --> 02:39:55,648
Stannard's all of these

3236
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:57,952
These are the places where the Republic

3237
02:39:58,464 --> 02:39:59,744
Have really infiltrated us

3238
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:00,512
Destroyed

3239
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:02,304
And now in

3240
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:04,608
Of all places

3241
02:40:04,864 --> 02:40:05,376
You know

3242
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:12,032
Bastion of democracy Iran history

3243
02:40:12,544 --> 02:40:15,104
History that one that was

3244
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:20,480
But that's that's the thing that gives me hope.

3245
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:21,248
Because again

3246
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:22,272
Young people

3247
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:24,320
I do think that

3248
02:40:24,576 --> 02:40:25,344
The younger generation

3249
02:40:25,856 --> 02:40:26,368
And it is

3250
02:40:26,624 --> 02:40:28,160
Hard to argue anything else

3251
02:40:28,928 --> 02:40:30,720
Are more Progressive

3252
02:40:30,976 --> 02:40:31,488
Armoire

3253
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:32,256
Aware

3254
02:40:32,512 --> 02:40:35,328
Are more educated and are more willing to enter

3255
02:40:35,584 --> 02:40:36,608
Surtain ideas

3256
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:39,424
That will benefit everybody

3257
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:40,960
Then the older generation

3258
02:40:41,216 --> 02:40:41,728
Totally

3259
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:45,568
And so when you see them start to take over that local arena

3260
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:47,360
That's when you start to see real

3261
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:50,688
Boise I think the history is cyclical in

3262
02:40:50,944 --> 02:40:52,736
In so many ways

3263
02:40:53,248 --> 02:40:55,296
Major focuses of the cycle

3264
02:40:55,808 --> 02:40:56,576
Is that

3265
02:40:57,344 --> 02:40:58,624
Wishing we could go back

3266
02:40:58,880 --> 02:40:59,648
To whatever

3267
02:41:01,184 --> 02:41:01,696
Is dumb

3268
02:41:01,952 --> 02:41:02,720
It's a dormant

3269
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:03,744
Dormant

3270
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,536
For a bit and then

3271
02:41:05,792 --> 02:41:06,304
Progress

3272
02:41:06,816 --> 02:41:08,096
And people start to

3273
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:09,888
Come together

3274
02:41:13,472 --> 02:41:16,800
What happened

3275
02:41:17,056 --> 02:41:18,592
But meanwhile

3276
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:22,432
Forces are bubbling under the surface

3277
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:24,736
I may start to build up

3278
02:41:25,504 --> 02:41:26,528
And eventually gets

3279
02:41:27,552 --> 02:41:28,320
Point where

3280
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:30,112
Everyone who want Society

3281
02:41:30,368 --> 02:41:31,392
Move forward realizes

3282
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:33,440
Alright

3283
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:34,208
We got to do

3284
02:41:35,488 --> 02:41:37,024
They never do until it becomes a

3285
02:41:38,048 --> 02:41:40,864
That's my that's my theory of generation

3286
02:41:42,656 --> 02:41:43,168
Progressive

3287
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:44,448
Always push

3288
02:41:44,704 --> 02:41:45,728
Towards progress

3289
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:47,520
But really till we get

3290
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:48,288
Complacent

3291
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:51,360
Yeah and then

3292
02:41:51,872 --> 02:41:52,896
I just win

3293
02:41:53,152 --> 02:41:53,664
The

3294
02:41:54,432 --> 02:41:55,200
Conservative

3295
02:41:55,712 --> 02:41:56,992
And regressive forces

3296
02:41:57,248 --> 02:41:58,016
Has become radical

3297
02:41:58,528 --> 02:42:01,600
And then it becomes like well now it's going to become a problem

3298
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:05,696
Like in the same way that ended up

3299
02:42:05,952 --> 02:42:06,464
In riot

3300
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:11,328
In the same way up in murders in the same way that the seventies

3301
02:42:11,584 --> 02:42:13,888
Early 70's late 60s

3302
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:15,168
Became

3303
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:16,192
Edit

3304
02:42:16,448 --> 02:42:17,728
It's progress meeting

3305
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:20,032
The radicalization of reek

3306
02:42:20,544 --> 02:42:22,848
Yeah and I think we're probably heading

3307
02:42:23,104 --> 02:42:24,128
Towards that

3308
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:25,408
In terms of

3309
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:26,432
Where are you

3310
02:42:26,688 --> 02:42:27,456
Society is going

3311
02:42:27,712 --> 02:42:29,248
The issue is for me

3312
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:33,344
That's how things go just would have been a natural Evans

3313
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:34,368
Flow

3314
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:35,904
Without outside influences

3315
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:37,184
Every reaction

3316
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:37,952
Equinox

3317
02:42:38,464 --> 02:42:41,536
Yeah we were talking about around

3318
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:45,120
An amazing Progressive Society until we f***** it up

3319
02:42:45,376 --> 02:42:46,656
Now there

3320
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:49,216
Coming out

3321
02:42:49,472 --> 02:42:52,032
And now of their own because of generations

3322
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:54,080
Cycles that coming back to us

3323
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:55,616
And hopefully it will work

3324
02:42:57,664 --> 02:42:58,944
I worry that

3325
02:42:59,200 --> 02:42:59,968
Situation

3326
02:43:00,224 --> 02:43:00,992
Do we have in our country

3327
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:02,272
Is

3328
02:43:03,296 --> 02:43:04,576
Boss is doing the same thing

3329
02:43:05,088 --> 02:43:05,600
To ourselves

3330
02:43:05,856 --> 02:43:07,904
That we did to foreign countries

3331
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:09,440
I think we're both

3332
02:43:13,792 --> 02:43:14,560
Here is

3333
02:43:14,816 --> 02:43:15,840
Here is my

3334
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:17,888
Daily

3335
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:19,680
Psychopath

3336
02:43:20,192 --> 02:43:20,704
Optimism

3337
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:23,264
Is always going

3338
02:43:25,312 --> 02:43:26,080
Will we do it in

3339
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:28,128
I think that's my big

3340
02:43:29,152 --> 02:43:30,176
Right now

3341
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:32,736
Think there will absolutely be a progressive

3342
02:43:34,016 --> 02:43:34,528
Bounce back

3343
02:43:34,784 --> 02:43:36,576
The pendulum will swing back towards

3344
02:43:37,344 --> 02:43:38,624
Yeah I don't think that's

3345
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:39,392
Within Quest

3346
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:40,672
It's already happening

3347
02:43:40,928 --> 02:43:42,208
Yeah the question is

3348
02:43:42,464 --> 02:43:42,976
Will it be in Thai

3349
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:45,024
Will we be able to do enough

3350
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:45,792
To stop

3351
02:43:46,048 --> 02:43:46,560
The damage

3352
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:48,352
That has already been done

3353
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:50,144
And is being done

3354
02:43:50,656 --> 02:43:51,936
Betsy DeVos is

3355
02:43:52,448 --> 02:43:53,472
Murdering

3356
02:43:53,728 --> 02:43:54,240
School

3357
02:43:54,496 --> 02:43:57,312
She is absolutely going out of her way

3358
02:43:57,568 --> 02:44:03,712
Dab small children in the throat

3359
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:05,248
She and her husband

3360
02:44:07,296 --> 02:44:09,088
Loan collection organization

3361
02:44:10,112 --> 02:44:11,648
Are you saying that

3362
02:44:11,904 --> 02:44:14,976
Her decision to repeal and remove

3363
02:44:15,232 --> 02:44:19,328
Loan forgiveness program has something to do with it written herself

3364
02:44:19,584 --> 02:44:20,864
Yeah odd

3365
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:22,144
That's so out of

3366
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:27,264
Character for the administration that were living under

3367
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:28,800
Yeah it's insane but

3368
02:44:29,056 --> 02:44:30,592
I want

3369
02:44:34,176 --> 02:44:36,736
The world in terms of like Empire

3370
02:44:36,992 --> 02:44:37,760
That it existed

3371
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:40,064
Do you mean the ones where America

3372
02:44:40,832 --> 02:44:44,672
What the ones we are living under the American Empire I think

3373
02:44:44,928 --> 02:44:45,696
Gets the last

3374
02:44:47,488 --> 02:44:49,280
A couple hundred years I have been

3375
02:44:49,792 --> 02:44:51,328
America as the big super

3376
02:44:51,584 --> 02:44:52,352
Power

3377
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:54,400
Certainly

3378
02:44:56,192 --> 02:44:57,472
Look at these places like

3379
02:44:58,240 --> 02:44:58,752
Greece was a

3380
02:45:00,288 --> 02:45:01,056
Roma's

3381
02:45:02,336 --> 02:45:04,640
And the things that happened to them afterwards

3382
02:45:05,152 --> 02:45:05,920
They became

3383
02:45:06,688 --> 02:45:07,456
Complacent

3384
02:45:10,528 --> 02:45:13,344
You know that I could they found their niche

3385
02:45:13,856 --> 02:45:15,136
As being like

3386
02:45:17,696 --> 02:45:20,000
Right we got some great stuff you can come check out

3387
02:45:21,024 --> 02:45:22,816
We're actively working again

3388
02:45:23,072 --> 02:45:24,864
What's the possibility of that being our future

3389
02:45:25,376 --> 02:45:27,680
That like that sort of hammock

3390
02:45:28,192 --> 02:45:31,264
Which superpowers get to after their Empires full

3391
02:45:31,776 --> 02:45:34,080
We're destroying our Natural Parks

3392
02:45:34,592 --> 02:45:37,664
Trump is trying to work against our natural beauty

3393
02:45:38,176 --> 02:45:38,688
Kia

3394
02:45:39,456 --> 02:45:40,480
We have shown

3395
02:45:40,736 --> 02:45:42,016
Over and over again

3396
02:45:42,272 --> 02:45:48,416
That the statistics in terms of our tourism numbers are white

3397
02:45:48,672 --> 02:45:50,208
Jason wants to come out the other end

3398
02:45:50,464 --> 02:45:51,488
After we lose

3399
02:45:51,744 --> 02:45:54,048
Maybe

3400
02:45:55,584 --> 02:45:57,120
I think the largest question

3401
02:45:57,376 --> 02:45:58,144
4

3402
02:45:58,656 --> 02:45:59,680
Fire which I think is very

3403
02:46:01,472 --> 02:46:01,984
Unique

3404
02:46:03,519 --> 02:46:04,287
Will Ark

3405
02:46:04,543 --> 02:46:05,567
Culture remains

3406
02:46:06,847 --> 02:46:07,615
Because

3407
02:46:07,871 --> 02:46:08,639
You think about

3408
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:09,407
Pieces of it

3409
02:46:09,663 --> 02:46:10,943
You think about Hollywood

3410
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:11,967
And

3411
02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:13,247
You like

3412
02:46:14,015 --> 02:46:14,527
I think about

3413
02:46:14,783 --> 02:46:16,319
Will will Bollywood

3414
02:46:17,343 --> 02:46:17,855
You know.

3415
02:46:18,111 --> 02:46:18,879
Will all of these

3416
02:46:19,135 --> 02:46:20,415
Please other people

3417
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:21,951
In terms of mass numbers

3418
02:46:23,487 --> 02:46:23,999
Ford Market

3419
02:46:26,047 --> 02:46:31,423
These movies that bomb in America make billions of dollars overseas

3420
02:46:31,679 --> 02:46:32,447
American movie

3421
02:46:33,215 --> 02:46:35,007
Like they still have that

3422
02:46:35,775 --> 02:46:38,591
Is it going to be that America will dominate

3423
02:46:38,847 --> 02:46:39,359
Muvico

3424
02:46:40,895 --> 02:46:43,967
And that will be or just f****** McDonald's

3425
02:46:44,223 --> 02:46:47,295
Yeah America winning

3426
02:46:47,551 --> 02:46:48,575
Any wars without

3427
02:46:48,831 --> 02:46:49,343
McDonald's

3428
02:46:50,367 --> 02:46:51,135
Or Starbucks

3429
02:46:51,647 --> 02:46:52,671
Like imagine

3430
02:46:53,951 --> 02:46:58,815
Like at like I think it was has the best joke

3431
02:46:59,327 --> 02:47:00,863
He does you did not

3432
02:47:01,375 --> 02:47:02,399
I respect that

3433
02:47:02,655 --> 02:47:06,495
He did not have a good chat

3434
02:47:07,775 --> 02:47:09,823
But his bit about how America

3435
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:11,615
Can Empire the American Empire

3436
02:47:12,127 --> 02:47:12,639
It was

3437
02:47:12,895 --> 02:47:13,919
When the British

3438
02:47:14,175 --> 02:47:15,711
Came in the kicked everybody out and then

3439
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:17,503
We on the

3440
02:47:18,783 --> 02:47:19,807
And then America

3441
02:47:21,343 --> 02:47:22,879
Bill's the Starbucks around

3442
02:47:24,159 --> 02:47:24,671
Like

3443
02:47:24,927 --> 02:47:26,975
Seems to me to be the more

3444
02:47:28,767 --> 02:47:29,791
Empire building a

3445
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:31,583
Active America in Utah

3446
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:35,935
Like there's a Starbucks on every f******

3447
02:47:36,191 --> 02:47:39,775
Like is that is that America or is that global

3448
02:47:41,567 --> 02:47:44,639
The part of Alex's sort of cosmology that I won't disagree

3449
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:46,175
Agree with is that

3450
02:47:46,431 --> 02:47:46,943
Like

3451
02:47:47,711 --> 02:47:50,783
It is clear I don't think it's by force

3452
02:47:51,039 --> 02:47:52,831
That American culture

3453
02:47:53,343 --> 02:47:56,671
Has been very attractive to people all around the world

3454
02:47:57,695 --> 02:47:58,975
Weather report

3455
02:47:59,231 --> 02:47:59,743
Through like

3456
02:48:00,255 --> 02:48:03,839
We have billions of dollars and we're going to put Starbucks everywhere

3457
02:48:05,631 --> 02:48:06,143
Starbucks

3458
02:48:09,215 --> 02:48:09,983
People enjoy it

3459
02:48:11,775 --> 02:48:14,335
Whether it's one or the other I'm not entirely sure

3460
02:48:14,591 --> 02:48:15,103
But

3461
02:48:16,127 --> 02:48:17,151
To me that's

3462
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:19,711
Steve that's the better Ambassador for America

3463
02:48:19,967 --> 02:48:20,991
It sure is

3464
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:21,759
Center for Impala

3465
02:48:22,015 --> 02:48:23,551
But the fact that

3466
02:48:23,807 --> 02:48:24,575
The fact that

3467
02:48:24,831 --> 02:48:26,623
If you're in China you can go to a McDonald's

3468
02:48:27,135 --> 02:48:28,415
Says more about

3469
02:48:28,671 --> 02:48:29,695
American hegemony

3470
02:48:31,231 --> 02:48:33,023
And it says a lot about McDonald's

3471
02:48:34,303 --> 02:48:35,327
How much do they care

3472
02:48:35,583 --> 02:48:39,167
Yeah about America

3473
02:48:41,215 --> 02:48:41,727
I don't give a fuk

3474
02:48:41,983 --> 02:48:42,495
Talk about America

3475
02:48:43,007 --> 02:48:44,543
Emissions

3476
02:48:46,335 --> 02:48:48,127
Absolutely I'm not sure what I'm saying

3477
02:48:48,639 --> 02:48:53,759
I am really not sure what your argument there is a really long weird

3478
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:55,039
And I

3479
02:48:55,295 --> 02:48:58,623
Oh that's still unusual for us

3480
02:49:02,207 --> 02:49:04,255
It's been so long I don't know who were talking to

3481
02:49:04,511 --> 02:49:06,559
10 minute 7 trying to figure out a way to

3482
02:49:07,583 --> 02:49:08,607
The square

3483
02:49:10,143 --> 02:49:11,679
Larry Nichols believes

3484
02:49:11,935 --> 02:49:12,447
That

3485
02:49:12,703 --> 02:49:15,519
The Tea Party is the answer

3486
02:49:15,775 --> 02:49:16,543
To all the society

3487
02:49:18,079 --> 02:49:20,127
The wrong

3488
02:49:20,383 --> 02:49:21,407
He believes that

3489
02:49:21,663 --> 02:49:22,943
The Republican

3490
02:49:23,455 --> 02:49:25,503
Are actively trying to work against the

3491
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:29,343
Which is which was kinda fair in 2015

3492
02:49:31,391 --> 02:49:32,159
I think they were well

3493
02:49:32,671 --> 02:49:33,439
Work again

3494
02:49:33,695 --> 02:49:35,743
I think they were trying to usurp

3495
02:49:36,255 --> 02:49:38,047
Virginia

3496
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:42,911
The RNC

3497
02:49:48,031 --> 02:49:49,567
COPD RN

3498
02:49:52,895 --> 02:49:57,247
The RNC does not want to give up control

3499
02:49:57,759 --> 02:49:58,783
And so their threat

3500
02:49:59,039 --> 02:49:59,551
Bye

3501
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:01,087
Tea Party

3502
02:50:01,343 --> 02:50:03,135
Primitive kind of

3503
02:50:03,391 --> 02:50:04,415
True

3504
02:50:05,951 --> 02:50:06,719
But this is going to

3505
02:50:09,535 --> 02:50:13,631
The tea party because they know that one thing

3506
02:50:16,191 --> 02:50:22,335
And take over the RNC

3507
02:50:22,591 --> 02:50:24,383
We took over the RNC

3508
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:28,223
We can take back our country

3509
02:50:35,647 --> 02:50:37,695
The last national election

3510
02:50:40,511 --> 02:50:43,583
Once those Mexicans are allowed

3511
02:50:44,607 --> 02:50:48,703
I know he's talking about illegal immigrants started

3512
02:50:49,471 --> 02:50:49,983
He's not

3513
02:50:50,751 --> 02:50:51,263
He's not

3514
02:50:51,519 --> 02:50:52,543
Hebrews 2

3515
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:54,079
He's not

3516
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:55,871
I think he if he was

3517
02:50:56,127 --> 02:50:57,151
If he was conscious

3518
02:50:57,663 --> 02:50:58,175
He would make

3519
02:50:58,431 --> 02:50:59,199
More of an effort

3520
02:50:59,455 --> 02:50:59,967
To say so

3521
02:51:00,735 --> 02:51:02,271
But you know exactly

3522
02:51:02,527 --> 02:51:04,319
He means that once Latinos

3523
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:05,087
In America

3524
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:08,671
Start voting

3525
02:51:09,695 --> 02:51:10,463
It will be towards

3526
02:51:10,975 --> 02:51:12,511
People who support them

3527
02:51:12,767 --> 02:51:15,327
I'm doing about them

3528
02:51:15,583 --> 02:51:16,863
And don't say they're all right

3529
02:51:17,887 --> 02:51:21,727
But that was the that was the demographic argument that was made

3530
02:51:21,983 --> 02:51:22,751
The entire

3531
02:51:24,031 --> 02:51:25,055
Was that

3532
02:51:25,311 --> 02:51:26,847
Well Trump doesn't have a chance

3533
02:51:27,103 --> 02:51:27,871
That's because

3534
02:51:28,895 --> 02:51:31,199
Now that the demographics have changed so much

3535
02:51:31,711 --> 02:51:33,247
It doesn't matter who the Republic

3536
02:51:33,503 --> 02:51:34,015
Logan's Run

3537
02:51:36,063 --> 02:51:37,087
It only matters where they run

3538
02:51:39,391 --> 02:51:41,695
Goes back to Larry Nichols fractured

3539
02:51:41,951 --> 02:51:43,487
Fractured Democrat

3540
02:51:44,767 --> 02:51:47,071
Exactly you bringing the gays you bring in the black

3541
02:51:49,119 --> 02:51:50,911
White people as opposed to act

3542
02:51:51,679 --> 02:51:52,191
Fourth

3543
02:51:55,007 --> 02:51:56,543
A progressive ideology

3544
02:51:57,567 --> 02:51:58,079
Is

3545
02:51:58,335 --> 02:52:00,127
The one that is supported by the

3546
02:52:00,383 --> 02:52:00,895
Majority of

3547
02:52:02,943 --> 02:52:03,711
Always

3548
02:52:03,967 --> 02:52:04,991
Always have

3549
02:52:06,271 --> 02:52:07,807
True it always has been

3550
02:52:10,623 --> 02:52:11,647
Election

3551
02:52:12,671 --> 02:52:13,695
Will

3552
02:52:13,951 --> 02:52:14,719
Argue against

3553
02:52:15,487 --> 02:52:17,279
And it's hard to it's hard

3554
02:52:17,535 --> 02:52:18,559
You believe they will argue

3555
02:52:19,327 --> 02:52:20,607
For any other reason

3556
02:52:20,863 --> 02:52:21,375
Peda

3557
02:52:24,447 --> 02:52:25,215
It's money

3558
02:52:25,471 --> 02:52:28,543

02:53:18,975 --> 02:53:21,791
Hillary for prison shirts

3578
02:53:22,047 --> 02:53:25,887
Simsbury High into this design at wrestling shows

3579
02:53:26,399 --> 02:53:27,679
So

3580
02:53:28,447 --> 02:53:32,287
This that the last play is an eyesore the punchline

3581
02:53:32,543 --> 02:53:33,311
I act weird

3582
02:53:33,823 --> 02:53:34,335
But

3583
02:53:34,591 --> 02:53:37,663
Before we get to it I want it I want it I want a soulmate

3584
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:38,687
A little bit

3585
02:53:38,943 --> 02:53:39,967
Yes

3586
02:53:40,479 --> 02:53:42,271
Alex started this show

3587
02:53:43,039 --> 02:53:43,807
Unaware of what

3588
02:53:44,063 --> 02:53:45,343
To do about the Charles

3589
02:53:46,111 --> 02:53:46,623
Yes

3590
02:53:46,879 --> 02:53:49,183
He ambivalently wandered around

3591
02:53:49,695 --> 02:53:50,719
Accidentally

3592
02:53:51,231 --> 02:53:51,743
Probably

3593
02:53:53,023 --> 02:53:53,535
Spouted

3594
02:53:54,047 --> 02:53:54,559
A bunch of

3595
02:53:54,815 --> 02:53:55,583
Incredibly

3596
02:53:55,839 --> 02:53:56,607
Just ideas

3597
02:53:57,119 --> 02:53:58,911
He wandered around until

3598
02:53:59,167 --> 02:54:00,447
He had a African-American

3599
02:54:00,703 --> 02:54:01,727
Preacher on the show

3600
02:54:01,983 --> 02:54:02,495
Cool

3601
02:54:03,007 --> 02:54:05,055
I went way further than him

3602
02:54:05,311 --> 02:54:06,335
And gave him permission

3603
02:54:06,591 --> 02:54:07,359
Cover

3604
02:54:07,615 --> 02:54:10,431
To be like

3605
02:54:10,687 --> 02:54:11,199
Yeah

3606
02:54:11,455 --> 02:54:12,479
So that was the first

3607
02:54:12,735 --> 02:54:13,759
Narrative

3608
02:54:14,783 --> 02:54:15,551
Secondarily

3609
02:54:16,063 --> 02:54:16,575
He has

3610
02:54:16,831 --> 02:54:17,855
Larry Nichols on

3611
02:54:18,111 --> 02:54:18,879
Who has weave

3612
02:54:19,135 --> 02:54:19,647
Scott

3613
02:54:19,903 --> 02:54:20,671
Victor lead

3614
02:54:20,927 --> 02:54:21,439
Discredited

3615
02:54:22,463 --> 02:54:23,487
Fired by Bill Clinton

3616
02:54:24,511 --> 02:54:25,023
Hated him

3617
02:54:25,535 --> 02:54:26,303
From the jump

3618
02:54:28,607 --> 02:54:29,887
Has done everything in his

3619
02:54:30,143 --> 02:54:30,655
Power

3620
02:54:31,167 --> 02:54:31,935
To take him down

3621
02:54:32,447 --> 02:54:33,983
To the extent of lying

3622
02:54:34,751 --> 02:54:36,287
On public radio shows

3623
02:54:37,055 --> 02:54:39,103
Lying on conservative radio shows and then

3624
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:43,455
Lying to Liberal interviewers like mother

3625
02:54:44,223 --> 02:54:44,735
Absolutely

3626
02:54:44,991 --> 02:54:46,783
And then waffling back and forth

3627
02:54:47,039 --> 02:54:51,647
Weather I love Hillary

3628
02:54:51,903 --> 02:54:55,231
Who says whatever it is that will get

3629
02:54:56,511 --> 02:54:57,023
And we'll get him

3630
02:54:57,279 --> 02:55:00,095
The point is what he thinks is the sorrel discredit

3631
02:55:01,375 --> 02:55:02,911
Is a absolute

3632
02:55:03,423 --> 02:55:04,447
Terrible source of information

3633
02:55:05,215 --> 02:55:06,239
At the same time

3634
02:55:07,775 --> 02:55:08,287
Alex

3635
02:55:08,543 --> 02:55:09,311
I do believe

3636
02:55:09,823 --> 02:55:10,591
Inform

3637
02:55:11,359 --> 02:55:12,895
The 2016 election

3638
02:55:14,431 --> 02:55:16,223
I think that Alex

3639
02:55:16,479 --> 02:55:18,015
You're the only person who can help us

3640
02:55:18,527 --> 02:55:19,295
That sort of thing

3641
02:55:19,551 --> 02:55:21,087
You need to galvanized

3642
02:55:21,343 --> 02:55:22,367
The Tea Party People

3643
02:55:22,879 --> 02:55:24,415
Jeb Bush isn't going to do it

3644
02:55:25,183 --> 02:55:28,255
Larry Nichols

3645
02:55:28,767 --> 02:55:29,279
I think

3646
02:55:30,047 --> 02:55:30,559
Formative

3647
02:55:30,815 --> 02:55:31,327
I think

3648
02:55:31,583 --> 02:55:32,863
Did they set the Bedrock

3649
02:55:34,655 --> 02:55:35,423
Alex's coverage

3650
02:55:36,191 --> 02:55:36,703
And I stink

3651
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:39,263
It's f***** up that I just started

3652
02:55:39,775 --> 02:55:40,799
I listen to a couple days

3653
02:55:41,055 --> 02:55:42,847
Is before

3654
02:55:43,103 --> 02:55:44,895
A really boring nothing really

3655
02:55:45,663 --> 02:55:46,175
But

3656
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:47,967
Just after Trump

3657
02:55:48,223 --> 02:55:48,735
Announces

3658
02:55:49,247 --> 02:55:50,271
This episode

3659
02:55:51,039 --> 02:55:52,319
And I think it is the launcher

3660
02:55:53,343 --> 02:55:54,111
For Alex losing

3661
02:55:55,391 --> 02:55:56,927
I think this will be

3662
02:55:57,183 --> 02:55:58,719
Beginning

3663
02:55:59,231 --> 02:55:59,999
Of our analysis

3664
02:56:02,047 --> 02:56:02,559
Just

3665
02:56:03,071 --> 02:56:05,375
This is the gestation of

3666
02:56:05,887 --> 02:56:06,655
Amman

3667
02:56:07,167 --> 02:56:07,679
Fall from

3668
02:56:08,191 --> 02:56:08,703
Yeah

3669
02:56:09,471 --> 02:56:12,543
It wasn't great

3670
02:56:12,799 --> 02:56:16,127
It's not go anywhere near fall from disgrace

3671
02:56:18,687 --> 02:56:22,783
So this Method Man's fall from the seventh level of hell

3672
02:56:26,623 --> 02:56:27,135
Just pulled one

3673
02:56:28,415 --> 02:56:32,255
I don't think it's a don't think it's important considering how Dante was just

3674
02:56:33,279 --> 02:56:34,815
Pissed off about people he knew

3675
02:56:35,071 --> 02:56:37,631
I love Dante but yeah you're totally right

3676
02:56:38,655 --> 02:56:44,799
I'm just picking people mostly get a boner for Beatrice

3677
02:56:47,359 --> 02:56:52,223
You got a last clip is just a really fun

3678
02:56:52,735 --> 02:56:53,759
Insight into

3679
02:56:54,015 --> 02:56:54,527
Larry

3680
02:56:56,575 --> 02:56:57,343
It's just

3681
02:56:57,855 --> 02:56:58,623
Peacock Keller

3682
02:56:59,903 --> 02:57:00,415
You don't give a

3683
02:57:02,207 --> 02:57:05,535
Done

3684
02:57:06,047 --> 02:57:09,631
Starts with Alex explaining that his book is out of print

3685
02:57:09,887 --> 02:57:10,911
And it goes from there

3686
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:15,519
That nichols's book is out of print or Alex

3687
02:57:15,775 --> 02:57:17,823

Phone number for 40

02:57:42,655 --> 02:57:46,751
Conway Arkansas 2034

Either wait for him up

3699
02:58:05,183 --> 02:58:06,463
Forevershe come out

3700
02:58:07,487 --> 02:58:09,791
Because this thing is coming down

3701
02:58:10,303 --> 02:58:11,327
That's crazy

3702
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:14,655
Freak

3703
02:58:15,167 --> 02:58:18,239
Are you calling him

3704
02:58:22,335 --> 02:58:23,103
There's a situation

3705
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:24,895
We try

3706
02:58:25,151 --> 02:58:25,919
We called

3707
02:58:26,175 --> 02:58:32,319
Larry nickel

3708
02:58:32,575 --> 02:58:38,719
Turn over my cell phone record you

3709
02:58:38,975 --> 02:58:42,047
Call Larry Nichols and spoiler alert

3710
02:58:42,303 --> 02:58:44,607
Phone number to call him

3711
02:58:44,863 --> 02:58:47,167
Leave this old man alone

3712
02:58:47,423 --> 02:58:48,703
Here's the deal we call them

3713
02:58:48,959 --> 02:58:50,239
It is still his phone number

3714
02:58:50,495 --> 02:58:51,263
Leave the man alone

3715
02:58:51,519 --> 02:58:57,663
But it was pretty hilarious he didn't answer his phone

3716
02:58:58,943 --> 02:59:02,271
It wasn't he was like, I don't want to talk

3717
02:59:02,527 --> 02:59:04,831
He was on oxygen

3718
02:59:05,855 --> 02:59:08,927
He didn't want to answer any questions about Alex Jones

3719
02:59:09,183 --> 02:59:15,327
He was very nice

3720
02:59:15,583 --> 02:59:16,095
It was recording

3721
02:59:16,351 --> 02:59:19,167
Interest in following the law

3722
02:59:19,423 --> 02:59:22,495
And just decency we decided to cut it out

3723
02:59:22,751 --> 02:59:24,031
So

3724
02:59:24,543 --> 02:59:30,687
You're missing out on some pretty funny stuff

3725
02:59:30,943 --> 02:59:32,223
A lot of perch

3726
02:59:32,479 --> 02:59:37,087
Stevie Larry Nicks

3727
02:59:37,343 --> 02:59:38,367
I'm a policy wonk

3728
02:59:38,879 --> 02:59:39,903
That was really

3729
02:59:40,159 --> 02:59:42,975
That was over

3730
02:59:45,791 --> 02:59:47,839
I thought that was going to be a b****

3731
02:59:50,911 --> 02:59:54,751
Who's the craziest thing that's ever happened on this Daddy f****** nuts

3732
02:59:58,335 --> 02:59:59,615
You know what

3733
03:00:00,383 --> 03:00:01,407
Probably on oxen

3734
03:00:01,919 --> 03:00:06,527
That's not an excuse not Salem think about Trump

3735
03:00:08,063 --> 03:00:08,575
Also did you

3736
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:09,855
Did you get the sense that he

3737
03:00:10,367 --> 03:00:11,647
Kind of does not want to talk

3738
03:00:11,903 --> 03:00:12,415
Talk about Alex

3739
03:00:12,927 --> 03:00:15,231
I think you kind of does not want to talk about anything

3740
03:00:15,999 --> 03:00:16,511
That's fair

3741
03:00:21,631 --> 03:00:27,007

03:00:27,263 --> 03:00:33,151

3748
03:00:51,583 --> 03:00:53,119
