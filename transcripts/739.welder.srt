1
00:00:01,287 --> 00:00:07,267
A young fireplug of a lawyer got his teeth in Alex Jones and decided that this was something he'd like to gnaw on.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:15,727
And, you know, so he tore through a series of people who were designated as corporate reps and then published their depositions online.

3
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:19,527
And so the haters we had a field day with the a corporate reps.

4
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:22,417
No one else that did infowars was willing to do it again.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,157
No one wanted to have their deposition placed on video online.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,762
To the ridicule of all the allocators.

7
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:32,912
Knowledge flight.

8
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:42,425
There are people there's a cult, there's something called Knowledge First or Knowledge Fight.

9
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:47,382
These people apparently live by loving the hate, Alex Jones.

10
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:50,450
And they bounce on every piece of video they can find.

11
00:00:51,112 --> 00:00:52,192
Knowledge Fight.

12
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:53,375
Knowledge Fight.

13
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:58,412
There's a website called Knowledge Bite.

14
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:04,762
And these are a couple of bottom feeders who make their chops heating out.

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,562
And so they have episodes almost daily.

16
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:11,525
The corporate reps didn't want to be exposed to that again.

17
00:01:13,162 --> 00:01:14,632
I guess I should say it.

18
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,497
I got my ass kicked.

19
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:17,832
Knowledge Fights.

20
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:18,997
Knowledge fights on.

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,397
Knowledge fights on knowledge.

22
00:01:20,442 --> 00:01:21,262
Hey, everybody.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,522
Welcome back to knowledge fight.

24
00:01:22,555 --> 00:01:22,947
I'm Ben.

25
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:23,577
I'm Jordan.

26
00:01:29,737 --> 00:01:31,542
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

27
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:32,862
Oh, yes, we are, Dan.

28
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:33,597
Jordan.

29
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:34,467
Jordan.

30
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:41,962
What's your bright spot today, buddy? My bright spot is I was on Marty and Sarah love wrestling this week.

31
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,197
Fun podcast.

32
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:45,967
Our friends Marty and Sarah Do.

33
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,167
Sarah is in Belgium, and so Marty needed someone to fill in.

34
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:54,252
And we had a fun conversation about my feelings about Bray Wyatt.

35
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,047
That's excellent.

36
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,037
I imagine that would be the main focus.

37
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:04,482
A little bit more about Bray Wyatt and then some talk about how I don't understand what the deal is with Orange Cassidy.

38
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:05,812
Well, that's fair.

39
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,982
It was a lot of fun.

40
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,927
People can find that over at I guess you just search for Marty and Sara Love Wrestling podcasts.

41
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:18,592
You know how to find podcast? I mean, if you don't know how to find podcasts, that's kind of an interesting thing that you have to find us.

42
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,312
Yeah, exactly.

43
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:29,797
Do you come here from north at US, tell you to check out these dorks and these losers? Did you download this bootleg from LimeWire? What's going on here? Yeah.

44
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,157
So what's your bright spot? My bright spot is shoes.

45
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:36,157
Dan, my wife, very beautiful person.

46
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:36,822
Lovely.

47
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:37,747
Love her very much.

48
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,017
Sure.

49
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:39,212
She's my favorite.

50
00:02:39,862 --> 00:02:43,912
Found out recently that my shoes are garbage, as they almost always are.

51
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:45,667
Got me some new shoes and they're amazing.

52
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,207
Nice.

53
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:46,882
They're amazing.

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,232
I'm the fastest tennis player maybe there's ever been right now.

55
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,142
And if you fuck up, you can say new shoes.

56
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:53,817
New shoes.

57
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:54,277
Yeah.

58
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,647
You know what? All sorts of things can be just completely written off because you have new shoes.

59
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:01,207
Oh, what's even better, they're a little bit too big.

60
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:02,527
Just a little bit.

61
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,822
It's actually very comfortable.

62
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:06,042
But when you're running, that's an excuse.

63
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:11,292
But also, your feet are like goldfish, and they will grow to the sides of the container.

64
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:12,457
That does sound correct.

65
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:16,677
From what I remember in basic biology when I was about 8th grade.

66
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:19,257
That is what they said about Koi feet.

67
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:20,457
Let me take a look at those shoes.

68
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:21,402
These are different shoes.

69
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:22,842
I'm wearing the old shoes.

70
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:24,717
I don't want to screw up the good shoes.

71
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:25,267
Sure.

72
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:25,807
Yeah.

73
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:28,377
One time I got new shoes.

74
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:31,312
They were pretty bright white because they're new.

75
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,297
And I wore them to an open mic just because my older shoes had fallen apart.

76
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:36,772
Right.

77
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,287
And so I wore them, and I walked in and immediately sorry.

78
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:56,612
And Choxy and his buddy John McBride, the two of them were sitting at a table and they saw me, and they just started doing a run of jokes about my new shoes.

79
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:04,272
I love being comedian.

80
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:05,122
You don't get that.

81
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:06,342
It's just my favorite.

82
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:06,577
Yes.

83
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:07,937
I couldn't stop laughing.

84
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:11,122
Anyway, Jordan, today we have an episode to go over.

85
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:17,457
We're going to do some fun stuff, but you might have noticed in the intro there, we have a new special intro courtesy of DJ Danarchy.

86
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:18,800
Thank you so much.

87
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:28,562
Norm Pattis, lawyer extraordinaire, one of the premier lawyers, first Amendment lawyers, constitutional lawyers for shit bags.

88
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:33,072
He has a podcast called Law and Legitimacy.

89
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:37,827
And on a recent episode after the trial, he did a little bit of a breakdown.

90
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:44,225
Bad idea of what happened, how he was wrong, bad idea how the appeal is going to go great.

91
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:48,142
And he decided to bring us up.

92
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,462
What a terrible idea.

93
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:53,812
First of all, I mean, Norm, you didn't get the memo that you're not supposed to talk about us.

94
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,107
That's the rule.

95
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:56,767
That's rule number one there.

96
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,200
You just accidentally revealed a lot more than you wish.

97
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:01,775
Quite a bit.

98
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:07,837
He mentioned us in a bankruptcy hearing where he called us Knowledge First.

99
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,257
Right.

100
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:08,947
Which was great.

101
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,952
And I think we have a cottage industry out of making fun of Alex.

102
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:12,912
Fantastic.

103
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,097
And that was just good, clean fun.

104
00:05:15,205 --> 00:05:21,792
But this mention of us is deeply problematic for Alex and everybody at Infowars.

105
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:22,117
Yeah.

106
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:29,257
And in case you could hear the intro and feel like things are maybe taken a little bit out of context for taking a beat yeah.

107
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,472
Here is the clip of Norm talking about us on his podcast.

108
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:35,892
And afterwards, I think we'll have a lot to celebrate.

109
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:40,977
And if there's one thing I've learned about Alex, it's that these are these were video depositions.

110
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,187
People love to hate him.

111
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:50,067
And so the haters we had a field day with the corporate reps and the corporate reps, there's no there there's no real organization.

112
00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:53,767
So they testified about what they knew, and their answer to most things is I don't know.

113
00:05:53,815 --> 00:05:54,457
Good question.

114
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:54,997
Really.

115
00:05:55,105 --> 00:06:07,902
And that young man was able to persuade a trial judge in Texas that this was wilful failure, that the corporation had an obligation to produce a representative that could answer his questions because there had to be answers.

116
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:13,207
And so there was another deadline in Texas to produce a corporate rep.

117
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,272
We selected I selected a person from Connecticut because no one else did.

118
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:19,267
Infowars was willing to do it again.

119
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:26,247
No one wanted to have their placed on video online to the ridicule of all the allocators.

120
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:32,675
Because you know what? There are people there's a website I learned about called Knowledge Fight.

121
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:41,217
These are a couple of bottom feeders make their chops heating out, and so they have episodes almost daily.

122
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:42,322
They'll call me out.

123
00:06:42,355 --> 00:06:43,642
They'll call this one.

124
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:49,812
I mean, I don't know if Alex is going to get a percentage of the royalties for the space he rented.

125
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:50,912
Good luck.

126
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:58,100
And so the Alex haters didn't the corporate reps didn't want to be exposed to that again.

127
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:00,987
So the Connecticut representative testified.

128
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:04,962
She didn't satisfy the fireplug or the Texas judge.

129
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:08,062
She testified in Connecticut three and a half days.

130
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,002
I called it the Gilligan's island.

131
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:10,552
Direct.

132
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:13,197
The guy had her up there, the lawyer for the plaintiffs.

133
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:16,807
Wait, the Gilligan that's three hour tour, not three and a half days.

134
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:18,817
Yeah, that doesn't make sense at all.

135
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:21,022
But that's norm, stand up chops coming.

136
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:23,182
Yeah, I was going to say so.

137
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:26,797
Norm, come on, man, you're showing too much here.

138
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:36,402
So apparently Brittany Paws got hired as the corporate representative because we everyone else was too worried about being roasted on our boat here's.

139
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:43,147
What's the most important thing? Like, okay, you know what, Dan? You kicked ass and you brought a lot of work into it.

140
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,042
But also the trials were the lawyers did a great job.

141
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,942
You know, like, your contribution was spectacular, but it was limited and it was shared.

142
00:07:52,077 --> 00:08:02,697
In this case, Dan, you cost Norm Pattis personally $30,000, maybe less, because they had to hire Britney Paul.

143
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,927
That 30 grand is all you.

144
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,992
Yeah, it might be.

145
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,052
I mean, look, I don't want to break down quantifying things.

146
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:24,442
What is important is that there is a recognition here of a behavioral change that was made at Infowars, which is, prior to this, Rob Do was totally fine going in and being a Kangal hat wearing doofus, sitting in there, being I don't know how many did he do? A couple, actually.

147
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,327
Yeah, exactly.

148
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:29,232
And then Daria was totally fine in these depositions.

149
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:31,387
I don't actually think she's afraid of me at all.

150
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,427
I'm afraid of her anything.

151
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:40,032
But these people were not willing to do this and face the kind of scrutiny in the public eye that our podcast brings.

152
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:43,347
Literally, only our podcast brings.

153
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:44,000
Right.

154
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:56,442
And the other thing that it reveals, too, is that there are discussions about they know us being a motivating factor and them not wanting to be the corporate rep, which is fucking hilarious.

155
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,522
That means this conversation happened.

156
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,802
We need you to be the corporate rep again.

157
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:02,152
I don't want to do it.

158
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:04,700
Those two guys will be mean to me.

159
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:10,325
Those two guys in Chicago will just roast the shit out of me.

160
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,667
Good luck.

161
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:15,812
Royalties.

162
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:19,567
Also, normally we're commerce based.

163
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,797
He's really got to stop with this brain landlord joke.

164
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:23,317
Yeah.

165
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,622
He's been doing this too much in the aftermath of the trial.

166
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,022
Too much.

167
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:28,797
Like, I live right free in people's heads.

168
00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:29,497
Sure.

169
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,372
I mean, it's fun and all.

170
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:35,312
Like, I remember the first time I heard it when I was maybe, like, 13.

171
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:38,397
That's a really interesting phrase.

172
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:42,397
Now it's a little bit especially when Norman said it, like, a hundred times.

173
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:43,702
It's getting very old.

174
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:53,947
And I think that it's evidence of him either deflecting from reality or not understanding what I and this show is about.

175
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,387
Like, I don't give a shit.

176
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:03,792
He is only serving the purposes of what I hope to achieve.

177
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:04,207
Yes.

178
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:05,517
Alex is a window.

179
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:06,862
Alex is nothing.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,127
The sky and everything cool is out there after we get through Alex, not after we get through Alex.

181
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:18,022
In terms of him going away right after.

182
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:19,357
You understand? Exactly.

183
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:22,347
If you see the window, you can see through the window.

184
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:23,272
There's a tree out there.

185
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,850
Yes, Norm.

186
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:27,727
None of this lives free in my head.

187
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:28,617
I think it's hilarious.

188
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:33,417
Yeah, it's even funnier now that you it's too funny.

189
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:34,377
It's too funny.

190
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:34,702
So.

191
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,675
Thank you, Norm.

192
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:38,312
It's beyond a bright spot.

193
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:39,762
It's a revelation.

194
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:40,625
It is.

195
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:47,900
Because it is such an acknowledgement of how much gaslighting they've been doing to us.

196
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:51,292
It's physically impossible for them not to know.

197
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,317
Right? We've known that for a long time.

198
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,382
But what they knew, how much they knew, what it meant to them, all that stuff that we could only guess at that we can only guess.

199
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,482
And it kind of drives you mad because you're like, there's no way they put that much thought into it.

200
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:09,717
I think that's partially because you and I are our self deprecating people by nature.

201
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:11,682
It's like, Get off your fucking high horse.

202
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:12,997
These people don't care about you.

203
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,172
No one cares about you in your head.

204
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:16,132
And zero people.

205
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,667
You're gaslighting yourself along with them.

206
00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:23,407
You think you're so important that they care about you, is my thought process.

207
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,662
That's why it was so shocking.

208
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:32,227
I'd heard that he mentioned us on the podcast, and when I was listening to it, I was like, what the fuck? That's all I had heard.

209
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:40,262
I had heard the rent free thing, so I was like, oh, to find out the second part is mindboggling.

210
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:50,087
Also, it is a bad idea to insult somebody when they have a DJ willing to remix that insult.

211
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:57,787
If you were in high school and there was a bully bothering you, but you had a DJ who was going to remix their insult, you've won, right? Yeah.

212
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:05,262
And if you have so little respect for the bully that whatever insult they're saying is funny yes, hilarious.

213
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:06,875
And do your best.

214
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:09,792
Good luck.

215
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:10,552
Thank you, Norm.

216
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:11,077
Yeah.

217
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,442
Anyway, we have an episode, like I said, but before we get to it, let's take a little moment, say hello to some new walk.

218
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,267
Oh, that's a great idea.

219
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,477
So first, Wilford Snipple snapple of the gripple.

220
00:12:18,507 --> 00:12:18,777
PIBBLE.

221
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:19,327
Thank you so much.

222
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:20,517
You are now a policy wonk.

223
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:21,582
I'm a policy wonk.

224
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:26,497
Wait, you can't donate to you well, now I can't use that as a name at the end because that's somebody else.

225
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,167
Now there's a walk blame.

226
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:29,607
So I have to come with a new alien.

227
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:30,852
Yeah, this is like a Twitter handle.

228
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:32,317
They bought it from you? Maybe.

229
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,112
Mind slum lord.

230
00:12:36,562 --> 00:12:39,817
Wait, why did that one show up first in your brain? I don't know.

231
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:40,657
That's a question.

232
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:42,252
Chef says trans rights.

233
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:42,802
Thank you so much.

234
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,887
You're now a policy won't.

235
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:44,952
I'm a policy wonk.

236
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:45,577
Thank you very much.

237
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:46,327
And we agree.

238
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,762
Thanks.

239
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:48,222
Next rolly, boys.

240
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:48,802
Thank you so much.

241
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,992
You're an hour policy wonk.

242
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,057
I'm a policy wonk.

243
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:51,787
Thank you very much.

244
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,357
Thank you.

245
00:12:52,435 --> 00:12:54,417
Next, Lucy Lawling on the trail.

246
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:54,982
Thank you so much.

247
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,232
You're now a PolicyWonk.

248
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:57,402
I'm a policy wonk.

249
00:12:57,432 --> 00:12:58,642
Thank you very much.

250
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,817
Next, never expected to learn that Alex Jones thinks our last name is weird.

251
00:13:02,877 --> 00:13:04,917
We pronounce it Pet ingill.

252
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:05,757
The gripple.

253
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:06,597
PIBBLE is silent.

254
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:07,222
Thank you so much.

255
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:08,517
You are now a policy wonk.

256
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:09,657
I'm a policy wonk.

257
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:10,417
Thank you very much.

258
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:10,867
Thank you.

259
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,422
Next, angela and Chase of House gripple PIBBLE.

260
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,737
Thank you so much for now policy wonk.

261
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:20,512
Here's how far behind sometimes you can really get it.

262
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:27,867
Really shortly after the gribble pivot and oops all swear he carries.

263
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:28,477
Thank you so much.

264
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:29,547
You're now a policy wonk.

265
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:30,627
I'm a policy wonk.

266
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:31,432
Thank you very much.

267
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,375
Thank you.

268
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:33,897
Now, Jordan.

269
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:34,552
Yes.

270
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,337
As you know, we've talked about this privately.

271
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:52,867
I've been having some insomnia type issues the past week, has been really tough with sleep, schedule, traveling, and I think it has a little bit of an effect on what you want to do, how much you can take on and what have you.

272
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,167
Sure.

273
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:58,282
And I found myself this week definitely having a like, I don't even want to turn on Alex's show.

274
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,647
I don't even want to listen to it.

275
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,567
It's frustrating.

276
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:01,902
I know I'm going to be bored.

277
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,267
I'm already exhausted.

278
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:05,302
I don't really want to do this.

279
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:12,742
And so I can guess what he's saying, and I feel like I'm just not interested.

280
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:13,732
Not hard.

281
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:19,152
And so I decided, hey, Norm talking shit about us covering deposition.

282
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:20,707
We're going through his whole show.

283
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:21,425
No.

284
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:26,197
All these people are afraid to sit in a deposition room.

285
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:27,052
Oh, no.

286
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:30,962
Today we have another formulaic objection.

287
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:37,767
So today what we're going to be looking at is the deposition of Don Salazar.

288
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:38,317
Okay.

289
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,787
The longtime writer and editor at Infowars.

290
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:46,497
One of the people who wrote some of the articles that were primary in the Sandy Hook conspiracies.

291
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:47,150
Right.

292
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:53,022
Someone who has a number of emails around the Sandy Hook conversation.

293
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:53,917
Yes.

294
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:58,400
Somebody who followed us on Twitter until we mentioned it and then he unfollowed us, ran away.

295
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:00,287
Goodbye forever.

296
00:15:01,162 --> 00:15:03,682
This is from the Connecticut case.

297
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,102
Got you.

298
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:17,962
And Don is somebody who I've always had a little bit of a fascination with because I think he is a soldier, as they say in the I don't know what world, but gangland warfare world.

299
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:18,382
Yeah.

300
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:18,892
Got you.

301
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,550
Sure.

302
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:23,127
He strikes me in the same way as someone like a Darya.

303
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:25,087
And that is like, oh, you believe.

304
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:25,657
Right.

305
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:36,837
Or whether or not you believe, you believe in whatever the underlying mission is, you are going to follow orders regardless of whether or not they are sanctioned by the Geneva Conventions.

306
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:37,557
A lie.

307
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:51,012
And you believing some insane things are undistinguishable for you because whatever is motivating it is more important than its primary.

308
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:54,817
He is somebody who's written a lot of horrible shit over the course of his time.

309
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:58,762
He seems like an asshole, but he's also somebody who I've never heard talk.

310
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,437
I've never seen him in front of the camera.

311
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,097
He's not an on camera guy.

312
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:03,892
That's true.

313
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:12,652
And so I had nothing really to prepare me to see his decision, like, what's going to happen here? No.

314
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,050
It's afraid of him anymore, I'll say that.

315
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:20,932
For one thing, he doesn't strike me as savvy as I imagined him.

316
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,252
So his intelligence is not of the worldshaking variety.

317
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:34,317
He might be a perfectly smart person, but I don't find him in the way he answers questions and the way he processes what's going on to be all that like, remarkable.

318
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:34,732
Okay.

319
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,242
And then also he's 37, and that really bummed me out.

320
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:38,857
Right.

321
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:48,742
For some reason, I thought he was like 26 or like, I don't know, in the Alex Darren McBrien a range for some reason.

322
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,662
37 was about the exact age that I was surprised to hear.

323
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:53,947
Yeah.

324
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,927
And I was disappointed.

325
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:56,212
Maybe it's because I'm 38.

326
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:56,767
Sure.

327
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:02,782
It's like I can kind of whatever the landmarks in life.

328
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,142
Right.

329
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,867
They would have been fairly similar.

330
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:15,357
We would have been the same age at about certain times, experience certain things, world events from the same presumed level of maturity.

331
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:15,877
Right.

332
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,742
And that kind of makes me sad.

333
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:18,067
Yeah.

334
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:24,487
It would be less sad if he were on the front nine of life, so to speak, instead of the back nine is where he's started.

335
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,902
He's starting on the 10th hole.

336
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:28,492
And you're going, this is not going to end well for you, man.

337
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:34,012
The other thing too is, though, I realized how delusional that was of me because he's been there since 2012.

338
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,142
So the idea that he would be 26 is like, what? He started at 16.

339
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:39,147
This is ridiculous.

340
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,637
That seems like the appropriate level of writing he's at, though.

341
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,342
You're not wrong.

342
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:43,912
Yeah.

343
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,162
So this deposition is quite interesting.

344
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:52,102
It's taken by Chris Matty and yeah, let's just jump in.

345
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,625
Begins with some formalities and stuff.

346
00:17:56,212 --> 00:18:05,512
And the first question, the first bit that you want to get into is how did you prepare for this deposition always my favorite question.

347
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:10,597
It's a great way to open well, and it always reveals that they didn't really do it at all.

348
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,522
What did you do to prepare for today's deposition, Mr.

349
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:18,800
Salazar? I went over a few of the articles that are in question.

350
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:25,497
Which article? I re read the FBI Sandy Hook.

351
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:27,747
FBI says nobody died at Sandy Hook.

352
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:32,375
And probably the first.

353
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:34,712
How big? Article that I wrote.

354
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:37,357
The first article, probably.

355
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,867
Sorry.

356
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:39,327
How big? Wolfgang.

357
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:41,087
How Big? Article that I wrote.

358
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:49,872
And that article was titled something to the Effect of Investigator Threatened.

359
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:50,577
Sandy Hook.

360
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:51,432
Investigator Threatened.

361
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:52,717
Something to that effect? Yes, sir.

362
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:53,675
That's it.

363
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:55,827
You reviewed those two articles.

364
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:59,172
Did you review anything else? I didn't go in depth.

365
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,802
I kind of just glossed over them.

366
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:02,197
That's pretty much it.

367
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:10,400
Okay, so other than launching all of those two articles, did you review any other materials in advance of your deposition today? No.

368
00:19:12,112 --> 00:19:19,625
Other than Attorney Woman, did you discuss your deposition with anybody else today? No, sir.

369
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:26,722
You haven't communicated with Alice Jones that you're being deposed? No, sir.

370
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:30,187
You haven't communicated that to Rob Do? No, sir.

371
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,352
You haven't communicated that to David Jones? No, sir.

372
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:34,100
Okay.

373
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:37,672
You ordinarily be working today? Yes.

374
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,042
And you're currently employed by who? Free speechystemsinfoworks.com.

375
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:49,092
As this deposition progresses, you get the sense that maybe Adam should have done a little more to prepare for this interview.

376
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:57,702
There are basic elements of his timeline and surrounding context of his writing that Maddie can demonstrate, which Adan seems to think are like, undiscoverable secrets.

377
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:58,282
Right.

378
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:05,187
Also, I find it very strange and probably difficult to believe that Adan didn't talk to Alex or Rob Do about being deposed.

379
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,397
They work together.

380
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,457
This is in relation to a suit against Alex and the company.

381
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:12,892
And as Adan says, he was supposed to be at work that day.

382
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:16,552
It seems like he would have to come up with a reason he couldn't make it to work.

383
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,927
So I guess he must have just lied to his employer right off the bat.

384
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:25,047
That doesn't inspire confidence in him as a credible witness highlighting his willingness to deceive.

385
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:34,317
Yeah, I told no, listen, I didn't tell Alex or Owen or anything because I told him my grandma died and I had to go to the funeral, so I'm a reliable source.

386
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:34,837
Come on.

387
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,362
Let the record show that this guy is a liar.

388
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:42,847
I can understand if Adon doesn't want to say that he spoke with Alex about what he was going to testify as.

389
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:52,062
That would probably or even possibly give the impression that Alex coached him, but I don't understand what issues there would be with him just telling Alex about the existence of this deposition.

390
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:59,142
Alex would have to know that they were interested in talking to Adan since he wrote these articles that are involved in the suit.

391
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:08,737
I could possibly see a scenario where Adam was afraid to tell Alex that he was actually going to show up and talk to the lawyers, but outside of something like that, I have a hard time accepting that this didn't come up.

392
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,297
Yeah, it's possible, but it's just like it seems very weird.

393
00:21:12,342 --> 00:21:14,542
I'm going to throw this out at you, okay.

394
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:33,500
If I was going to be deposed for anything and they had like six books I had to read and I would be like, okay, I'm going to make it through at least a full two or three of these books, right? I've got the time, there's the need to do it, and then maybe I can pass off the other three as being fine.

395
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:39,757
But Adon is only telling me that he skimmed less than 5000 words.

396
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:40,297
Right.

397
00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:42,800
It's not like the articles are long.

398
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:46,717
Some of them may be longer than you think, but not that long.

399
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:50,502
Yeah, it seems really strange.

400
00:21:50,607 --> 00:22:00,217
You would think that if you really wanted to be an active participant, you would go, you'd read the article, you'd figure out like, where the information that you were working from came from.

401
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,500
At least brush up on some of that so you can defend your process.

402
00:22:04,162 --> 00:22:05,812
But yeah, you just skim some stuff.

403
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,367
Yeah.

404
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:13,612
So Adam started in April 2012 and as we know, the shooting happened in December 2012.

405
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:16,325
So he was pretty new there.

406
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:17,752
Yeah.

407
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,867
But before we get to any of that, we talk about what he was doing before April 2012.

408
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:29,000
When did you guys start working for Free Speech Systems? April 2012.

409
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:36,812
Where were you? I held three jobs.

410
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:40,025
I wrote for textbroker.com.

411
00:22:40,912 --> 00:22:44,162
I also was a contractor for Quest Diagnostics.

412
00:22:56,087 --> 00:23:00,387
I was also a Google search engine optimizer.

413
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:05,992
I worked for a contractor for Google called Leadforce.

414
00:23:06,127 --> 00:23:12,082
It's somewhat notable that Don began his time at Info is only a short time before Synthany hook occurred.

415
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:15,137
He was a fresh new on the job reporter when this story started.

416
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:22,997
And as you can tell from this resume that Don is giving, he didn't have previous work experience that would make him well prepared for the role that he found himself in.

417
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:30,712
No the job at Quest is basically a courier position, shuttling samples from hospitals and doctors office to a central testing facility.

418
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:36,472
The job he had with tech broker is the sort of thing where he would get paid to write little blurbs for websites.

419
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:39,362
Sort of a freelance gig thing.

420
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:39,962
Sure.

421
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,257
This is where you might go if you want someone to write a paragraph about a lamp you're selling and you don't want to pay too much.

422
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:52,132
Text broker is also the sort of place you might go to get filler for a website that's designed for gaming affiliate link systems.

423
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:59,422
To give you some sense of the operation in their basic category of services, you can choose their low rate option, which has this blurb.

424
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:00,962
This is how it describes that service.

425
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:03,947
Did they write their own blurb using their service? They might have.

426
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,262
Okay.

427
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:15,107
Quote, I accept mistakes in spelling, grammar, and expression in favor of a lower price for writing, where you can just write what, random misspelled words.

428
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,662
You can make about 1.1 cents per word for that.

429
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,417
If you have to pay attention to spelling and grammar, you can make up to about, like, 5.5 cents a word.

430
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:23,987
Right.

431
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,367
To be clear, I'm not knocking the hustle, and there's no shame in this kind of gig.

432
00:24:27,427 --> 00:24:32,762
It's just not necessarily the sort of writing work you do if you had in demand skills in that field.

433
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:39,017
And it's something that maybe isn't a great thing to be like on the resume for the job that he ends up in.

434
00:24:39,065 --> 00:24:46,650
Yeah, I think heinlein got paid 1.1 cents a word at one point, but it was different currency wise at the time.

435
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,037
I don't think he's on the same level.

436
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,475
Right? I don't think so.

437
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:54,787
Hemingway got money subtracted for punctuation.

438
00:24:54,937 --> 00:24:57,232
Yeah, too many commas.

439
00:24:57,397 --> 00:25:02,687
The job at Leap Force is described here as an SEO subcontractor for Google.

440
00:25:02,825 --> 00:25:12,322
More specifically, the company hires people to work at home and do repetitive searches to evaluate the results, basically to use as information for better ad placement.

441
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:21,427
It's a pain in the ass kind of job, and you can find tons of reviews about the grind and how it's really only worth doing as a side gig for some extra cash unless you can just turn off your brain.

442
00:25:21,457 --> 00:25:25,867
And the people on, like, glass door talk about this as miserable.

443
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:26,462
Yeah.

444
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,577
I mean, no offense to a Don or anybody else working these kinds of jobs.

445
00:25:30,682 --> 00:25:35,587
It actually does show quite a bit of initiative for him to have these three gigs running simultaneously.

446
00:25:35,662 --> 00:25:37,402
That's impressive.

447
00:25:37,432 --> 00:25:38,002
He's got a hustle.

448
00:25:38,032 --> 00:25:39,742
In a certain sense, he's got a hustle.

449
00:25:39,802 --> 00:25:48,692
I just don't think it's the kind of resume I would be incredibly impressed by if I were running a super important media network and I was looking to hire a reporter, editor of the news.

450
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,502
Maybe you take a chance on this candidate and you get lucky.

451
00:25:51,532 --> 00:25:55,867
But Adam's writing and behavior are pretty central to the claims that infowars was disseminating.

452
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:57,752
That just lost them a billion dollars.

453
00:25:57,845 --> 00:26:00,152
So it doesn't seem like this one worked out great.

454
00:26:00,245 --> 00:26:08,527
When I worked at the coupon place testing coupons, that was my whole job, is I would go in there and I would test expired coupons.

455
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:12,347
I'd put the code into a website, and I'd click, can you buy? And they'd be like, no.

456
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,237
And I'd be like, you're goddamn right, no.

457
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,547
That was my whole day, right? Yeah.

458
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:23,937
At no point in time was I like, okay, now that I've finished this, I'm going to go work for the Tribune as a cub reporter.

459
00:26:24,437 --> 00:26:25,887
That's not the jump.

460
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:28,342
Let's even go a step further.

461
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:29,887
It's not a cub reporter.

462
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:31,592
No, that's right.

463
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,575
I'm not the features editor at Tribune today.

464
00:26:35,312 --> 00:26:39,217
Asadon will go on to describe his role immediately.

465
00:26:39,277 --> 00:26:41,117
Was essentially he could write whatever he wanted.

466
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:42,687
There was no oversight.

467
00:26:44,387 --> 00:26:53,327
It's going from Coupon cabin to being to write by hand in the newspaper, basically, while people writing it, while they're reading it.

468
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,917
So just make it up as you go along.

469
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:55,702
It's wild.

470
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:56,850
That's crazy.

471
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:00,012
Not best practices.

472
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,497
So now we get to Adam's educational background.

473
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,400
Okay, tell me about your educational background, please.

474
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:17,037
I went to the University of Texas for about a year and a half and majored in liberal arts.

475
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:27,902
Took several English courses there, and I also did half a semester at Austin Community College.

476
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:32,042
I don't know why you would even bring up that you did half a semester at a community college.

477
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:33,202
It's just confusing.

478
00:27:33,232 --> 00:27:37,247
And it sounds like you're saying that you signed up for some classes and you just didn't finish them.

479
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:42,392
Austin Community College has 16 week semesters, but they also offer some courses that run eight weeks.

480
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,762
So it's entirely possible that Adan is expressing that he finished some of those eight week classes.

481
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:50,342
But if that's the case, he should have said, I took a few classes at ACC.

482
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,052
That makes me think that it's more likely that he signed up and then just didn't finish them.

483
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:02,122
Also, I don't know how it is at all universities, but typically liberal arts isn't a major in sort of a category of majors.

484
00:28:02,242 --> 00:28:03,932
You wouldn't be a liberal arts major.

485
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,127
No, you'd be within the liberal arts.

486
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:12,407
I mean, in the early year that he did finish, maybe he hadn't chosen a specific major.

487
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:14,392
He was just taking the basic courses.

488
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:14,627
Yeah.

489
00:28:14,645 --> 00:28:18,157
And you were drawn towards the soft sciences of humanities.

490
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:18,992
Yes.

491
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,350
That's fine, but I don't think liberal arts is a major.

492
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:24,782
I didn't go to UT Austin, though.

493
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:35,837
I went to a community college for a while, and I hated it so much that after the second week, I would drive there to avoid telling my parents that I wasn't going to school.

494
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:41,837
But I would sleep in the parking lot in the car in case they put, like, a low jack on your car? Exactly.

495
00:28:41,975 --> 00:28:42,977
Just in case.

496
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,922
What, am I going to go in and sleep in the class? No, that's disrespectful.

497
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:48,922
I'm going to not go to their class and sleep nearby.

498
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:49,862
That's pretty good.

499
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:50,282
Yeah.

500
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,637
I did not put that on many resumes, though.

501
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,800
I didn't put it on there when I hired you.

502
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:57,750
Yeah, exactly.

503
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:06,482
So I'm a huge fan of education and the academic environment as a whole, but I do try to be as clear as possible that I don't think it's necessary for everyone to partake in.

504
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,457
You can be as smart and capable as anyone who went to college without any higher education.

505
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:14,857
And many folks I know bear that out over here looking at you, buddy.

506
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:22,397
There are so many hyper competent people who never went to college, and those people aren't folks that I would look at and say, hey, they should take some classes because.

507
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,732
They're doing just fine.

508
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:37,832
On the other hand, if you don't have any formal education, then find yourself as a highly placed reporter at a propaganda outlet where you argue that grieving families are actors and you're discussing your educational background in a deposition that about that shitty work that you did.

509
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:44,347
I might think that your lack of training or familiarity with the field that you're in is a problem and it could have helped if you would have taken some classes.

510
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:48,757
Yeah, to be perfectly blunt, I don't think that any amount of classes would have helped the dom.

511
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:53,897
Not that he's dumb or anything, just that I don't think that he's interested in doing the thing that he's doing.

512
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,432
Well, I don't think he needs to get better.

513
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:01,562
If you have the moral framework necessary to do what you're doing now, then you're fine.

514
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:05,942
Whether you're an expert at J school or not, you're going to do what you're doing.

515
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,197
Yeah.

516
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,297
You might just need a moment of revelation about yourself as opposed to classes.

517
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:11,347
Honestly.

518
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:18,847
So by this point, the deposition, we have a sense of what Adam's resume would have probably looked like when he applied to be a writer and editor at Infowars.

519
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:32,027
He had some freelance style writing experience, but beyond that, iffy credential, he had no experience in media or journalism and he had no education in the field, but he got hired anyway, and it seems like there might be possibly a reason why.

520
00:30:41,387 --> 00:30:43,177
I liked Alex Jones.

521
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:55,287
And the message? Before you ever applied to free speech systems, you were essentially an audience member, correct? Yes, he was a fan.

522
00:30:57,212 --> 00:31:01,442
Every time I learn more about how Infowars operates, I'm like, there's no way.

523
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:02,702
There's just no way.

524
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:05,897
It's usually a contest that people win and they end up working.

525
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:18,787
I guess that maybe is for more the on air folks, because given the razzle dazzle of an Infowars contest about writing, cause there's like no benchmark.

526
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:21,862
There's no like oh, here's good writing and here's bad writing.

527
00:31:21,937 --> 00:31:25,147
You've just got the same Infowars essay contest.

528
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:29,597
Oh, no, I think that's the low rate.

529
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:33,187
Not worried about typos and spellings and characters.

530
00:31:33,262 --> 00:31:34,142
1.1 cent.

531
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,075
Yeah, that's 1.1 cent a word.

532
00:31:37,337 --> 00:31:57,387
So Mattie asks, what was it about Infowars that really got you interested? What Alex Jones show and the written content? Probably they're refusal to believe the narrative behind 911.

533
00:31:58,187 --> 00:31:58,950
Okay.

534
00:31:59,312 --> 00:32:14,100
Do you suspect the narrative that the mainstream media had reported concerning 911? What was that question again? Were you suspicious? I'm sorry, just let me finish my question.

535
00:32:14,537 --> 00:32:30,152
I know you're anticipating what I'm going to say, but did you personally suspect the narrative that the mainstream media had reported concerning 911? Yes, I was suspicious of it.

536
00:32:30,245 --> 00:32:35,197
So in eleven years after 911, that's a motivating.

537
00:32:35,317 --> 00:32:39,837
I guess maybe whenever he got interested in it could have been gears prior.

538
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:47,112
So motivating factor suspicion about 911 and their refusal to accept the mainstream narrative.

539
00:32:47,912 --> 00:32:58,022
What's your career path like? If it starts with, I thought 911 was an inside job, and then the next step is, I'm the editor@infowars.com.

540
00:32:58,205 --> 00:32:59,302
That's a career path.

541
00:32:59,332 --> 00:33:05,642
I saw employment because I was impressed with these people refusing to believe that 911 happened.

542
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,242
That is great.

543
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,725
We're told that is great.

544
00:33:08,762 --> 00:33:16,402
So I appreciate this instinct on Maddie's part, and that is to go from this like, oh, you were suspicious about 911.

545
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:17,477
Why? Yeah.

546
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:21,450
Because in a deposition setting, that can lead to some interesting things.

547
00:33:22,112 --> 00:33:35,197
And what in particular were you suspicious of? I didn't think we were being told the full truth about various parts of that narrative.

548
00:33:35,392 --> 00:33:47,147
Like, can you go into a little bit more detail about what you thought the gaps were in what the reporting was? I could.

549
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:55,082
I suppose I didn't think that the planes should have been able to take down the buildings as they were taken down.

550
00:33:55,235 --> 00:34:00,900
It seemed like a controlled demolition, which is a lot of people still believe, actually.

551
00:34:02,762 --> 00:34:12,302
Are you one of those? That was probably the biggest one, especially with building seven falling and collapsing, controlled demolition style when no plane hit it.

552
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,862
So those are the biggest factors.

553
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:36,722
And did the fact that you felt it was implausible that the buildings would have collapsed the way they did cause you to suspect whether the United States government was involved in some way in the attack injection? Yes, sir.

554
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,367
Okay.

555
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:41,717
So this is a really interesting clip, because there's a couple of things happening here.

556
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,187
The first is really transparent, which is how a conspiracy theorist answers a question.

557
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:52,067
Adan is asked why he was suspicious about 911, but it's a conspiracy he hasn't focused on in a while.

558
00:34:52,115 --> 00:34:57,242
So a lot of the talking points are a bit foggy in his memory, so he tries to give a vague, non answer.

559
00:34:57,365 --> 00:35:02,267
Then Maddie asks for something more specific, and Ada basically it doesn't seem right.

560
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:05,162
And Building seven is a response, which is pretty soft.

561
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:05,627
Yeah.

562
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,082
The second thing is, something that will become important later is some of Maddie's questions develop.

563
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:12,797
This is something that Adon is suspicious about.

564
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:18,247
He has some inconclusive things to point to that he can use to justify these suspicions.

565
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:23,567
And based on having those suspicions, he just testified to Maddie that led him to suspect the US.

566
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:25,312
Government was involved.

567
00:35:25,462 --> 00:35:35,467
This provides a clear example of Adan's thought process, where he's willing to take things that look weird and make him suspicious and use them to build up baseless explanatory narratives.

568
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:43,067
Hold on to this for later, because it will become clear how relevant this is to the matter at hand and how much of a mistake this was on Adon's part.

569
00:35:43,190 --> 00:36:00,387
In reflection, yeah, maybe it doesn't, you know, lead to any direct consequences, but if you're analyzing this and looking at the way he describes his process and how he interacts with information, it's very damning.

570
00:36:01,862 --> 00:36:03,257
That will become clearer later.

571
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:03,932
Yeah.

572
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:26,197
I mean, that's hard to I do appreciate one thing about Infowars employees that will never not be hilarious to me is that at some point, doesn't the lawyer have to go in and be like, before you answer the question, look at me to see whether or not I'm going to object? It in a deposition.

573
00:36:26,242 --> 00:36:32,002
It's a different but in this setting, you still have to answer the question unless it's some other kind of objection.

574
00:36:32,032 --> 00:36:40,127
But these objections are just, yeah, you can't be away, but I think you could just still say, like, I don't know or not answer.

575
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:40,967
Sure.

576
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,577
Just always look at your lawyer before your answer.

577
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,777
It's not hard.

578
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,257
Right.

579
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:56,552
Isn't that's what I would do? I'd be like, my answer is so when Adan got hired, he got some training.

580
00:36:56,645 --> 00:36:56,942
Sure.

581
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,127
But it wasn't what you thought.

582
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,050
Yeah, it's not really training.

583
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:17,032
When you started at Info Wars in April of 2012, did you receive any training of any kind just to learn the back end systems, like WordPress and things of that nature.

584
00:37:17,197 --> 00:37:29,312
Okay, so that training basically involved learning how to use the software programs that you are going to be using every day as an employee, correct? Yes.

585
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:35,925
Did you receive any training concerning the writing function of your job? No.

586
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:39,277
Did you ever objection.

587
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:50,400
A form? Did you ever receive any training during your tenure? Free speech systems concerning the writing function of your job? No.

588
00:37:51,662 --> 00:37:52,067
Wow.

589
00:37:52,115 --> 00:38:05,467
Have you ever received any training during the course of your employment concerning investigative journalistic practice? They train you more at, like, a fast food restaurant.

590
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:21,967
Yeah, I remember when I went to I worked at JCPenney's for a cup of coffee when I was younger, and there was an entire hours long thing about the corporate culture, the rules and harassment policies.

591
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:23,762
You had to sit in a room and watch videos.

592
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:28,652
At the very least, you had to sign something saying that you understood the rules of what they told you.

593
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,207
Yeah.

594
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:45,832
It seems like there's less oversight at Infowars than JCPenney's, man, if you have walked into any newspaper in the world and they didn't tell you first things first about the quote in house style, if they were just like, right away, my dude.

595
00:38:45,997 --> 00:38:56,417
Also, I would say that every single job that I've ever had, at least the first half a week, maybe even the first week you're working with somebody else.

596
00:38:56,465 --> 00:38:57,300
Yeah, absolutely.

597
00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:59,242
You're trained Shadowing.

598
00:38:59,302 --> 00:38:59,612
Yeah.

599
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:03,825
Because you can be trusted just to know exactly how to do your job.

600
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:05,362
And it's wild.

601
00:39:05,437 --> 00:39:07,922
That does not seem to be the case here.

602
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:14,775
It is wild to not receive training on the job you are ostensibly doing.

603
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:21,082
They taught him how to post things on the Internet through WordPress.

604
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:22,472
Yeah, that was it.

605
00:39:22,505 --> 00:39:26,192
You know what? It kind of makes me think of, like, some temp gigs I've had yeah.

606
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:29,777
Where it's just like, all right, here's how you enter this data go do it.

607
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:30,502
I don't give a shit.

608
00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:31,607
I got other work to do.

609
00:39:31,685 --> 00:39:40,472
What did he think that first six months, right? He had to have been walking around like, they know, right? They know I have no idea what I'm doing.

610
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,137
They have to look at me and know.

611
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,550
Maybe that's part of the test, though.

612
00:39:44,912 --> 00:39:50,452
You have the psychopathic confidence there's no such thing as impostor syndrome.

613
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:50,762
Exactly.

614
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:52,102
Because I'm the greatest.

615
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:52,697
Yeah.

616
00:39:52,805 --> 00:40:07,500
So you also got no training about what news to cover what you understood when you applied Infowars, that you were applying for an editor and writer position when you first started.

617
00:40:08,762 --> 00:40:16,712
It sounds like one of the things that you needed to do was update news items on the Infowars.com website, correct? Yes.

618
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:46,050
And what do you mean by update? Kind of like, find news items and republish them on Info or with a link back to the original source, find news items that appeared elsewhere on the Internet, and then put a link to that news item on the Infowars.com website, correct? Yes, sir.

619
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:56,497
And how would you determine which news items to highlight on the Infowars.com website? That was subjective.

620
00:40:56,692 --> 00:41:01,050
So basically, whatever I thought would be good on the website.

621
00:41:02,012 --> 00:41:06,962
Did you receive any guidance or training on that in any way? No.

622
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,637
That's wild.

623
00:41:11,237 --> 00:41:11,792
I know.

624
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,922
Words fail.

625
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:19,937
I just don't know how it's so nuts that, like, you have to think, like, that can't be true.

626
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,732
That can't be true.

627
00:41:20,735 --> 00:41:21,737
But it could be.

628
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:24,737
It's the only place in the world where it could be true.

629
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,462
It could be true here.

630
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,022
And, like, the opening of a WeWork.

631
00:41:30,217 --> 00:41:36,075
These are the only two scams where you can pull up having no clue what you're doing, and just be like, yeah, fuck it.

632
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,275
Wow.

633
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:40,952
I'm just making noises, man.

634
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,597
Yeah.

635
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,922
I don't know how to deal with that information.

636
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,050
I would have straight up quit so fast.

637
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,202
This is a scam.

638
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:49,847
This is a scam? Yes.

639
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,692
I would have just been like, or at least this is trouble.

640
00:41:53,827 --> 00:42:01,057
This is a recipe for leaving aside anything about the ideology or anything about Infowars.

641
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:03,375
A business that runs like this.

642
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:06,797
I don't know if payroll works like this.

643
00:42:06,905 --> 00:42:12,237
What are we doing? What is going on? That is the roommate scam.

644
00:42:12,587 --> 00:42:17,542
If I was interviewing for that job, I would view it the same way as the roommate scam.

645
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:28,157
You know, where it's like, no, I'll move in with you and be a roommate, but I need $1,000 upfront to move here, and then I'll give you $2,000, whatever, or whatever it is.

646
00:42:28,235 --> 00:42:29,042
I didn't know about that.

647
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,247
Yeah, it's a great scam.

648
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:34,697
It works for somebody, but it is the job equivalent of that.

649
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,347
It's like, hey, man, come on in.

650
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,237
You're a new editor? No.

651
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,187
I don't believe you for a fucking second.

652
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,400
You are trying to make me the CEO and then blame me for something.

653
00:42:45,287 --> 00:42:47,797
I'm the fall guy, right? This is a bait and switch.

654
00:42:47,842 --> 00:42:49,125
Here, for sure.

655
00:42:50,162 --> 00:42:50,925
Yeah.

656
00:43:07,637 --> 00:43:08,400
No.

657
00:43:10,562 --> 00:43:15,647
You should probably and it was like, thanks a little less.

658
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,867
It was more loose back in 2012.

659
00:43:17,915 --> 00:43:25,652
And now we learned our lessons, and we're kind of stricter about what we republish, and I'll ask you some questions about that.

660
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:39,467
But at the time you started, you could go to any website, select a news item that you thought your audience might be interested in, and publish it to infowars.com, correct? Yes.

661
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,237
Wild.

662
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:43,337
So we've learned our lesson thing.

663
00:43:43,475 --> 00:43:48,947
You think that that's about, like, content, like Sandy Hook stuff, but it's not.

664
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:58,682
He explained later in a clip that I didn't cut that basically there are some websites that are litigious about repurposing their content.

665
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,177
Yeah.

666
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,612
It did sound like he was trained on stealing.

667
00:44:01,687 --> 00:44:02,192
Yeah.

668
00:44:02,315 --> 00:44:08,347
And so he's like, basically by trial and error, you learn that the AP doesn't like it when you just steal their articles.

669
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:09,002
Right.

670
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,767
And so you just avoid AP articles.

671
00:44:11,827 --> 00:44:12,450
Right.

672
00:44:13,112 --> 00:44:15,532
That's pretty sad.

673
00:44:15,697 --> 00:44:20,927
In terms of the lessons you've learned are respecting intellectual property.

674
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:27,750
I guess it is analogous to learning about which dumpsters are good to get food from.

675
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:31,132
There's definitely certainly something along those lines.

676
00:44:31,222 --> 00:44:34,050
They are nothing if not info record.

677
00:44:35,837 --> 00:44:38,867
We info scavenge in the info war.

678
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:50,677
So I think that if you're in a position like a don, you always have to, whether you believe it or not, put on the front facing facade company line that you are reporting facts.

679
00:44:50,707 --> 00:44:51,077
Yes.

680
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,597
You're doing factual reporting.

681
00:44:52,642 --> 00:44:53,567
Doing the god's work.

682
00:44:53,615 --> 00:44:54,182
Yeah.

683
00:44:54,335 --> 00:45:09,525
Do you consider yourself to be reporting facts, or do you consider yourself to be writing your opinion? How do you consider the type of writing you're doing? Objection to form.

684
00:45:11,987 --> 00:45:21,487
I believe it's probably you write the facts with maybe like a right leading slant instead of the left leaning slant, the mainstream media approach.

685
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:22,350
Okay.

686
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:41,462
So if I understand correctly, in your writing, you are reporting facts, but to the extent there's any sort of editorializing of those facts, you put a right leaning slant on them? Yes.

687
00:45:41,525 --> 00:45:44,072
And usually yes, I think so.

688
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:54,525
And is that because you know that your audience is used to the right of the political spectrum? My audience and me? Yes.

689
00:45:55,112 --> 00:45:55,562
Right.

690
00:45:55,625 --> 00:46:01,937
If I started writing left wing manifestos, your audience will never know what the heck happened.

691
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,037
Right, right.

692
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,412
Yeah.

693
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:12,197
Well, I think the journalistic outfits, like the AP and stuff, they pretend to be objective, but they're not.

694
00:46:12,305 --> 00:46:14,487
And we don't pretend to be objective.

695
00:46:15,287 --> 00:46:21,825
I'm sorry, what? When you say you pretend to be objective, I assume you don't need that.

696
00:46:23,387 --> 00:46:24,997
We wear our bias on our sleeves.

697
00:46:25,042 --> 00:46:25,472
Sorry.

698
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,252
Not really.

699
00:46:26,345 --> 00:46:27,572
No, absolutely not.

700
00:46:27,605 --> 00:46:29,932
Alex's entire brand is he's above the left right parents.

701
00:46:29,947 --> 00:46:30,692
That's the whole thing.

702
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,307
Yeah.

703
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:37,297
The right leaning slant of this is absolutely a betrayal of the central premise of Infowars.

704
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:38,042
Yeah.

705
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,900
But also quite obvious.

706
00:46:40,262 --> 00:46:42,427
So not revelatory.

707
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:50,452
It's just embarrassing that Adan would phrase it this way in a under oath setting because Alex probably disagrees.

708
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,717
Yeah, I'm not right wing.

709
00:46:52,852 --> 00:47:03,750
The hard part about these depositions is I always feel like we should really, really you know, no matter how basic a concept you think you're dealing with, you need to go further and further down.

710
00:47:04,562 --> 00:47:09,397
What do you think a journalist does? Well, they tried to do that with Kit Daniels.

711
00:47:09,442 --> 00:47:09,692
Right.

712
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,592
That didn't go well.

713
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,287
That was weird.

714
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:12,647
Yeah, good point.

715
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,032
And to be fair, I think that you could probably find some fertile ground in there.

716
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:18,572
Right.

717
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,117
But this is already 4 hours long, the deposition.

718
00:47:22,177 --> 00:47:22,667
That's true.

719
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,102
Probably don't need to get down to like first principles.

720
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:25,667
That's true.

721
00:47:25,715 --> 00:47:26,977
Basic core concepts.

722
00:47:27,082 --> 00:47:32,687
I would really like to get down to the very nitty gritty and be like, let's go with a glossary of words, my man.

723
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,187
I would love using this.

724
00:47:34,325 --> 00:47:41,732
There's nobody in the world who would love if every one of these depositions was a Ken Burns documentary more than me.

725
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:42,092
Right.

726
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:42,517
Naturally.

727
00:47:42,577 --> 00:47:43,592
That's what I want.

728
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,752
Of course you can't do it.

729
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,462
Other humans have other things to do.

730
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:48,122
I understand.

731
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,687
So Adon gets to talking about his research method.

732
00:47:52,862 --> 00:47:53,850
They're good.

733
00:47:54,212 --> 00:48:03,975
When you are reporting facts to your audience, I take it that it is important for you to accurately report what those facts are, correct? Yes.

734
00:48:05,987 --> 00:48:24,987
And when you're writing about a particular topic, what do you do to educate yourself about the topic and the facts that you're going to convey? I do research and pretty much read everything I can before I jump into an article.

735
00:48:26,387 --> 00:48:52,887
Where do the sources of information come from that you read? I do a Google search on Google News and also we'll look back at anything that Infowars has written and maybe look at a YouTube video or two, try to find various different data points to try to formulate facts and opinions on the subject.

736
00:48:55,262 --> 00:49:06,225
When you are doing research for piece you're writing, you are doing that research exclusively from internet sources, correct? Yes.

737
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:11,325
Including Info or own previous material? Yes, sir.

738
00:49:12,287 --> 00:49:13,912
That doesn't inspire confidence.

739
00:49:13,987 --> 00:49:14,447
Wow.

740
00:49:14,555 --> 00:49:17,177
My research methods are Googling things.

741
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:20,657
Looking at Infowars articles from the past and maybe some YouTube videos.

742
00:49:20,735 --> 00:49:21,375
Yes.

743
00:49:22,412 --> 00:49:23,175
Yeah.

744
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:29,047
This is the dream.

745
00:49:29,242 --> 00:49:30,762
He's living the dream.

746
00:49:31,112 --> 00:49:34,787
Isn't that what he's doing? Well, it's easy in a certain sense.

747
00:49:34,925 --> 00:49:40,232
He doesn't have to do anything but occasionally Google stuff and then steal it.

748
00:49:40,385 --> 00:49:48,092
I imagine that there is a lot of like you got to get this out fast because this isn't going to be interesting to people in 6 hours.

749
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:48,797
Sure.

750
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,042
So some of that is probably a hectic frustrating schedule.

751
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:56,057
I'm sure there's emails flying around, did you see this? Did you see that? Sure.

752
00:49:56,135 --> 00:49:56,597
Yeah.

753
00:49:56,705 --> 00:50:00,347
And then I also don't know how much he's getting paid because that doesn't come up.

754
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,775
So it could also be 1.1 cents a word.

755
00:50:03,287 --> 00:50:05,797
And if that's the case, then maybe this isn't such a good gig.

756
00:50:05,842 --> 00:50:09,922
But if he's making as much as some of the other Infores employees, I mean, holy shit.

757
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:11,037
Holy shit.

758
00:50:11,462 --> 00:50:13,112
Get the fuck out of here.

759
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:18,427
Yeah, I wouldn't go back to Google Analytics either, or whatever it was he was fucking.

760
00:50:18,607 --> 00:50:19,217
No.

761
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:25,492
Although he didn't even read these 5000 words that he needed to read for this deposition.

762
00:50:25,627 --> 00:50:33,577
What confidence does that give you that he actually does any fucking reading? This deposition isn't an article that he needs that very seriously.

763
00:50:33,607 --> 00:50:36,225
I read everything I can on Google.

764
00:50:36,887 --> 00:50:40,322
So here's an editor now, right? Sort of.

765
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,012
Not really.

766
00:50:41,075 --> 00:50:41,477
Okay.

767
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:44,357
He has a copy editor who reviews the work.

768
00:51:08,162 --> 00:51:12,450
whenever Jamie White is available, he reviews your work? Yes.

769
00:51:12,812 --> 00:51:20,687
And for what purpose does he review it? Typos, pretty much the end.

770
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:24,452
And make sure I got my I's and T's crossed and stuff.

771
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:28,747
So I's and t's you're referring to, like, no typographical errors.

772
00:51:28,942 --> 00:51:29,387
Yeah.

773
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,497
Or words and stuff.

774
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:31,427
Yes, exactly.

775
00:51:31,595 --> 00:51:34,717
He's essentially just proofreading, correct? Yeah, proofreading.

776
00:51:34,777 --> 00:51:35,400
Okay.

777
00:51:35,837 --> 00:51:36,377
Amazing.

778
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:39,762
He's not checking for the accuracy of what you've written.

779
00:51:43,337 --> 00:51:44,625
Technically, no.

780
00:51:44,987 --> 00:51:46,067
Technically, no.

781
00:51:46,115 --> 00:51:47,537
Well, certainly it's technically, no.

782
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,392
Technically, no.

783
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,032
There's no way you could say technically.

784
00:51:50,122 --> 00:51:55,267
They have, like, a whole conversation about whether or not anybody has ever done that in his time at Infowars.

785
00:51:55,402 --> 00:51:57,782
And he mentions only one person.

786
00:51:57,935 --> 00:52:01,507
There's this guy, Mikhail Falan, who isn't with the company anymore.

787
00:52:01,522 --> 00:52:03,097
He now writes for the Daily Dot.

788
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:13,657
I don't know what the fuck his deal is, but he has managed to transition out of the Infowars stink into somewhat legitimate like he's actually writing somewhere.

789
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:15,742
Yeah, I bet he has an editor.

790
00:52:15,877 --> 00:52:16,575
Yeah.

791
00:52:17,162 --> 00:52:20,117
I don't know what his deal is, but he was there.

792
00:52:20,165 --> 00:52:27,612
And apparently when he was there, he would point out things like, no wonder he got fired.

793
00:52:29,237 --> 00:52:34,582
But Adon doesn't understand, like, that action.

794
00:52:34,672 --> 00:52:35,325
Right.

795
00:52:35,912 --> 00:52:41,100
He experiences it as like, oh, he was just doing that because he wanted to.

796
00:52:41,762 --> 00:52:43,882
It was just kind of fun for Mikael.

797
00:52:43,972 --> 00:52:46,892
It was like we were having a little game between us.

798
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,977
I would lie and he would be like, you can't do this.

799
00:52:48,995 --> 00:52:50,087
And I'd be like, ha ha.

800
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:50,852
And then post it.

801
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:54,422
You get the strong sense that he didn't listen to the advice that Phelan was giving me.

802
00:52:54,455 --> 00:52:55,057
Wild.

803
00:52:55,222 --> 00:52:55,862
Yeah.

804
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,802
So he can just write about whatever he wants.

805
00:52:58,895 --> 00:53:02,507
And apparently he has never been told not to write something.

806
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:07,275
Have you ever been instructed that you couldn't write about a particular topic? No.

807
00:53:08,912 --> 00:53:16,382
Have you ever had a request to publish an article turned down? No, I don't think so.

808
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:23,347
This is directly contradictory to Alex's entire thing about how he told people not to write about we're done with this topic.

809
00:53:23,392 --> 00:53:24,227
Got it.

810
00:53:24,395 --> 00:53:25,562
So that's interesting.

811
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:36,697
And because I believe that email from Paul to Buckley, it mentions Ada.

812
00:53:36,742 --> 00:53:38,957
Adan wrote something about this.

813
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:44,372
And so he would be the person who was told, don't write about this.

814
00:53:44,405 --> 00:53:45,602
That would be the only person.

815
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:48,362
And so someone has their picture wrong.

816
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:49,487
Oh, that's not good.

817
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:54,742
So I don't know how you picture the workplace environment at Infowars.

818
00:53:54,802 --> 00:54:05,632
The kind of like, coworker after I find out that nobody's even does don Salazar even live in the country? He lives in Austin.

819
00:54:05,722 --> 00:54:09,692
Right, but I mean, there's no way to know based on what he's describing of his job.

820
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:14,282
He could be in fucking South America right now and nobody would have any difference.

821
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:21,247
I think that's probably part of why it's so easy for Paul to have worked there the entire time living in England.

822
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:21,900
Yeah.

823
00:54:22,562 --> 00:54:29,100
But the workplace environment seems really cold and this bums me out.

824
00:54:29,762 --> 00:54:38,162
During the course of your employment at Infowars, has your contact level with Mr.

825
00:54:38,225 --> 00:54:41,250
Jones changed at all? No.

826
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:45,167
How often are you in communication with Mr.

827
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:53,687
Jones? In communication? I would say maybe going to the bathroom or something.

828
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,287
Say hi.

829
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,475
So once a week or something.

830
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:04,877
How often are you in communication to him about the substance of your working in force? Some of them, if ever.

831
00:55:05,045 --> 00:55:06,337
This is bizarre.

832
00:55:06,412 --> 00:55:07,822
Living the dream.

833
00:55:07,942 --> 00:55:09,012
No, boss.

834
00:55:10,037 --> 00:55:12,287
I want to do a cubicle every day.

835
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:19,950
I mean, he's worked there for a decade and Alex still doesn't know his name.

836
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:24,900
Oh my God.

837
00:55:25,337 --> 00:55:27,037
It's inconceivable.

838
00:55:27,187 --> 00:55:31,350
That is I don't believe that if that is true.

839
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:33,412
So rude.

840
00:55:33,487 --> 00:55:34,312
Totally.

841
00:55:34,462 --> 00:55:35,332
Totally.

842
00:55:35,497 --> 00:55:37,787
There aren't that many people who work there.

843
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:38,162
No.

844
00:55:38,225 --> 00:55:46,577
How do you ignore one that close to you, that's banana, and somebody who's responsible for creating so much of the content that you use to lie on air.

845
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:47,325
Yeah.

846
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:48,537
Wild.

847
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:53,392
It's like that is impersonal to the point of being hostile.

848
00:55:53,452 --> 00:55:54,707
Yeah, absolutely.

849
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:59,242
There's no way to experience that except as like, this is a clear rejection.

850
00:55:59,302 --> 00:56:01,367
I'd feel like I was being iced out or something.

851
00:56:01,415 --> 00:56:03,000
You've been there ten years.

852
00:56:03,362 --> 00:56:07,352
It would feel like, oh, Alex has clearly tried to get rid of me.

853
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:07,937
Wow.

854
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,262
And then it just never happens, I guess.

855
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:10,652
Yeah.

856
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,982
You just hide out in your cubicle and just wait until someone notices you're there.

857
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:14,700
Yeah.

858
00:56:16,112 --> 00:56:25,697
I go back to the forensic financial analyst and he's like, a competently run business should have this to this amount of money.

859
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:37,277
And when you hear shit like this, you're like, either they've got an absurd amount of money hidden in gold somewhere because they are hiding it from everyone, or this place just doesn't even know where money comes from.

860
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,562
Like, they just don't.

861
00:56:38,987 --> 00:56:43,612
Yeah, well, they do have a very serious distrust of fiat currency.

862
00:56:43,687 --> 00:56:44,325
Exactly.

863
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:45,002
Yeah.

864
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:45,677
I don't know.

865
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,557
It's a weird, weird picture.

866
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:51,382
If it wasn't Infowars, it would be like wonka factory nonsense.

867
00:56:51,397 --> 00:56:51,797
Absolutely.

868
00:56:51,905 --> 00:57:02,702
It would be like everyone's running around in costumes and like no what the fuck is this? When do you see Alex? Well, occasionally he calls the entire staff out.

869
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,637
We have to put on our elf costumes, and we have to do a little dance for him and then we go back to work.

870
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,067
I mean, that question wasn't asked.

871
00:57:10,265 --> 00:57:12,202
Could be whatever you have to wear.

872
00:57:12,232 --> 00:57:13,837
A little dance at Dancer.

873
00:57:13,912 --> 00:57:14,972
You never know.

874
00:57:15,155 --> 00:57:25,592
So we finally get to Sandy Hook coming up, and the question that's opposed is, when did you find out about the shooting? Mr.

875
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:43,950
Salzar, do you recall how you first learned about the Sandy Hook shooting? I believe I was at work when it happened, so it was kind of playing everywhere on CNN, the break room.

876
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,637
Then it was everywhere on the Internet.

877
00:57:48,212 --> 00:57:56,100
And so given your job as a writer, I take it that you started following that coverage very closely as soon as it broke? Yes.

878
00:57:56,612 --> 00:58:05,400
And you knew immediately that the Sandy Hook shooting was going to be a subject of Info Wars reporting, correct? I didn't know that immediately, no.

879
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:13,192
You weren't able to leave into it that this was going to be a major news story that infowars was going to cover? Objection.

880
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:22,187
No, I didn't immediately realize that until days after what came off of the news.

881
00:58:22,325 --> 00:58:29,462
So at that time, like, two days after the event happened, I was like, okay, this is a big news event.

882
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:39,172
This is something to keep an eye on here because Adon is testifying that in this first month, he was unaware of an intent to cover the shooting at Sandy Hook as being fake.

883
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:43,867
And that timeline is going to be in trouble as information is revealed.

884
00:58:43,927 --> 00:58:48,547
Yeah, but yeah, your response to that is, I think, very appropriate.

885
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:52,412
Like, it's very bizarre to imagine that you could see the shooting happen.

886
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:53,557
You work it in force.

887
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,442
You know how they've covered shootings in the past.

888
00:58:55,565 --> 00:59:03,752
You were there for Aurora, which just happened pretty recently, and like, a couple of days later, you realize, oh, this is a big story.

889
00:59:03,845 --> 00:59:05,887
What? It's very weird.

890
00:59:05,962 --> 00:59:08,262
Either he's lying or he's insane.

891
00:59:08,687 --> 00:59:10,202
Like, there's no other way.

892
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,092
I think it's lying.

893
00:59:11,152 --> 00:59:16,037
Or just trying to give a softer appearance, too.

894
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:23,482
Yeah, we weren't taking this as seriously as we could or maybe thought we would, something along those lines.

895
00:59:23,572 --> 00:59:29,822
There's no way you don't want to give the impression that you're like seeing this and getting excited for the coverage that you're going to do.

896
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:32,972
I can understand how that isn't the perception you would want to give.

897
00:59:33,005 --> 00:59:36,332
Like, I saw this and I immediately knew this was going to lead the news.

898
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:37,050
Right.

899
00:59:37,862 --> 00:59:39,167
Okay, fine.

900
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:40,052
Wow, whatever.

901
00:59:40,145 --> 00:59:41,132
There's going to be a problem.

902
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:49,172
Yeah, but a couple of days, I would even be like, oh, it was a few hours afterwards when I realized it was going to be what it was.

903
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,822
A couple of days makes you sound like you're hiding underneath rocks.

904
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:53,417
Oh, true.

905
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:56,412
And the timeline is just completely fucked.

906
00:59:56,837 --> 01:00:04,477
You'd say that about two days after the event is when you first realized that you would be writing about Sandy Hook.

907
01:00:04,507 --> 01:00:09,750
Correct? I didn't think I'd be writing about it yet.

908
01:00:10,937 --> 01:00:17,972
I was looking at different anomalies and stuff, so I hadn't really put my foot down that I'd be writing about it yet.

909
01:00:18,005 --> 01:00:26,377
So I think the first time I did was when I heard the Halbig interview, which was I don't think it was immediately after the shooting.

910
01:00:26,482 --> 01:00:29,002
No, it was in 2014.

911
01:00:29,107 --> 01:00:29,462
Yeah.

912
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:35,325
So there was an interview that Halbig did, and we'll talk about that a little more later with the American Free Press.

913
01:00:35,912 --> 01:00:39,937
And that was in February, I think it was February.

914
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:40,517
Maybe not.

915
01:00:40,565 --> 01:00:41,347
Maybe December.

916
01:00:41,467 --> 01:00:41,927
I don't know.

917
01:00:41,945 --> 01:00:42,862
It was in 2014.

918
01:00:42,937 --> 01:00:44,042
Two days, two years.

919
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:45,107
Same difference.

920
01:00:45,185 --> 01:00:45,512
Right.

921
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:50,227
And so Adon wrote an article about Wolfgang's interview.

922
01:00:50,332 --> 01:01:00,832
And that is true, but that amount of time is like, if you're pitching that as your timeline until 2014.

923
01:01:00,997 --> 01:01:02,717
I didn't know I was going to be writing about this.

924
01:01:02,765 --> 01:01:04,067
I don't think it's a big story.

925
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:17,437
That is outrageous, and you don't want this to be like the sort of the foundation that you're laying in terms of explaining what happened in a deposition setting, because you're going to directly contradict yourself repeatedly.

926
01:01:17,512 --> 01:01:25,125
You know that authority experiment where they've got somebody and the doctors like, press the button and no groom experiment? Yeah, that whole thing.

927
01:01:25,637 --> 01:01:32,002
This is one of the few situations where if you did that experience that experiment here, it'd be like, five minutes max.

928
01:01:32,107 --> 01:01:32,822
Press the button.

929
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:39,152
Every time he lies and beg, they're like, It's going to get larger, and he might die on this one.

930
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:42,577
And you're like, Listen, I think I know how electricity works, buddy.

931
01:01:42,682 --> 01:01:43,652
Press that button.

932
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:49,342
I mean, look, I don't know if that's one of those experiments that has been debunked.

933
01:01:49,402 --> 01:01:49,622
Yeah.

934
01:01:49,655 --> 01:01:50,822
Is that R1? Sure.

935
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,362
I know the prison experiment, wasn't that one debunked? More or less.

936
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,397
Problems with it.

937
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,917
But leaving all that aside sure.

938
01:01:58,115 --> 01:02:04,800
There is such a frustrating path that this goes down.

939
01:02:06,362 --> 01:02:09,987
Don is such a bad stonewall.

940
01:02:12,137 --> 01:02:13,172
We'll get to it.

941
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,497
It is so frustrating.

942
01:02:14,542 --> 01:02:19,697
All right, what you need to know for now is that after the shooting, adam thought it was real.

943
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:26,475
I'm just trying to understand in the immediate aftermath, what your perspective was.

944
01:02:29,387 --> 01:02:30,077
Go ahead.

945
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:30,947
No, please.

946
01:02:31,055 --> 01:02:41,542
I was just saying the immediate aftermath, my perspective was a school shooting happened, so I was on board with the shooting.

947
01:02:41,677 --> 01:02:59,147
I'm sorry, what? When you say on board in the immediate aftermath and let's try and time this out within two days of the shooting, it was your own view at that time that children and educators were killed at Sandy Hook, correct? Yes.

948
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:03,047
I would have phrased that differently, but yeah, it is what it is.

949
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,422
I was like, I'm on board with this shooting.

950
01:03:05,542 --> 01:03:06,377
Oh, man.

951
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:07,282
Strange.

952
01:03:07,447 --> 01:03:10,177
Metty almost even gave him a chance to rephrase.

953
01:03:10,207 --> 01:03:10,397
It.

954
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:12,392
He gave you another go at it, man.

955
01:03:12,515 --> 01:03:18,952
So Don, his perspective on this is like he was only going to report on Sandy Hook if there were anomalies.

956
01:03:19,057 --> 01:03:19,637
Sure.

957
01:03:19,775 --> 01:03:33,692
I take it from your testimony earlier that you anticipated that you would likely only write about it to the extent you thought that there were anomalies associated with the shooting worth writing about.

958
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:34,350
Right.

959
01:03:37,862 --> 01:03:42,482
Something that I found interesting and I thought the readership would find interesting.

960
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,247
Yes.

961
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:43,817
Okay.

962
01:03:43,865 --> 01:03:45,375
And that eventually happened.

963
01:03:45,812 --> 01:03:46,307
Correct.

964
01:03:46,385 --> 01:03:58,082
Where you felt that you wanted to report on anomalies around Sandy Hook because you found them interesting and you thought the audience would find them interesting, correct? Yes.

965
01:03:58,085 --> 01:03:58,697
Yes.

966
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:09,757
So we come to this idea of anomaly, and it's one of the words that Alex uses to sort of rationalize a lot of his coverage, but it is kind of a vague term.

967
01:04:09,922 --> 01:04:18,127
There isn't really a concrete definition of this, and so in order to move forward, we try to get a definition of what is an anomaly.

968
01:04:18,157 --> 01:04:18,917
That's a great idea.

969
01:04:18,965 --> 01:04:19,127
Yeah.

970
01:04:19,145 --> 01:04:19,717
It's helpful.

971
01:04:19,777 --> 01:04:20,177
Yeah.

972
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:21,472
We're talking about anomalies.

973
01:04:21,517 --> 01:04:22,697
I just want to go back.

974
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:30,900
Can you give me your definition of anomalies? Maybe something that doesn't really jive with the story.

975
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:43,010
So some fact that you believe exists that calls into question other facts surrounding the shooting.

976
01:04:43,055 --> 01:04:44,650
Correct? Objection.

977
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:59,575
Why are you checking something that calls into question everything else? It's just something peculiar or odd that you really don't know what it is, what it's purposes, like I said, until you have more pieces.

978
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,762
Okay.

979
01:05:01,275 --> 01:05:17,385
And in considering those anomalies when it came time to report on them, I take it that it was important to you for anything you published concerning Sandy Hook to be true and accurate, correct? Yes.

980
01:05:17,492 --> 01:05:19,000
To the best of my knowledge.

981
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,565
Right.

982
01:05:20,732 --> 01:05:29,787
And you'd agree with me that the shooting of 20 children and six educators is a horrible atrocity, correct? Yes, sir.

983
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:40,965
And so if you're going to be reporting facts about that situation, it's incredibly important to you that they be accurate, correct? Yes.

984
01:05:41,132 --> 01:05:48,435
And your audience relies on you to provide them with truthful and accurate information, correct? Yes, sir.

985
01:05:48,542 --> 01:06:02,337
And you understood at the time of the Sandy Hook shooting and your coverage of that shooting that the Infowars audience included millions of people across different platforms, correct? Yes.

986
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:12,105
And so you considered it a tremendous responsibility of yours to make sure that they were well and accurately informed, correct.

987
01:06:12,227 --> 01:06:16,470
Injection yes, I would say so.

988
01:06:16,622 --> 01:06:19,812
You take that responsibility seriously, don't you? Yes.

989
01:06:22,575 --> 01:06:32,280
It's important to you that the sources of information you had concerning Sandy Hook be credible, correct? Yes.

990
01:06:32,402 --> 01:06:37,085
So Don has repeatedly now said, yes, I take this very seriously.

991
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:47,625
It's very important to me that the facts and we're in for, and that's fun, but yeah, we have a sort of vague definition of anomaly, but at least it's something you can kind of work with.

992
01:06:47,687 --> 01:06:48,312
Right.

993
01:06:48,825 --> 01:07:00,162
I was surprised that the lawyer objected to Maddie really doing a really good job of rephrasing anomaly is something that doesn't jive doesn't jive with the story.

994
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:11,262
I appreciate his dictionary anomalies doesn't jive anteater groovy tongue like, I like the way this man thinks he's got it.

995
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,987
Don calls Maddie's, daddy out later.

996
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,495
He's hip.

997
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:20,235
He smokes a jazz cigarette in between.

998
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:30,285
So there's a phenomenon called motivated reasoning wherein you try and create an argument for something based on a conclusion that you already had.

999
01:07:30,317 --> 01:07:30,555
Right.

1000
01:07:30,602 --> 01:07:34,895
You go looking for information, you succumb to confirmation bias.

1001
01:07:34,985 --> 01:07:38,187
You find information that supports your conclusion that you are going to have already.

1002
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:54,550
Now, this conversation here with Adan and how he was approaching questioning the shooting has some of the hallmarks of that you might think, okay, immediate aftermath.

1003
01:07:55,125 --> 01:08:01,185
When I say immediate aftermath of the Sandy Jerk shooting, let's talk about a month.

1004
01:08:01,292 --> 01:08:01,740
Okay.

1005
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:08,810
So December 14, 2012 to January 14, 2013.

1006
01:08:08,855 --> 01:08:36,287
Are you with me? During that period, did you develop a concern that the shooting at Sandy Hook could be used as a pretext for gun confiscation legislation? I'm not sure if it was specifically gun confiscation, but yeah, it was going to be used to curtail gun rights, I believe, yes.

1007
01:08:37,325 --> 01:08:48,062
That was a concern you developed within the month after the shooting that the fact of the shooting could be used as a pretext for curtailing gun rights, correct? Yes.

1008
01:08:51,725 --> 01:08:58,025
Was there a concern, to your knowledge, that Alex Jones shared? I believe so, yeah.

1009
01:08:58,087 --> 01:09:06,375
Maybe if you go back and see some of the episodes following the incident, alex might have been mentioning that concern.

1010
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:12,062
I can't recall that it was a specific concern or not, but it might have been.

1011
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:28,187
Was that a principal reason that it was important to you to question whether or not the shooting in fact occurred? Yeah, that was one of several reasons, yeah.

1012
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:39,455
What were some of the others? Just trying to keep the media honest and trying to sift through actual news and not fake news.

1013
01:09:39,577 --> 01:09:42,000
That is a shocking admission.

1014
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:50,612
I can't understand how Adam wouldn't recognize what he just said.

1015
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:59,575
He said that principally one of the reasons it was important for him to question whether or not Sandy Hook happened was because he was worried they were going to use it to take guns.

1016
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:00,065
Right.

1017
01:10:00,157 --> 01:10:04,295
That has nothing to do with the reality or falsity of an event.

1018
01:10:04,372 --> 01:10:04,790
No.

1019
01:10:04,882 --> 01:10:08,855
That is a fucked up thought process.

1020
01:10:08,977 --> 01:10:09,395
Right.

1021
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:27,410
So here's what I thought, okay? I thought that people would exploit this tragedy to pass gun grabbing legislation, right? So I went out and I looked for the truth, and everybody who said that it wasn't, I called fake news, and everybody who said that it was, I called true news.

1022
01:10:27,517 --> 01:10:30,035
So obviously it's true, my man.

1023
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:30,812
Right.

1024
01:10:31,925 --> 01:10:41,360
Thinking about it this way, that you're worried about them exploiting the strategy in order to push a political goal that you are opposed to, right.

1025
01:10:41,542 --> 01:11:03,275
Instead of supporting the political point that you are in favor of and engaging in the argument about it, wherein people are like, hey, there's this school shooting, we should probably get better gun regulations in place and common sense reform, instead of responding to that with like, well, no, I don't believe that that is an appropriate thing to do and here are the reasons why.

1026
01:11:03,412 --> 01:11:17,625
Instead you're like, well, they wouldn't have any argument if the shooting didn't happen, so maybe I should try and prove that, or maybe I should try and get people to insist that because that's a shortcut, that I don't have to make my argument.

1027
01:11:17,975 --> 01:11:22,190
And that's basically the way you could interpret what Adan is saying.

1028
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:27,920
And obviously on some level, I'm fully aware that this is part of it.

1029
01:11:27,997 --> 01:11:29,200
Yeah, totally.

1030
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:32,105
Sort of ideological and information model.

1031
01:11:32,227 --> 01:11:41,645
But to hear it on not trying to mask that in some way is very shocking and it strikes me as somebody who doesn't realize what he's saying.

1032
01:11:41,722 --> 01:11:48,305
Yeah, I mean, how do you say it out loud? Because you'd hear it then you'd hear it spoken into the world.

1033
01:11:48,427 --> 01:11:49,520
Maybe he's got one of those.

1034
01:11:49,522 --> 01:11:53,687
I believe his lawyer didn't just like, stop water on the computer.

1035
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:55,787
Yeah, 100%.

1036
01:11:56,825 --> 01:11:58,550
That's a revelatory thing.

1037
01:11:58,612 --> 01:12:01,130
The lawyers should have a shot caller for these people.

1038
01:12:01,252 --> 01:12:03,830
That is an insane thing to say.

1039
01:12:04,027 --> 01:12:10,025
How can you say that out loud and not be like, oh, I get where we went wrong now.

1040
01:12:10,162 --> 01:12:11,000
Thanks, guys.

1041
01:12:11,062 --> 01:12:13,090
Listen, we had a great deposition.

1042
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:16,385
I'm going to 100% of the wrong whatever it is you say is true.

1043
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:17,420
I'm going to get out of here.

1044
01:12:17,497 --> 01:12:27,815
I'm supposed to give the presentation that we're just looking for the truth and ask some hard questions that no one else will and exposing cover ups and what have you.

1045
01:12:27,832 --> 01:12:39,395
No, you're just trying to take shortcuts and push your political agenda in a different way because you know that if you did it on the merits, no one would be interested.

1046
01:12:39,472 --> 01:12:43,985
Right? If I argued with you about the thing you want to argue about, I would lose because you're right.

1047
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:44,630
Wrong.

1048
01:12:44,752 --> 01:12:52,115
So instead, what if I pretended that you don't exist and neither does anybody else? Just me, and everything I think is true? Yeah.

1049
01:12:52,282 --> 01:12:53,462
So that's good.

1050
01:12:54,125 --> 01:13:00,525
Good way to live the day of the shooting or the round there within the 24 hours time frame.

1051
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:08,230
Dawn got an email, and this is an email where we get an appearance from an old friend of ours, likes to hide in the bushes.

1052
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:09,560
Oh, now you know the guy.

1053
01:13:09,592 --> 01:13:10,330
Oh, Batman.

1054
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:10,910
That's the guy.

1055
01:13:10,942 --> 01:13:11,360
Oh, boy.

1056
01:13:11,392 --> 01:13:12,445
John Rappaport.

1057
01:13:12,535 --> 01:13:13,390
Hang up that picture.

1058
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,050
Rappaport.

1059
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:20,455
He has sent an email to John Bound, who then has forwarded to a Don Sally.

1060
01:13:20,515 --> 01:13:23,585
Okay, exhibit number one, it should be coming up on your screen.

1061
01:13:23,617 --> 01:13:27,050
Do you see an email before you, Mr.

1062
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:37,562
Salazar? In the from line is Jonathanjohn@infowars.com to you? Yes.

1063
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:45,005
And do you see the date that this is Mr.

1064
01:13:45,127 --> 01:13:46,265
Whoever Jonathan is.

1065
01:13:46,282 --> 01:13:51,075
And your testimony is that you don't know who that is? That's probably John Bone.

1066
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:55,295
How do you spell his last name? Bowne.

1067
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:58,800
And who is that? He's a video producer.

1068
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:06,550
Is he still there? I think he works off site, but I think he's still employed by Free Speech.

1069
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,380
Okay, and you knew who Mr.

1070
01:14:09,427 --> 01:14:15,290
Raffleport was at the time, correct? I was barely becoming familiar with him.

1071
01:14:15,307 --> 01:14:17,045
Yeah, it's my first year there.

1072
01:14:17,197 --> 01:14:17,912
Okay.

1073
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,825
And Mr.

1074
01:14:20,887 --> 01:14:26,405
Bound is forwarding you an email and an attached document that he received from Mr.

1075
01:14:26,452 --> 01:14:32,687
Rappaport on the day of the shooting, correct? It appears so, yes.

1076
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:47,375
the document that was attached to the email is dated December 15, 2012.

1077
01:14:47,437 --> 01:14:53,250
And it says here, come to grief counselors over the hill, pouring into Newtown, Connecticut.

1078
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,285
Do you recall reading this piece by Mr.

1079
01:14:56,317 --> 01:14:58,487
Rappaport? No.

1080
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:06,137
No.

1081
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:09,830
Do you have an understanding of what Mr.

1082
01:15:09,877 --> 01:15:17,330
Rapaport's view was concerning the Sandy Hook shooting in the immediate aftermath? No, I don't know what Mr.

1083
01:15:17,377 --> 01:15:18,737
Rabbit's view was.

1084
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:22,910
Do you know when Mr.

1085
01:15:22,942 --> 01:15:39,635
Bounce forwarded you this email because he thought it was interesting and thought I might find it interesting maybe to republish? Do you know if this was republished by Infowars.com? I don't know.

1086
01:15:39,742 --> 01:15:41,020
It's a little weird.

1087
01:15:41,185 --> 01:15:42,430
It's a little weird.

1088
01:15:42,565 --> 01:15:45,760
I mean Rappaport's unhinged weirdo.

1089
01:15:45,805 --> 01:15:51,280
So the idea that he's writing blogs questioning Sandy Hook the day of or the next day regular.

1090
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,537
Yeah, that's part of the course.

1091
01:15:53,975 --> 01:16:00,895
But the idea that John Bound has found this and thought, hey, you know who will enjoy this? Don Salazar.

1092
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:02,775
That is a little weird.

1093
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:04,670
Definitely.

1094
01:16:04,822 --> 01:16:09,475
If someone were to email me that sure, I would take offense.

1095
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:12,050
Yeah, I don't think they would.

1096
01:16:12,112 --> 01:16:12,875
That'd be a problem.

1097
01:16:12,937 --> 01:16:15,395
There's something about adon that people know.

1098
01:16:15,547 --> 01:16:18,775
It's totally cool to send him weird shit about Sandy Hook.

1099
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:19,862
Yeah, man.

1100
01:16:20,225 --> 01:16:33,080
I just feel like if I were being deposed by anyone and they asked me a question and I gave my response, and then they were like, okay, do you see this on your screen? Point to exhibit one.

1101
01:16:33,127 --> 01:16:37,310
My first response would be like, fuck, something went wrong with my answer.

1102
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:39,590
How is that not your response? Right.

1103
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:45,110
Like, the moment they go, did you say this? Bring this up? You'd be like, well, obviously I didn't say that.

1104
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:47,075
Now I know that.

1105
01:16:47,137 --> 01:16:49,070
I didn't know that just a moment ago.

1106
01:16:49,147 --> 01:16:49,925
Oh, no.

1107
01:16:50,062 --> 01:16:50,495
Yes.

1108
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:53,500
Something not a dawn.

1109
01:16:53,575 --> 01:17:05,087
He sticks to his guns and is presenting the idea that he did not know in the immediate aftermath that they were going to cover it as if it were really trying.

1110
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:12,670
In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, that is the month following the shooting.

1111
01:17:12,685 --> 01:17:26,890
Is it fair to say that you understood that your coverage was going to frame Sandy Hook as a staged event? I didn't know that in the media aftermath.

1112
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:43,637
you were not aware at that time, or you did not have a view at that time, that Infowars coverage of the event would frame it as a staged event.

1113
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:44,600
Correct.

1114
01:17:44,662 --> 01:17:45,290
Yes.

1115
01:17:45,457 --> 01:17:54,200
So that is important in as much as we've now sort of laid the framework of what we're talking about, when you say the immediate aftermath, we're talking about that month.

1116
01:17:54,262 --> 01:17:54,887
Yeah.

1117
01:17:55,325 --> 01:17:56,925
And I think that's helpful.

1118
01:17:57,350 --> 01:18:00,950
I don't believe it on here, but I'm going to throw this out there.

1119
01:18:01,012 --> 01:18:01,637
Sure.

1120
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:03,005
Don.

1121
01:18:03,127 --> 01:18:10,745
Earlier in the deposition says, why did I join Infowars? AHA, 911 was an inside job.

1122
01:18:10,822 --> 01:18:11,105
Right.

1123
01:18:11,152 --> 01:18:20,035
So your very first moment of joining Infowars is based entirely it's entirely around something being a false flag.

1124
01:18:20,155 --> 01:18:20,525
True.

1125
01:18:20,587 --> 01:18:24,055
You knew exactly how they were going to fucking you know that they're the false flag.

1126
01:18:24,115 --> 01:18:25,250
They're the false flag people.

1127
01:18:25,312 --> 01:18:25,940
Yeah.

1128
01:18:26,107 --> 01:18:29,200
They're the one stop shop for flag.

1129
01:18:29,275 --> 01:18:30,005
Yeah.

1130
01:18:30,202 --> 01:18:33,410
And you've just done aurora yeah.

1131
01:18:33,517 --> 01:18:36,460
They have just done all of their coverage about how that was fake.

1132
01:18:36,505 --> 01:18:38,060
And you were listening, we know.

1133
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:38,390
No.

1134
01:18:38,407 --> 01:18:39,590
You were working there.

1135
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:40,475
Yeah, exactly.

1136
01:18:40,612 --> 01:18:41,615
That's right.

1137
01:18:41,782 --> 01:18:42,485
Oh, my God.

1138
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:43,070
Yeah.

1139
01:18:43,222 --> 01:18:47,305
So it's a little bit tough pill to swallow.

1140
01:18:47,365 --> 01:18:47,540
Yes.

1141
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:48,530
I'm not going to buy that one.

1142
01:18:48,577 --> 01:18:55,810
And especially because obviously he said that the interest that you would have in reporting on this is based on seeing anomalies.

1143
01:18:55,855 --> 01:18:56,315
Of course.

1144
01:18:56,407 --> 01:19:01,650
And he started to see anomalies pretty fast in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.

1145
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:08,195
Am I correct that you did become aware of what you considered to be certain anomalies? Fair to say.

1146
01:19:08,347 --> 01:19:09,362
Yes, sir.

1147
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:26,255
How is it that you became aware of those anomalies? What did you do to discover them? Jackson I'm not sure if I received tips on emails or found videos on YouTube, but it was maybe a combination of the two.

1148
01:19:26,452 --> 01:19:31,835
In order to find videos on YouTube, you would have to search for something that you were looking for.

1149
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:32,462
Correct.

1150
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:37,595
A link is provided somehow via social media or email.

1151
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:38,312
Yeah.

1152
01:19:38,675 --> 01:19:39,305
Okay.

1153
01:19:39,427 --> 01:19:49,910
Do you recall doing any affirmative work on your own to search YouTube or any other sites or anomalies? No, I didn't search the site.

1154
01:19:49,942 --> 01:19:53,015
I was probably provided with links to videos about it.

1155
01:19:53,182 --> 01:20:02,162
And you think those links may have come either through you viewing social media or through the writer's email? Correct.

1156
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:03,560
Right.

1157
01:20:03,592 --> 01:20:04,285
Or on reddit.

1158
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:04,937
Yeah.

1159
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:08,312
Various places you can find links to YouTube? Yes.

1160
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:13,790
Were you looking for those things? I wouldn't say I was looking for them now.

1161
01:20:13,882 --> 01:20:14,315
Okay.

1162
01:20:14,407 --> 01:20:16,280
Everything just fell into my lap, man.

1163
01:20:16,327 --> 01:20:20,165
All this information, these anomalies just kept popping up.

1164
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:21,620
I wasn't doing anything looking for them.

1165
01:20:21,622 --> 01:20:23,275
They just I don't know where tips.

1166
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,675
Yeah.

1167
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:24,485
Social media.

1168
01:20:24,592 --> 01:20:24,905
Yeah.

1169
01:20:24,952 --> 01:20:40,630
I think this is who am I to not follow the story? This is the only episode, I think, of our show where if you just put Liz in my chair based on his descriptions of her job, she would be making she would be screaming.

1170
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:47,585
I can't imagine anybody who works in media journalism hearing this and not being a fan, not being like, I will kill this world.

1171
01:20:47,767 --> 01:20:51,455
Nothing means anything anymore, right? I've ripped my hair out.

1172
01:20:51,502 --> 01:21:01,085
So many people who have worked so hard and just in the trenches grinding for one story, right? Months of research.

1173
01:21:01,192 --> 01:21:12,680
They've got people who actually go out there, fact checkers, who rip everything everything, or even people who do, like a lot of the behind the scenes totally facilitates good journalism and stuff.

1174
01:21:12,877 --> 01:21:15,530
I just kind of like, I don't know, maybe I just fall.

1175
01:21:15,652 --> 01:21:18,755
Somebody emailed me on Reddit, email me a link.

1176
01:21:18,802 --> 01:21:20,775
So I get paid six figures.

1177
01:21:22,175 --> 01:21:24,560
But there's also emails that come in that's true.

1178
01:21:24,592 --> 01:21:26,440
Like from Rappaport, naturally.

1179
01:21:26,545 --> 01:21:28,990
Or this other email from Rappaport.

1180
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:41,625
Do you see that this is an eight page document and page one is an email from Jonathan to you with an indication that there is an attachment entitled Adam lands a mask.

1181
01:21:43,475 --> 01:21:44,675
Yes, I see that.

1182
01:21:44,812 --> 01:21:49,355
And you see that the email from Jonathan is a forwarded email again from Mr.

1183
01:21:49,402 --> 01:21:50,400
Rappaport.

1184
01:21:52,475 --> 01:21:57,860
It looks like it was sent from John Wrappers to John Bound and then John Bound forwarded to me.

1185
01:21:57,967 --> 01:21:58,595
Correct.

1186
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,875
And the date that Mr.

1187
01:22:00,937 --> 01:22:02,540
Bound received it.

1188
01:22:02,632 --> 01:22:03,605
So the date that Mr.

1189
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:06,530
Raffler sent it to Mr.

1190
01:22:06,577 --> 01:22:08,855
Bound was December 16, 2012.

1191
01:22:08,902 --> 01:22:10,460
Correct? I see that, yes.

1192
01:22:10,567 --> 01:22:11,015
Okay.

1193
01:22:11,107 --> 01:22:14,325
That would have been two days after the shooting.

1194
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,100
I believe so, yes.

1195
01:22:16,237 --> 01:22:28,055
And if you scroll down in the document, again, similar to the last email we looked at, there's an attachment with a written piece that appears to be authored by Mr.

1196
01:22:28,102 --> 01:22:30,605
Rappaport, correct? Yes, sir.

1197
01:22:30,727 --> 01:22:34,200
And the title is two Movies, two Mass murders.

1198
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:36,962
Yes, I see that.

1199
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:42,000
With a subtitle that says The Dark Knight Rises in The Hunger Games.

1200
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,290
Okay, yeah, correct.

1201
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:47,065
It doesn't look like it's the subtitle.

1202
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,055
It looks like it's the lead sentence in this.

1203
01:22:49,177 --> 01:22:51,545
Okay, all right, fine.

1204
01:22:51,622 --> 01:22:54,040
So Rabaport has sent this to John Bound.

1205
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:57,790
And again, it seems like there's sort of a tunnel, sort of pipeline.

1206
01:22:57,895 --> 01:23:01,350
It does seem like there's a very developed clear pipeline.

1207
01:23:01,775 --> 01:23:02,135
Yeah.

1208
01:23:02,167 --> 01:23:11,180
I mean, the first one that John Bound sends me, and maybe if I'm not interested, I say, don't send me shit like, that weird, there's another one next day.

1209
01:23:11,227 --> 01:23:13,360
Kind of sounds like maybe this happens regularly.

1210
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:17,912
Yeah, but look, Don doesn't know if he actually even read this.

1211
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:19,112
Okay.

1212
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:22,487
Fair to say, right? Yes.

1213
01:23:23,825 --> 01:23:33,737
You eventually did develop an interest in the nexus between the movie the Dark Knight Rises and the Sandy Hook shooting, correct? Yes, there was an interest in it.

1214
01:23:34,325 --> 01:23:54,975
And it's possible that that interest may have been sparked by this particular piece, which I can scroll down, draws a connection between the Batman movie, the Aurora shooting, and Sandy Hook.

1215
01:23:56,975 --> 01:24:10,700
My question to you, is it's possible that this particular email, which you received, sparked your interest in the nexus between the movie The Dark Knight Rises and the Sandy Oak shooting, correct? It's possible.

1216
01:24:10,762 --> 01:24:11,585
I can't say for sure.

1217
01:24:11,617 --> 01:24:13,787
I don't know if I read this article at the time.

1218
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:19,540
But in any event, it appears that you received this email shortly after the shooting.

1219
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:21,200
Correct? Yes.

1220
01:24:21,337 --> 01:24:27,080
It's honestly too bad for Adam that he didn't read this article, because if he had, he could defend himself here.

1221
01:24:27,202 --> 01:24:34,705
The conspiracy that Adan spread about Sandy Hook and Batman had to do with the name Sandy Hook appearing on the map in the movie Dark Knight Rises.

1222
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:38,180
That was in an article Rappaport wrote on December 18.

1223
01:24:38,227 --> 01:24:44,450
But the one from the 16th, which is being discussed here since it was forwarded to a dawn, is actually about something else.

1224
01:24:44,587 --> 01:24:45,280
The Batman.

1225
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:52,060
Part of this has to do with the Aurora shooting happening at a screening of Batman, and the theories about James Holmes thinking he was the Joker.

1226
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:55,270
In this article, Sandy Hook relates to the Hunger Games.

1227
01:24:55,435 --> 01:24:59,360
I'm just going to read you here some of John Rappaport's brilliant work.

1228
01:24:59,467 --> 01:25:03,745
Please quote, we now have the boggling connection to The Hunger Games.

1229
01:25:03,835 --> 01:25:10,780
In that scifi novel and film, 24 children are picked to take part in a competitive national blood sacrifice killing ritual.

1230
01:25:10,915 --> 01:25:14,005
One child survives at the end, and 23 die.

1231
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:15,745
20 died in Newtown.

1232
01:25:15,835 --> 01:25:20,440
And the author of The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins, lives in Sandy Hook next to Newtown.

1233
01:25:20,545 --> 01:25:27,395
And this means this is just the kind of bizarre and insane opsecret societies are reputed to enjoy.

1234
01:25:27,547 --> 01:25:33,280
Ordinarily I would ignore this sort of thing and just call it a coincidence, but it's too improbable.

1235
01:25:33,415 --> 01:25:39,155
I can't prove the killings in Newtown were part of a kind of op, but I can't disregard it either.

1236
01:25:39,277 --> 01:25:41,920
The quote, coincidence is just too stunning.

1237
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:46,487
And if The Hunger Games connection is real here, tell you what, then all bets are off.

1238
01:25:47,525 --> 01:25:58,325
The coincidence that Rappaport finds too stunning is that Suzanne Collins lives nearby, and the number of children who were killed in The Hunger Games doesn't match the number dead at Sandy Hook, but it's kind of close.

1239
01:25:58,387 --> 01:25:59,420
Plus or minus five.

1240
01:25:59,497 --> 01:26:02,785
Plus or minus five, there's a margin of error.

1241
01:26:02,905 --> 01:26:03,410
Yeah.

1242
01:26:03,517 --> 01:26:12,065
This is the kind of dumb shit that Rappaport was writing two days after the shooting that John Bound thought it was worth sending to Adon, who I almost guarantee did read it.

1243
01:26:12,157 --> 01:26:20,390
He may think it's in his best interest to not know anything about the article in this deposition, but the idea that he wasn't interested in this, it just flies, right far more.

1244
01:26:20,482 --> 01:26:20,870
Yeah.

1245
01:26:20,947 --> 01:26:25,050
Everything I've been able to tell about him from his work, far more ridiculous.

1246
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:26,930
Fuck out of here.

1247
01:26:27,052 --> 01:26:31,315
I think I would have made it two sentences into that email before I would have thrown my computer out the window.

1248
01:26:31,345 --> 01:26:32,765
I've been like, Get this away from me.

1249
01:26:32,782 --> 01:26:34,460
I think the computer is scary now.

1250
01:26:34,492 --> 01:26:36,485
Or I would have told John Bound to stop sending me.

1251
01:26:36,517 --> 01:26:37,350
Bullshit.

1252
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:40,637
Look, if it says John Rapper on it, I'm not interested.

1253
01:26:42,425 --> 01:26:43,325
Yes, do better.

1254
01:26:43,387 --> 01:26:44,095
Bound.

1255
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:46,787
Where's Theodore at? Let's get him back in here.

1256
01:26:47,225 --> 01:26:53,035
So Adon, he apparently is not only a receiver of emails, he's a sender of emails.

1257
01:26:53,155 --> 01:26:59,255
He sent an email to Melissa Melton, who is a former employee of Infowars on December 19.

1258
01:26:59,302 --> 01:27:00,530
It's a little interesting.

1259
01:27:00,727 --> 01:27:09,812
Do you have this email before you, sir? Which is an email from you to Melissa Milton on December 19, 2012.

1260
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:12,470
I see that here.

1261
01:27:12,547 --> 01:27:15,900
Who is Melissa Milton? She was a previous employee.

1262
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:24,140
What was her role in force at the time? Video producer, I guess.

1263
01:27:24,157 --> 01:27:25,120
She wrote some articles.

1264
01:27:25,135 --> 01:27:26,775
So she was a partial editor.

1265
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:40,575
Can you read the subject line, please? It says, forward Connecticut police radio, purple band Maskman one dressed as none.

1266
01:27:41,675 --> 01:27:45,565
And can you read the text that you emailed to Ms.

1267
01:27:45,595 --> 01:27:47,030
Milton? Look at this.

1268
01:27:47,077 --> 01:27:48,160
Sent in from a reader.

1269
01:27:48,205 --> 01:27:53,987
Don't know if you caught the show that day, but a caller said none gained entry to the school.

1270
01:27:55,175 --> 01:27:57,640
And why did you share that information with Ms.

1271
01:27:57,670 --> 01:28:04,112
Melton? It looks like I was going off of the email before it.

1272
01:28:07,475 --> 01:28:08,435
Well, correct.

1273
01:28:08,542 --> 01:28:11,625
We just probably interested in the anomalies.

1274
01:28:14,225 --> 01:28:16,270
So you were sending this to Ms.

1275
01:28:16,285 --> 01:28:26,250
Melton because you were interested in the possibility that someone dressed as a nun had gained entry to the school on the day of the shooting.

1276
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:32,912
More of sharing a weird tale here.

1277
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,025
It's a weird tale.

1278
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:40,945
I mean, sure, I thought it was true, but then when you said it out loud back to me now, I think it was a weird tale.

1279
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:49,425
It's a weird tale like that publication where Lovecraft's stories were originally published, submitted to the secret society.

1280
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:57,590
Okay, so you sent a weird tale to Melissa Melton about a nun, someone dressed as a nun, gaining access to the school.

1281
01:28:57,682 --> 01:29:00,150
Obviously, this is because there was another shooter.

1282
01:29:00,875 --> 01:29:04,725
And that same day, something else happened at Infowars.

1283
01:29:05,075 --> 01:29:09,500
This exhibit, does it appear to you, Mr.

1284
01:29:09,562 --> 01:29:18,812
Salazar, to be a headline in the text of an article that was published on Infowars.com on December 19, 2012? Yes.

1285
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:35,237
This is the article, I believe you attributed to a particular staffer, aaron Dykes, correct? Yeah, I think it was he that wrote this stuff.

1286
01:29:36,575 --> 01:29:42,275
Were you aware of the article at the time? It was published only when it went up on the website.

1287
01:29:42,412 --> 01:29:49,520
I was aware of when the readers were pretty sure I did.

1288
01:29:49,672 --> 01:29:56,515
So here's something that Maddie might not know or just isn't bringing up that makes this all a bit suspicious.

1289
01:29:56,695 --> 01:30:04,600
These two clips that we just heard on the same day, December 19, don is emailing Melissa Melton about a Sandy Hook conspiracy theory.

1290
01:30:04,675 --> 01:30:08,110
And Aaron Dijks is posting this article to Faming Robbie Parker.

1291
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:12,845
The connective tissue that's missing is that Aaron Dijks and Melissa Melton were a couple.

1292
01:30:12,997 --> 01:30:17,035
They ended up leaving Infowars together, and they started their own outlet called Truth Stream.

1293
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:21,925
Media and now have spoken pretty poorly about Alex, but are still lunatic conspiracy theorists.

1294
01:30:22,075 --> 01:30:25,240
They're married now, and Melissa has taken on Aaron's surname.

1295
01:30:25,345 --> 01:30:40,810
It seems difficult for me to imagine that you have Aaron actively posting the Sandy Hook conspiracy shit and Adon emailing his girlfriend other Sandy Hook conspiracy shit, and that doesn't translate to a group of people intensely interested in Sandy Hook conspiracy shit.

1296
01:30:40,855 --> 01:30:41,462
Yeah.

1297
01:30:41,975 --> 01:30:47,015
That, to me, is something that doesn't pass the smell test.

1298
01:30:47,182 --> 01:30:48,760
I used to be pretty good at pool.

1299
01:30:48,805 --> 01:30:49,960
I used to be pretty good at pool.

1300
01:30:50,005 --> 01:30:58,805
And one time I was watching these two really, really good hustlers who accidentally wound up playing against each other like they fucked up.

1301
01:30:58,927 --> 01:31:01,235
And they were so good.

1302
01:31:01,267 --> 01:31:07,370
Like, after the first couple of games, they realized what was going on, and then they would just move so fast.

1303
01:31:07,447 --> 01:31:12,755
It would be like if there were four balls left on the table that they think you could run those out.

1304
01:31:12,802 --> 01:31:15,050
They just rip them off the table and they'd be like, next game.

1305
01:31:15,112 --> 01:31:15,605
Next game.

1306
01:31:15,652 --> 01:31:16,412
Like that.

1307
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:22,880
If we were in this kind of high level situation, I think Adan would have been like, all right, you got me on this one.

1308
01:31:22,927 --> 01:31:23,570
Next question.

1309
01:31:23,647 --> 01:31:24,110
Let's go.

1310
01:31:24,142 --> 01:31:24,695
Next one.

1311
01:31:24,772 --> 01:31:26,065
We'll swipe these off the table.

1312
01:31:26,095 --> 01:31:26,635
I'm going to pawn.

1313
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,275
You've won.

1314
01:31:27,337 --> 01:31:28,340
You've won this one.

1315
01:31:28,432 --> 01:31:29,945
I got to play the next game, though.

1316
01:31:30,022 --> 01:31:31,655
I'm down a lot of money.

1317
01:31:31,852 --> 01:31:39,895
Yes, I think that I would be very interested in that piece of information being brought as a rebuttal.

1318
01:31:39,985 --> 01:31:47,260
You know there are a couple, right, these people that you're communicating with on the same day about conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook.

1319
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:54,565
I guess Adon doesn't necessarily have, like, a concrete proof that he was talking to Aaron Dijks about his article about Robbie Parker.

1320
01:31:54,595 --> 01:31:57,380
But how many writers are there at the time? Not many.

1321
01:31:57,427 --> 01:31:58,805
They all work in the same office.

1322
01:31:58,927 --> 01:31:59,570
Right.

1323
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:05,755
I find it unbelievable that the two of them wouldn't have been at least in some kind of context.

1324
01:32:05,815 --> 01:32:08,995
I would go so far as to call that an anomaly.

1325
01:32:09,085 --> 01:32:10,520
It is anomalous sure.

1326
01:32:10,597 --> 01:32:16,975
Should that be the case? That's anomalous ironically, it sort of has the hint of a conspiracy.

1327
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:19,725
Listen, I'll tell you what, that's a fact that doesn't jive.

1328
01:32:20,075 --> 01:32:21,310
That's for the truth.

1329
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:29,725
So Don also sent Paul Joseph Watson an email looking for tips about a Sandy conspiracy article he was writing.

1330
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:35,175
Do you have an email before you, sir? From you to Paul Joseph Watson.

1331
01:32:36,725 --> 01:32:40,180
Can I see that? Balls off the table.

1332
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:40,730
Next question.

1333
01:32:40,777 --> 01:32:41,645
You got me.

1334
01:32:41,797 --> 01:32:56,485
Please, Paul, if you have the time, can you take a look at the article I have pending publishing on the back end of inflows? I did a little bit of research on the Sandy Hook Batman coincidence, and I've come to the conclusion that Sandy Hook was substituted for another name on the map.

1335
01:32:56,605 --> 01:33:03,310
So I think maybe you've got some tips or something you'd like to add or I think I should mention the article or a better headline.

1336
01:33:03,355 --> 01:33:03,962
Thanks.

1337
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:15,305
Do you have a article that you are referencing? I think it's the one about Sandy Hook maps and stuff.

1338
01:33:15,352 --> 01:33:16,105
I mean, Batman.

1339
01:33:16,165 --> 01:33:16,750
Maps.

1340
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:17,612
Yeah.

1341
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:36,875
This is an article that you wrote in which you reported that a map that appears in the movie The Dark Knight Rises had a location that had been changed from South Hinkley to Sandy Hook, correct? Yes.

1342
01:33:37,012 --> 01:33:37,712
Okay.

1343
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:42,260
Do you know if Paul Watson got back to you on this? I don't think he did.

1344
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:45,365
He wasn't as interested in this story as I was.

1345
01:33:45,532 --> 01:33:47,612
You were pretty interested in this.

1346
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:50,012
Yeah.

1347
01:33:51,425 --> 01:33:52,615
That's revealing.

1348
01:33:52,720 --> 01:34:04,070
I mean, we already knew that Paul wasn't down with this shit, but, like, for you to say he wasn't as interested in it as I was, the lie's, like, a real interest on your part, which doesn't look great.

1349
01:34:04,147 --> 01:34:04,787
Yeah.

1350
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:18,025
So this is about December 20, right? Now, here is where things got a little bit confusing for me because there was an article posted on the 17th on Infowars about the map in The Dark Knight Rises.

1351
01:34:18,175 --> 01:34:21,155
And then there's another article that's an update of it.

1352
01:34:21,202 --> 01:34:23,390
That's the one that Don is talking about, I believe.

1353
01:34:23,482 --> 01:34:23,825
Okay.

1354
01:34:23,887 --> 01:34:31,780
I'm not sure if he wrote the original one on the 17th because they both have Infowars.com as the writer.

1355
01:34:31,915 --> 01:34:33,070
There's no attribution.

1356
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:38,015
Right, but he said that he wrote the one, and obviously he's emailing Paul about it.

1357
01:34:38,107 --> 01:34:40,780
He wrote that one, presumably.

1358
01:34:40,915 --> 01:34:47,140
I would think he wrote the first one, too, but who knows? Yeah, I mean, that could have been just a fuck.

1359
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:48,365
They could have stolen that one, too.

1360
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:49,865
Who knows? Can't nail it down.

1361
01:34:49,957 --> 01:34:57,770
Who knows? What we do know is that when it did get published, the 20th one, someone else got a little update about that.

1362
01:34:57,922 --> 01:35:03,200
This is an email from you to the Drudge Report, correct? Oh, no.

1363
01:35:03,262 --> 01:35:03,755
Yes.

1364
01:35:03,877 --> 01:35:04,910
Drudge Report.

1365
01:35:05,092 --> 01:35:09,730
And the subject line that you wrote was bizarre.

1366
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:12,055
Sandy Hook Dark Knight Rises connection.

1367
01:35:12,115 --> 01:35:14,312
Correct? Yes.

1368
01:35:14,825 --> 01:35:28,910
And you wrote, Infowars has exposed that a section of Gotham City was renamed Sandy Hook in the latest Dark Knight release, and you include a link to the story, correct? Yes.

1369
01:35:29,017 --> 01:35:32,450
That was a story that you wrote? That's the one I wrote, I believe.

1370
01:35:32,512 --> 01:35:32,915
Yes.

1371
01:35:33,007 --> 01:35:33,665
Okay.

1372
01:35:33,832 --> 01:35:39,725
And that story was written and published six days after the Sandy Hook shooting, correct? Yes.

1373
01:35:39,862 --> 01:35:40,520
Okay.

1374
01:35:40,672 --> 01:35:48,125
And you then asked Drudge will help us spread the news of this very strange coincidence, correct? Yes.

1375
01:35:48,262 --> 01:35:56,585
So at this point, we have at very least, Infowars has a story about this Batman thing three days after the attack.

1376
01:35:56,767 --> 01:36:01,765
Then six days after the shooting, there's another one that Adon has written.

1377
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:07,450
Now he's trying to enlist the Drudge Report to disseminate it more widely.

1378
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:16,925
The argument that they weren't pushing a lot of this stuff and they weren't responsible for the spread of it, especially in the early days, it was very.

1379
01:36:16,987 --> 01:36:21,890
Out the window in terms of the size of the reach that Infowars has at this time.

1380
01:36:21,982 --> 01:36:29,405
Their active courting of Drudge, the largest link aggregator in the right wing, maybe all of yeah.

1381
01:36:29,452 --> 01:36:33,150
At the time, it was like the biggest was the Internet.

1382
01:36:33,575 --> 01:36:38,450
That, to me is like, really? Damning, that email is pretty it's a bad look.

1383
01:36:38,512 --> 01:36:39,137
Yeah.

1384
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,470
I could not be deposed this way.

1385
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:52,037
If you listen to the video of me being deposed, if this was me, it would just be like, don't read it on no, come on, man.

1386
01:36:52,475 --> 01:36:54,620
And I know I sent it.

1387
01:36:54,772 --> 01:36:56,315
It sucked up.

1388
01:36:56,332 --> 01:36:59,305
Because it's not like an interrogation where you can just confess.

1389
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,050
Exactly.

1390
01:37:00,187 --> 01:37:00,800
Keep going.

1391
01:37:00,862 --> 01:37:02,840
You can't just be like, I did it.

1392
01:37:02,932 --> 01:37:04,337
Let's just move on.

1393
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:08,585
Charge me whatever you want.

1394
01:37:08,767 --> 01:37:09,200
No.

1395
01:37:09,262 --> 01:37:10,325
We have more questions.

1396
01:37:10,462 --> 01:37:11,030
No.

1397
01:37:11,152 --> 01:37:22,040
Can't we be done? Can I just go to jail instead of talk to you anymore? So the reason that this is something that would be interesting to Adam Salazar now.

1398
01:37:22,057 --> 01:37:37,640
You might imagine that the obvious answer is because if somebody who worked on Batman that had already come out had changed the name of this place on the map to Sandy Hook as some kind of a message.

1399
01:37:37,732 --> 01:37:39,875
And then later Sandy Hook happens.

1400
01:37:40,012 --> 01:37:44,090
It would lead one to think maybe they did that as a message.

1401
01:37:44,257 --> 01:37:49,460
There's this whole idea of predictive programming that is really big in Alex's coverage of stuff.

1402
01:37:49,567 --> 01:37:55,435
So the argument here, the shorthand is very clear that it's trying to argue for foreknowledge.

1403
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:59,915
There's no other way to unless you're a dawn, you could argue that it's not.

1404
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:04,250
Is he going to argue that there was a psychic power? No, that's a coincidence, man.

1405
01:38:04,312 --> 01:38:05,837
Oh, well, then, yes.

1406
01:38:06,650 --> 01:38:07,055
Mr.

1407
01:38:07,102 --> 01:38:27,830
Salazar, the reason you were reporting on this is because the fact that a map location in The Dark Knight Rises had been changed to Sandy Hook, caused you to suspect whether there had been some sort of advanced knowledge by somebody that the Sandy Hook shooting was going to take place.

1408
01:38:27,877 --> 01:38:29,250
Correct injection.

1409
01:38:29,675 --> 01:38:31,580
I don't know if that was my belief at the time.

1410
01:38:31,627 --> 01:38:36,150
I just thought it was a very bizarre, strange coincidence that I thought needed to be highlighted.

1411
01:38:36,575 --> 01:38:55,720
Why did you continue to be what relevance was it to your coverage? I think it's relevant if the name of a map changes on a movie when it's supposed to be something else and then Sandy Hook changes to Sandy Hook, and then something happens at a place called Sandy Hook in the same year that the movie is released.

1412
01:38:55,810 --> 01:38:56,462
Right.

1413
01:38:56,975 --> 01:38:58,125
Coincidence.

1414
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:03,385
And so help me explain why that is relevant.

1415
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:12,380
It seems and correct me if I'm wrong, that what you are inviting your audience to consider is that it's not a coincidence at all.

1416
01:39:12,427 --> 01:39:14,237
Correct injection of form.

1417
01:39:14,825 --> 01:39:17,255
I wasn't inviting the audience to consider that.

1418
01:39:17,302 --> 01:39:39,845
I was asking if maybe they perhaps thought the coincidence was bizarre to I think I point out the fact that the prop manager of the movie lived in Sandy Hook, maybe in one of the articles, or in town, Connecticut, which is the same place the shooting took place.

1419
01:39:39,922 --> 01:39:41,710
I thought that was all bizarre coincidence.

1420
01:39:41,755 --> 01:39:42,095
Yes.

1421
01:39:42,172 --> 01:39:46,210
I was only trying to tell the readers that it was a stage false flag.

1422
01:39:46,255 --> 01:39:48,550
I was trying to point out a bizarre coincidence.

1423
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:53,755
Just so we're clear, here's the second paragraph of the article a don wrote and sent to Drudge.

1424
01:39:53,890 --> 01:40:07,940
Quote since that quote minor coincidence, we've scoured the Batman movies and poured over various Gotham City maps to find anything that could support the theory that the movies may have had hints of foreknowledge of the tragic massacre that occurred last week.

1425
01:40:08,032 --> 01:40:10,550
Because where there's smoke, there's usually fire.

1426
01:40:10,612 --> 01:40:11,180
Oh, my God.

1427
01:40:11,227 --> 01:40:13,730
What we found is interesting, to say the least.

1428
01:40:13,927 --> 01:40:17,860
It seems like this isn't quite how he's describing his writing in this deposition.

1429
01:40:18,055 --> 01:40:25,145
From the article, it sounds like they were studying these maps, searching for clues to prove that there was foreknowledge and that they found interesting stuff.

1430
01:40:25,222 --> 01:40:27,275
And where there's smoke, there's usually fire.

1431
01:40:27,412 --> 01:40:29,945
Seems pretty overt in its point, I would say.

1432
01:40:30,022 --> 01:40:30,395
Yeah.

1433
01:40:30,472 --> 01:40:33,670
And Ada doesn't point out that the prop master was from Sandy Hook.

1434
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:45,995
He does bring up that there's a Sandy Hook in New Jersey, but it's kind of a non sequitur between heavy insinuation of a conspiracy and then this quote for those who are left asking, why would someone do this? Okay.

1435
01:40:46,072 --> 01:40:47,245
Alfred pennyworth.

1436
01:40:47,335 --> 01:40:53,720
Like Bruce Wayne says of an evil force in the Dark Knight movie, some men aren't looking for anything logical like money.

1437
01:40:53,797 --> 01:40:56,480
They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with.

1438
01:40:56,527 --> 01:40:58,900
Some men just want to watch the world burn.

1439
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:09,075
The article ends with this quote if you're enjoying spotting these bizarre coincidences and traveling down the road of curiosity with us, stay tuned for tomorrow's scintillating revelation.

1440
01:41:09,950 --> 01:41:15,850
Is the smoking gun needed to tie The Dark Knight Rises, the Aurora massacre and the Sandy Hook tragedy.

1441
01:41:15,925 --> 01:41:20,480
We guarantee it will leave you wondering exactly WTF is going on.

1442
01:41:20,527 --> 01:41:21,200
Oh, my God.

1443
01:41:21,262 --> 01:41:33,725
That doesn't really seem like someone who's just saying, hey, isn't this weird? Anytime I'm in a deposition, I just want to make sure that I've never written the word guarantee at the moment.

1444
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:47,720
You say guarantee, you're fucking I think that it's an interesting approach that Adawn is taking because Maddie is asking, why is this relevant? Right? It's just something kind of interesting.

1445
01:41:47,797 --> 01:41:53,360
It's a weird coincidence, right? But it's only a meaningful coincidence if you're trying to argue X, Y, or Z.

1446
01:41:53,467 --> 01:41:54,137
No.

1447
01:41:54,575 --> 01:42:06,150
And this when I told you about this being an incredibly frustrating kind of thing, are we going to be here for a while? This seems to be a stumbling.

1448
01:42:07,175 --> 01:42:12,125
There are difficulties in getting Adam to admit at all that he was making a point.

1449
01:42:12,187 --> 01:42:12,812
Okay.

1450
01:42:14,075 --> 01:42:17,840
Adan, what do you do as a writer? I just throw words out.

1451
01:42:18,007 --> 01:42:20,200
I just say, Isn't this weird? Whoa.

1452
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:21,505
Walking noodle doo.

1453
01:42:21,565 --> 01:42:26,650
But then you read the article, and I say we have a scintillating revelation of a smoking gun tomorrow.

1454
01:42:26,725 --> 01:42:27,675
Guarantee.

1455
01:42:28,325 --> 01:42:30,115
So anyway, it's just coincidence.

1456
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:31,855
So it's really just the pointing out coincidence.

1457
01:42:31,915 --> 01:42:32,537
Okay.

1458
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:39,170
That really is like to the extent there would be any salience to the coincidence, it's that right.

1459
01:42:39,247 --> 01:42:58,655
To find Sale, that the fact that a map location in a movie had been changed to the name of a place where a shooting later occurred could potentially be evidence that somebody involved in that movie had awareness that a shooting would later occur there.

1460
01:42:58,702 --> 01:43:00,675
Correct? Objection.

1461
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:03,835
I don't know what it signified.

1462
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:09,080
I just thought it was a bizarre coincidence that people should maybe look into okay.

1463
01:43:09,277 --> 01:43:13,880
Highlighted it for the audience because I thought it was interesting, and I thought they'd find it interesting as well.

1464
01:43:14,002 --> 01:43:16,015
It's just a bizarre coincidence.

1465
01:43:16,045 --> 01:43:16,685
It doesn't mean anything.

1466
01:43:16,717 --> 01:43:18,215
I didn't have any suspicions about this.

1467
01:43:18,232 --> 01:43:19,490
I wasn't trying to make a point.

1468
01:43:19,582 --> 01:43:21,062
Don come on.

1469
01:43:21,425 --> 01:43:22,475
Come on, man.

1470
01:43:22,537 --> 01:43:26,915
Unfortunately, he also had a Facebook account, and this happened.

1471
01:43:27,082 --> 01:43:29,237
I'm going to show you exhibit eight A.

1472
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:46,715
You actually posted your article to Facebook and that's exhibit eight A before you, correct? I see that, yes.

1473
01:43:46,882 --> 01:43:59,550
And contrary to the testimony you just gave, which is you were just pointing out the coincidence, you included commentary there that called the coincidence very fishy, correct? Objection.

1474
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:02,390
It looks like it says that.

1475
01:44:02,407 --> 01:44:05,387
Can you zoom in a little more? Yeah, that's the problem.

1476
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:18,535
Yeah, I put very fishy, which you meant to so doubt about whether there was, in fact, foreknowledge on somebody's part of the shooting.

1477
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:19,187
Correct.

1478
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:22,135
I'm just pointing out that it's a bizarre coincidence.

1479
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:27,075
I'm not trying to sow doubt really out that it's fishy.

1480
01:44:27,725 --> 01:44:33,025
Yeah, it seems like I'm pointing out that it's a bizarre coincidence.

1481
01:44:33,175 --> 01:44:35,035
I don't know if I'm trying to sow doubt.

1482
01:44:35,155 --> 01:44:47,780
I think that Chris Matty's delivery of that it seems fishy is just right on point, because that is the kind of thing that you could just repeat to somebody and you're shaming them.

1483
01:44:47,827 --> 01:44:55,510
Yeah, I wasn't trying to sow doubt or make this look suspicious when you said fishy.

1484
01:44:55,555 --> 01:44:56,325
Fishy.

1485
01:44:59,075 --> 01:44:59,705
Yeah.

1486
01:44:59,827 --> 01:45:08,025
I think that's one of the moments where Donald probably didn't think, like, well, you know, I didn't post anything on Facebook.

1487
01:45:09,950 --> 01:45:15,785
It is such like, of course you're constantly surprised that they're bringing this up to you.

1488
01:45:15,892 --> 01:45:18,320
You didn't research the things you did.

1489
01:45:18,397 --> 01:45:18,815
Right.

1490
01:45:18,907 --> 01:45:21,115
And you're used to working with a bunch of ding dongs.

1491
01:45:21,145 --> 01:45:27,155
You don't do anything you don't understand, like, how process of actual exploration might work.

1492
01:45:27,202 --> 01:45:33,680
I mean, it really does feel like he's like, how did you get that? You know? Like, no, it's public, man.

1493
01:45:33,727 --> 01:45:35,795
You can find it anytime you want.

1494
01:45:35,872 --> 01:45:36,335
Right.

1495
01:45:36,442 --> 01:45:36,890
Crazy.

1496
01:45:36,982 --> 01:45:38,110
It was fishy.

1497
01:45:38,155 --> 01:45:42,485
Mean, it's more of an anomalous word, really.

1498
01:45:42,592 --> 01:45:45,525
Have you seen fish? There's a lot of anomalous fish.

1499
01:45:46,025 --> 01:45:48,595
I'll tell you what, that fish doesn't jive.

1500
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:53,875
So the next day after this adan is working on another Sandy Hook conspiracy theory.

1501
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:54,587
Yeah.

1502
01:45:55,700 --> 01:46:11,860
On December 21, and this will be exhibit number eleven, you latched onto a different anomaly.

1503
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:31,190
Do you recall becoming aware that an online movie review of a movie entitled Sandy Hook Lingerie Party Massacre had been published in the days prior to the shooting? Do you recall that? Yes.

1504
01:46:31,357 --> 01:46:35,612
And you referenced an exhibit eleven, but have not shown it? Correct.

1505
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:51,887
You recall as you're sitting here without looking at an exhibit, becoming aware of and interested in the fact that somebody had published an online review of this movie before the Sandy Hook shooting? Correct.

1506
01:46:53,150 --> 01:46:56,645
I don't know about the review, but I was aware of the movie or something.

1507
01:46:56,722 --> 01:46:59,625
Somehow it crossed my path.

1508
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:07,405
Probably some John Rapaport email, some dumb shit you saw on Reddit.

1509
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:09,835
That lawyer should have been like when he was like, Objection.

1510
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:11,230
You haven't showed exhibit eleven.

1511
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:12,755
And he's like, correct.

1512
01:47:12,952 --> 01:47:14,005
Oh, fuck.

1513
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:16,885
That means exhibit eleven is going to make my client look real dumb.

1514
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:18,075
Oh, no shit.

1515
01:47:19,325 --> 01:47:45,845
Did you think that this movie was fishy? Yeah, so, yeah, Don's working on this article about the Lingerie Party Massacre, and there's some emails, these have come up in other depositions where Don is emailing the guy who wrote the review, I believe, and discussing how like, hey, there's a bunch of people who are spreading a rumor that you are maybe at foreign knowledge of the attack.

1516
01:47:45,922 --> 01:47:46,205
Sure.

1517
01:47:46,252 --> 01:47:49,775
And we think that's dumb, but we're going to write it anyway.

1518
01:47:49,837 --> 01:47:51,350
Oh, no, that's a bad idea.

1519
01:47:51,412 --> 01:47:57,680
Yeah, so it's always fun when in a deposition setting, you get to make someone read their own email.

1520
01:47:57,727 --> 01:47:59,015
Oh, don't make me read it.

1521
01:47:59,032 --> 01:47:59,690
And here's how it goes.

1522
01:47:59,707 --> 01:48:00,740
Don't make me read it.

1523
01:48:00,757 --> 01:48:06,737
And I'm going to scroll down to the beginning of the email and I'll just go down so everybody can see this one page.

1524
01:48:07,175 --> 01:48:17,965
And am I correct, sir, that you sent an email on December 21, seven days after the shooting, to a Ms.

1525
01:48:17,995 --> 01:48:20,855
Gonzalez? Is that correct? Mr.

1526
01:48:20,902 --> 01:48:22,160
Gonzalez? Yeah, Mr.

1527
01:48:22,192 --> 01:48:22,615
Gonzalez.

1528
01:48:22,645 --> 01:48:23,780
I'm sorry, Mr.

1529
01:48:23,827 --> 01:48:24,750
Gonzalez.

1530
01:48:26,525 --> 01:48:43,840
And your email reads, actually, can you read it for me? There is a vicious rumor that the date you posted your review of the Sandy Hook Lingerie Party Master on your site, a slash above.com, shows four knowledge or prior planning of the events that have taken place as of late.

1531
01:48:43,945 --> 01:48:49,585
At first, and I include two links at first, we thought this was surely ridiculous.

1532
01:48:49,630 --> 01:48:56,100
However, we're going to point it out in an article and we'd like to give you the opportunity to provide a comment.

1533
01:48:57,650 --> 01:49:03,410
Sorry, you said we're going to point it out in an article anyway, right? Yes.

1534
01:49:03,517 --> 01:49:04,235
I'm sorry.

1535
01:49:04,342 --> 01:49:12,050
Wonder if that's an attentional omission on this part of reading it, because the anyway, there really is a word.

1536
01:49:12,112 --> 01:49:20,345
Yeah, it shows like you're sending this person an admission that you don't even believe the shit you're going to post.

1537
01:49:20,422 --> 01:49:21,350
You're going to do it anyway.

1538
01:49:21,412 --> 01:49:24,130
Yeah, the NA is a shiv to your gut.

1539
01:49:24,265 --> 01:49:25,955
That is what the NA is for.

1540
01:49:26,002 --> 01:49:30,080
But I don't understand what the goal would be of not reading the word.

1541
01:49:30,127 --> 01:49:32,510
I mean, it's there well, because you don't want to read it.

1542
01:49:32,542 --> 01:49:36,225
Because anyway really makes you sound like you just shived somebody in the gut.

1543
01:49:37,625 --> 01:49:39,040
It's a weird instinct.

1544
01:49:39,145 --> 01:49:42,080
Don't make me read my own again.

1545
01:49:42,127 --> 01:49:42,955
I can't be deposed.

1546
01:49:43,015 --> 01:49:44,245
The whiny voice.

1547
01:49:44,410 --> 01:49:45,950
Don't make me read it.

1548
01:49:46,012 --> 01:49:47,465
I would just say, no problem.

1549
01:49:47,632 --> 01:49:48,650
Yeah, you read it.

1550
01:49:48,712 --> 01:49:49,712
You do it.

1551
01:49:51,200 --> 01:50:00,170
The email that he's sending involves a notion of foreknowledge because that's literally what he says in the email.

1552
01:50:00,247 --> 01:50:00,625
Yup.

1553
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:16,615
So you might think that covering this story as Adon does, is an attempt for him to cast aspersions on the reality of the shooting and imply that the audience maybe should consider that there's four planning for knowledge.

1554
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:17,435
Yeah.

1555
01:50:17,617 --> 01:50:18,185
Nah, man.

1556
01:50:18,217 --> 01:50:19,280
He wasn't making a point.

1557
01:50:19,402 --> 01:50:20,285
He wasn't making a point.

1558
01:50:20,317 --> 01:50:20,555
Sorry.

1559
01:50:20,602 --> 01:50:24,005
What? But the rumor that you were informing Mr.

1560
01:50:24,052 --> 01:50:39,700
Gonzalez of was that the fact that he had posted the review sometime in advance of the Sandy Hook shooting could be evidence that he was aware the shooting would take place, correct? I believe that's what I was questioning.

1561
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:45,812
And you thought that it was surely ridiculous at first, right? Yes.

1562
01:50:47,675 --> 01:51:00,062
Why then, if it was ridiculous, were you going to include it in an article anyway? Because it was just another bizarre coincidence that I found interesting, that I thought our readership would find interesting.

1563
01:51:00,425 --> 01:51:17,230
And the reason that you thought they would find interesting is because you were trying to highlight evidence for them suggesting that this was an event of which certain people had four knowledge.

1564
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:18,825
Correct? Objection.

1565
01:51:20,375 --> 01:51:31,895
I wasn't particularly trying to highlight that there was an event that people had for knowledge of more so that I thought this was a weird anomaly that people should keep their eye on and maybe read about.

1566
01:51:32,047 --> 01:51:33,545
Keep their eye on.

1567
01:51:33,697 --> 01:51:34,780
This is infuriating.

1568
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:36,575
That is wow.

1569
01:51:36,712 --> 01:51:37,280
Yeah.

1570
01:51:37,402 --> 01:51:38,195
Fuck you.

1571
01:51:38,272 --> 01:51:43,610
This is kind of it reminds me a little bit of a child being like, I'm not hitting you.

1572
01:51:43,642 --> 01:51:45,680
I'm not hitting you right in your face.

1573
01:51:45,727 --> 01:51:46,500
Insane.

1574
01:51:48,425 --> 01:51:50,660
I mean, Jesus Christ.

1575
01:51:50,842 --> 01:51:57,825
At a certain point, just be like, if you're going to play dumb, you're playing the wrong amount of dumb.

1576
01:51:58,325 --> 01:52:01,915
This is dumb enough where I'm like, you're an asshole.

1577
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:04,670
You've got to go way too far if you're going to try.

1578
01:52:04,822 --> 01:52:06,715
You've got to be like, Holy shit.

1579
01:52:06,745 --> 01:52:09,190
That is the first time that I have thought of that connection.

1580
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:10,640
I can't believe I didn't consider that.

1581
01:52:10,657 --> 01:52:15,440
Are you kidding me? You know what? Honestly, now that you've brought that up, to me, that sounds like a crazy thing I did.

1582
01:52:15,457 --> 01:52:16,265
I'm so sorry.

1583
01:52:16,357 --> 01:52:22,280
Now you know what? It's weird that I completely unknowingly and accidentally speculated about that in the articles that you're asking.

1584
01:52:22,327 --> 01:52:23,000
It is crazy.

1585
01:52:23,062 --> 01:52:24,035
It is crazy.

1586
01:52:24,142 --> 01:52:24,940
That's wild.

1587
01:52:25,045 --> 01:52:31,340
Or just, like, I don't know have an entirely open mind and be like, oh, yeah, that is what I was saying.

1588
01:52:31,357 --> 01:52:31,685
You're right.

1589
01:52:31,717 --> 01:52:32,555
That doesn't make sense.

1590
01:52:32,602 --> 01:52:33,305
Yeah.

1591
01:52:33,502 --> 01:52:34,040
I don't know.

1592
01:52:34,057 --> 01:52:35,465
Maybe that's a bad road to go.

1593
01:52:35,557 --> 01:52:36,905
I mean, there's no way to go.

1594
01:52:36,952 --> 01:52:38,305
This one's just very dumb.

1595
01:52:38,365 --> 01:52:40,370
Good way to go, but this is bad.

1596
01:52:40,522 --> 01:52:53,090
So Maddie asks Adon about, like, these anomalies and stuff, and actually this moment, it was revelatory for me because it was something that I'd never really thought about.

1597
01:52:53,257 --> 01:53:03,005
You yourself weren't convinced at this point that the evidence you were collecting established that somebody other than Mr.

1598
01:53:03,052 --> 01:53:04,775
Landon had four knowledge of the event.

1599
01:53:04,837 --> 01:53:06,600
Correct? Objection.

1600
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:14,837
At the time, I was still kind of, I guess, trying to convince myself to put the pieces together.

1601
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:22,535
So what were any of your coincidences to law enforcement? Did you no, I'd never thought about it.

1602
01:53:22,567 --> 01:53:23,075
Wow.

1603
01:53:23,212 --> 01:53:25,880
That if they took this stuff seriously, wow.

1604
01:53:26,002 --> 01:53:42,825
Why wouldn't they tell somebody in law enforcement? Why wouldn't they try to? I mean, obviously, if we don't believe any of this right? But that would be something that you probably have some kind of at least moral obligation to do if you took any of this seriously.

1605
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:52,250
That's one of those things that when you're too close to stuff, you can't see it, but if you step back and you look at that, that's so simple, and it demolishes everything.

1606
01:53:52,312 --> 01:53:52,580
Yeah.

1607
01:53:52,627 --> 01:53:53,330
It's so simple.

1608
01:53:53,377 --> 01:54:00,905
It's so taken for granted by us because of how long we've been doing this, how much it's been repetitively borne out.

1609
01:54:01,027 --> 01:54:02,035
They don't take the series.

1610
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:02,465
Yeah.

1611
01:54:02,557 --> 01:54:06,580
We just know that isn't even, like, a consideration.

1612
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:07,160
Yeah, you're right.

1613
01:54:07,192 --> 01:54:07,805
It just does.

1614
01:54:07,852 --> 01:54:09,650
Like, what a great question.

1615
01:54:09,787 --> 01:54:10,175
Yeah.

1616
01:54:10,237 --> 01:54:14,605
If you really thought this, wouldn't you at least talk to somebody? Yeah, because it's very, very serious.

1617
01:54:14,665 --> 01:54:20,735
Well, the implications of this are earth shattering, so wouldn't you at least try? Right.

1618
01:54:20,767 --> 01:54:31,295
And you can be like, well, no, because the whole system is going to be like, well, that's not an excuse to not try, especially not if you're using somebody who is a former cop or whatever as your person.

1619
01:54:31,372 --> 01:54:34,985
Find somebody who's a former cop to ease it into them or whatever.

1620
01:54:35,092 --> 01:54:37,280
Dude's uncle is a former FBI agent.

1621
01:54:37,402 --> 01:54:39,587
Are you guys that stupid? Yeah.

1622
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:47,260
So this next clip I really enjoyed this clip.

1623
01:54:47,305 --> 01:54:47,555
Okay.

1624
01:54:47,602 --> 01:54:49,850
It's a little longer, but it has to be.

1625
01:54:49,987 --> 01:55:09,635
And you were at this time aware that of allegations that one or more of the parents of Sandy Hook children were crisis actors, correct? Yes, I heard the rumor at that point.

1626
01:55:09,667 --> 01:55:11,400
Yes, you heard the rumor.

1627
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:21,662
Did you believe it yourself at that point? I didn't really go into that so much as everybody else did.

1628
01:55:22,325 --> 01:55:30,080
Could have been a factor, but I wasn't really interested in trying to figure out whether they were crisis sectors or not.

1629
01:55:30,202 --> 01:55:34,412
You weren't interested in that? Not really.

1630
01:55:35,825 --> 01:55:43,580
It didn't really matter to the case we were trying to make or prove like, any of the bizarre anomalies that I was writing about.

1631
01:55:43,702 --> 01:55:44,435
Okay.

1632
01:55:44,617 --> 01:55:49,562
Can you let me know? And this will be exhibit number twelve.

1633
01:55:50,150 --> 01:56:02,735
Why on January 6, 2013, you attempted to establish an account@crisisactors.org? I'm not sure.

1634
01:56:02,767 --> 01:56:08,555
Why people listed on the site or something.

1635
01:56:08,602 --> 01:56:09,512
I don't know.

1636
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:10,820
Okay.

1637
01:56:10,972 --> 01:56:26,225
You agree that zip number twelve is an email from crisis actors that is a website to you asking for you to verify your address so you can sign into the crisis actors website, correct? Yes.

1638
01:56:26,362 --> 01:56:27,062
Okay.

1639
01:56:30,725 --> 01:56:34,205
About three weeks, correct? Yes.

1640
01:56:34,327 --> 01:56:37,262
But your testimony here today is that you don't know why you did that.

1641
01:56:38,375 --> 01:56:45,275
Well, looks like I was trying to investigate, see if maybe if they're listed as crisis actors on there.

1642
01:56:45,337 --> 01:56:50,665
I don't know what I was just trying to any avenue I can possibly investigate.

1643
01:56:50,695 --> 01:56:53,875
I wanted to do my due diligence.

1644
01:56:54,025 --> 01:56:54,887
I see.

1645
01:56:55,325 --> 01:56:56,135
Wow.

1646
01:56:56,317 --> 01:57:16,015
Your assumption is that you were trying to gain access to the site in the hope that you might be able to see if any of the crisis actors appearing on the website were the same as individuals who were family members of Sandy Hook victims.

1647
01:57:16,045 --> 01:57:17,475
Correction.

1648
01:57:18,650 --> 01:57:28,165
At the time, it looks like I was trying to figure out if any of the people involved in the Sandy Hook event were crisis actors.

1649
01:57:28,195 --> 01:57:29,537
That's what appears, yes.

1650
01:57:29,975 --> 01:57:34,205
Including family members, correct? I'm not sure.

1651
01:57:34,402 --> 01:57:35,390
Could have been anybody.

1652
01:57:35,482 --> 01:57:53,375
I might have been looking into some guy that was just interviewed and said, you know what? And what were the results of your query of the crisis actors website? Honestly, I cannot tell you because I do not remember.

1653
01:57:53,512 --> 01:57:54,212
Okay.

1654
01:57:54,575 --> 01:57:55,850
Really important information.

1655
01:57:55,912 --> 01:58:09,587
I got some expose level stuff, and Maddie makes another great point after that, and that is like well, I mean, if you'd gone on there and found somebody that was one of the Sandy Hook people, you probably would have reported that, right? Would have.

1656
01:58:10,175 --> 01:58:16,640
The fact that you didn't kind of shows that maybe you didn't and you didn't report to your audience that you didn't find it.

1657
01:58:16,657 --> 01:58:17,105
No.

1658
01:58:17,227 --> 01:58:19,425
Did you? Nope.

1659
01:58:20,075 --> 01:58:26,815
It appears that you said earlier today that you did not know why that assassin killed your wife.

1660
01:58:26,995 --> 01:58:33,815
Now, do you know why the day before you signed up for can an assassin kill my wife.org? I don't know.

1661
01:58:33,907 --> 01:58:35,435
I mean, look, it's a long time ago.

1662
01:58:35,467 --> 01:58:36,335
I don't know.

1663
01:58:36,517 --> 01:58:40,337
I think I was just looking to see how assassins are doing these days.

1664
01:58:42,275 --> 01:58:53,365
Are they making good money? What's their world like? Yeah, I've always wanted to interview an assessment, and as far as the day before it goes, I think that's just a bizarre coincidence.

1665
01:58:53,395 --> 01:58:53,710
Totally.

1666
01:58:53,755 --> 01:58:54,050
Yeah.

1667
01:58:54,112 --> 01:58:55,187
I got to go.

1668
01:58:57,425 --> 01:58:58,637
Oh, my God.

1669
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,880
That's so fucking terrible.

1670
01:59:00,940 --> 01:59:04,085
Yeah, but that's a pure comedy moment.

1671
01:59:04,267 --> 01:59:07,100
I wasn't really that interested in the crisis actors stuff.

1672
01:59:07,237 --> 01:59:12,850
Three weeks after the shooting, you tried to join crisisactors.org.

1673
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,050
Yeah, well, I guess I did do that.

1674
01:59:15,112 --> 01:59:19,820
There's just so many so many stepping on a rake moment.

1675
01:59:19,972 --> 01:59:21,670
It's bananas.

1676
01:59:21,835 --> 01:59:22,520
Wow.

1677
01:59:22,672 --> 01:59:30,800
So there's another conspiracy that was going around that has to do with the idea that there was a fundraiser for Sandy Hook that was published before this.

1678
01:59:30,862 --> 01:59:31,487
Right.

1679
01:59:32,375 --> 01:59:36,962
And so Don has to address this on January 13.

1680
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:52,537
Well, you agree that you are the recipient of this email? Yes.

1681
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:55,935
And descend.

1682
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:56,790
Or Sean knows.

1683
01:59:56,820 --> 01:59:59,170
You know who that is? I do not.

1684
01:59:59,322 --> 02:00:00,037
Okay.

1685
02:00:04,375 --> 02:00:25,030
The sender Sean Noel in his email is encouraging you to go to a link where, according to the link, a Sandy Hook Relief Fund page appeared three days before the shooting, correct? Yeah.

1686
02:00:25,077 --> 02:00:26,125
That's what Mr.

1687
02:00:26,187 --> 02:00:28,612
Knowl seems to be pointing out in this email.

1688
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:33,205
Did you do anything to investigate that? I might have clicked the link.

1689
02:00:33,252 --> 02:00:34,590
I can't recall.

1690
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:35,512
Okay.

1691
02:00:37,450 --> 02:00:40,620
And showing you exhibit number 13.

1692
02:00:47,275 --> 02:01:04,300
fair to say that this is an image of your Facebook account in which you shared the post concerning this issue of a Sandy Hook fundraising page being created three days before the shooting? Yes, sir.

1693
02:01:04,437 --> 02:01:09,337
And you did that on January 11, 2013, right? Yes.

1694
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:10,645
Oh, boy.

1695
02:01:10,722 --> 02:01:18,210
Again, you didn't do anything to investigate whether in fact a relief fund had been created three days before the shooting.

1696
02:01:18,255 --> 02:01:22,960
You just posted the link, right? Posted a link to Natural News on my Facebook? Yes.

1697
02:01:23,067 --> 02:01:23,737
Okay.

1698
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:32,835
And you did that because, as you say, this was another coincidence.

1699
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:33,175
Right.

1700
02:01:33,237 --> 02:01:36,985
Is that how you felt? The Google thing I wasn't too sure about.

1701
02:01:37,017 --> 02:01:43,225
Since I knew a little bit about how Google worked, I wasn't so ready to follow that.

1702
02:01:43,287 --> 02:01:46,140
How much do you know about how Google works? Anomaly.

1703
02:01:46,245 --> 02:01:54,415
You were prepared to post about it, but you were going to write an article about it, right? I was prepared to post it on Facebook for other people that might find it interesting, yes.

1704
02:01:54,507 --> 02:01:59,385
So that's interesting because he's willing to spread this bullshit that he knows his bullshit.

1705
02:01:59,505 --> 02:01:59,785
Yeah.

1706
02:01:59,817 --> 02:02:05,815
He knows that this is nonsense, but he's still more than willing to put it out as if it is.

1707
02:02:05,907 --> 02:02:18,565
Now, the interesting thing is that was a fun trap because you've got this email where this guy is sending him an email on January 13, and he said, did you research this at all? Maybe I clicked the link, I don't know.

1708
02:02:18,657 --> 02:02:20,790
He posted about it on Facebook two days prior.

1709
02:02:20,895 --> 02:02:25,150
OOH, that's fucking OOH, that's not good.

1710
02:02:25,212 --> 02:02:25,837
No.

1711
02:02:26,575 --> 02:02:27,505
Oh, that's bad.

1712
02:02:27,552 --> 02:02:32,235
There's a decent chance that this guy's emailing him about the article that Adon had posted on his Facebook.

1713
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:35,290
The same article might have been what spurred this email.

1714
02:02:35,382 --> 02:02:36,120
Jesus.

1715
02:02:36,285 --> 02:02:38,845
And he'd already admitted that he didn't look into it.

1716
02:02:38,847 --> 02:02:40,462
He didn't research it.

1717
02:02:41,875 --> 02:02:49,990
One of the little pet peeves that I have, especially in situations like this, is whenever it's like you can't say it seems like that's what he's doing.

1718
02:02:50,082 --> 02:02:55,275
I'm giving you a thing that happened in the past that cannot be changed anymore.

1719
02:02:55,350 --> 02:02:56,170
It is done.

1720
02:02:56,247 --> 02:02:58,930
So this does not seem like he says this.

1721
02:02:58,977 --> 02:03:01,255
He said this, correct? Seems like it.

1722
02:03:01,377 --> 02:03:02,062
No.

1723
02:03:03,775 --> 02:03:12,855
So when they were talking about the Batman article that Don had written, he said that he thought, he mentioned that the prop master was from Newtown.

1724
02:03:12,915 --> 02:03:13,405
Right.

1725
02:03:13,527 --> 02:03:15,100
And that was not true.

1726
02:03:15,237 --> 02:03:19,250
He had mentioned that new Jersey, there's an island.

1727
02:03:19,675 --> 02:03:20,730
Sandy Hook.

1728
02:03:20,865 --> 02:03:29,305
The reason Adam thought that he brought up the prop master is because this became another big conspiracy for him.

1729
02:03:29,502 --> 02:03:39,915
So basically the argument or the theory that goes around is that this guy, Scott Getsinger is the name of the prop master.

1730
02:03:40,095 --> 02:03:48,135
He died in a car wreck prior to the release of the movie and prior to Sandy Hook.

1731
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:48,520
Right.

1732
02:03:48,597 --> 02:03:56,185
So the theory that people had was that he was responsible for changing the name to Sandy Hook and that's why they killed it.

1733
02:03:56,217 --> 02:03:56,725
Exactly.

1734
02:03:56,862 --> 02:03:58,462
Because he knew too much.

1735
02:03:59,125 --> 02:04:02,355
Which sort of raises the question of why it was still in the movie.

1736
02:04:02,415 --> 02:04:07,905
Yeah, I mean, if they knew that he did it, but they also killed him for it and then they left it in anyways.

1737
02:04:07,965 --> 02:04:08,185
Right.

1738
02:04:08,217 --> 02:04:09,060
That seems silly.

1739
02:04:09,105 --> 02:04:12,780
And it appears that Adan was pretty into this conspiracy.

1740
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:13,510
Right.

1741
02:04:13,692 --> 02:04:21,075
And so this is discussed a little bit here and I don't know, don't.

1742
02:04:21,150 --> 02:04:24,037
Boring as a dodger, let's say.

1743
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:34,795
Am I correcting for sales or another email that you sent this one to Elliot Brown? Yes, sir.

1744
02:04:34,872 --> 02:04:38,825
And you see that it's dated there, january 28, 2013.

1745
02:04:40,375 --> 02:04:41,137
Yes.

1746
02:04:41,725 --> 02:04:52,720
And in this email you are asking him if he's free for an honest journalist question, correct? Yes.

1747
02:04:52,797 --> 02:04:55,387
And you're referring to yourself there, correct? Yes.

1748
02:04:56,125 --> 02:04:57,505
Even he laughed at that.

1749
02:04:57,552 --> 02:04:57,985
Exactly.

1750
02:04:58,092 --> 02:04:59,410
Even he laughed at that.

1751
02:04:59,442 --> 02:04:59,860
Exactly.

1752
02:04:59,967 --> 02:05:00,862
Fuck you.

1753
02:05:04,375 --> 02:05:30,562
And in the body of the email you ask him about the change in the title of the map in Dark Knight Rises, and you ask him about this gentleman, Scott Getsinger, who was the prop master, according to you, who passed away in a car accident, correct? Yes.

1754
02:05:31,675 --> 02:05:48,862
And so does this situate you in time, that the time when you were inquiring about the death of Scott Getsinger was in January of? Yes, it looks like.

1755
02:05:50,800 --> 02:06:05,530
And the coincidence that you were referring to, and we'll go back to exhibit number 14, this is the email to help Ranger Direct was that Mr.

1756
02:06:05,577 --> 02:06:18,562
Getsinger was associated with the movie The Dark Knight Rises and he was killed in a car crash and lived in Newtown, Connecticut, correct? Yes.

1757
02:06:19,150 --> 02:06:24,840
And you say what struck me as extremely odd is that this dude hailed from, you guessed it, Newtown, Connecticut.

1758
02:06:24,870 --> 02:06:26,560
Right, right.

1759
02:06:26,742 --> 02:06:31,462
And then you say at the end, definitely something fishy about it all.

1760
02:06:33,775 --> 02:06:48,262
What was fishy about the fact that somebody associated the props department with The Dark Knight Rises was from Newtown and it died in a car accident? Rejection to form.

1761
02:06:54,325 --> 02:06:57,275
I thought it was very odd.

1762
02:06:58,225 --> 02:07:04,740
Same year that this movie is put out and Sandy Hook is changed on a map, something happens at a place called Sandy Hook.

1763
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:08,425
And what you were suggesting, were you not, was that Mr.

1764
02:07:08,487 --> 02:07:20,655
Gessinger's death was somehow due to the fact that he had knowledge about why the map had been changed? Objection.

1765
02:07:20,715 --> 02:07:29,355
Honestly, I did not have a theory as to why if he was murdered or killed or why he died in the car accident.

1766
02:07:29,415 --> 02:07:31,480
So I didn't really have an answer.

1767
02:07:31,602 --> 02:07:35,320
But it did seem like a strange anomaly worth pointing out.

1768
02:07:35,472 --> 02:07:51,337
So there is this infuriating thing where it's just the way that Don is presenting what Infowars does is like, I guess we're just a journalistic or media outlet where we post weird coincidences that mean nothing.

1769
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:58,575
I find to be an offensive, just sort of characterization.

1770
02:07:58,725 --> 02:08:01,325
It's silly, it's fishy.

1771
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:08,520
You are theoretically a writer, and you're trying to insist to me that words don't have meaning.

1772
02:08:08,610 --> 02:08:09,445
This is a problem.

1773
02:08:09,522 --> 02:08:10,735
More or less, yeah.

1774
02:08:10,842 --> 02:08:19,435
And so Maddie makes this point, and I think that this is important, and that is that coincidences don't mean anything unless there's a point to them.

1775
02:08:19,467 --> 02:08:22,312
No, you'd agree with me.

1776
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:39,500
If something is a mere coincidence, meaning just happenstance, then there's nothing to note about it, correct? There's no relevance to noting it, right? Objection.

1777
02:08:40,375 --> 02:08:44,300
Well, there are big coincidences and little coincidences.

1778
02:08:44,650 --> 02:08:47,940
I think some of the big coincidences deserve to be noted.

1779
02:08:48,045 --> 02:08:49,687
Small ones, probably not.

1780
02:08:50,125 --> 02:09:01,250
And the reason they deserve what noted or investigated is because they signify that it may not be a coincidence at all, correct? Objection.

1781
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:06,120
I'm not sure what the coincidence would point to, honestly.

1782
02:09:06,285 --> 02:09:16,850
It's just one thing that people have to look into on their own, what is relevant if it points to something, right? Objection.

1783
02:09:17,425 --> 02:09:18,375
Not necessarily.

1784
02:09:18,450 --> 02:09:23,395
I think coincidences can be highlighted without them having a point to them.

1785
02:09:23,547 --> 02:09:37,200
So your testimony is that when you're highlighting what you refer to as these coincidences, you are not intending to suggest anything about what they signify.

1786
02:09:37,275 --> 02:09:44,005
That's your testimony? I'm trying to tell the reader that this is going on.

1787
02:09:44,052 --> 02:09:45,200
It's kind of weird.

1788
02:09:45,850 --> 02:09:51,895
What do you think about it? I think at the bottom of one of my articles, I'm like, what do you think? Sound off in the comments below.

1789
02:09:52,047 --> 02:09:54,660
So just kind of bringing this to people's attention.

1790
02:09:54,855 --> 02:10:01,312
It's just what value is there, too? Coincidence? That's the question you have to ask yourself.

1791
02:10:02,275 --> 02:10:04,030
I think at that point, I'd be like, mr.

1792
02:10:04,077 --> 02:10:09,610
Salazar, I am now going to bounce a tennis ball off your forehead every time you say something about your job.

1793
02:10:09,642 --> 02:10:11,325
That's pants shittingly insane.

1794
02:10:11,475 --> 02:10:14,020
What are you talking about? Just coincidences, man.

1795
02:10:14,097 --> 02:10:32,610
What are you talking about? I mean, you know that time that Infowars ran a huge expose about how Carmen Electra's birth name was Terra Patrick, and she couldn't use that name because it was already a porn star's name associated with Carmen? Isn't that an interesting coincidence? That's a big coincidence.

1796
02:10:32,655 --> 02:10:34,270
So we investigate that one.

1797
02:10:34,347 --> 02:10:37,095
Not one of those little coincidences, right? I mean, it's.

1798
02:10:37,110 --> 02:10:44,355
Like, do you really think, like, maybe you would run an article about how some people have the same middle name? I mean, that's a coincidence.

1799
02:10:44,490 --> 02:10:50,410
What do you understand the word coincidence to mean? Yeah, no, there can't be.

1800
02:10:50,442 --> 02:10:58,485
I mean, I understand what you mean by big coincidences, little coincidences, but that is not a description of their meaningfulness.

1801
02:10:58,680 --> 02:10:59,910
That's insane.

1802
02:11:00,030 --> 02:11:03,465
Yeah, I'm not sure you do know what he means by big or little coincidence.

1803
02:11:03,495 --> 02:11:06,160
Actually, I'm not sure I do, now that you say it like that.

1804
02:11:06,192 --> 02:11:08,800
I know what I would mean by saying that.

1805
02:11:08,937 --> 02:11:10,360
What he means, I do not know.

1806
02:11:10,392 --> 02:11:20,737
And I certainly feel for Chris Matty quite a bit, because there is just a real attempt to be like, come on, you're making a point.

1807
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:23,185
There's a point that you're trying to make.

1808
02:11:23,217 --> 02:11:24,165
Words have to have meaning.

1809
02:11:24,195 --> 02:11:25,690
An adon will not go for it.

1810
02:11:25,707 --> 02:11:26,100
God damn.

1811
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:27,055
It isn't true, mr.

1812
02:11:27,102 --> 02:11:43,290
Salzar, that the reason you're highlighting what you claim are coincidences is because you want your audience to suspect that something like Sandy Hook, in fact, did not occur as has been reported.

1813
02:11:43,395 --> 02:11:46,175
Isn't that your purpose? Objection.

1814
02:11:48,175 --> 02:11:53,887
My purpose is to point out the coincidences and let the reader make up their own mind.

1815
02:11:55,075 --> 02:12:04,135
You have no interest in suggesting to the reader what the relevance of the coincidence might be.

1816
02:12:04,317 --> 02:12:05,900
That's your testimony.

1817
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:12,685
I think I present the evidence, I gather it for them and allow the reader to make up their own mind.

1818
02:12:12,717 --> 02:12:13,270
Yes.

1819
02:12:13,422 --> 02:12:20,700
So we have one sort of coda here of the Sandy Hook prop portion.

1820
02:12:20,775 --> 02:12:23,200
And so just we'll ride this out here.

1821
02:12:23,337 --> 02:12:27,015
And then this is exhibit number 16.

1822
02:12:27,195 --> 02:12:31,825
This is your Facebook page, correct, Mr.

1823
02:12:31,887 --> 02:12:48,820
Salazar, in which you are posting on February 6, 2013, less than two months from the shooting, something from Intel Hub concerning Sandy Hook, and you post Google Scott Getsinger, correct.

1824
02:12:48,972 --> 02:12:50,137
Oh, my God.

1825
02:12:50,500 --> 02:13:01,300
And that's because you wanted people to discover the same nexus that you believed you had discovered between Mr.

1826
02:13:01,362 --> 02:13:11,975
Gessinger's death, the map in the dark night rises, and the Sandy Hook shooting, correct? Yes, I was pointing people to the anomaly.

1827
02:13:14,350 --> 02:13:20,375
The anomaly which you testified had absolutely no significance to you, correct? Objection.

1828
02:13:22,375 --> 02:13:24,510
I don't think I said it had no significance.

1829
02:13:24,555 --> 02:13:28,060
I think I said it was a bizarre coincidence that people should be aware of.

1830
02:13:28,242 --> 02:13:37,830
But that did not signify anything to you, correct? Well, it didn't signify that it was a staged mass shooting, but it did signify something very bizarre.

1831
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:39,090
Bizarre coincidence.

1832
02:13:39,195 --> 02:13:45,337
What did it signify? It was just a bizarre coincidence that needed to be found.

1833
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:51,385
For what purpose? We're not going to let this go, man.

1834
02:13:51,417 --> 02:13:54,187
Look into it so they can investigate it on their own.

1835
02:13:54,775 --> 02:14:01,600
So they could investigate it on their own and potentially discover that, in fact, it wasn't a coincidence at all, but that Mr.

1836
02:14:01,662 --> 02:14:11,640
Getsinger had been killed so as to silence him because he was aware that the change in the Sandy Hook map signified some advanced knowledge of the shooting.

1837
02:14:11,670 --> 02:14:13,400
Correct? Objection.

1838
02:14:14,950 --> 02:14:17,535
I'm not sure what they would discover, honestly.

1839
02:14:17,580 --> 02:14:21,262
It was very strange though, putting it out there.

1840
02:14:23,575 --> 02:14:27,585
I wanted them to google Scott Gensinger and see all the anomalies.

1841
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:28,105
Yes.

1842
02:14:28,227 --> 02:14:28,870
Okay.

1843
02:14:29,022 --> 02:14:30,070
Just see what happens.

1844
02:14:30,147 --> 02:14:32,662
Just Google it and see what you find.

1845
02:14:33,175 --> 02:14:40,030
Maybe you'll find some of his other work from his storied career in other movies like The Truman Show.

1846
02:14:40,152 --> 02:14:45,675
Maybe that's a good reason to Google him, to see the work that he's done over the course of his career.

1847
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:48,550
What's? His IMT page? Yeah.

1848
02:14:48,612 --> 02:14:49,150
Oh, boy.

1849
02:14:49,212 --> 02:14:50,400
I mean, it's infuriating.

1850
02:14:50,475 --> 02:14:51,112
Yeah.

1851
02:14:53,275 --> 02:15:04,135
I don't know Chris Matty personally as I know some of the Texas attorneys, but I get the sense that maybe he enjoys that back and forth a little bit.

1852
02:15:04,167 --> 02:15:05,770
It does seem a little bit like that.

1853
02:15:05,847 --> 02:15:06,310
Yeah.

1854
02:15:06,417 --> 02:15:21,805
There is a like AHA, how about this one? How about we try these words? Right? So there is a meaning to this for you, right? Coincidence that people should look into look into and find what? What? Come on, man.

1855
02:15:22,002 --> 02:15:22,795
All right.

1856
02:15:22,947 --> 02:15:23,350
Okay.

1857
02:15:23,412 --> 02:15:25,045
Frontal assault isn't going to work for you.

1858
02:15:25,047 --> 02:15:25,960
I'm going to go around the back.

1859
02:15:25,992 --> 02:15:27,400
Let's see about this one now.

1860
02:15:27,462 --> 02:15:27,865
Okay.

1861
02:15:27,957 --> 02:15:28,345
Alright.

1862
02:15:28,422 --> 02:15:30,790
So a lot of this stuff is fairly annoying, certainly.

1863
02:15:30,882 --> 02:15:31,360
Yes.

1864
02:15:31,467 --> 02:15:33,910
But there is some, like, positivity that comes in.

1865
02:15:33,942 --> 02:15:36,430
Unfortunately, it's positivity in the worst possible way.

1866
02:15:36,477 --> 02:15:37,180
Sure.

1867
02:15:37,377 --> 02:15:45,125
You received an email, did you not, in March, march 7, 2013 from Daniel Dupont.

1868
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:47,512
Okay.

1869
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:49,105
And Mr.

1870
02:15:49,152 --> 02:15:56,550
Dupont wrote to you, please stay on top of the story, no names of deceased to be released, et cetera.

1871
02:15:56,625 --> 02:15:59,235
The attack appears to be completely staged.

1872
02:15:59,355 --> 02:16:01,912
The public knows that they are being lied to.

1873
02:16:03,850 --> 02:16:05,980
And you wrote back to him.

1874
02:16:06,177 --> 02:16:07,925
Thank you for the encouragement.

1875
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,312
Come on, man.

1876
02:16:12,550 --> 02:16:19,690
YouTube video that Infowars had published in January, correct? Yeah, looks that way.

1877
02:16:19,782 --> 02:16:24,790
Boy, I would regret responding to a random email like that at this point.

1878
02:16:24,882 --> 02:16:27,025
That would be like, I didn't have to write back to that.

1879
02:16:27,087 --> 02:16:29,305
He didn't give us a true moment, though.

1880
02:16:29,352 --> 02:16:32,965
A true moment of comedy, where he was like, yeah, I don't think I read that one.

1881
02:16:33,057 --> 02:16:35,980
He's like, let's see the reply that you sent to them.

1882
02:16:36,177 --> 02:16:36,937
Yeah.

1883
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:39,112
Wow.

1884
02:16:40,150 --> 02:16:49,645
So now we finally get to conversation about Wolfgang Halbig and his role in all of this and how would dawn first learned about him.

1885
02:16:49,797 --> 02:16:56,962
One of the articles you wrote introduced the Infowars audience to Wolfgang Halbig, correct? Yes.

1886
02:16:58,675 --> 02:17:00,580
How did you first learn of Mr.

1887
02:17:00,627 --> 02:17:10,237
Halvin? I heard he was interviewed and I went and listened to the interview on American Free Press.

1888
02:17:13,825 --> 02:17:16,175
You required conducted the interview.

1889
02:17:17,575 --> 02:17:18,562
Not sure.

1890
02:17:34,675 --> 02:17:40,850
Did you recall when that was? Know, I'd have to look at the date on the article.

1891
02:17:41,425 --> 02:17:46,312
Let me show you what has been marked as exhibit 19 B.

1892
02:17:47,875 --> 02:17:55,075
Do you see an email from Bastian to you tomb? Astian you bet this guy.

1893
02:17:55,137 --> 02:17:57,510
And yes, it's legit.

1894
02:17:57,555 --> 02:17:59,160
Ask alex to bring him on as a guest.

1895
02:17:59,205 --> 02:17:59,812
Okay.

1896
02:18:01,225 --> 02:18:03,775
Basskyne is I have no idea.

1897
02:18:03,912 --> 02:18:04,612
Okay.

1898
02:18:06,625 --> 02:18:09,880
And you understood Mr.

1899
02:18:09,927 --> 02:18:16,912
Bastian to be asking you to vet Wolfgang Halbeck, correct? Yes, it looks like that.

1900
02:18:20,875 --> 02:18:21,685
Yes, sir.

1901
02:18:21,792 --> 02:18:24,460
But you don't know who Bastian is? No.

1902
02:18:24,567 --> 02:18:29,025
So this interview on the American Free Press was released on February 11, 2014.

1903
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:33,550
So the email from Bastian asking Adan to vet him came the next day.

1904
02:18:33,687 --> 02:18:42,105
It's probably not unreasonable to assume that Adan heard about the interview from this email unless he was closely monitoring everything put out by the AFP.

1905
02:18:42,165 --> 02:18:42,745
Yeah.

1906
02:18:42,897 --> 02:18:55,110
It's really good that Adan seems to not know who did that interview, because if he did, he'd have to say that it was Dave Gehari, a friend of David Dukes, who actually was the publisher of Jim Fetzer's book, Nobody Died at Sandy Hood.

1907
02:18:55,155 --> 02:18:55,965
OOH, Nazi.

1908
02:18:55,995 --> 02:18:56,490
Shit.

1909
02:18:56,595 --> 02:19:02,565
Well, and the guy who published that book that you're not supposed to really know all that much about, he was the guy who was interviewing Wolfgang.

1910
02:19:02,595 --> 02:19:06,115
How big that brought how big? To the attention of oh, man.

1911
02:19:06,282 --> 02:19:07,625
Of infowars.

1912
02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:20,265
Actually, I was looking around on Gehry, and he actually recently has made some comments about, like, I think I might be responsible for Alex and Wolfgang.

1913
02:19:20,295 --> 02:19:22,175
How big? Getting sued.

1914
02:19:23,575 --> 02:19:25,945
Yeah, maybe that's possible.

1915
02:19:26,022 --> 02:19:27,025
It could be you.

1916
02:19:27,162 --> 02:19:37,905
So even leaving aside who this interviewer was, american Free Press is a rag that was founded by Nazi and General White supremacist Willis Carter, which has a strange trend of Holocaust deniers as writers.

1917
02:19:37,965 --> 02:19:46,240
So it's not a great sign that this is where Adan was cruising to get new guests, particularly ones he's going to use to inflict severe trauma on the parents of murdered children.

1918
02:19:46,332 --> 02:19:46,765
Yeah.

1919
02:19:46,857 --> 02:19:47,860
Maybe do better.

1920
02:19:47,967 --> 02:19:48,460
Yeah.

1921
02:19:48,567 --> 02:19:49,780
That's not good.

1922
02:19:49,977 --> 02:19:51,900
A tip for depositions.

1923
02:19:52,050 --> 02:19:54,580
Ask how many exhibits there are.

1924
02:19:54,702 --> 02:19:58,395
Like, get as much information as you can beforehand.

1925
02:19:58,560 --> 02:20:03,360
And in fact, I would say even prepare, because then when you go in, see, this goes back to the first clip.

1926
02:20:03,405 --> 02:20:03,700
Yeah.

1927
02:20:03,762 --> 02:20:04,630
Prepare a little more.

1928
02:20:04,677 --> 02:20:06,085
You don't run into this.

1929
02:20:06,192 --> 02:20:08,100
And now let's go to exhibit 19.

1930
02:20:08,175 --> 02:20:11,020
Shim, you know what exhibits are coming.

1931
02:20:11,097 --> 02:20:11,950
That's what's important.

1932
02:20:12,012 --> 02:20:13,425
That's what my pro tip.

1933
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:14,137
Sure.

1934
02:20:14,950 --> 02:20:15,712
Yeah.

1935
02:20:16,150 --> 02:20:29,050
Or, like, just be aware that you tried to sign up for crisisactors.org before you say, I wasn't interested in crisis actors, you really got to know what websites you signed up for that are exactly the thing that you shouldn't have.

1936
02:20:29,187 --> 02:20:29,755
Yeah.

1937
02:20:29,877 --> 02:20:37,065
So Don, having heard this American Free Press interview, you felt the need to vet Wolfgang.

1938
02:20:37,095 --> 02:20:37,687
Sure.

1939
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:46,630
where Mr.

1940
02:20:46,677 --> 02:20:53,665
Halwick says down here in this paragraph, I think it's a scripted event that took place.

1941
02:20:53,757 --> 02:20:57,337
I think it was in planning for maybe two two and a half years.

1942
02:20:58,900 --> 02:20:59,662
Yes.

1943
02:21:01,225 --> 02:21:01,720
Okay.

1944
02:21:01,797 --> 02:21:02,755
And that was Mr.

1945
02:21:02,802 --> 02:21:05,800
Halbig's allegation correct? Yes.

1946
02:21:05,937 --> 02:21:21,262
Now, the idea that a mass shooting at which 20 children were killed and six educators were killed have been scripted and planned for two and a half years in advance is a serious charge, correct? Correct.

1947
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:28,905
And you knew it was a serious charge at the time, serious charges.

1948
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:36,112
And that's why you felt like you needed to establish Mr.

1949
02:21:36,625 --> 02:21:39,800
Halberg's credentials, right? Objection.

1950
02:21:42,175 --> 02:21:44,665
Wish anyone's credentials if you're writing about them.

1951
02:21:44,757 --> 02:21:55,210
But you'd agree with me that you did not do that in every article in which you reported what somebody else was saying, correct? I don't check credentials for everybody I write about.

1952
02:21:55,242 --> 02:21:55,570
Yes.

1953
02:21:55,647 --> 02:21:56,830
All right, but you did for Mr.

1954
02:21:56,877 --> 02:21:57,725
Housing.

1955
02:21:58,225 --> 02:21:58,987
Yes.

1956
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:05,825
And the reason you did is because you knew that these allegations were particularly serious? Objection.

1957
02:22:08,575 --> 02:22:15,262
I thought he was bringing to the table some important information that only a school safety consultant could provide.

1958
02:22:16,675 --> 02:22:35,900
Did it occur here how families who have lost loved ones at Sandy Hook would react to an allegation that, in fact, their children were murdered in an event that was scripted and planned over two and a half years? Did that occur to you? Objection.

1959
02:22:36,925 --> 02:22:38,980
I didn't think about that.

1960
02:22:39,102 --> 02:22:42,445
Why would you? Yeah, I mean, they're not real.

1961
02:22:42,597 --> 02:22:43,630
They're not real people.

1962
02:22:43,677 --> 02:22:47,770
See, I am in Austin, Texas, working for Infowars, and they are not there.

1963
02:22:47,847 --> 02:22:48,400
Right.

1964
02:22:48,537 --> 02:22:50,150
It's solipsism.

1965
02:22:50,875 --> 02:22:53,850
Also, people might have heard what sounded like a gasp.

1966
02:22:53,925 --> 02:22:54,415
It was you.

1967
02:22:54,432 --> 02:22:55,250
Hiccuping.

1968
02:22:57,100 --> 02:22:58,200
I did not gasp.

1969
02:22:58,275 --> 02:22:58,950
I hiccup.

1970
02:22:59,025 --> 02:22:59,440
Yeah.

1971
02:22:59,532 --> 02:23:02,740
So the vetting process pretty light.

1972
02:23:02,832 --> 02:23:05,655
Almost like the vetting process to get hired at Infowars.

1973
02:23:05,715 --> 02:23:08,355
It turns out they're parallels.

1974
02:23:08,415 --> 02:23:09,265
You googled it.

1975
02:23:09,357 --> 02:23:12,580
Other than visiting the website, which you acknowledge Mr.

1976
02:23:12,627 --> 02:23:30,855
Halbeck may have put up himself, and reviewing the interview, did you do anything further to investigate the claims that he made relating to the threatening conduct of law enforcement officers and the scripted nature of the scene to hook them? No, I didn't.

1977
02:23:30,915 --> 02:23:33,435
I just published what he said in the interview.

1978
02:23:33,555 --> 02:23:41,980
Why? And you're aware that shortly after you published this article, mr.

1979
02:23:42,027 --> 02:23:53,125
Halbig appeared on the Infowars broadcast? Are you aware of that? I think I recall yet.

1980
02:23:53,187 --> 02:23:54,090
Probably a coincidence.

1981
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:54,535
Yeah.

1982
02:23:54,642 --> 02:23:55,230
Bizarre.

1983
02:23:55,290 --> 02:23:55,735
Yeah.

1984
02:23:55,842 --> 02:23:59,740
So he did a little looking around.

1985
02:23:59,832 --> 02:24:00,355
Yeah.

1986
02:24:00,477 --> 02:24:03,655
Did a website that maybe how big? Put up himself? Yeah.

1987
02:24:03,702 --> 02:24:05,085
Well, I mean, listen to that interview.

1988
02:24:05,130 --> 02:24:06,760
If it's on the Internet, you can trust it.

1989
02:24:06,867 --> 02:24:07,930
It's the mainstream media.

1990
02:24:07,977 --> 02:24:08,760
He said bingo.

1991
02:24:08,805 --> 02:24:09,205
Let's go.

1992
02:24:09,252 --> 02:24:09,670
Let's do it.

1993
02:24:09,672 --> 02:24:10,300
It looks good.

1994
02:24:10,362 --> 02:24:10,987
Yeah.

1995
02:24:11,725 --> 02:24:18,500
And then a guy named Robert Keith sent an email to Info that said, hey, this guy looks shady.

1996
02:24:19,450 --> 02:24:21,345
Maybe check into his credentials.

1997
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:22,405
Yeah, maybe don't do this.

1998
02:24:22,452 --> 02:24:26,565
And Adon wrote back to him and said, hey, man, it looks like he's got plenty of credentials.

1999
02:24:26,595 --> 02:24:27,085
Oh, my God.

2000
02:24:27,117 --> 02:24:28,560
You're being too unspecific.

2001
02:24:28,605 --> 02:24:29,200
Oh, my God.

2002
02:24:29,262 --> 02:24:35,820
And so Heath wrote him back and had a specific long list of things that were of concern.

2003
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:36,562
Right.

2004
02:24:36,925 --> 02:24:52,150
We talked about this on a bunch of the deposition episodes because it's come up in the corporate reps and with Alex, so I didn't want to play it all over again, but we got this discussion about the email here.

2005
02:24:52,287 --> 02:24:52,855
So Mr.

2006
02:24:52,902 --> 02:25:02,335
Heath followed up in his email to you with the results of inquiry he had made online about Mr.

2007
02:25:02,367 --> 02:25:05,635
Halbat's past, correct? Here's that way, yes.

2008
02:25:05,742 --> 02:25:06,412
Okay.

2009
02:25:07,300 --> 02:25:15,310
And it seems as though he did, according to his email, quite a bit more than you did to investigate Mr.

2010
02:25:15,342 --> 02:25:21,337
halving's background correction, but it looks like he did ample research.

2011
02:25:22,075 --> 02:25:24,505
Well, all you did was visit one website that Mr.

2012
02:25:24,552 --> 02:25:26,160
Halbeck himself may have created.

2013
02:25:26,205 --> 02:25:35,065
Correction he may have created I think I did a little bit more searching, but I think it was mainly based off of that one website.

2014
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:35,605
Okay.

2015
02:25:35,652 --> 02:25:37,030
You're talking to me earlier today.

2016
02:25:37,077 --> 02:25:38,590
Was that it was just the website.

2017
02:25:38,682 --> 02:25:44,325
Are you expanding that now to testify that you think you may have done other searches? Objection.

2018
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:47,155
I don't recall what kind of searches I did for Mr.

2019
02:25:47,202 --> 02:25:53,275
How big's information other than that website, but it's possible that I did do more research other than what I stated I did.

2020
02:25:53,337 --> 02:25:57,175
I'd like to stipulate that I might have done something yeah, that makes you look way better.

2021
02:25:57,237 --> 02:26:14,430
Yeah, I did this bad thing, but I might have done I will say that if I were in a don's position and the lawyer asks, is it fair to say that this random guy emailing you did more work than you on the story you're doing? Yeah, if my lawyer didn't then object, I'd be furious.

2022
02:26:14,490 --> 02:26:14,980
Yeah.

2023
02:26:15,102 --> 02:26:20,835
That would be a position where no, you're getting hanging out to dry.

2024
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:21,580
That's what's happening.

2025
02:26:21,627 --> 02:26:25,035
If your lawyer is like, yeah, answer that question, buddy.

2026
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:28,110
So these emails come in warning about how big s credentials.

2027
02:26:28,155 --> 02:26:28,405
Right.

2028
02:26:28,452 --> 02:26:32,050
And as it turns out, I mean, how big just kept coming back on the show.

2029
02:26:32,112 --> 02:26:32,695
Yeah.

2030
02:26:32,847 --> 02:26:33,745
Did Mr.

2031
02:26:33,822 --> 02:26:51,775
Heath email to you in which he expressed concern that he was not able to find information concerning how big professional activities cause you to question whether Mr.

2032
02:26:51,837 --> 02:27:05,737
How big could be relied upon? I think the points he's bringing it up are valid, and, yeah, I think it probably maybe made me question I can't recall how I felt at the time.

2033
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:08,005
Okay.

2034
02:27:08,202 --> 02:27:12,685
In fact, you don't even recall receiving this email, correct? It's been so long.

2035
02:27:12,717 --> 02:27:16,687
It's been nine years, so, no, I definitely don't recall receiving this email.

2036
02:27:20,950 --> 02:27:22,855
And you don't recall whether you raised mr.

2037
02:27:22,902 --> 02:27:28,330
Heath's concerns with anybody else at info force, is that correct? I don't recall doing that either.

2038
02:27:28,377 --> 02:27:28,810
Yeah.

2039
02:27:28,917 --> 02:27:31,180
If you had, do you suspect you would have ordered mr.

2040
02:27:31,227 --> 02:27:36,910
Heath's email along to whoever you wanted to notify about it? Yes, I probably would have.

2041
02:27:36,942 --> 02:27:37,450
Yes.

2042
02:27:37,587 --> 02:27:38,335
Okay.

2043
02:27:44,725 --> 02:27:49,405
whatever you may have done or not done in response to this email, mr.

2044
02:27:49,452 --> 02:27:58,855
Howberg continued to appear on Infowars after March 15, 2014, correct? I believe that's the case, yes.

2045
02:27:58,977 --> 02:28:02,410
And you don't recall whether you did any additional betting of Mr.

2046
02:28:02,442 --> 02:28:09,130
How big yourself in response to receiving this email? Correct? I don't believe I did any betting after this email.

2047
02:28:09,177 --> 02:28:12,145
Now, wow, that certainly shows that you care.

2048
02:28:12,297 --> 02:28:12,700
Mr.

2049
02:28:12,762 --> 02:28:15,490
Medi, I think you misunderstood our process here.

2050
02:28:15,507 --> 02:28:24,250
You see, what we did was we used him because his narrative bolstered our own credibility, and that was so we could make money.

2051
02:28:24,312 --> 02:28:24,685
Oh, no.

2052
02:28:24,717 --> 02:28:26,310
Now I see why we're in trouble.

2053
02:28:26,505 --> 02:28:31,087
And honestly, at the time, we kind of figured that if anybody was going to get in trouble, it would be him.

2054
02:28:31,900 --> 02:28:34,080
Yeah, we thought we were off the hook.

2055
02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:38,275
Yeah, we kind of thought we were going to be able to throw him under the bus.

2056
02:28:38,337 --> 02:28:39,610
I'm going to throw this out.

2057
02:28:39,792 --> 02:28:40,525
Screwed up.

2058
02:28:40,587 --> 02:28:42,037
We're not good at law.

2059
02:28:42,925 --> 02:28:47,815
I mean, based on their choice of lawyers, they really bad at law.

2060
02:28:47,907 --> 02:28:48,940
Yeah, fine.

2061
02:28:49,107 --> 02:28:57,100
So there is clear evidence that there were people who are raising concerns that a don had heard because he did respond to that email.

2062
02:28:57,162 --> 02:29:00,660
Yeah, that's an issue about Wolfgang how big's credibility.

2063
02:29:00,855 --> 02:29:07,690
But there were other people, maybe even Infowars employees, who were saying, you got to be careful here.

2064
02:29:07,857 --> 02:29:08,635
Other than Mr.

2065
02:29:08,667 --> 02:29:12,955
Heath, did anybody else ever warn you about relying on Mr.

2066
02:29:20,425 --> 02:29:21,190
Maybe.

2067
02:29:21,357 --> 02:29:22,485
I can't recall.

2068
02:29:22,605 --> 02:29:23,450
Possibly.

2069
02:29:24,025 --> 02:29:29,175
Do you know an individual named Robert Jacobson? Yes, Robert Jackson.

2070
02:29:29,325 --> 02:29:30,085
How do you know Mr.

2071
02:29:30,117 --> 02:29:33,950
Jacobson? He was a video producer for Alex.

2072
02:29:36,025 --> 02:29:43,210
Did your work intersect at Infowars? He's down the hall from me.

2073
02:29:43,392 --> 02:29:45,045
Once in a while, we'd chat.

2074
02:29:45,210 --> 02:29:46,545
When did he leave? In Cohorts.

2075
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:53,890
Do you recall? Maybe 2017 or 2018 something somewhere around there.

2076
02:29:53,907 --> 02:29:54,445
I don't know.

2077
02:29:54,522 --> 02:29:58,465
And was he at his when you started in 2012? Yes.

2078
02:29:58,632 --> 02:30:03,037
So you were colleagues for five, six years? Yes, sir.

2079
02:30:05,050 --> 02:30:06,805
Did you have a friendly relationship with Mr.

2080
02:30:06,852 --> 02:30:09,187
Jacobson? Yes, I did.

2081
02:30:09,700 --> 02:30:12,562
Are you in touch with him today? Not really.

2082
02:30:13,375 --> 02:30:15,875
Do you communicate with him? I don't.

2083
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:17,230
Did Mr.

2084
02:30:17,277 --> 02:30:21,355
Jacobson ever advise you of his concerns about relying on Mr.

2085
02:30:21,402 --> 02:30:28,975
How Big as a source for reporting that Sandy Hook was a scripted event? Mr.

2086
02:30:29,037 --> 02:30:34,705
Jacobson, I think, did raise concerns, but I didn't really regard them because Mr.

2087
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:37,615
Jacobson has some wild theories about a lot of things.

2088
02:30:37,707 --> 02:30:40,495
Oh, he does? He has wild theories? Amazing.

2089
02:30:40,647 --> 02:30:41,655
Wild theories.

2090
02:30:41,715 --> 02:30:42,862
Just amazing.

2091
02:30:43,375 --> 02:30:49,000
Truly an incredible thing for a human being to say in the context within which he's telling it.

2092
02:30:49,062 --> 02:30:49,330
Yes.

2093
02:30:49,377 --> 02:30:55,965
He's telling me that maybe I shouldn't listen to this wacko about Sandy Hook being fake, but I don't listen because he's got weird theories.

2094
02:30:55,995 --> 02:30:56,940
He's a wacko.

2095
02:30:57,045 --> 02:31:00,160
Mike down for this because I get into what those theories are.

2096
02:31:00,192 --> 02:31:01,105
Oh, no.

2097
02:31:01,302 --> 02:31:03,880
And this is really unfortunate for a Don.

2098
02:31:04,077 --> 02:31:05,335
Your testimony is that Mr.

2099
02:31:05,367 --> 02:31:07,750
Jacobson raised concerns about Mr.

2100
02:31:07,812 --> 02:31:16,175
Halbig's credibility, but that you ignored those concerns because he tends to have wild ideas.

2101
02:31:17,575 --> 02:31:22,162
Yeah, he thinks Michelle Obama is a man, for one.

2102
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:29,710
And you've actually posted on your own social media suggesting that Michelle Obama is a man.

2103
02:31:29,742 --> 02:31:34,345
Having I've gone along with that conspiracy theory? Yes.

2104
02:31:34,497 --> 02:31:37,480
You've actually posted a picture of Mr.

2105
02:31:37,527 --> 02:31:37,965
And Mrs.

2106
02:31:37,995 --> 02:31:42,187
Obama kissing and saying essentially, Happy Gay Pride Day? Correct.

2107
02:31:43,075 --> 02:31:44,140
I might have done that.

2108
02:31:44,157 --> 02:31:44,560
I don't know.

2109
02:31:44,592 --> 02:31:45,430
I don't remember.

2110
02:31:45,552 --> 02:31:48,220
So I guess you don't think that Mr.

2111
02:31:48,297 --> 02:32:00,570
Jacobson's view of that is quite as wild, right? I think I entertain the theory, but I don't espouse the theory.

2112
02:32:00,735 --> 02:32:03,205
In any event, you discounted Mr.

2113
02:32:03,252 --> 02:32:08,287
Jacobson's warning because you believe he held views like that.

2114
02:32:10,150 --> 02:32:10,555
Mr.

2115
02:32:10,602 --> 02:32:20,835
Jacobson wasn't completely credible in my opinion, but he did give the warning, and I didn't think much of it, honestly.

2116
02:32:20,955 --> 02:32:28,335
So the best way you can really interpret this otherwise, it's something that I couldn't even imagine translating.

2117
02:32:28,455 --> 02:32:36,250
But the best way I can figure is what Adam is saying is that Rob actually believes this thing.

2118
02:32:36,387 --> 02:32:52,350
Whereas I'm willing to post this trolling shit, post meme about it in order to push my transphobic and homophobic ideology, I'm willing to use something that I don't even come close to believing because it spreads the hate that I want to spread.

2119
02:32:52,425 --> 02:32:55,180
Whereas Rob is crazy because he actually believes this.

2120
02:32:55,227 --> 02:32:55,795
Right.

2121
02:32:55,947 --> 02:32:58,750
That's as close to making sense of this as I can.

2122
02:32:58,812 --> 02:33:06,070
Yeah, it does appear that he is saying that Rob is crazy for believing the things that I say.

2123
02:33:06,147 --> 02:33:08,575
Yeah, the things that we promote and make money off of.

2124
02:33:08,637 --> 02:33:11,130
You might actually believe this stuff, and that's worrying.

2125
02:33:11,190 --> 02:33:14,185
So see, the thing is, you got to see, Mr.

2126
02:33:14,217 --> 02:33:20,215
Maddie, the thing you got to know is none of us are actually really believe the shit that we say and Rob does.

2127
02:33:20,307 --> 02:33:21,700
So that guy's crazy.

2128
02:33:21,837 --> 02:33:35,850
I was invested in spreading Sandy Hook conspiracy theories and implying that it's fake because I needed to attack the event as a way to get around the obligation to make arguments in favor of guns being everywhere because of a liberal.

2129
02:33:35,925 --> 02:33:44,740
I have a kind of second order interest in it, whereas I'm actually just manipulating the audience into thinking these things are real, these concerns are real.

2130
02:33:44,832 --> 02:33:48,187
Again, in order to make money, rob kind of believes this stuff.

2131
02:33:48,925 --> 02:33:49,510
Wow.

2132
02:33:49,617 --> 02:33:52,405
It seems like that's one of the readings you could make of this.

2133
02:33:52,452 --> 02:33:53,170
I still know.

2134
02:33:53,247 --> 02:33:54,535
Well, there's another one, I think.

2135
02:33:54,567 --> 02:34:00,915
And that is that it's another rake in the face, and you're just sort of punch drunk from the rake.

2136
02:34:00,945 --> 02:34:02,437
You're like, I don't fucking know.

2137
02:34:02,875 --> 02:34:09,210
How am I supposed to respond to it? What am I going to say? Why didn't I listen to this guy's warning? Because I didn't.

2138
02:34:09,255 --> 02:34:18,195
What do you want? Well, no, how would Adan expect that Maddie has knowledge of this thing? He posted on Facebook.

2139
02:34:18,285 --> 02:34:18,760
Right.

2140
02:34:18,867 --> 02:34:19,915
He didn't expect that.

2141
02:34:19,932 --> 02:34:27,640
No, of course he thought he was going to get away with saying something that would be offensive to most people, this belief that Rob allegedly has.

2142
02:34:27,732 --> 02:34:30,505
And then they'd be like, oh, that is a crazy idea that Rob has.

2143
02:34:30,552 --> 02:34:37,120
Maybe you have demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, but instead, he gets confronted with you believe the same thing.

2144
02:34:37,197 --> 02:34:39,925
I mean, it is just amazing.

2145
02:34:40,062 --> 02:34:56,230
It's just amazing for a human being to be and it's even more amazing because Rob, when he was there raising these concerns about Wolfgang Adan, decided that the best course of action would be to make fun of him.

2146
02:34:56,277 --> 02:34:57,262
Oh, my God.

2147
02:34:58,825 --> 02:35:02,605
Your general recollection that he raised concerns about relying on Mr.

2148
02:35:02,652 --> 02:35:08,600
Halbig as a source for the claim that CNN hook was scripted.

2149
02:35:10,225 --> 02:35:12,862
I believe I brushed it off.

2150
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:18,712
I might have poked funded him for saying that.

2151
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:24,412
Did you report these concerns to anybody else at Info Wars? No.

2152
02:35:40,300 --> 02:35:45,637
Do you ever take any tips to have those T shirts or bumper stickers made? No.

2153
02:35:46,750 --> 02:35:48,730
Did you say that because you believed, in fact, Mr.

2154
02:35:48,777 --> 02:36:03,880
Halbig was right? I tend not to, like, throw my beliefs behind everything fully, so it's potential that he could have been correct, and I just know that it was getting under Jacobson's craw to say that he was right.

2155
02:36:03,927 --> 02:36:13,140
So I kind of threw that in there as a joke, but also half serious.

2156
02:36:13,320 --> 02:36:15,405
See, it's a joke, but it's also kind of serious.

2157
02:36:15,465 --> 02:36:17,955
Oh, my God, I'm kind of making this point, but it's also a joke.

2158
02:36:18,015 --> 02:36:27,085
I want to have entire plausible deniability about this stuff, but I also really want the benefits of people thinking that I'm serious about it when they're available.

2159
02:36:27,267 --> 02:36:43,600
How is it that a human being can lay out this clear a pattern of behavior that you engaged in that is so obviously everything wrong and not be like, Now I get it.

2160
02:36:43,662 --> 02:36:43,975
Right.

2161
02:36:44,037 --> 02:36:47,790
Well, just because, you know, going in, that what you already full of shit.

2162
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:48,550
Yeah, exactly.

2163
02:36:48,687 --> 02:37:03,130
And I think that that moment of the constant banging your head against the wall, of, like, you had these things that you were bringing up about anomalies Sandy Hook, but you weren't making a point.

2164
02:37:03,177 --> 02:37:05,775
You didn't have a conclusion of the foreknowledge.

2165
02:37:05,925 --> 02:37:14,860
Like, if he realized the thing that was laid out about 911 at the beginning of the like, I had anomalies and it made me government did it.

2166
02:37:14,892 --> 02:37:15,575
Totally.

2167
02:37:16,825 --> 02:37:19,780
There should be a moment where it's like, Ah, fuck, yeah.

2168
02:37:19,827 --> 02:37:20,305
Absolutely.

2169
02:37:20,427 --> 02:37:21,340
That's what I want.

2170
02:37:21,432 --> 02:37:26,200
I just want that moment, like, with Norm dropping his bullshit to me.

2171
02:37:26,262 --> 02:37:30,840
That's the moment that I really want is when you have to finally admit that you're an idiot.

2172
02:37:30,870 --> 02:37:32,455
And I have boxed myself in.

2173
02:37:32,502 --> 02:37:32,710
Exactly.

2174
02:37:32,742 --> 02:37:35,595
I can't exist in this space and make anything totally.

2175
02:37:35,685 --> 02:37:37,255
You did this to yourself.

2176
02:37:37,377 --> 02:37:37,975
Yeah.

2177
02:37:38,112 --> 02:37:42,960
A decade of working at Info Wars causes no problems because no one gives a shit.

2178
02:37:43,005 --> 02:37:44,935
No one is monitoring your work.

2179
02:37:44,967 --> 02:37:47,500
I've never been asked a follow up question in my life.

2180
02:37:47,562 --> 02:37:50,245
Integrity and the point doesn't matter.

2181
02:37:50,322 --> 02:37:53,455
No, but yeah, when you're asked follow questions.

2182
02:37:53,502 --> 02:37:58,990
When you're in a place where people don't believe your nonsense, you can't do it.

2183
02:37:59,007 --> 02:37:59,812
It's hard.

2184
02:38:00,775 --> 02:38:02,525
Also, this was really funny.

2185
02:38:02,950 --> 02:38:08,565
I mean, it's not funny because the result of it, but being said, Don, is very funny.

2186
02:38:08,595 --> 02:38:09,055
Okay.

2187
02:38:09,177 --> 02:38:32,825
Up until relatively recently, you had a pinned tweet to the top of your Twitter account, which was a link to your first ever article about Wolfgang Halbeig introducing him to the Infowars audience, correct? I don't recall a pen tweet about how big, but maybe I don't know why I'd be publishing that on Twitter in 2019.

2188
02:38:33,400 --> 02:38:36,760
Okay, good question.

2189
02:38:36,867 --> 02:38:39,715
Showing you exhibit number 19 A.

2190
02:38:39,807 --> 02:38:40,837
Oh, my God.

2191
02:38:44,275 --> 02:38:52,045
This is the page of your Twitter account, correct? Yes.

2192
02:38:52,197 --> 02:38:56,905
Okay, and you joined in September 2017, right? Okay.

2193
02:38:56,952 --> 02:38:57,430
Yes.

2194
02:38:57,552 --> 02:39:08,650
And then you have a pinned tweet at the top of your account, which, according to the page, was posted on April 17, 2018, correct? Oh, my God.

2195
02:39:08,787 --> 02:39:09,580
Yes.

2196
02:39:09,777 --> 02:39:10,540
Okay.

2197
02:39:10,707 --> 02:39:14,035
And you can see the partial headline there.

2198
02:39:14,067 --> 02:39:16,890
School shooting expert threatened over Sandy Hook.

2199
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:20,005
That's the first article you ever wrote concerning Mr.

2200
02:39:20,052 --> 02:39:21,820
Halving, correct? Yes, that's it.

2201
02:39:21,897 --> 02:39:33,955
So at least as of 2018, you were leading your Twitter landing page with an article in which Mr.

2202
02:39:34,002 --> 02:39:38,000
Halbeig referred to Sandy Hook as a scripted event, correct? Objection.

2203
02:39:39,475 --> 02:39:51,580
It appears I pinned the tweet to the top of my Twitter account on April 17, 2018, and the pin linked to an article in which Mr.

2204
02:39:57,250 --> 02:39:57,700
Yes.

2205
02:39:57,762 --> 02:40:00,345
The article is about it's.

2206
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:01,850
The one we covered earlier.

2207
02:40:02,800 --> 02:40:03,562
Yeah.

2208
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:08,437
Boy, well, I guess I did do that.

2209
02:40:09,700 --> 02:40:17,005
Why did I post that article in 2018 and pin it in my top tweet on my account? Mr.

2210
02:40:17,052 --> 02:40:19,735
Medi, I'm starting to see a pattern of behavior here.

2211
02:40:19,767 --> 02:40:30,280
So you ask me a question, then I answer it, and then whenever I answer it, you pull out an exhibit proving the opposite, or at least something different from what I said.

2212
02:40:30,327 --> 02:40:39,385
Is it too late for me to blame this on them not training me? How have you considered telling me what your exhibits are before you ask the question? That was really fun.

2213
02:40:39,492 --> 02:40:41,975
Then I will be able to answer truthfully.

2214
02:40:43,150 --> 02:40:50,955
So we have one last thing that comes up, last line of questioning that has to do with Adon writing.

2215
02:40:51,090 --> 02:40:54,480
The FBI says no one was killed at Sandy Hook.

2216
02:40:54,540 --> 02:40:55,210
Right.

2217
02:40:55,392 --> 02:40:59,110
That article that was one of the most popular stories ever.

2218
02:40:59,142 --> 02:41:02,830
Drove a massive spike in traffic, went all over social media.

2219
02:41:02,877 --> 02:41:05,525
It was a huge thing for infowars.

2220
02:41:07,300 --> 02:41:15,085
And, yeah, it was all just based on one table from a report that Adon found somehow, I guess.

2221
02:41:36,775 --> 02:41:42,925
you cited a table eight from that report, correct.

2222
02:41:42,987 --> 02:41:46,060
You recall that it might have been table eight.

2223
02:41:46,167 --> 02:41:46,570
Okay.

2224
02:41:46,647 --> 02:41:47,815
And I'm going to pull that up for you.

2225
02:41:47,832 --> 02:41:49,387
That's 25 B.

2226
02:41:53,575 --> 02:41:55,885
And I'll acknowledge, Mr.

2227
02:41:55,992 --> 02:42:04,855
Salazar, that because of the way this was PDF is kind of partly cut off on the left side, but we'll be able to see what we need to see.

2228
02:42:04,977 --> 02:42:11,437
You recall the look of this graphic header? You included that in your article, did you not? Yes.

2229
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:40,360
page three, to the Newtown row now, I can see that the N is cut off, but if we can just accept for purposes of this that this is the New Town row, you see that zero are reported in that particular row for murders and non negligent manslaughter for that year, correct? Yes, I see that.

2230
02:42:40,467 --> 02:42:44,887
And that was the quote anomaly you were reporting on, right? Yes.

2231
02:42:45,250 --> 02:43:04,125
But you didn't look in any other part of the report to see if the deaths that occurred in Newtown at the Sandy Hook shooting were in fact reported in another section, did you? I didn't think there would be another term for what happened at Sandy Hook.

2232
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:15,725
I thought the murder would encompass the whole thing any further for other definitions or other places.

2233
02:43:16,075 --> 02:43:32,440
And you didn't look any further to see whether those murders were reported under a different law enforcement organization that had jurisdiction to investigate them, correct? I only was reporting on what the FBI was saying in this report.

2234
02:43:32,607 --> 02:43:34,720
Well, that's what I'm asking.

2235
02:43:34,797 --> 02:43:35,230
Good question.

2236
02:43:35,277 --> 02:43:38,737
This report wasn't just table eight, correct? There were other parts of the report.

2237
02:43:39,775 --> 02:43:42,800
Did you know that? Objection.

2238
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:48,460
I figured there's one through seven at least it's table eight.

2239
02:43:48,492 --> 02:43:52,275
So we're on one through seven exists probably somewhere.

2240
02:43:52,425 --> 02:43:57,050
And you didn't think to look for table nine or table ten or any other tables, right? Objection.

2241
02:43:58,450 --> 02:44:08,050
I think my story was mainly about table eight, so I didn't go through the entire list of tables that the FBI has.

2242
02:44:08,187 --> 02:44:16,770
So I was listening to this and it just kind of struck me how clearly this demonstrates that there's no curiosity.

2243
02:44:16,860 --> 02:44:20,695
No, because curiosity isn't useful for someone like a don.

2244
02:44:20,847 --> 02:44:27,637
Like when your job is to write a story about a predetermined thing, curiosity is just going to get in the way.

2245
02:44:28,225 --> 02:44:35,965
In order to do the work that he has done and is doing, you have to actively not ask questions.

2246
02:44:36,132 --> 02:44:38,760
You have to actively not question events.

2247
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:46,900
You're branding yourself in some way as like, we're out there, we're questioning things, but this is literally not asking questions.

2248
02:44:46,962 --> 02:44:53,812
It's stopping yourself from asking natural questions that one would have upon finding information.

2249
02:44:54,250 --> 02:44:55,400
It's wild.

2250
02:44:56,500 --> 02:45:05,275
I don't understand how they can't understand not that they don't understand it, but I don't understand how they can't see how transparent that is.

2251
02:45:05,337 --> 02:45:21,112
Well, what's interesting to me about that is I feel like it's very similar to why they're so susceptible to being trapped in these depositions, is because the way their brain thinks is they go into the forest, they get their apple, and then they go back home.

2252
02:45:21,775 --> 02:45:26,620
You could put an apple underneath a box, and I'm talking about this now.

2253
02:45:26,697 --> 02:45:32,460
In real life, you could put an apple underneath the cardboard box with a little thing attached, and they'd be trapped.

2254
02:45:32,505 --> 02:45:34,590
Every time they go in there, they grab the apple.

2255
02:45:34,620 --> 02:45:35,790
They'd be like, OOH, good apple.

2256
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:36,825
And then they'd be trapped.

2257
02:45:36,900 --> 02:45:38,230
It wouldn't be hard.

2258
02:45:38,427 --> 02:45:40,620
They don't think clearly.

2259
02:45:40,710 --> 02:45:42,025
Well words.

2260
02:45:42,162 --> 02:45:44,110
All of the things they don't think them.

2261
02:45:44,217 --> 02:45:44,800
Yeah.

2262
02:45:44,937 --> 02:46:01,015
I just I wonder if it is just a thing of, like, no one cares in their lives, so why would they think that anybody else would see through the fake game that they're playing? Yeah.

2263
02:46:01,107 --> 02:46:10,975
If he did have curiosity somewhere with deep within him, I really feel like his answer to those would be like, oh, that would be a good idea to look for a table nine.

2264
02:46:11,037 --> 02:46:11,305
Right.

2265
02:46:11,352 --> 02:46:17,080
Ironically, I'm curious about this lack of curiosity, and that is absolutely not a healthy place.

2266
02:46:17,127 --> 02:46:21,915
Where does it come from? Yeah, but he really only was interested in that table because it made his argument.

2267
02:46:21,945 --> 02:46:22,710
He got it apple.

2268
02:46:22,755 --> 02:46:23,410
Yeah.

2269
02:46:23,592 --> 02:46:26,215
You only went to the one table that A.

2270
02:46:26,232 --> 02:46:28,210
Tipster pointed out to you.

2271
02:46:28,242 --> 02:46:30,000
Correction.

2272
02:46:30,150 --> 02:46:34,000
I only went to the table that showed their zero debts in New Ten.

2273
02:46:34,137 --> 02:46:34,435
Right.

2274
02:46:34,467 --> 02:46:38,715
But you had to have a reason to know that that's what that table showed.

2275
02:46:38,745 --> 02:46:42,460
And I think your testimony was that A.

2276
02:46:42,492 --> 02:46:43,810
Tipster had provided it to you.

2277
02:46:43,842 --> 02:46:46,825
Correct? It was either a tip or something I found on social media.

2278
02:46:46,887 --> 02:46:47,290
Yeah.

2279
02:46:47,382 --> 02:46:47,950
Okay.

2280
02:46:48,087 --> 02:46:54,712
And you only wanted to go to that table because that's the table that reported zero deaths, right.

2281
02:46:55,075 --> 02:46:59,300
That's the only table that pertains to the story I was writing.

2282
02:46:59,650 --> 02:47:00,190
Yes.

2283
02:47:00,282 --> 02:47:07,105
Well, the story you were writing reported that the FBI reported zero deaths in Newtown, correct? Yes.

2284
02:47:07,152 --> 02:47:12,725
And that's why the point is a table eight showing that it showed zero deaths in Newtown.

2285
02:47:13,075 --> 02:47:18,150
And what you were conveying to your audience was, this is an anomaly.

2286
02:47:18,225 --> 02:47:24,490
If there had been deaths in Newtown, you would expect the FBI to have reported them, correct? We're trying, yes.

2287
02:47:24,582 --> 02:47:25,030
Back down.

2288
02:47:25,077 --> 02:47:31,995
What you didn't point out was that the FBI didn't fact report them in a separate table in the same report correction.

2289
02:47:32,085 --> 02:47:33,735
Mischaracterizes the evidence.

2290
02:47:33,855 --> 02:47:39,735
You didn't point that out, did you? I wasn't aware that the FBI had reported the deaths elsewhere.

2291
02:47:39,780 --> 02:47:44,137
I don't know why they would not list the deaths where it says murders in UTown zero.

2292
02:47:44,575 --> 02:47:45,985
You don't know why they might do that.

2293
02:47:46,017 --> 02:47:46,612
Correct.

2294
02:47:47,650 --> 02:48:02,155
It seemed like it should all be listed in the table late and what did you ask or make any inquiry about whether those deaths may have been reported elsewhere in the same report? Correct? I didn't ask the FBI, if that's what you're asking.

2295
02:48:02,277 --> 02:48:04,555
You didn't ask anybody? No.

2296
02:48:04,677 --> 02:48:08,275
This is a dangerously uncurious and unserious person.

2297
02:48:08,337 --> 02:48:09,150
That's insane.

2298
02:48:09,225 --> 02:48:09,640
Yeah.

2299
02:48:09,732 --> 02:48:10,890
That's bananas.

2300
02:48:10,995 --> 02:48:15,400
I feel like he's now a completely unique person to me.

2301
02:48:15,537 --> 02:48:17,525
I don't know how this person exists.

2302
02:48:18,550 --> 02:48:22,237
How do you tie your shoes? My God.

2303
02:48:23,275 --> 02:48:28,885
So did you think that there could be a table nine or they could report it anywhere else? I don't know why they would.

2304
02:48:29,067 --> 02:48:43,600
You can answer that question, right? You can go be like, why would you? And find the answer things that you don't know if they aren't, like, necessarily in your interest? It's a dead end.

2305
02:48:43,662 --> 02:48:44,065
Yeah.

2306
02:48:44,157 --> 02:48:51,165
There's no reason to explore this because the only thing you could possibly find ruins the ability to get this for your purposes.

2307
02:48:51,195 --> 02:48:51,520
Yeah.

2308
02:48:51,597 --> 02:48:55,225
Which is what they won't just come out and say, right? Yeah, but it's pretty obvious.

2309
02:48:55,287 --> 02:48:57,810
If I looked any further, I would find out that I'm lying.

2310
02:48:57,855 --> 02:49:01,095
And I don't want to do that because I want to possibly deny that I'm lying.

2311
02:49:01,110 --> 02:49:04,245
I would get past the point of plausible deniability, and then we're in trouble.

2312
02:49:04,335 --> 02:49:07,012
Like these emails you keep reading back to me.

2313
02:49:07,975 --> 02:49:24,645
So, speaking of emails, I'm going to skip this next clip because it's long, and honestly, I only kept it in for one reason, and it's because there's an email that he sent to his cousin that was about these cyclists who are going from Newtown to Washington to, like, bring attention to gun legislation.

2314
02:49:24,810 --> 02:49:30,200
And he sent an article about it, and the subject headline was Fuck These Psychological.

2315
02:49:31,300 --> 02:49:32,587
That's very good.

2316
02:49:33,100 --> 02:49:34,030
I'll take that one.

2317
02:49:34,077 --> 02:49:35,490
Yeah, but it's a long clip.

2318
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:36,190
We can skip it.

2319
02:49:36,207 --> 02:49:36,790
Yeah.

2320
02:49:36,957 --> 02:49:47,375
So the subject comes up as we're dismounting here of a documentary that Infowars had promoted called We Need to Talk About Sandy Hook.

2321
02:49:47,800 --> 02:49:51,115
And here is Adon's sense of what happened there.

2322
02:49:51,282 --> 02:50:00,415
You familiar with the documentary We Need to Talk About Sandy Hook? I believe I tried to get through it.

2323
02:50:00,432 --> 02:50:05,155
It was so long that I probably just got through 30 minutes worth of it or something.

2324
02:50:05,202 --> 02:50:08,600
Yeah, fairly familiar with the documentary.

2325
02:50:09,175 --> 02:50:09,937
Okay.

2326
02:50:10,825 --> 02:50:19,087
And you didn't have anything to do with making that documentary, did you? No, sir.

2327
02:50:20,725 --> 02:50:28,855
Did you promote that documentary on your social media platforms? I might have.

2328
02:50:28,902 --> 02:50:30,050
I can't recall.

2329
02:50:41,300 --> 02:50:52,712
Do you know whether Infowars ever promoted that documentary? I believe I wrote an article about it when it was taken off of vimeo or something.

2330
02:50:55,250 --> 02:50:57,590
No, other than that, I don't think we promoted it.

2331
02:50:57,607 --> 02:51:00,750
I just read about why being censored.

2332
02:51:01,175 --> 02:51:01,937
Okay.

2333
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:13,220
Did you express your own disagreement with the fact that certain platforms had chosen not to publish it? Well, I did write an article about it.

2334
02:51:13,222 --> 02:51:15,820
I don't know if I express a personal opinion in that article.

2335
02:51:15,985 --> 02:51:16,760
Okay.

2336
02:51:16,942 --> 02:51:39,080
Did you know at the time that We Need to Talk About Sandy Hook documentary presented, to view that Sandy Hook and not in fact, occurred? I figured that was the central tenant of the documentary, but I didn't watch it in its entirety, so I kind of had to just guess that was what they were going for.

2337
02:51:39,202 --> 02:51:39,890
Okay.

2338
02:51:40,057 --> 02:51:45,560
And you reported that in your coverage of the ban? I believe so.

2339
02:51:45,667 --> 02:51:46,115
Okay.

2340
02:51:46,207 --> 02:51:56,635
On December 2, 2014, inForest posted the video of this documentary on their site with the subheadline, quote, documentary blows the lid off suspected Sandy Hook coverup.

2341
02:51:56,755 --> 02:52:14,305
The article includes this, which sounds pretty laudatory a loose coalition of concerned citizen journalists known as the Independent Media Solidarity have produced an indepth, well researched documentary regarding the countless anomalies inconsistencies and discrepancies evident in the Sandy Hook School shooting investigation.

2342
02:52:14,440 --> 02:52:23,830
The video is a tellall, leave no stone, unturned work that coalesces hundreds of data points, which researchers laboriously spent countless hours compiling.

2343
02:52:23,965 --> 02:52:27,110
That certainly sounds like what you might write if the video was too long.

2344
02:52:27,142 --> 02:52:31,640
You couldn't even make it through the whole thing, and you can't even really nail down what the point of it was.

2345
02:52:31,807 --> 02:52:39,760
Also, the article includes this update a previous version of this video was removed from YouTube due to a copyright claim by Lenny Posner.

2346
02:52:39,880 --> 02:52:45,250
Posner is reportedly the parent of one of the children supposedly killed at Sandy Hook.

2347
02:52:45,400 --> 02:52:48,190
Reportedly and supposedly both in that sentence.

2348
02:52:48,220 --> 02:52:49,187
It's pretty over.

2349
02:52:49,625 --> 02:52:50,285
Go fuck you.

2350
02:52:50,317 --> 02:52:50,960
Wow.

2351
02:52:51,142 --> 02:52:54,805
If that's the article that dawn wrote, makes himself look quite a bit worse.

2352
02:52:54,865 --> 02:52:55,490
Yes.

2353
02:52:55,657 --> 02:53:00,385
Man, he should have watched the last ten minutes of that documentary, because they go, Hahahaha.

2354
02:53:00,505 --> 02:53:01,205
Fooled you.

2355
02:53:01,252 --> 02:53:03,445
And then we were just doing this to fuck with Rob Jacob.

2356
02:53:03,460 --> 02:53:05,400
Yeah, this is all the fuck with Rob.

2357
02:53:06,500 --> 02:53:15,095
So Maddie is done with his questioning, and unlike some of the other depositions here, at the end, the defense lawyer asks a couple questions.

2358
02:53:15,247 --> 02:53:20,860
And so the first one has to do with that only using table eight of the FBI.

2359
02:53:20,905 --> 02:53:22,200
Let's hear the stats.

2360
02:53:22,775 --> 02:53:33,475
There were some questions about this table eight at the time you reviewed table eight back in 2014.

2361
02:53:33,550 --> 02:53:43,690
Did you have any reason to doubt that the number for Newtown as zero was accurate? That's bullshit.

2362
02:53:43,795 --> 02:53:52,975
Adon absolutely had reason to question the interpretation of the table given here because the rest of the world was saying that these kids did in fact, die.

2363
02:53:53,125 --> 02:53:59,150
There is a direct contradiction here, and any curious person would see that table, and it wouldn't even really be a choice to question things.

2364
02:53:59,212 --> 02:54:00,655
It would just be a reaction.

2365
02:54:00,790 --> 02:54:22,280
You'd start asking yourself things like, how is this possible? Is there information I'm missing? What's the context here? Is it possible for both this table to be accurate and the shooting happened as was reported? The not questioning is actually a choice Adan is making, and he does that because if he scratched even an inch below the surface, he couldn't make the insane claims that he does make for a living.

2366
02:54:22,402 --> 02:54:28,810
He's woefully unqualified, and doesn't have the tools to be in the role he pretends to be in, which is that of a writer and reporter.

2367
02:54:28,855 --> 02:54:42,310
Yeah, that ability to turn off the instinct to question things when something conforms to your narrative while simultaneously yelling at your audience about how you're the people who question things, that ability actually makes him perfectly qualified to be an in house liar at Infowars.

2368
02:54:42,355 --> 02:54:42,830
Yeah.

2369
02:54:42,952 --> 02:54:46,855
So he better hope they don't go out of business, because there's not many other games in town.

2370
02:54:46,915 --> 02:54:49,805
Yeah, that's the way no, but they don't pay well.

2371
02:54:49,852 --> 02:54:54,110
No, see, the problem is, all right, I just misread it.

2372
02:54:54,142 --> 02:54:56,060
I didn't know it was table eight.

2373
02:54:56,167 --> 02:55:00,770
I thought it was table infinity, so, of course I didn't think there were one through seven.

2374
02:55:00,847 --> 02:55:02,330
This is all the tables? Yes.

2375
02:55:02,377 --> 02:55:04,765
I didn't think there were imaginary number tables.

2376
02:55:04,795 --> 02:55:05,030
Yeah.

2377
02:55:05,077 --> 02:55:05,705
Come on, man.

2378
02:55:05,752 --> 02:55:06,760
So here's the last clip.

2379
02:55:06,805 --> 02:55:12,895
The defense lawyer also has a question about his research that he did about the qualifications presented by Wolfgang Halbert.

2380
02:55:12,910 --> 02:55:13,940
Let's hear this.

2381
02:55:14,107 --> 02:55:15,200
Switching over to Mr.

2382
02:55:15,262 --> 02:55:19,570
How big? You don't have to have that open anymore.

2383
02:55:19,735 --> 02:55:26,080
There was some discussion of an email you received questioning his credentials.

2384
02:55:26,140 --> 02:55:30,212
Do you recall that? Yes, I recall it.

2385
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:34,880
Now, when you first wrote about Mr.

2386
02:55:34,927 --> 02:55:43,115
How Big, you referenced one website, but was that necessarily the entirety of your research? I can't recall how much research I did.

2387
02:55:43,132 --> 02:55:50,762
I know that one website did probably provide a majority of the credentials that I credited him.

2388
02:55:52,700 --> 02:56:04,862
Is it possible you could have come across, say, Orlando Sentinel articles from the 90s referring to him as a director of security for seminal schools? Entirely possible, sir.

2389
02:56:05,375 --> 02:56:13,300
Could you come across articles in the La times mentioning him in the late 90s, early 2000s? Objection.

2390
02:56:13,450 --> 02:56:14,615
It's possible, sir.

2391
02:56:14,707 --> 02:56:16,375
This is fishy.

2392
02:56:16,450 --> 02:56:19,385
Oh, man, I love it.

2393
02:56:19,417 --> 02:56:23,312
Is it possible that you could testify better? Here, use this.

2394
02:56:24,125 --> 02:56:24,887
Okay.

2395
02:56:25,325 --> 02:56:26,510
Excuse me.

2396
02:56:26,692 --> 02:56:27,895
My own witness.

2397
02:56:27,985 --> 02:56:31,550
Could you do a better job? Let me give you an up.

2398
02:56:31,612 --> 02:56:31,970
Yes.

2399
02:56:32,047 --> 02:56:32,825
Jesus Christ.

2400
02:56:32,887 --> 02:56:34,520
It would be a better answer for you.

2401
02:56:34,597 --> 02:56:35,015
Wow.

2402
02:56:35,107 --> 02:56:35,765
Yeah.

2403
02:56:35,932 --> 02:56:39,260
If you had prepared for that, then you would have had that in the can.

2404
02:56:39,367 --> 02:56:40,040
Maybe.

2405
02:56:40,207 --> 02:56:43,145
If your lawyer knows that, then you should know that.

2406
02:56:43,297 --> 02:56:44,612
Oh, you'd hope.

2407
02:56:44,975 --> 02:56:48,920
Why is this hard? I feel like this is not that hard.

2408
02:56:48,997 --> 02:56:49,685
Yeah.

2409
02:56:49,867 --> 02:56:54,025
So we reached the end of this deposition of Adam Salazar.

2410
02:56:54,100 --> 02:57:04,040
And like I said, this peeled away a bit of the mystique around him and sort of, I don't know, a sense of menace that I felt about his body of work.

2411
02:57:04,132 --> 02:57:07,100
Certainly, I think he's defanged a little bit in my mind.

2412
02:57:07,162 --> 02:57:07,787
Yeah.

2413
02:57:08,525 --> 02:57:14,215
If the wizard of Oz was revealed to be a puddle of mayonnaise, that could handle a lever.

2414
02:57:14,395 --> 02:57:15,137
Yeah.

2415
02:57:16,025 --> 02:57:20,540
Maybe part of it was just because he was the one who was following us and then stopped following us.

2416
02:57:20,557 --> 02:57:23,250
Maybe that is kind of part of the menace.

2417
02:57:24,350 --> 02:57:37,705
Whatever the case, I feel like the way he answers questions, the way this is all processed, is very sad, transparent, and, I think unnecessary.

2418
02:57:37,765 --> 02:57:39,200
He didn't have to answer any of these questions.

2419
02:57:39,262 --> 02:57:39,800
No way.

2420
02:57:39,862 --> 02:57:40,255
Nope.

2421
02:57:40,315 --> 02:57:40,885
Nope.

2422
02:57:41,005 --> 02:57:44,225
He clearly has an interest in the company.

2423
02:57:44,287 --> 02:57:45,737
Like he's a company guy.

2424
02:57:47,900 --> 02:57:50,185
I think we covered his deposition.

2425
02:57:50,305 --> 02:57:50,810
Certainly.

2426
02:57:50,917 --> 02:57:55,915
I hate paul Joseph Watson, but we weren't as cruel about that because he comported himself decently.

2427
02:57:56,020 --> 02:57:56,687
Yeah.

2428
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:12,975
There is obviously more actions that Adam Salazar took in the past that are relevant to this case and that is unique for his position as some being deposed.

2429
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:21,830
But there is such a refusal to accept reality and the like, no, I wasn't making a point.

2430
02:58:21,877 --> 02:58:23,065
It's just a weird coincidence.

2431
02:58:23,095 --> 02:58:24,140
Stop it, stop it.

2432
02:58:24,157 --> 02:58:26,687
Like, that stuff is a come on, man, you're a child.

2433
02:58:27,125 --> 02:58:29,305
It makes you lose a little bit of respect.

2434
02:58:29,365 --> 02:58:34,835
Even as a villain in my mind, you can't just be like, yeah, this is what I was thinking at the time.

2435
02:58:34,867 --> 02:58:37,430
I found out I was wrong and whatever right.

2436
02:58:37,477 --> 02:58:43,940
There's a way to do this that isn't completely disqualifying and he failed to know it is.

2437
02:58:43,957 --> 02:58:46,115
Like he was trying to half lie about everything.

2438
02:58:46,207 --> 02:58:48,995
Like, I'm going to try and obfuscate just enough.

2439
02:58:49,072 --> 02:58:57,137
Like, yeah, I'll say yes or no, but whenever they want to get me on something, I'll be like, I don't recall, or something like that.

2440
02:58:58,025 --> 02:59:05,890
Revelations of like it was my vested interest in questioning the reality of Sandy Hook had to do with my fear of them using it against the guns.

2441
02:59:06,070 --> 02:59:09,095
There's stuff like that that's just like, damn, you can't be real.

2442
02:59:09,172 --> 02:59:15,440
How can you be so slippery about a bunch of these other things and then just give that one give it away.

2443
02:59:15,532 --> 02:59:16,625
Give it all away.

2444
02:59:16,762 --> 02:59:17,500
Very weird.

2445
02:59:17,575 --> 02:59:18,220
Wild.

2446
02:59:18,385 --> 02:59:21,830
Anyway, we have a bit more where this came from.

2447
02:59:21,877 --> 02:59:22,190
Oh, yeah.

2448
02:59:22,207 --> 02:59:26,690
There's more deposition that will be coming up in the future because that's bottom feeders we got to do.

2449
02:59:26,782 --> 02:59:35,530
We love feeding on the bottom immediately after being called a bottom feeder to then talk about a Donadar Salazar.

2450
02:59:35,590 --> 02:59:38,870
It doesn't make me feel great, but there are worse things.

2451
02:59:38,947 --> 02:59:39,587
Sure.

2452
02:59:40,475 --> 02:59:45,650
Anyway, I mean, we'll be back with another episode in the near future.

2453
02:59:45,712 --> 02:59:46,180
Indeed.

2454
02:59:46,240 --> 02:59:47,525
But until then, we have a website.

2455
02:59:47,587 --> 02:59:49,055
We do it's knowledgefight.com.

2456
02:59:49,102 --> 02:59:49,795
We're also on Twitter.

2457
02:59:49,810 --> 02:59:54,685
We are on Twitter at that knowledge of the score fight and someone's been fighting.

2458
02:59:54,730 --> 02:59:59,585
No, we'll be back.

2459
02:59:59,617 --> 03:00:01,105
But until then, I'm neo.

2460
03:00:01,165 --> 03:00:01,735
I'm Leo.

2461
03:00:01,780 --> 03:00:03,385
I'm dzx Clark.

2462
03:00:03,505 --> 03:00:09,900
I run a cooperative in my brain where people are free to squat.

2463
03:00:10,925 --> 03:00:12,955
It's an artist's spaceship.

2464
03:00:13,090 --> 03:00:17,860
This is not really so much a thing where a charge rent barter is acceptable.

2465
03:00:17,905 --> 03:00:21,812
Right? I don't know what I'm saying.

2466
03:00:22,250 --> 03:00:24,145
Here comes the sex robots.

2467
03:00:24,235 --> 03:00:25,685
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

2468
03:00:25,717 --> 03:00:26,700
Thanks for holding.

2469
03:00:28,100 --> 03:00:30,640
So, Alex, I'm a person calling in my a huge fan.

2470
03:00:30,670 --> 03:00:31,430
I love your work.

2471
03:00:31,477 --> 03:00:31,812
I love you.
