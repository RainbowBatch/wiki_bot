00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:17,920
Taunting somebody opening tones

3
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,944
I don't know what it was

4
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,112
Indeed we are.

00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:38,400
Today

7
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,472
I usually come up with a question

8
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,288
Right off the top of my head

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
I usually like to dig dig out of a ditch with your question

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,040
To ask myself

11
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,856

To the topic at hand

21
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
Which will explain

22
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
Thank you to couple people

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,672

You're now Apollo

25
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,472
I don't think we did that

26
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,104
Anyway most questions

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
I don't remember what we were talking about 5 minutes ago

28
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,832
I'm a policy wonk

29
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,880

Start until you're brilliant someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

39
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584

00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
I hear you got a podcast about UFOs

56
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,328
That's pretty that's pretty fun

57
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
Send me a message

58
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288

Underwater base

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
No it's not underwater the Dulce base oh yeah that's how it is

61
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
New Mexico

62
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,832
Delfina explores

63
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:16,256
Hey Bruce knows about that UFOs

64
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Selective

65
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
Third letter of the alphabet

66
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
Oh I see what you're saying

67
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
It's been polished

68
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
Too much

69
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,847
God bless you

70
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
I hope all is well

71
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:38,783
We are getting into this time travel episode request

72
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
I would say

73
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
Back to step

74
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
10 / 20

75
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
5th 2011

76
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
It's always a fun game

77
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
Try and figure out if

78
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
If you have any idea

79
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
Might be that someone would send me back to

80
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,727
Okay so this is 925 11

81
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
Correct

82
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Y9 1111

83
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,455
The 10-year anniversary never forget two weeks

84
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
Years to weeks

85
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
Street

86
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,727
Things to say about Occupy Wall Street

87
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
The dis

88
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,567
Coming in I had no I've no idea

89
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,639
According to their own website Occupy Wall Street

90
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,479
Quota people-powered movement Spire by popular uprisings in

91
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Egypt and Tunisia

92
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
It aims to fight back

93
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,599
The richest 1% of the world that are

94
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,671
Of an unfair global economy that is foreclosing on our feet

95
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
Based on that

96
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
Alex Jones to be against

97
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,815
Since the uprising is in

98
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
Neither were globalist false-flag uprising

99
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,191
So that this is just another one

100
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
On the other hand

101
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,055
Well Occupy Wall Street was the Federal Reserve

102
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
It definitely had the

103
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
Appearance of being a

104
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
Community of people who could be red

105
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
Build by the info Warriors

106
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
And become them

107
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Themselves

108
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,271
So maybe Alex

109
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
Since it could serve as a pipeline to him

110
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
On the other hand

111
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
The beginnings of Occupy Wall Street Grado publication

112
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Adbuster

113
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
Which is definitely anti-consumerist

114
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
A pretty certainly

115
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Anti-capitalist

116
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
So that seems like

117
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,959
This is so infuriating when you know the answer of what

118
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,359
Is going to happen in this episode

119
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,407
Possible for Alex

120
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
On the side of the people

121
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
Good feels like you would have to

122
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
Occupy Wall Street

123
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
Against his principles

124
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
Weekly ignore it so he doesn't

125
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
I have to side with the

126
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
Are we doing

127
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,959
They were literally protesting Bank malfeasance and that's one of them

128
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
But primary branch

129
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:13,663
December to same time ignore the part that what the protests that are diametrically opposed to his world

130
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,247
You truly have a gift for Ryan's boyfriend

131
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:22,367
Does Delta protest good for that proposed to his worldview it's really important stuff

132
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Redistribution

133
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Come forgiveness

134
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
That putting restrictions or limitations on Bank

135
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
Putting restrictions on excessive

136
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,559
Executive

137
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
Substation all these things

138
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
Evil goals of the globalist

139
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,311
A+ Michael Moore was in Fault

140
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
What I'm getting at

141
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
What I'm getting at

142
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
That

143
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:53,599
Proposed episode

144
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,903
I have literally no idea what I was going to fight

145
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,487
Any slot on the roulette wheel

146
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,071
In choosing a specific date to go back to I decided to choose the temperature

147
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
25th 2011

148
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
I chose the date because they'll Occupy Wall Street

149
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
Began on September 17th

150
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
I thought it was

151
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,799
Probably likely that Alex would be slow to hear about it or talk about it

152
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
Cuz that seems to be his friend

153
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:20,479
Somali pirates

154
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,295
September 24th at least 80 protesters were arrested

155
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
Police roughing up protesters

156
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Who are peaceful

157
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:32,511
Corralling them with a large net and a video of Officer Anthony bologna

158
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Female protest

159
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,863
I felt if there was any day that was going to be the day that Alex

160
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,191
Talk about Occupy Wall Street as a positive or the negative

161
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
This was going to be the day

162
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
That he was trigger

163
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
Then so we jumping

164
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
On

165
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,919
25th of September

166
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
It's not

167
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
I don't actually know like

168
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
You you're pretending that I know a lot even though I know what the

169
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Clips are going to be in all that

170
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
I don't really know that much

171
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
We don't know where you actually Lance

172
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
It's it's

173
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
We'll get to it

174
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,535
It's hard to say exactly conflicted

175
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,351
I'm going to tell you ahead of time like this is probably going to

176
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
To be one of these like

177
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
Preludes of things to come

178
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
IFixit Occupy Wall Street

179
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,287
The entire span is where I'm going after

180
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
2009

181
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,847
Yeah

182
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Of my fill

183
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,503
Of Alakazam

184
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,599
For me once I get a handle on the Soros stuff all that stuff in 2009

185
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
I believe that looking at the entirety

186
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Positions on it

187
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,303
I think it'll be that would be a

188
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,399
Fitting next investigation we get here

189
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
Sweet at all

190
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Just know

191
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
I know what

192
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
Coming in the clips

193
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
But I don't

194
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:55,199
I don't know big picture what's going on

195
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
Subway

196
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
So he has a Sunday show

197
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
It's only a two-hour

198
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
I thought that would be

199
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,951
Be better

200
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,535
Bored

201
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303

Add

205
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
It seems

206
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
Very possible

207
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Sunday episode

208
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031

Restart with Alex

212
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Bragging

213
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
Infowars.com

214
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,839
Thank you so much for joining us

215
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,167
Infowar

216
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,687
Cool you know what the only thing that I get whenever I hear that kind of beginning

217
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,991
When he's like number one on global shirt

218
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
And stuff like that

219
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,295
Remember When

220
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,879
The Academy Award

221
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
No

222
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:14,303
Next song

223
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Doe Boy Fresh

224
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Estate

225
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,543
Yes that's the way you

226
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,127
It doesn't sound like

227
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Chamillionaire

228
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
How long is Chamillionaire been around

229
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,159
It's just a Being John Malkovich

230
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,719
Rip they just

231
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,815
Okay people going into the little duck

232
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
They're just like doing a music video

233
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:55,775
Keeps flashing

234
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Video

235
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
The reason I bring it up is the song starts with

236
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
Academy Award winner

237
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,319
But they were hyping up that they won the Academy Award yeah you're really not telling me on this song

238
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Or this album

239
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,951
Or Three 6 Mafia at all the next angle they had after

240
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
It starts with

241
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
36B

242
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
Number one ringtone

243
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
Of the Bragg

244
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
Put the song

245
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,383
In that era consistently open with them bragging about something you want to hang out

246
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,967
Three 6 Mafia syrup

247
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Yeah

248
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,879
Give me Schoolboy Q

249
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
So

250
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
I thought that was funny but it's just kind of like

251
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
Standard doesn't tell us anything

252
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Think about what's going on

253
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
So

254
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
Chamillionaire

255
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
Turn on chameleon

256
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Yeah

257
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
It is yes

258
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Okay

259
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
And Billy Gunn

260
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,151
I was I just wasn't sure what do or like was his name

261
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
I like

262
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,503
Hammer something like that you know like

263
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,039
It starts hbh

264
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Chameleon end

265
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
Chipotle

266
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,655
Anyway that opening doesn't tell us that much

267
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
His career

268
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,967
But I don't know what he's been up to

269
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,551
Who knows what's going to happen

270
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
There's a lot of like in 2014

271
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,671
He had different waypoints that were used

272
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
And I was expecting

273
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
Find

274
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Different Waypoint

275
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
September 2011

276
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Alex Jones

277
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Really into

278
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Party

279
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,055
Obviously we got an information overload here

280
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,967
Are horses owned by the people

281
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
In the arena

282
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,743
Agreement obituaries

283
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,151
Our constitution

284
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
Are they

285
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,783
The Republican debate

286
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,343
And the Tea Party is destroying

287
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,671
He is now taking ownership of the

288
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
The Tea Party by the

289
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
Easter 2019

290
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
People first

291
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,471
So it's some point

292
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Between these two points

293
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Time

294
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Keys

295
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
Accepted that like

296
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
I can

297
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
I can

298
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Associate

299
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,759
And of course he's super into Ron Paul

300
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
No surprises

301
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,903
This is also in the lead-up to the 2012 elections or Ron Paul's running

302
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
You know like

303
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
So true

304
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
Alexander the end game.

305
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
He's been a long time

306
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,823
Unfortunately I should tell you that Alex's

307
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Rick Perry

308
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
And sometimes the homophobic

309
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,783
Also got to take out politically

310
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,879
Is just as bad or worse and that's MIT

311
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Twinkle Toes

312
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Tommy

313
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,839
The fact that he's from Michigan from Texas

314
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
And

315
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
Okay

316
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,335
Cheerleader

317
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,175
Isabel cheerleader

318
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,623
Really

319
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Not the Twinkle Toes

320
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,583
Hey hey come on who is it wasn't

321
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,703
That was station that was given to avatar The Last Airbender

322
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
Text matters

323
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
Gave him the nickname

324
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,359
Context Matthews in Airbender

325
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:53,247
Alright I assumed that Alex Jones is describing both Rick Perry and

326
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,599
Mitt Romney's Airbenders

327
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,903
The Firebender wasn't pillow biter

328
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:09,119
Okay more about the laser

329
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
How does it relate to

330
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Dune

331
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,335
Avatar The Last Airbender

332
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,527
In much the same way

333
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
Goodbye

334
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
Episode

335
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
Be about something

336
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
I am about the Somali pirates out of nowhere

337
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:39,327
The same way I'm expecting to hear something about Occupy Wall Street or I'm expecting Alex

338
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Keep talking

339
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,959
About Ron Paul

340
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
People are waking up

341
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
The game

342
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:02,367
Listen to the who songs

343
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,999
Zipless music

344
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
But finally

345
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:29,759
That's what I'm talkin point of his stock in 2009

346
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,879
He just goes on a TED talk about

347
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Man

348
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,231
Look and you know what

349
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
This is one thing I'm not going to Folsom

350
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,887
All right it is a lot to put out for hours of content

351
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
No totally

352
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
So I guess

353
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:54,335
Yeah you're driving to work whatever it was you thought you were going to talk about that day isn't you're not getting it up

354
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Forever whatever reason

355
00:18:56,127 --> 00:19:02,271
It's just like I who song Baba O'Riley this here you go

356
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
You fill your time with what you got to do

357
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
I guess but

358
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
But that's what shock jock

359
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
That's what like

360
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
He lives in the world of high-stakes

361
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,143
Espionage and governments

362
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,751
He insists on doing like 20 minutes on importance of Won't Get Fooled Again

363
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
It's crazy

364
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,127
Like to the point where it is next cook it starts with him reminding people

365
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,039
They are bring up who are you

366
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,839
I should put a clip of this song

367
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,239
I love that

368
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,135
Soccer

369
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
On television

370
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,439
Doesn't shoot video

371
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
It's a side issue on a side issue

372
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,399
Okay so if I understand correctly

373
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
The train of thought is

374
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,543
The I got to remind you who is the who is

375
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,175
Band from rabbi

376
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:12,575
That's correct water 84 Hap's the most famous rock bands of all time

377
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,976
You are on this planet and you have not heard of who song

378
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
In the top

379
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
50

380
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,816
Rock songs of all time

381
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
Probably have

382
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
No no

383
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,312

00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,432
Wizard

385
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:48,160
Oh get real aggressive and then you ran out of gas slick

386
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,768
Quadrophenia

387
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
Like they're kind of a big deal

388
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:05,568
Let me remind you my Target demographic

389
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,456
Let's start there

390
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Next.

391
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,832
Now that I've reminded you who is I'm going to bring up

392
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,488
Unrelated Personnel for Robert produces ran into Robert Plant watches

393
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:28,608
You should have your Adderall this morning

394
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
Conversation

395
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:34,496
Secondary revelation.

396
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Pick up on

397
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,104
But I think it's actually super important

398
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
No

399
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
This point

400
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
2011

401
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,736
His producers

402
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,528
That's truly a Papal

403
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
He hates those companies

404
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
Kia use using

405
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
Products

406
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
Another producer

407
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,328
He couldn't have cared about those like an apple narratives back then

408
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
New Edition to it

409
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:08,032
When was Samsung

410
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Bent

411
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
I'm sure he's still

412
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
Uses Apple products

413
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Monster

414
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
Who cares

415
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
He prefers Simplicity over

416
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:22,368
Well how many holistic healers have we had on the show always tell a story where they like

417
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
And I had to go to the doctor

418
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
What time are you like

419
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,792
Alex

420
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,864
Dramatic reading of lyrics of

421
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,936
Make a claim

422
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
What is not true

423
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:43,872
Constitution take a bow for the new Revolution

424
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:52,320
No no

425
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,624
By the way I can confirm from Bugs

426
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,008
Whatever

427
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,824
Pete Townsend the guy who wrote all the songs

428
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,152
The album that won't exist

429
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,064
Music has always suffered from being tied to any kind of political or social even spiritual or religious connect

430
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,672
I suppose the who were rebellious and I for a while we were

431
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
Tubi

432
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
But that wasn't really

433
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,304
I think we're just reflecting what was going on around us

434
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
So

435
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:42,496
Also Won't Get Fooled Again with originally written to be a part of the who's scrapped sci-fi rock opera Lifehouse

436
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,568
They realize they should just let Tommy stand

437
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
So they abandoned Lifehouse

438
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,896
Put the song on the album who's next

439
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,224
Also the song wasn't really even about the real world

440
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,784
It Was Written was that rock opera

441
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
And when you actually look at the lyrics

442
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
The kind of inspire app

443
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Together Poster Revolution

444
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,720
Criticism

445
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,584
My criticism has described the song as one

446
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,936
B creams Defiance at those who feel any causes better than no car

447
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,776
Rallying cry to

448
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
Have no position

449
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,640
Like defending your right to remain silent

450
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,688
In the face

451
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
Is there a lion

452
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
Probable

453
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,904
Prog rock opera

454
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,256
It was setting the dystopian time when rock and roll was gone people repressed

455
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:42,656
I'm giving Bland entertainment people kept a secret knowledge

456
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
Rock secret but alive prog rock

457
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
70th cocaine obvious

458
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,432
Wehelp 12

459
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
Tons of other concept album

460
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,272
Deltron 3030

461
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,856
Alex could not be more wrong about the who

462
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,952
Art School weirdos revolutionary sentiment

463
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,256
Even as it relates to this very song

464
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,328
The song revolutionary

465
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
But that was never the interest

466
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
They were

467
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
Largely

468
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
Just like

469
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,776
And you can see it in

470
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
Career like

471
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,384
He's gotten more involved in like the Philharmonic

472
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
It's crazy

473
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,552
Electric

474
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:36,928
I do too I do have you ever heard of

475
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
I've not

476
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,048
Maybe

477
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,328
I will say that I like

478
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
Concept album

479
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,704
Perfect

480
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
Immersive

481
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
Experience of like this album.

482
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Me a story

483
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Along with music

484
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:59,968
It's great but have a really boring conversation

485
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
Certainly do

486
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,320
Tire rack

487
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:08,672
You know he's doing his misguided Ted Talk About The Who

488
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
On some level

489
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,024
Well it's only because it's not interest

490
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
Is that make sense

491
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,632
It's out of place is weird

492
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,704
It takes up a large chunk of the show

493
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,288
At least 15-20 minutes song

494
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
That has been out for good

495
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:32,736
Thirtysomething

496
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:39,136
Like 90s hip-hop from St Louis and the surrounding

497
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:45,792
Let me know about the members of

498
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,376
I know I I know the city Spud was in prison

499
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:56,032
I get it that's why the first album was called free second album was called City free

500
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:02,432
I understand I know about aliens

501
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
Lead

502
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
Zeppelin

503
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,296
Freak out no idea

504
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,392
Holy s*** you don't even know that there's a California hotel

505
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,672
That you cannot

506
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
Was worried you get any

507
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
Oh I was also worried

508
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,448
It's just nuts.

509
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
Why waste your time

510
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:33,152
You're in the middle of like trying to defend Ron Paul about like why he's running for president

511
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
Wall Street happening

512
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
That should be either

513
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,528
Summon your super into or super again

514
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,576
Yet you've got to dissect

515
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
The goddamn

516
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,672
Although on the other hand perhaps it makes even

517
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,208
More sense

518
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,048
He's is Ron Paul and Occupy Wall Street

519
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,888
What song could be more fitting than apathy from

520
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,728
Lyrics because

521
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:04,128
Wall Street

522
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,944
We Won't Get Fooled Again

523
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:13,600
Perhaps putting off having

524
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
That makes more sense

525
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
Good bit of time about that

526
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
Commercial

527
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,400
Commercial that I've never heard before

528
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
It's one of these rare in

529
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
Lake

530
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
Messed up,

531
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
Doing the voiceover

532
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,296
Commercials that he's done

533
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
For like

534
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
The Israeli

535
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
Tourism Bureau

536
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,184
Right those are packaged commercials that are sent over and

537
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
Please play DMX money off it

538
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,792
This one he's doing the voiceover for

539
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,400
I'm here to tell you today that

540
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,728
Modest Proposal

541
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,568
There is a new food company out there Revolution

542
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,200
What if what if what if

543
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,760
What if he got onboard of soylent real early

544
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,600
Not breathe it's not free

545
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,392
Eltingville

546
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,472
My ear really weird because

547
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
First of all I found

548
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
3 kg

549
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,104
Haha, specifics to be lacking

550
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
Figure out what

551
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:43,200
For the one I found out

552
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
Alex

553
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
Did the voiceover for it

554
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,184
A very wealthy USA 2011

555
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,384
The crazy part is

556
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,584
I can't stress this enough

557
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,992
URL for time

558
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,064
Also it's not

559
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,464
The only thing that

560
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
The call to action

561
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,400
Should be towards the action you want

562
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
As opposed to call to action which makes me want to go

563
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:15,616
Well what the f***** up with end of America one.com right I can't go

564
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:22,016
Return of the Jedi

565
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,368
Is the work of a guy named Porter Stansberry

566
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:32,768
Which Alex is very keen to not say his name in the commercial very wealthy American is

567
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
That's Porter Stansberry

568
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,376
The f****** con man

569
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,192
Alex is not just running a commercial for him he did the

570
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,008
The voiceover for it and he plays it four times

571
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
During this two-hour episode

572
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
He's pushing

573
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
Or at least

574
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
He's getting a lot of money

575
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,944
Which

576
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,528
Is a fraud in the reign of most of Alex's gas

577
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
He spreads fear of append

578
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:00,928
Collapse advises people to subscribe

579
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
And also advise them

580
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
His credibility was based on the

581
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
The claim that he has

582
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
Do you predicted the collapse

583
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

584
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:14,240
Problem is that the only evidence of this prediction is him saying that he predicted it after the fact

585
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,056
In a funny turn of the best prediction

586
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Stripped

587
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:25,248
Was fellow Alex Jones Peter Schiff

588
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
Who stuck his newsletters

589
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:34,208
2006/2007

590
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,608
To the woodshed

591
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,704
Another man's car

592
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,056
Respect Peter Schiff a little more not much but a little

593
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,640
There's a conman high Council that got together and sensor

594
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
Peter Schiff

595
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,712
And there's also a possibility that like

596
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
He was working against

597
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
Peter Schiff scam

598
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,064
So maybe there wasn't

599
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
Yeah maybe like a

600
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:06,464
Cut it off at the pass

601
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,000
Newsletters

602
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
Advocating for

603
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,840
Where you buy your gold and silver from

604
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,544
Enjoyed seeing these Alex Jones podcast

605
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
Supporters

606
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,872
8645

607
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,224
It does prove that they can research

608
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,064
Did you spend two years

609
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,112
Looking at this guy shift and then

610
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,160
Real world information

611
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,208
Just emphasized whether or not it was

612
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
Valuable

613
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
Have you thought about doing that before

614
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,120
Did you spend that time in

615
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
Instead of research

616
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
Sing the truth

617
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,008
So

618
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
Like

619
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,872
Operation going

620
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,944
And we would have passed out long ago

621
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
But instead

622
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:08,672
In 2003 the SEC filed a case against Porter Stansberry for sale

623
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
Direction to subscribers

624
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,888
An investigation found that he just made up the source

625
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:22,752
In 2070 was sentenced to pay $1000000 in restitution to the people

626
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
Frauded

627
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,568
He tried to pull a First Amendment argue

628
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,968
But the court rejected conduct undoubtedly involved deliberate fraud

629
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
False

630
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,296
The sentence was upheld by the force

631
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
Circuit Court

632
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,672
And the Supreme Court refused to hear the case because why would you

633
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:45,280
The episode that we're listening to 2011

634
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,864
Years after Stansbury was charged with intentional fraud

635
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:53,472
Here Alex is doing the voiceover for the commercials for his new fraud

636
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,592
Alex has no

637
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,432
Fucken moral compass

638
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
Didn't know that

639
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,040
You didn't even need the definition of the word on

640
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,600
Unscrupulous

641
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:14,720
It's not like the idea why you even words to describe unscrupulous

642
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:20,352
Tell that story 11 and stay like

643
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,144
2005 3006

644
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,728
Before he was charged by the

645
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:32,128
Prodigy

646
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,760
It's too good

647
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:43,136
Camfrog

648
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:48,000
I always like to check in where is monetary resources are coming from

649
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,584
Great to find out the 2011

650
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
No more ethical than the other point

651
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
Little bit

652
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
Beyond wanting to talk about

653
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:03,616
Who Alex mostly into Ron Paul today

654
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
F****** super in

655
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,624
Why are you saying

656
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,720
When's unfortunately

657
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,560
Why do you guys keep insisting he can win

658
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
Ron Paul

659
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,640
In a row

660
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,688
That is a Republican

661
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,760
Real Republican

662
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,088
Now this is a misrepresentation

663
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,720
Because I don't know if you remember this during the Republican iridal this one

664
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
Mitt Romney

665
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,328
Announced ahead of time that he was skipping straw-poll

666
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
He did not

667
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
Engage at all

668
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,704
His campaign

669
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,520
We are only focusing on caucuses and primaries

670
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
Lee straw polls

671
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,360
It it will be a waste of our resources

672
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Sew-in

673
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
The first

674
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
What came out

675
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
Mitt Romney was

676
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,296
Because you put no effort into

677
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
No effort into

678
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,696
Involved in the process of it at all

679
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Incredibly

680
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
False hope

681
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,536
That Ron Paul had the goods

682
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
Go the Distance

683
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
Any f******

684
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
These these

685
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
Indications of

686
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,008
In terms of his defensive

687
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
And if you know anything

688
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,592
Think about what was going on you would know that that

689
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Is a

690
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
I don't know what is

691
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
Hollow victory

692
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Yes.

693
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
Yeah exactly

694
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
Cubeatz

695
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
I hope you

696
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,072
Orthoscopic straw-poll

697
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,376
The primaries that started happening

698
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
Admit Rami just started

699
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Could be

700
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
And the toy

701
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
Arizona 2012

702
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,432
Sure they were all like

703
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:20,832
There's a black president so obviously people

704
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
I hate black people

705
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Platform

706
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,232
Let's pickle I got a Mitt Romney

707
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,840
It wasn't until Trump really show them that you can let your race

708
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:35,424
Six Flags fly that they realize that a run pulp

709
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,496
You could be elect

710
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:44,896
Did now before they probably couldn't afford

711
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:51,040
Galvanized

712
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:03,328
A big gun for recessed we would have had a one-term Obama

713
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,096
Newsletters

714
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Stuff like that

715
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
You might have seen

716
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
Acceleration

717
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
And where we ended up for you

718
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Years later exactly

719
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:19,200
Just sort of a broadside into reality TV show old man

720
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,736
Boring

721
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
Order

722
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
Yes and also his brother

723
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,672
Free People

724
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,000
He thinks the three

725
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
So it's just all wrong

726
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
Paul defense

727
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,168
There's a lot of cut out cuz

728
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,704
Straight dogs

729
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,008
Justin Bieber

730
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,056
I don't need to hear that honey

731
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,384
We will hear a little bit more of it later but before we do

732
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,920
We got to check in with

733
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,968
What Alex thinks about The Highwaymen

734
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,832
Does he want to sing along with me 2011

735
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,672
Year are we not going to find out how he feels about the highwomen

736
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:08,096
Just plays all right along with it

737
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,768
Not bad

738
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,424
Two terms of his Impressions that's not bad currently

739
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,216
Easily his best impression

740
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:52,640
That's a good impression of this depression apparel

741
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:59,039
Exactly still better than his impression of

742
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,343
Show me information

743
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
Anyway

744
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
Like I said

745
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,975
Most of the show is about

746
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,767
Defensiveness about Ron Paul

747
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,303
And if next

748
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,167
Elementary

749
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,727
It makes my head spin sometimes

750
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,359
In every

751
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,663
100

752
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,199
And Hunter Johnson

753
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,599
Who wins all the spontaneous

754
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:45,375
Double double

755
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,751
Formula 1 racing

756
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
And

757
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,111
And their car is picking up steam running Gray

758
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,207
That's the

759
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,023
For the Jack Daniel's car whatever it is

760
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,559
For the Chevy car

761
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,935
I think I'm more at one of those three can make a car

762
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,287
You're more apt metaphor would be like

763
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,079
Okay so you're doing this race

764
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,359
The guy who has the

765
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
Best Buy

766
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
Lakeway fast

767
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,431
Her car wasn't

768
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,967
The first two laps

769
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,295
Do you know your car is going fine

770
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,463
Running out of it doesn't have any more boosters on it doesn't

771
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,279
And so what you got here

772
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
You're doing fine

773
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,703
You're you're going around the course but the guy who has the much better faster sleeker car

774
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,031
It was better at driving is now in the race

775
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,103
He's gaining on you

776
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,431
But his Rockets

777
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,015
Yeah so there's a legitimate way to look at it

778
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,039
He's in third then

779
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,599
That's a great position for him to be in

780
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,623
At any point

781
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
But he's only in Thursday

782
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Because Mitt Romney

783
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Is game

784
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
I remember this

785
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,583
No one no one

786
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,679
Conversation

787
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,215
A tiny piece

788
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,751
But no one really believe

789
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,287
It was

790
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:34,687
Mixture of

791
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,711
After anal sex

792
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
That was that

793
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
I just

794
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
I think his metaphors are

795
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,463
Keesler not dealing with reality

796
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,487
He's

797
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,255
Fetishizing

798
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,791
The idea of a volcano

799
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
Court

800
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:58,495
To be expected

801
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:02,335
It's interesting to see that there's so much going on in the world like

802
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
Legitimately

803
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,663
The day before

804
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,479
80 people who were peaceful protesters

805
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
Were arrested

806
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
If they Occupy Wall Street

807
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:17,695
Violently pushed to the ground roughed up

808
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,975
Pepper spray

809
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,767
Algeria people

810
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
Rihanna

811
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:27,167
Really, really close to Kent State

812
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,775
You think that you've seen these young white women being spray

813
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,567
I'm going to start my show

814
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Talkin about

815
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,455
Atomy that I think is a strong indication

816
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
Doesn't care that much

817
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
She doesn't care.

818
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,111
Mike little I don't nobody cares more about Ron Paul

819
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,903
He's really pissed off

820
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
The people are saying

821
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,511
To the point where you can't do is show

822
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:59,167
Ron Paul

823
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
He's here

824
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,479
He's presenting

825
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,575
I've gone back and looked

826
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
Some of the

827
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,879
The primaries for

828
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
2012

829
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,439
Cuz it's kind of relevant to like trying

830
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
Can figure out Alex's

831
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
Political

832
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,303
Trajectory related

833
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,583
Especially turning

834
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Later

835
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,191
What are things that I noticed is that like

836
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
The only reason

837
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,799
2012

838
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Is there

839
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
2008

840
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
No one f******.

841
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,711
Even his supporters didn't think

842
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,015
But in 2012

843
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
Because Mitt Romney

844
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
Participate

845
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,879
In the street

846
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:55,231
Earlier in the primaries

847
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
4 years of the

848
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Tea Party

849
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,327
Galvanizing movement

850
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,631
More engaged at

851
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:10,335
Necessarily

852
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
That was sort of growing

853
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
Farther to the right

854
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:14,943
You're weird

855
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
To the right

856
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
The GOP

857
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
That energy

858
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
When

859
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
Intersect

860
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,927
Mitt Romney not

861
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,231
Beginning of primary season

862
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,023
This swelling

863
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,095
The appearance of massive grass

864
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,119
Success

865
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,679
2012 was a heartbreaking

866
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
Experience

867
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
Actually bought it

868
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,519
Because there was

869
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
The perception that he could

870
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
The beginning of the primary season

871
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,127
There was an idea

872
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,919
Army base on unfortunate

873
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
Didn't

874
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
Alex's

875
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Presenting the side

876
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,159
That he's being screwed

877
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,207
Based on the

878
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
The fact that

879
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
All that momentum

880
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:04,351
That was gained by Mitt Romney not being involved in the campaign

881
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:09,727
Sort of dissipated as Mitt Romney in the campaign

882
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,031
Alex is trying to also

883
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
Help

884
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,175
Oh no

885
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,991
But I think his advice is bad

886
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,855
Don't ever try to call Ron Paul I think I am

887
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:38,143
4 minutes

888
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
Give me the floor

889
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,687
First of all I know rajbhog

890
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
Here's a great strategy

891
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,759
Demon title

892
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
Again

893
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Works

894
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,159
Be a whiny dick

895
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,439
That works

896
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:06,047
For Trump because it was at I know I'm being I'm being

897
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,351
Just seen it before

898
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:13,471
Okay

899
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:20,127
Only

900
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:28,063
Rock Quarry

901
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,719
Ever hit a f****** homerun I don't believe that for a second foot

902
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
Publix

903
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:42,399
Available now do you believe that Republican shirts

904
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:46,751
R naught of the box scores

905
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
But think about this for one second

906
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:55,711
Don't you think a lot of Republican voters would change their vote

907
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
Wussies

908
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:02,879
Don't you think a lot of the people are the most delectable as

909
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,671
Republicans also have a history

910
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,743
Like there's a lot of

911
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,071
I think so I think

912
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,679
People

913
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:20,287
Jim Jordan can hit a Dinger you think so

914
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,359
Hours

915
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Challenge

916
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:30,271
Even Romney's got wheels

917
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:36,671
He was a governor you probably wasn't welcome

918
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,999
Inside the park homerun

919
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,071
Budweiser

920
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Work at the park

921
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:47,423
I think this is

922
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,519
If they had just shown video of Mitt Romney

923
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,287
Running

924
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,591
He would never won the GOP

925
00:50:55,103 --> 00:51:01,247
Navigation to him try and run they would look at him and he would look like a baby duck

926
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,087
Like Ron Paul

927
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
I'm in the house

928
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
Has been there for like

929
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Texans nineteen

930
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:14,815
He's been married

931
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,631
He hit that home run or something like that

932
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:24,287
No one's ever keep playing tonight

933
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,823
The f*** out of here

934
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,639
Sasha Cohen

935
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:34,271
Facebook

936
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:49,119
Unless, nobody else up here I've won most of straw polls I'm coming first second third

937
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:14,463
Play what the fact Rod Paul's version of the facts

938
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,303
Speech therapy what Ron needs

939
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
To do is like

940
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,095
Just be up

941
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,191
Witches entry at Somali pirate

942
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:24,959
On that level

943
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:30,079
Also in terms of like what we know from the 2016 election

944
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,383
When he's in support of Paul

945
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:36,479
He keeps saying R&B aggressive be an a******

946
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:42,879
I won't do it but who runs well NBA

947
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,671
David Alex just ask Ron Paul 2

948
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,535
To disguise dad

949
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,559
And both

950
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,583
Generations

951
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,119
Can't follow through with it

952
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,399
Eventually one

953
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
Real defense

954
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,239
About Ron Paul

955
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,519
These

956
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,287
He's pissed off

957
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,919
But he's so likeable

958
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,967
He's present like out

959
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,527
3 right

960
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
Every time

961
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
The top three

962
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,391
Is always the best

963
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791
And I will robot

964
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,815
On the other end

965
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,159
Horse racing

966
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:53,279
Which raisin is the closest he's come to the lake place show in end

967
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:59,935
Exacta box call man

968
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,727
Number it's always

969
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:05,055
Is the Final Four

970
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:11,455
We're in the West in the NBA another LeBron and that was it it was LeBron versus the

971
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,759
Nothing

972
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,855
Depicts reality

973
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,135
Nonsensical

974
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,255
I could come up with a better one like the Olympics

975
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,351
Gold silver and bronze

976
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
Be a result

977
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,959
The three people who came in first second and third

978
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,751
Are the people who get rewarded

979
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:38,079
Bronze still win

980
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,759
Become the gold medalist by coming in

981
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,343
The only time that the top three

982
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
3 or import

983
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,903
Horse racing and

984
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,719
Of the Olympic Games

985
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
Your only important

986
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,839
Arkansas

987
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,887
You just described

988
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
Betting odds

989
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:14,175
Bright Olympic ice skating

990
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,711
Does that mean that there's a

991
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:22,111
It means people

992
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
Games

993
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,695
Who

994
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,231
But I love the idea that

995
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
The top three are the

996
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,047
Contenders

997
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:37,215
If the top three were contenders the Washington Nationals won a World Series

998
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,567
Would be like the entire

999
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,103
Just a foundation

1000
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,383
Sports

1001
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
Is it raining

1002
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
Macron feel better

1003
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,367
Amazon needs help

1004
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,671
Checking in on 2011

1005
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
Yep

1006
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
And it's interesting

1007
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,255
Some of these

1008
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
Congruous

1009
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
Things that we talked about

1010
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,863
2009-10 man anytime like

1011
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,399
Pops up I like to

1012
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,471
In present-day Alex

1013
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,263
Not into a Ron

1014
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,311
Does not like A-Rod

1015
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,847
In 2009

1016
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:18,687
He was pro-rata in 2011

1017
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,295
Romney and Rick Perry

1018
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,791
Weapons material

1019
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:40,191
Dozens of countries have weapons

1020
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,335
Iran

1021
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:52,735
Start World War 3

1022
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:57,087
And go along with the police

1023
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
Crazy

1024
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,535
First of all Alex's doing some sort of

1025
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,583
High-ground racism

1026
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
Argue

1027
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:13,215
Growler run

1028
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:14,751
Sort of

1029
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:22,175
You don't like those three girls in Nigeria

1030
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:26,527
Wild berry strain I don't understand

1031
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,343
Thinking he's doing let alone what it is he is asked

1032
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,415
2011

1033
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,207
Solidly pro-iran

1034
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,023
Against

1035
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,815
Demonizing arawn

1036
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:47,263
That's interested colonialism

1037
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,799
Which okay

1038
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
I guess

1039
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,663
Yeah I know

1040
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,967
Tehran Falls

1041
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,015
No I mean not just that

1042
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:04,415
The idea of advocating for a country to get a nuke

1043
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
Is essentially saying

1044
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:11,327
If you want to have a conversation with the United States you better protect your neck

1045
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,631
Like that's what he said he's like

1046
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:20,031
Iran should have

1047
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,359
He's just missing the very idea that the capabilities of

1048
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,663
They have will ever produce

1049
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
Or have any

1050
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,455
Potential to

1051
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,087
Material

1052
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,207
Threat in the way the people who

1053
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,351
Make them a threat like Bill Clinton Mitt Romney they aren't that

1054
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,983
Which is

1055
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
Agree with

1056
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
Within a few years

1057
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,847
I'm not sure why

1058
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
Because I mean Obama's president

1059
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
In 2011

1060
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,415
Everybody

1061
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,439
Everybody knows

1062
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
My principal

1063
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,743
Fine with that

1064
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:16,351
Cuz if he before the deal

1065
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:20,447
Before the deal he is like

1066
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
Spread

1067
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,031
We should all keep it that way

1068
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,567
Nobody makes a deal

1069
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:29,407
That will help.

1070
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,943
Hard not to feel that way

1071
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:37,599
No I don't know cuz we're just taking a snapshot of 2011 we don't know where

1072
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:41,695
Builds to REI

1073
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:46,303
Yeah I know

1074
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,631
We get a random acts of Somali pirates

1075
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:54,751
We're not just playing team sports

1076
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:00,383
From some principal place and they're actually is like a tree break

1077
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,407
Supposed to

1078
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,247
Like moment words like

1079
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,039
No this is to

1080
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,087
Imagine what that is

1081
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,111
No clue

1082
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,391
There's at least at present

1083
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,719
We know that we should

1084
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,487
Give Alex

1085
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:18,303
Which credit bureau credit

1086
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,095
Anyway

1087
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,631
Gets really defensive about Howard

1088
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,007
Supposed to just sit here and be calm and talk about

1089
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,919
I want it to stop

1090
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:39,551
A sucker

1091
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:49,791
What's going on

1092
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
Call

Protest

1096
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,031
All of the things that

He is

1098
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
And has proven himself

1099
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,991
He is in the present over

1100
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,527
Powder

1101
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,855
Yeah exactly

1102
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:17,183
So we can

1103
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:25,375
Yeah yeah

1104
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Our friend

17 Clips October point

1111
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,671
Not talkin about Occupy Wall Street

1112
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,767
Finally Alex

1113
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,559
Get to Occupy Wall Street

1114
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,607
And let's see what his angle is

1115
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,655
See who his expert on the streets

1116
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
For Occupy Wall

1117
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,407
Casino

1118
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:12,479
The week-long demonstrations

1119
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:17,343
Are there New York 120

1120
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:23,743
I don't know a bunch of articles about it.

1121
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,559
Is it allowed

1122
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:32,959
Wall Street

1123
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:10,847
Luca Brasi wasn't even a New York one

1124
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:17,247
You got a man on the ground

1125
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,551
Fuel tank

1126
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:24,927
I don't know what the time frame is

1127
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:29,023
I don't f****** know Mandy was just over there getting a biscuit

1128
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:29,791
U7

1129
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,071
I don't know

1130
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,375
Just lollygagging

1131
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,423
He's not a serious

1132
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:39,007
Person is not Luke radowski is not a serious person

1133
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,543
He was hanging out New York

1134
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,335
Oh my God what is this

1135
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
The Occupy Wall

1136
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,919
Everything is blowing up

1137
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
And tried to get

1138
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,711
Get some after the fact

1139
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:48,991
He was intact

1140
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,271
Actually engaged

1141
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,575
Who were there

1142
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,391
Portland

1143
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,671
Resetting Revolution either

1144
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,207
Neither is Alex

1145
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:58,975
None of these

1146
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,743
People are

1147
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
Now

1148
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,815
The important thing I think he

1149
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
Alex

1150
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
Wrong

1151
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,727
The way you presented

1152
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
He's

1153
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,055
Hour and 40 minutes

1154
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,735
I hear a bunch of these people are at

1155
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,015
End the Fetters

1156
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,831
Please end the Federal Reserve

1157
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,111
That's not a cure

1158
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,647
That wasn't a big deal

1159
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:35,583
I remember Occupy Wall Street they were very insistent that there were only three members of

1160
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:41,471
Congress who voted for the Fed

1161
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:45,567
53

1162
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:49,151
Fred Wayne

1163
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:53,247
There might be some people and maybe even like

1164
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,039
Contingent

1165
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
Some point

1166
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:00,159
Federal Reserve System

1167
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,743
But it wasn't a central tenet

1168
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,023
Of the

1169
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,071
Ows

1170
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,399
Movement it really wasn't even from the

1171
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,447
It wasn't a destroy the Fed

1172
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,727
Absolutely

1173
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,543
Alex Jones

1174
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,823
Ron Paul

1175
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,847
Those people

1176
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,151
And the sad type

1177
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,711
So Alex is imagining

1178
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,991
These people

1179
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,527
Protest

1180
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,807
Against

1181
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:31,647
Who are just dumb, you don't realize

1182
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,183
Is minimizing the

1183
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:33,951
The entire

1184
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:34,975
Right

1185
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,255
Right

1186
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,279
Maybe

1187
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,815
A lot of them are

1188
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
Exactly

1189
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,863
Like what

1190
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,887
Maha

1191
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:47,007
Is my remember that long list on the other hand

1192
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,311
It's it was it was intense

1193
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
Alex

1194
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,383
In the exact same

1195
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,663
Zigzag

1196
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,223
Pattern that the enterologist episode is

1197
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,039
Episode

1198
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,575
Think he is

1199
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,367
I don't think

1200
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,183
I think that he

1201
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
Mad

1202
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,231
The police are

1203
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,511
Yeah

1204
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,815
He likes it they're making fun of the bank

1205
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,655
He also likes the specific people who are being oppressed

1206
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,191
Arby's

1207
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:23,359
There is definitely that there is actually pepper sprayed

1208
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:32,319
He's a man without a country in this protects

1209
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,599
Might as well be

1210
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,879
Somali pirates

1211
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,415
You can't help but admire

1212
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,207
80s it is interesting

1213
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:43,071
Specifically because I remember the way your mainstream right way

1214
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,351
Outlets covered this

1215
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,655
Which was peor like

1216
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:59,711
Rose and they were like definitely not reacting because there's a black guy

1217
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:04,063
Presidents and their freedom they were like

1218
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,391
They're just protesting because they want to overthrow the government

1219
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,047
Do you get that I appreciate Alex for

1220
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,839
Waffling

1221
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,631
I guess that's a

1222
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,287
I think it's a more sinister

1223
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
And honestly

1224
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
If you will

1225
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,943
Will be in activity

1226
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,527
Willington

1227
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,087
Like he's against the idea of these protesters

1228
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
Just got to rest

1229
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,391
But he's also still denigrate

1230
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,487
Clearly not on board with what

1231
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,023
By Wall Street

1232
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
At this point

1233
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,071
Which is not getting

1234
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,119
Pretending

1235
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,935
Understand

1236
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:58,079
Even do little child little communist

1237
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,127
Alex we would prefer dinner

1238
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,431
I understand that you're mad

1239
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,223
Your boss communist

1240
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:07,551
But I know better I know but look

1241
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:13,183
You don't think he's your boss but he is

1242
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,999
He's paying you so

1243
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,071
This whole time he's talking about the Narwhal

1244
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,423
The number of Sorrows

1245
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
So

1246
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,007
I think that I have

1247
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,103
September

1248
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
Fifth 20

1249
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,431
I don't think

1250
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,967
Is a s*** about matcha

1251
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,535
In the New York area where do they converge

1252
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,095
Liberty Plaza by City Hall

1253
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,799
This is America

1254
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:07,199
New York

1255
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,735
Mad

1256
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,503
People who are gathering

1257
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,295
He's telling all of the

1258
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,575
Info Warriors

1259
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,855
New York to go to

1260
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,647
China Wok

1261
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:20,511
In 2011

1262
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:26,911
Grizzled Detective

1263
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,215
Just about to retire

1264
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,751
Training Young Buck

1265
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,567
We've seen this

1266
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,639
What else is present in here I think

1267
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,663
Is a

1268
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,687
A perfect sympathy

1269
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,503
Occupy Wall Street

1270
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,295
I don't know

1271
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
Entirely

1272
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:44,831
But I'm

1273
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
I'm going to guess

1274
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
He hasn't talked to me

1275
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,439
Because

1276
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,719
He didn't seem to care

1277
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,511
Much

1278
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,351
The day after a ton of people get arrested and depressed

1279
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,399
Peaceful protesters getting

1280
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
Jammed up

1281
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
The protest

1282
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,007
Seems like something

1283
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
Beats

1284
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,567
He spent most

1285
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,103
Stupid show talking about

1286
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,383
Like dissecting

1287
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
The Who

1288
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
Like all this stuff

1289
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:10,943
You spent

1290
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,223
Is that much time

1291
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:12,991
That shitt

1292
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,783
4 min

1293
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
About

1294
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,623
At all

1295
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,415
The day after

1296
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,463
Probably one of the most

1297
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,511
Like if you really look at the

1298
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,863
Of course when the police came in and took all the tents out

1299
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,191
More of a

1300
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:33,983
Encroachment

1301
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,287
This was one of the biggest

1302
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,311
Early warning

1303
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,127
Shots of like this is getting serious

1304
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,687
Alex doesn't give a s***

1305
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,735
He just I don't

1306
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,015
I don't think

1307
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
Before

1308
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,319
I bet he will

1309
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,599
I bet he will

1310
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,415
Because you think he'll give a s*** later because

1311
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,463
Clip

1312
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,535
From Hammond

1313
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,559
Go down there

1314
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,863
Because I think he thinks

1315
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:01,887
Co-op

1316
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,423
I honestly

1317
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,215
We think that is his position

1318
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,007
In the same way with a tea party

1319
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,543
In 2009 that we

1320
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,591
We've seen when you talk

1321
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,895
It's about like this tea party is a place where we can

1322
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
Find people

1323
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,199
Then we can educate them

1324
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,015
The Federal Reserve and all this year

1325
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,319
Views that Occupy Wall Street

1326
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,343
Movement is like

1327
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,111
Hey

1328
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:25,183
Look maybe some of them self-identify as commie

1329
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,207
Cuz they're f******

1330
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,511
You don't know who their boss is

1331
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,303
But we can red pill those

1332
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,839
Pictures down there

1333
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,863
Figure this out

1334
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,655
And then before you know it

1335
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,287
I honestly think that's probably the position from

1336
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,359
And I don't I don't I don't think

1337
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,431
A Warrior's all go down to this park

1338
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,967
Let's let's flood

1339
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,295
We got Luke rudowski

1340
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,575
Across town when

1341
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,343
Action HEPA

1342
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,367
He's somewhere

1343
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,391
He's around

1344
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,999
I don't know I don't know I find this to be a very dishonest

1345
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,303
Who live in New York

1346
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,351
Luke rudowski

1347
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,631
Is around

1348
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:12,543
Start looking

1349
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
New York

1350
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,383
So they could be anywhere

1351
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,943
There's a small space

1352
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,735
I find this to be like

1353
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,527
On a journalistic level

1354
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,415
From what I would expect from a

1355
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,719
Terrible

1356
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,279
D-11

1357
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:36,863
I understand that

1358
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,935
Heating the banks

1359
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
That's true

1360
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,519
Mister B's open

1361
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,799
No matter what

1362
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,591
Positive or negative

1363
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,383
Whatever the

1364
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,175
He should have

1365
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,711
Rock Solid position

1366
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
This move

1367
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,551
Like the people

1368
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,599
Like occupying zuccotti Park

1369
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:58,879
Houston

1370
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,159
Have a ball

1371
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,695
He should

1372
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,463
Either

1373
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,023
I understand day one

1374
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,303
Not knowing what you think

1375
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,839
But a week in

1376
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:11,167
They can start on the 17th we're talkin about the 25th

1377
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,703
He has a week from

1378
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,239
The day before the show

1379
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,287
Yeah everything to play out

1380
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,335
And get his bearings

1381
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,359
Figure out what

1382
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
Think about it

1383
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,919
Do you think anything about it

1384
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,687
Except

1385
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,271
Maybe we can twist them

1386
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:33,183
Opportunistic

1387
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:36,255
The rebuttal to so many arguments

1388
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
When we

1389
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,583
About

1390
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:42,143
Changed his principles in the present

1391
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,007
Well in 2011 following his

1392
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,055
Stated principles

1393
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,335
He will be off

1394
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,359
For occupied

1395
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,407
Not really

1396
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,943
Not really because they're

1397
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,967
Very left

1398
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:06,207
Looks like William black

1399
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,279
Yep

1400
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:13,631
Like which are against Alex

1401
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,655
And they did

1402
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,983
They did do that but the Occupy Wall Street as a movement

1403
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Was not

1404
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,543
Centered around like

1405
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:23,615
We're going to send these policy proposals to book

1406
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,639
In the same way that the

1407
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:27,711
The Tea Party wasn't a movement that was built around were sending policy

1408
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,479
Proposal

1409
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,807
8 something

1410
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,111
The idea of a group

1411
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:37,183
People non-violently brutal this resistance

1412
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
Exactly

1413
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:41,791
Play this version.

1414
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,071
Didn't mean s***

1415
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,351
2011

1416
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,631
I don't mean s***

1417
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,215
Now

1418
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,799
Lego news

1419
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,567
Tumi

1420
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,943
There wasn't any shift on

1421
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
Principles

1422
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,527
Ever know the principles have always been

1423
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,599
Nazis in the White House

1424
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,391
DoubleDown

1425
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,671
I honestly

1426
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:10,975
Everything I can

1427
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
Until

1428
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,047
Alex eventually ends up

1429
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
Viking Auto

1430
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,583
Occupy Wall Street

1431
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,863
That motherfuker

1432
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,143
Because I think that he

1433
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:23,007
He thinks he can co-opt it the same way I think

1434
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:23,775
I think

1435
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:27,359
I think it'll be an interested I want to do a full investigation

1436
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
Because I want

1437
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,431
You stand it better

1438
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,967
I want understand the past

1439
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,503
You don't want to know

1440
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,807
Hey on the 25th he was

1441
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,087
Dismissive

1442
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,623
Of it but also thought he could

1443
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
Co-opted

1444
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,951
Right mid October

1445
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,719
He's a fan

1446
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,047
I want to understand

1447
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,071
Progression through the

1448
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,863
And I can't do service

1449
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,887
To that until we

1450
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,983
So I think they are next vest

1451
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,775
100%

1452
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,055
Be walking

1453
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
Through

1454
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,871
This

1455
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:03,967
It's not that long

1456
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,759
It really was but

1457
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,039
I think that you

1458
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:07,807
Alex

1459
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,599
Really

1460
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
Really changed

1461
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,183
And I think that

1462
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
I think

1463
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:14,975
A very

1464
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
Interesting

1465
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,279
And robust

1466
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,095
How little he cares

1467
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,911
When we do that invest

1468
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,215
Let's all agree

1469
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,799
Where I say

1470
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,591
My predict

1471
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,615
Is Alex

1472
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,967
Dismissive of Occupy Wall Street

1473
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,527
Then says they have some good point

1474
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,575
Ventas they're good

1475
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,135
And then very quickly says they're Eve

1476
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,951
Event

1477
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:52,351
Present himself as the real version of it

1478
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,655
I would bet a lot of money on that

1479
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,983
Progression Bakery

1480
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,031
Maybe make us suspicious that like

1481
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,311
In the present

1482
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:09,759
Not I'm the real trouble

1483
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,975
Are you sure this isn't he will he'll be like

1484
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,535
Look

1485
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:26,655
We didn't leave the party

1486
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,471
He could pull something like that

1487
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:36,383
French

1488
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,735
I don't know a lot of options and

1489
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:41,503
The same time here

1490
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,271
Has nowhere to go

1491
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,063
Fascinating human being

1492
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:44,831
Yeah I know

1493
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,511
I don't think he has a real position on it

1494
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,279
Many meanings

1495
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,167
He's for the ID

1496
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:04,799
The ideas

1497
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
People are being

1498
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,591
By the police

1499
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,127
Wrightwood also jump

1500
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,455
He's in a real

1501
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,991
Difficult

1502
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
Evolve

1503
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,695
Clip

1504
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,743
It's just a little

1505
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,511
Icing on the cake

1506
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,047
Most

1507
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
What episode

1508
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:35,519
And about how much Alex wants Ron Paul to be elected president

1509
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:41,663
Most of this episode was the thing that we talked about

1510
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,199
Terry tertiary

1511
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,855
Both of Us episode was actually about Somali pirates

1512
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,951
So

1513
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,511
Alex gets a call at

1514
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,047
The show

1515
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:02,911
Styxhammer

1516
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
Are you f******

1517
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,263
Exceptions

1518
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:09,823
Invalidate

1519
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,871
About Donald Trump

1520
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:19,551
You and I and most your lesson is all they are gold doesn't count I meant Ron Pauley tonight Skype

1521
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,599
But does he have a standing army

1522
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,623
Afford

1523
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,671
Air Defense Artillery.

1524
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,231
Keeping working if he was to be a

1525
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:38,239
And I'm running we win exposing the whole system

1526
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:42,079
Illustrating all their dirty tricks

1527
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,127
You have this position that

1528
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,175
Can fix it all

1529
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,647
This one

1530
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,767

1531
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,815
A president before 2011

1532
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,471
I don't know

1533
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:13,824
Joshua I appreciate you setting up on the time travel

1534
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,384
I don't think that we found

1535
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,712
Position about Alex Jones

1536
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,248
Occupy Wall Street

1537
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,320
You will certainly

1538
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,648
Find out more

1539
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
Indeed

1540
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,512
It's so weird when we do the time travel episode

1541
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,048
Because unlike

1542
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,352
With 2015

1543
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:41,472
We don't have like a f****** sticks week exploration to why it is

1544
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
You thinking this s***

1545
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,520
Right now

1546
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:46,080
Time travel episodes

1547
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,408
Crazy because we're like does this mean something does it

1548
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,200
I don't know.

1549
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:54,272
I don't know

1550
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:58,624
Like Panera to give it to every episode.

1551
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,648
Between

1552
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:06,048
January 1st 2011 and December 31st 1

1553
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,656
I knew that he was mostly just talkin about Ron Paul's

1554
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:20,128
Mother things that I didn't pick up on it

1555
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,992
We'll figure it out radical

1556
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,528
We just figured out

1557
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,576
We'll sweep that up

1558
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,856
Get back to

1559
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:30,880
More exhaust

1560
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,000
We almost certainly will within the next six

1561
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:36,768
212 year

1562
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,840
It will be next

1563
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,376
So I

1564
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,168
Block this been fun

1565
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:54,176

1566
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,712

1577
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,968
Cayenne now this right with a k

1578
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,504
Of course

1579
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,856
Knowledge

1580
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
Right

1581
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:47,424
Ross on Facebook

1583
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,008
Good stuff

1584
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,800
But for now

1585
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:55,872
Who among our cast

1586
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,640
The characters to

1587
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,968
Has not probably definitely

1588
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,296
Lucrative

1589
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,624
Prove it

1590
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,928
Ask me to prove it

1591
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:15,584
You can't do it

1592
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:19,168
Bradley Cooper

1593
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:25,568
I will say that much like Bradley Cooper probably haven't killed anybody

1594
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,688
Same is true of lucre dowski just an ineffectual propaganda

1595
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,712
God bless him

1596
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,736
He's never killed me by

1597
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:37,088
Anybody who has almost probably

1598
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:39,648
Quickly killed again

1599
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,696
Probably totally

1600
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,488
Allegedly

1601
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,304
Himself he said his

1602
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,584
Themselves that guys out

1603
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
