00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by knowledge

00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Sit around drink novelty Beverages and talk a little bit

7
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,584
About Alex Jones

8
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,168
What up

9
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,704
For today

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,752
This is this is groovy old maybe

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,712
So I didn't realize

12
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,248
I like to dip you like to

13
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:30,368
I like to dip them but you are not a constellation of any sort

14
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
I'm going to be an Alex Jones improvised

15
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,072
Ridiculous

16
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,216
Next

17
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776
I dip you like a sauce

18
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
But

19
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
Never considered like the way that most people have wings is the sauces

20
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,528
Put the sauce on their juice squeeze it on there

21
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,088
I didn't realize if you have Tupperware

22
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
You can put the sauce

23
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
Fingers

24
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,744
Ziploc bag works too

25
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
Whole New World

26
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
I finally realized

27
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,264
Capoeira

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,824
Lifetime how much pepper where do you have

29
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,760
I mean not a ton not as much as my mom probably

30
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,600
Periodically I will get a couple things of Tupperware

31
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,672
I'm just throwing away and up

32
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,560
Not getting reused or something

33
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
What's the easiest thing you do

34
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
Necessary

35
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,968
Better as I get older but it's just like

36
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:05,088
Yeah this just can't be clean this can't be washed

37
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:11,488
You know I think of

38
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
A lot of bright spots going on now

39
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Right now

40
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
Is anxious and nervous and I'm not sure just like I can't hang right now you got to celebrate

41
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:42,976
Relation of your Rhythm to sleep right

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
Episode 2

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,288
Hotly anticipating whatever bulshit going to happen here

44
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,616
30th and 31st 2020

45
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
But Alex

46
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,088
Realizes

47
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
Interesting but will still go over it

48
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,000
News about stuff is about what you'd expect

49
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,143
A lot of stuff is very transparently

50
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,007
Course

51
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
According to show

52
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
So first FNL thank you so much you are now policy walk

54
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
I'm a policy wonk

55
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
I'm a policy wonk

56
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311
Hey Leslie

57
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Thomas the political Martian

58
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
Thank you so much you're an alcoholic

59
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
That Marvin PetSmart

60
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
Martian

61
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:20,511
People donated on elevator

62
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
She went outside

63
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
Heroin

64
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,687

65
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
These gents website

66
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703
Probably your area perhaps

67
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,591
Generosity and throat not directions

68
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
For today

69
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:19,135
29th that's Friday Saturday and Sunday

70
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,743
It's get us fully up-to-speed where we are as

71
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:29,119
Escalated and deteriorated in many cities around the country

72
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,471
I will take on it is

73
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Temptation

74
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
Live from Austin Texas broadcasting reply

75
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
Millie Weaver

76
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,343
Austin Texas broadcasting World why

77
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
Alex Jones

78
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,999
There's something fun about the computer

79
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Let's hear it for the computer

80
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,119
So we start off I can't wait to speak to you

81
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Alex

82
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,007
We start off on Friday

83
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
Then they were on Thursday

84
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:16,735
That's not safe.

85
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
I don't think Alex

86
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
I'll be there I'll include myself in this

87
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
I don't think that anyone

88
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,975
Maybe some people but let's just keep this upset to me and Alex

89
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
I don't think he and I

90
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
Victor necessarily that things would go as

91
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,471
As much of

92
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
A hard take on things

93
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
Killing

94
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
The people who are speaking out against

95
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
Ignored it until the point where he could

96
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
And

97
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
It's a big deal

98
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,207
On Friday it's a big deal

99
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
And you know what that means

100
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
It's time to shift

101
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
Narratives

102
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,191
Document

103
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
2018

104
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,615
Civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore Maryland

105
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,735
Nationwide unrest

106
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
In 2018

107
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
Friends of democracy run by Alexander Soros

108
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
Crying trigger with

109
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Americans

110
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Dieting as the cover

111
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,775
Overthrow major city governments Obama whatever

112
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Pretext

113
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,895
National martial law in 2018

114
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
It did not go the way they wanted to

115
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
It seems

116
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:59,647
I was watching things unfold on Thursday and Friday night

117
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
About to start hearing more about Soros

118
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,119
This is the value of Alex's strategy of having his whole list of villains

119
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
But he can pull out whenever he needs to

120
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,775
Ruby last four months or so

121
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:21,151
Because the relevant kind of fear use trying to explain to the characterization of Soros

122
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
The medical tyranny of the evils of vaccines those are in the Bill Gates wheelhouse so Alex Focus mode almost entirely on

123
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
Bill and Melinda Gates

124
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,391
Of course the new villain

125
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Please remember

126
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
That the first time Alex

127
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,791
Mention fauci broadcast on February 8th

128
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,863
I was just pretending the fauci and said that they were investigating if

129
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
Coronavirus was man made

130
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
And that he was a hero within the administration

131
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,775
Once it became clear that this was all bulshit that Alex is making up

132
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
Alex pretend you never said any of those things

133
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,687
Thought you became a long time

134
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Just looking

135
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
Make it up as you go along

136
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,647
Even decided the Bill Gates was ahead of the New World Order and had been for the past 12 years or so

137
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,255
Alex claimed the gates reportedly been a committed statements at the age of 10

138
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,303
He was taking over with his pink sweater

139
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,375
It was the season of going very hard against

140
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
Soros

141
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,751
Now that we have societal unrest in protesting

142
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
Wheelhouse

143
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,711
Alex can't credibly claim that Bill Gates is playing antifa protesters to go around and cause trouble

144
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,807
Because his audience already

145
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
End.

146
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,671
As Alex open to show on Friday soros's called off the bench

147
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,255
As anyone who's listen to our show for any stretch of time nose

148
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,095
These Soros antifa contract Alex is talking about are very fake

149
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,447
What are the least competent underlings hours

150
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
No federal law enforcement has ever

151
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
Confirm their real Alex is making that up

152
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,455
Also I'm not sure what he means when he says no media has ever disputed them because we're media and I sure as s*** dispute

153
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
And mock the very idea of someone

154
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Contractor start riots

155
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,231
The notion that never put down at the paper is laughable

156
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,375
The real new enter into a contract with someone is so that you can take action against them in court if they fail to live up to their obligation

157
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,727
Literally zero purpose to start a riot

158
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
F****** stupid

159
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:28,127
I would assume the absence of coverage of these fake documents in the larger media

160
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
Apparently fake

161
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
Seems like something the most media Outlets wouldn't waste their time

162
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:40,415
On the other hand have nothing but time for this.

163
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:47,327
I feel like the media has not yet refuted the details of

164
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
The treaty between the Elves and the orc

165
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:55,263
Works either and I feel like that's something they've been silent about Eisenhower going on record about his meeting with alien

166
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,359
South America

167
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
Soccer contract with him

168
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
The ship

169
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,935
And he hired some movers and the contract about the Ark of the Covenant

170
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,775
Don't look at the Ark of the Covenant contract as well

171
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,079
How do I say would be sued for their face melting

172
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
Yeah yeah yeah something like that

173
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:38,527
So Alex is going to enter into the season of trying to make a

174
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
RC Theory out of this

175
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,927
Sure he's going to talk about the protests and riots and make them into

176
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
The work of metal and Soros operatives

177
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:56,959
Stop

178
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,543
Sense of intensity in in severity

179
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,383
And Alex

180
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,199
GE starts weaving also conspiracies

181
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,015
About the killing of George Floyd itself

182
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
Why not the center of the case

183
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,623
But the local police are not our enemy

184
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,743
Anybody that's live long enough on average knows that

185
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,167
Minnesota that the media has hyped up

186
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:32,287
That was becoming more and more suspicious very well

187
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
And

188
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,575
Do you put your knee on the Carotid artery is somebody that's not a police

189
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
Somebody

190
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,463
So Alex police aren't they

191
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
Counter to his entire self mythology

192
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,911
According to his telling of his own life story he uncovered an elaborate drug-dealing ring in the police department of Dallas

193
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,751
Would you like to a lawyer calling Alex's dad kill Alex

194
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,151
Alex's life story the beginning of his career is at odds with his current state

195
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,063
Obviously I don't believe that's why I was moved to Austin but it's telling that the corrosive effect of supporting Trump has

196
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,879
He's supposed to be pretending to be

197
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,791
Answer that news item about George Floyd and the cop Derek Chauvin knew each other

198
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
Reporting a bit

199
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:33,471
This is something that's based on some comments from buy a Santa Maria Club in Minneapolis called El Nuevo Rodeo

200
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,591
She told the local news Outlet.

201
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
Took to mean that they knew each other and this must have been person

202
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,711
This is ignoring me.

203
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
Santa Maria's comments

204
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
They were working together at the same time it's just that Chauvin worked outside

205
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:58,559
Working together for several years even the blaze included the information in their article

206
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,375
It's only work there for roughly a year

207
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:07,007
It's definitely interesting and I'll need to wait till there's more information to draw any conclusion from it but

208
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
I mean Santa Maria told the local news outlet that she did not know the two guys knew each other and it's entirely possible

209
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
They didn't

210
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:19,039
She said there were dozens of guards on busy nights like when their shift would have overlapped so

211
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,135
It's entirely possible they were only distant acquaintance

212
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,255
The stories being used by some

213
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,559
It shouldn't fall into the same category

214
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,631
This is where a white cop kills another black person

215
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
I think that's a losing strategy

216
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,751
If you think about it for even a second

217
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
If it turns out that this case was something where it's

218
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:47,455
The cop killed George Floyd

219
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,503
The situation is far worse than it looks

220
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,903
That's the idea that he could get away with acting like that

221
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,487
View of his co-workers and expected he would pay any consequences for it

222
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
Encapsulation of the problem

223
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,935
Whether or not these two knew each other is an interesting future but regardless

224
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,495
It doesn't change the fact of the situation one bit

225
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,335
It's some kind of a

226
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,407
You know like this is something else

227
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,479
It's not something else it is a little bit like

228
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Saying that

229
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,599
You know it's like domestic abuse is fine for cops

230
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
Apps to get away with because

231
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
They

232
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,743
Personal you know it's not them using their badge to get away with

233
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,071
Kind of s*** it's B personal if their personal life

234
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,143
It's like no I'm still going to go with that's f***** up

235
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,311
It's kind of standard a lot of people float these kinds of things out

236
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,383
I didn't realize where Alex was going to go from there

237
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
He takes that little bit

238
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
Misinterpreted news

239
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
And he just Builds on it support

240
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,623
Good luck f****** defending this conspiracy theory Alex

241
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Tomatoes looks like sometime

242
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,375
You're probably going to find this corruption going on in this is some kind of weird police game

243
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,823
How do you kill somebody on camera why would you just

244
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,831
Here we see Alex correctly assessed there's something completely sucked up

245
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
In an attempt to

246
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
Police games

247
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
This is absurd

248
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
But Beyonce

249
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:54,687
Claiming gang involved killing does literally nothing to explain away the thing that he's claiming to find suspicious of The Originals

250
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
It is probably assumed there be even more reason and honestly

251
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,159
While you're on shift as a cop in public

252
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:10,303
You'd think that would ultimately lead to an investigation which would likely real reveal the existence of this cop game

253
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
You're probably trying to keep a secret

254
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:18,239
I want those conspiracy supposed to explain why the cop did this even though he was on sale but it doesn't choose that goal

255
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,383
All it does is create a possibly more intriguing But ultimately very difficult to prove distraction from reality

256
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
Let me tell you

257
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:32,575
Now Alex needs to establish that there is a police gang in Minneapolis The Wolverine that this cop was a member of the police

258
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:38,975
You had a tattoo the other members of the officers there were also members

259
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:45,375
I have a reason to commit mass murders imaginable

260
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,263
Rise to the level of a cop in uniform killing someone in the street with recording

261
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
You think it would have to be something really serious like I don't know Floyd was going to provide evidence to the attorney general about the cop gang

262
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,023
You can easily see how this might be fun for conspiracy theorists to think about but it's pure speculation

263
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,863
!

264
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
Even though you knew we was on tape

265
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,751
Any consequences

266
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,823
Maybe you can make an argument that he didn't actually think that

267
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,919
Floyd was going to die but still requires you to accept

268
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
If those be concerned autocar's

269
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
Not as not seriously enough to consider

270
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
It would be very easy to see

271
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,159
I hope you would think that there wouldn't be any consequence

272
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
There really are

273
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,791
For police people of color and early in his career

274
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:52,191
Just Liza last episode 2000

275
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,519
The same cop Derek Chauvin responded to a domestic disturbance call

276
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,127
When the police arrived the guy with police called on him Ira tolls

277
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,503
According to his telling of the story to The Daily Beast show the officers entered the house unannounced

278
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,783
Ben Chauvin kicked

279
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
At the door of the bathroom

280
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,183
When he got in he started hitting tools

281
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,743
I didn't know what to think when he started hitting me

282
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
I swear he was hitting me with the gun

283
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
Show me Kohl's in the stomach

284
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,167
Because he claimed the tolls reached for an officer's gun

285
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:31,871
If his first reaction was hitting me in the face then it means I can't see it and I'm too disoriented to First locate is gone

286
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
And then try to take it from him and for what

287
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:39,295
Misdemeanor disorderly situation into a felony

288
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
He tried to kill me in that bathroom

289
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,647
Consequences for this

290
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,719
Which teaches a lesson that there are consequences for this sort of thing

291
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,863
You just got paid he got put on paid administrative leave while there was an investigation that didn't result in any consequences

292
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
Vacation

293
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,055
I find it substantially easier to believe that a cop with a record like chauvin's living in America like the one we've been living it

294
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,871
Just didn't give a s*** about her

295
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,407
That's easier to believe than this

296
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,247
Completely baseless conspiracy about the Imagine

297
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Who's coming up with

298
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,807
Subway that was 2008

299
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
Obviously

300
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Good cop

301
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,720
Allow bad cops to stay in there

302
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
Angry

303
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
Stroke

304
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,176
Work on Alex's bar

305
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Is you really have to look at

306
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:44,064
You can see how now that he hasn't Angela story that he thinks defuses the race issues

307
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,416
He's completely comfortable dropping the whole like Captain know what he was doing

308
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:52,768
That was only his ankle on Thursday because he couldn't come up with anything better to

309
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
Defend whiteness

310
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:59,168
That's all he had I've now you

311
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,056
It's just realize

312
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
You're attacking the very

313
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,920
Cornerstone of the all cops argument which is that

314
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,480
If you want to argue there are good cops

315
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:17,856
Then why are they doing everything humanly possible to protect murderers you know

316
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
So that's the that's

317
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
The Cornerstone in for you to say at me

318
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
To my face

319
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,072
They don't suffer bad cops there for very long

320
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
F*** off

321
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
That's that one problem with the other problem is that like

322
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
That's

323
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:38,080
Contradiction of Alex's entire life story

324
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,176
It's ridiculous to be this idea like cops don't put up with bad cop

325
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:47,040
You got run out of Dallas by French.

326
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,112
Like one of those with Chief if you were correct

327
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:56,512
Then you wouldn't have needed to do the thing that you think you're right here overdo it never would have moved

328
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
Exactly

329
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Dallas ass-whole

330
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,984
Sure not over 4000.

331
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,824
A video of the fire at the 3rd Precinct

332
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,128
Minneapolis

333
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
You think of

334
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
Chicago Fire

335
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,648
The fireworks going off at Celebration of the pool

336
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
Station

337
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
Just move out of that already

338
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:38,496
Thursday night protesters Minneapolis Police Station

339
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,336
The image of that was something I could have never imagined

340
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,664
I never thought my lifetime I would see a police station

341
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
Capture that's where the

342
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Police are

343
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,552
That's where they keep their gun did not seem like a possibility I was

344
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Shocked

345
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,744
Leaving my basement decide there been some responses from business owners in the area and some are not happy but others

346
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
Musically

347
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,120
The Gandhi Mahal Indian restaurant was one of the businesses that caught fire that night

348
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,424
The owner's daughter posted on Facebook

349
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,752
Don't worry about us we will rebuild and we will recover

350
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
Referring to her father she said quote

351
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:17,408
I hear him say on the phone let my building bird Justice needs to be served

352
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,944
But those officers in jail

353
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
Another was the target

354
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:27,136
Which was the site of the initial looting that's so scandalize the right-wing think about the target they said

355
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:32,256
Their CEO Brian Connell put a press release that started community in pain

356
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,048
That pain is not unique

357
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,096
Twin Cities across America

358
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,424
The murder of George Floyd is Unleashed dipenta pain of years

359
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,496
Breonna Taylor

360
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,080
We say their names and hold a to long list of other than our heart

361
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,920
As a Target team we've huddled and we've been sold and we've witnessed

362
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:53,248
Horrific seed similar to it's playing out now and where

363
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
Is that not enough is changed

364
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,856
As a team we vowed to face pain with purpose

365
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,648
You went on to reaffirm targets

366
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Commitment to the effect

367
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
Store in neighborhood

368
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:08,352
Our store

369
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,400
Team a former Lake Street store in

370
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,728
We'll make sure they are full pay and benefits in the coming week

371
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,568
As well as access to other resources and opportunities within Target

372
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,616
We'll continue to invest in this vibrant

373
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,432
Crossroads of Seward Longfellow Philip

374
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,712
And Powderhorn

375
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
Communities

376
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,296
Preserving jobs and economic opportunities by rebuild

377
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,624
I'm bringing back the store that has served as a community resource

378
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
Since 1976

379
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,816
I mean it's corporate Target

380
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
The f****** word of it but

381
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,168
At least I don't believe a word of it

382
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
Will so you know

383
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:49,824
They're almost certainly some businesses that will be hesitant to reopen or want to relocate but it's not a universal thing

384
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:56,480
Megan realize the larger reality what's going on in the country in a responding by attempting to reaffirm their commitment to the communities they

385
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Serve

386
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
These are two voices that are inspiring

387
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,136
Here in carnival

388
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
Elvis travels

389
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,584
Really what he's trying to do is shame the protesters with ideas that they've driven business out of their Community which is a very

390
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,984
Response for people in events like that community

391
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:22,336
Dla right before Alex Jones ever on air

392
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
On-air at that time

393
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,384
Spell Cooper

394
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:28,992
So after that after the policeman

395
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
McCain were found not guilty

396
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
And right broke out

397
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,856
A part of what he had to say

398
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
No biggie

399
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
McMurray

400
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,608
An open grocery store

401
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Supermarket

402
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,680
Discount store

403
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
Electronics store.

404
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Floor heating

405
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Pringles

406
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Store

407
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824
Rihanna

408
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
It is not going

409
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:02,272
Whenever a group of protesters engaging property damage on the right making this argument

410
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,832
Not to just hear it as a form of scold

411
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Supalonely

412
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
I was considering

413
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,488
Plane

414
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Talking

415
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:18,656
Much more about Bill Cooper's response to that the riots that broke out after the acquittal

416
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,520
But I I just I didn't feel like it would be an episode

417
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:28,640
Bill's response to it is very complicated and very different from Alex's

418
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,968
Inasmuch as he completely understands

419
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
The reasons

420
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,832
Flight that these communities were in

421
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,672
And anybody who supports

422
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
Is categorically a race

423
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,232
He has

424
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,792
Some strong stances

425
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,840
Are you also

426
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Very similar

427
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
Take that Alex eyes towards

428
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,960
Sleep regression that the the protest

429
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Truck Yeah

430
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
Yeah.

431
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,616
Encapsulation of the that right-wing whites light

432
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,408
That idea of like

433
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,712
Something in my neighborhood has changed

434
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,296
I am not going to spend a single dime helping to rebuild it

435
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,112
Or changing with it or growing as a person

436
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm leaving

437
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Not that

438
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,840
Other people would say see what was going on and what

439
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
Maintain the community

440
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,776
Something somebody kept saying the middle class

441
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,664
Incredibly difficult thing to unpack

442
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
IQs

443
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
Approach to its like

444
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,272
There's there's moments of like

445
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
You get it

446
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,304
Qronika

447
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:56,960
And then you pick into blaming Rodney King for driving drunk

448
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Gran Torino

449
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,008
Know that kind of thing

450
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:04,128
Too much to throw away already

451
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,736
So Alex wants to play another standard conspiracy game here on the

452
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
29th

453
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,112
And that is that happens in the world Maybe

454
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,672
All that stuff

455
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,000
Maybe it's really a distraction

456
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
Remember that while we're all folks

457
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
Los Angeles

458
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
And

459
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
Minneapolis-Saint Paul

460
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
Batman riots

461
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:38,176
That's going on videos come out of Joe Biden in

462
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,552
United States

463
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:49,696
I'm not sure that Alex ever does get back to that video I don't know

464
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,744
To most of this episode

465
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:58,400
I did end up turning it off a tiny bit early because I was just sick of it

466
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
Know if he got to it and I don't care

467
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
It's not worth

468
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,384
I want to take a second to show Alex there were bunch of murders and racial attacks on white people

469
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,016
This is interesting because if I'm not much mistaken Alex is currently on a nationally televised program

470
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,064
If he's upset and no one's covering this

471
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
He should be covering with himself

472
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,696
When you realize that he's not starts coming to focus

473
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:28,096
Alex isn't covering specific details but he claims that he's aware of tons of murders and violence

474
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,376
I don't see these specific

475
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
Fix being brought up

476
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
Cuz

477
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,288
He's there to make up a talking point no one in the mainstream media is talk

478
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
Talking about it

479
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:41,920
No one is talking about Bingo and I would talk about it but that's not my job

480
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,992
Who would listen that used the talking point

481
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:49,600
Queen of the story is that no one in the media is covering the murders and anti-violence

482
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,160
That's the whole story covering

483
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,744
Not the underlying events he claims to be upset about no one covering

484
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,400
If Alex had these stories and he's not covering them that conceivably he's just as bad as all the other media Outlets he's complaining about

485
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:06,240
He's on air right now be specific whenever you want and he doesn't

486
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,520
Because he doesn't want to

487
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,896
Only seeking to impart to his audience is the general feeling that there's a massive cover-up of murder

488
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:16,224
Violence against whites going on to give them further incentive

489
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,528
To demonize the underlying point of

490
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
The protest

491
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:25,440
Quite simply it's an expression of his white supremacy the media is covering this and to prove it

492
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
Neither will I

493
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
I mean like

494
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:34,912
In terms of like when I was getting this episode together the concrete instances of like deaths

495
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:41,568
Find there was that guy in the protester who got shot by someone driving by in a gray Dodge Durango

496
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
And he died

497
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,408
There was a security officer a contracted

498
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,712
Security officer in Oakland who was shot

499
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,016
But again it was by someone in a vehicle

500
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:56,416
Fire is under investigation but I can find there's nothing solid connecting this with any protest

501
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,560
And then Fox News reported on St Louis man who died after being

502
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
Dragged under a FedEx truck

503
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,656
That guy was a protester as well

504
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Run over

505
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,520
So like I don't know how

506
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,312
Yeah inside English

507
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,848
Not anything to be like a

508
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,664
Bunch of burgers at Alex's ramp

509
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,064
It seems like mostly police beating people up and property damage real problem is is that

510
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,624
Protesters

511
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
People

512
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,976
Because if they were killing people man they could really make hay out of it

513
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,768
And said protesters are just

514
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,792
Hurting building

515
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
They don't like that

516
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:42,240
Wow it makes it to clear the like property rights over everything kind of mentality of so

517
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
So many people on the right

518
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
But whatever

519
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:50,944
I don't particularly care to engage with his complaints about anti-white racial attacks because his definition of that is meaningless

520
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,600
And even gone to a white person is racial attack when he wants it to be so I'm sure I'll try to save that guy was waving around a bow and arrow on Sunday

521
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:02,976
They got beat up with the victim of a surprise

522
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,072
Kind of idiot flail about with a crossbow on camera

523
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,424
Sure

524
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,032
Is coming out while we're distracted I didn't point out that the government released

525
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
The phone call

526
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,896
Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey kislyak on Friday

527
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:27,296
Well that's when we can all best analyze what the content of that is

528
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
No that's why we have time

529
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:35,488
The readouts clearly show Flynn discussing Obama's sanctions with Russia and how Russia should respond which is something they all said

530
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,352
It was before Trump took office and Flynn said quote

531
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
Let's keep this at even

532
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:47,008
IQ level that would we come in we'll have a better conversation where we're going to go regarding our relation

533
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:53,920
Is the documents even show a follow-up call where kislyak tells Blended Enon escalation on Russia's part was because

534
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
Because of their previous conversation

535
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,552
Some might say this is bad stuff and religion is being engulfed

536
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
Intense protesting seems fishy

537
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:05,440
I'm guessing that I went to never cover these documents and instead focus on

538
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:10,816
Biden saying something about China

539
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,120
You get you come away with the impression that

540
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,680
Trump himself has no idea what's being just

541
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,520
That's what I thought when I read those it says to me

542
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
A man who is

543
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
Hiding this from Trump

544
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
That's what I'm reading in those

545
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
I don't know

546
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,552
I don't know what to search

547
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
Or something

548
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,440
China

549
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,304
Well the Rothschilds

550
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
That's why

551
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
Joe Biden and Bill Gates

552
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,848
Economist cover to cover

553
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,832
See here we have this weird tendency popping up again

554
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:10,720
Alex and a whole lot of his associates really seem to think the messages are being delivered in newspapers and magazines

555
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:16,608
We heard Alex and Steve pieczenik just gossiping feel like newspapers were communicating directly with them

556
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,216
I think the Rothschild still there The Economist

557
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:26,080
Honestly this is stupid and I would make fun of him but honestly I think it might be indicative of like mental

558
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:32,480
What do you do set like how else would you speak to people in power like

559
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,808
There's no way we'll be able to catch that

560
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,904
The Economist

561
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,928
BBC.

562
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:45,280
Everyone knows that the economist is the name of the episode in season 4 of Lost

563
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,864
Where we learned that after leaving the island Syed is becoming assassin

564
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400
For the nefarious Ben Linus

565
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,752
Important

566
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Joking aside

567
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:04,480
Just let this

568
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,016
I'm just along for the ride

569
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,320
The Economist ownership is a weird thing

570
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,720
The structure of the company is pretty bizarre

571
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,024
21% stake in the publication

572
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,608
In 2015 a company called Pearson hit on half of the economist

573
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
Decided to sell

574
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,544
The arrangement was made where the and Galley family through their Investment Company excerpt from 4.7 per cent

575
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:33,664
40% which allowed to previous status quo of powers within the magazine to stay intact

576
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,224
According to an article in Politico

577
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
Economist Independence

578
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:42,368
Is protected by a unique complicated corporate structure that was place in the 1920s

579
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,232
Ownership is widely dispersed among wealthy English families descendants of past editors

580
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,536
And numerous current and former employee

581
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:55,936
Significant changes must be approved by four independent trustees charged with preserving the magazines Legacy

582
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,824
It's ridiculous and childish just to say that the Rothschilds own the magazine use it to disseminate their marching orders

583
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,152
Ridiculous and childish or Alex is so whatever

584
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:10,528
Yeah that's awesome I'm already confused in a little bit angry at everything you just said just like

585
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,856
It shouldn't be that complicated I guess I don't know

586
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:20,512
I don't know if it's to make sure that the legacy of the paper of the magazine stays in

587
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,376
You can't be subject to a hostile takeover

588
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
I understand

589
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
It's just it's just

590
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,520
The frustrating series of things for me to have to understand

591
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:44,320
Just continue to own all of our paper anymore

592
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
Didn't work out great

593
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,928
Alex teases one of his gas

594
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
For the day

595
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
Miss Mexico

596
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,232
Boy

597
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
Badass

598
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Tim Enloe

599
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
He's going to be in studio

600
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
His experience

601
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
Mobile Police federal police

602
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,848
Barney going for Blackwater state

603
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,200
What he sees going on

604
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,224
Case of this poor man

605
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
How suspicious

606
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,624
Different angles of the Gorge

607
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,184
Because none of it

608
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,232
None of it none of it added up

609
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,072
Must have known each other must have been inside dealing out turns out

610
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,544
Nightclub

611
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,272
George Floyd orthoscopics that I'm just saying

612
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
Chances of this

613
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,112
Structurally

614
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
Why should we

615
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,024
Transmission lined up on Friday

616
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,864
If you're listening Alex literally just said I'm not saying I'm just saying

617
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,872
Crime tip well I mean he's playing around with it.

618
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:18,272
Responsible for Library

619
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,624
Got excellent results

620
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
But doesn't want to say that

621
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,400
That's because I didn't even

622
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,984
There's just no words I can come up with express my disgust

623
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,544
The way he's behaving August 29th episode

624
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,616
But I can at least laugh directly in his face

625
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,944
We're having a guest on who used to be in Blackwater to talk about this

626
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
If you told Alex from

627
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,808
320i 2004

628
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,624
He probably tell you to feel your hand you know what

629
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,024
I'm just going to bring in my mercenary friend haha

630
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
Crime

631
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:08,192
Not really a black water thing as I understand it this would be a great I started to have feelings

632
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:08,960
Songs of like

633
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
Like you know that A Christmas Carol

634
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:19,712
This is this is like it's Alex

635
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
But Alex just is what you called

636
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,416
Back in time and she'll probably

637
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:34,048
Scooter rental

638
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,120
2015

639
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Probably

640
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,240
Interesting Lee to Menlo was definitely in Blackwater

641
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
Is it rebranded to later

642
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:50,432
He specifically named in a lawsuit brought by to whistleblowers who claimed they were fired after they raised the alarm that someone in the cup

643
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
Falsifying doesn't

644
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
Marksmanship test

645
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
For security contract

646
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:00,672
Wired story

647
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,696
Inaccurately

648
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:05,280
The Academy's guards were proficient with shotguns and machine guns

649
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,888
Failed to bring an M249 belt-fed machine gun

650
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
Near Kabul

651
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,984
But reported a successful test anyway

652
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:19,360
That person was Tim Enloe

653
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,896
Insecurities forums

654
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:27,296
Now Tim Brunson gun training outfit in Texas on their website you'll find that he was

655
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Water contractor

656
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:32,160
In Iraq and Afghanistan between 2000 for 2012

657
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:36,000
Consider that the Square massacre happened in

658
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
2007

659
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,608
Alex should a f****** hate this guy

660
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,960
Not that he was involved companies

661
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,776
Yeah there for 5 years

662
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,384
Termites

663
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,687
Can I continue

664
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,711
It's tremendously f*****

665
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
You know

666
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
Yeah

667
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,599
So Alex takes a turn for the racist here

668
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:08,767
We don't do a good job this country with people

669
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,583
Araby by another countries

670
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,191
Is Bad Country

671
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,031
Why countries went through a Renaissance

672
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
We want to treat people good

673
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,663
And other places

674
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,199
We've been really good

675
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,551
Overthrow the European ethos

676
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,575
Appreciate

677
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,647
Because you get rid of that people won't stand up for each other

678
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,975
The song about racism

679
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,631
You can see just from that clip how much of a piece of s*** double talkin a****** Alex is

680
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
And that one

681
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:51,775
Cliff he says that certain countries are countries and their better because they have Christianity

682
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
Other places presumably not awake

683
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,871
Countries follow the rules of the jungle

684
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,711
Everything wrapped up his thoughts by saying this is not about race

685
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:05,343
I would ask if it's not about race countries are

686
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,183
If it's not about race why does he defined the United States in Europe as being

687
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,231
White countries to begin with

688
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,559
The unexamined Baseline of Alex's beliefs are racist

689
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
To begin with

690
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,167
Doesn't feel like they are

691
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,215
They're just common sense to him

692
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:27,615
So if someone were to point out for example that America is not a white country

693
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
He thinks it is

694
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,919
Common sense

695
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:36,319
The basic reality

696
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:41,695
United States they said send over all of your boats to put ourselves and

697
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:48,095
I hope you kill a bunch of us along the way and while you're on the boat if you got a capsize us and kill us all

698
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
You know what

699
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,703
That's what we got to do in order to get into that white country

700
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:59,103
Accurate information and imaginary bulshit

701
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,639
Most of what you picked up from

702
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Old school racist

703
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:07,295
He spends basically no time engaging self-reflection and literally Everything feels like an attack to him

704
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,647
Until he decides he doesn't want to anymore

705
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,927
Which probably will be never

706
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:19,839
He's just going to like have these positions that he thinks or just common sense

707
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,863
Good people races

708
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,911
Single white country

709
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
Country

710
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471
To say it to my face

711
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:40,319
16 countries in Africa that Alex would probably call a non-white countries that have higher percentages of the population

712
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
Christendom

713
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,135
Actually looks 8:15

714
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,439
I'm pretty sure he would say that South Africa is awake.

715
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,791
You can hide behind whatever these like

716
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
Freezing if you want

717
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
No bulshit

718
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,143
Yeah people wanted to join White

719
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:58,495
Country so bad whenever a white country with setup in their land

720
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,543
They made sure that it lasted forever

721
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,639
That's why we all sing the national anthem of Rhodesia every morning

722
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
That's how it worked out

723
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,735
So

724
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,807
Box and

725
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,951
It said when the Looting starts the shooting starts

726
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,583
And

727
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
Pretty soon

728
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,543
Shoot rioters that's what you do

729
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,407
Well I mean

730
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,015
This is where Alex is at

731
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:48,415
Shooting protesters

732
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:54,815
Chance to murder people at something that they consider looting and Twitter for some strange

733
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,119
The reason decided that people shouldn't see that

734
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,423
You know like II

735
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,751
It's like the people at the Bundy Ranch were stupid

736
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055
Don't care for their

737
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,847
Are there are there position

738
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,199
The government threatened to shoot all of them I would be opposed to

739
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,063
Sir

740
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,951
When the occupation starts the Shuki patient begins

741
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,791
So we get back to deflecting by talking about China stuff

742
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
You're the sex club

743
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,911
And I found something that Alex

744
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,775
Is the most racist country other than probably North the real planet

745
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
China

746
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,383
One Muslim another country

747
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
China

748
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,711
Literally looks down on black

749
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,271
Zzp

750
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,807
Meijer Hitler

751
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,111
Are you

752
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:57,535
Chinese folks

753
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,351
Alex

754
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,399
Wait a second

755
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
Alex

756
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:12,383
Now is the time for me to hear that all Chinese people look alike that's what I hear

757
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:19,807
Friday the 31st

758
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:24,159
It's amazing

759
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:30,815
It was only our last episode where we covered Alex discussing China's treatment of Muslims

760
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,423
As I pointed out in that episode whenever Alex wants to attack China

761
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
Completely different

762
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,495
The use of their treatment of Muslims as a prop

763
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,567
This is because Alex is a hack and doesn't care about any of this

764
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,871
Also that think about Judaism

765
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,639
True

766
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:49,247
That's from a 2019 book called deceiving the sky inside China's drive for Global

767
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,295
Supremacy by guy named Bill Gertz

768
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,623
Necessarily trust anything

769
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,159
Especially Rancho

770
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,743
In 2019 he was fired by the Washington Free Beacon

771
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,559
BuzzFeed news reported that it was for quote

772
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,863
What replication called an undisclosed

773
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,935
Financial transaction with someone he covered

774
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:12,031
This person is a Chinese billionaire

775
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:18,175
Gertz and long-standing relationship

776
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,015
Wengert's was writing this book about China approach clock for money

777
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,575
Send clock is an opponent of the Chinese government

778
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,415
Allegedly turned him down but Gert approach Williams

779
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,719
Who gave him $100,000

780
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:36,863
The former head of voice of America's Mandarin Services said the Kwok referred to G as quote the money guy

781
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:44,287
This $100,000 was never disclosed his work so severely

782
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,055
Climber's to hazard

783
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,847
Is a shady stuff

784
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
Also because it

785
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:58,623
Miles Kwok is a guy who sued Rodger stone for 100 million dollars

786
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:05,023
Miles Kwok somewhere Rodger for defaming him on Infowars

787
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,839
Advertisements apologizing

788
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:14,495
Rodger claimed Oquawka been convicted of financial crimes and maybe legal donations to Hillary Clinton but when he blamed it on

789
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,543
Bad information he got from

790
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:23,199
Kindly drop the suit on the condition that Rodger profusely apologized and admitted he lied and Rodger

791
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,735
Rodger going to prison

792
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,295
Unrelated

793
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,879
Must have read a blurb about Bill group is

794
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,647
Because that's

795
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:35,743
Pretty much the only place I can find a story from

796
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,303
Iowa Rutgers

797
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,887
Self has been like

798
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:47,519
Hitler was a complete badass is that going to be like Hitler on record

799
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:54,431
We have you on record right into how many of your guests

800
00:49:54,687 --> 00:50:00,831
6 million numbers inflated

801
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,159
Fairly maligning his good name

802
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,695
So I don't know

803
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
Optimistic feeling

804
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,375
About

805
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,911
Things that are going on

806
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,703
In the world

807
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
That's not good

808
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,263
I believe we can win

809
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,567
I believe

810
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,991
Intelligence agencies collaborator

811
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,551
Balls out the glove with minions

812
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,903
The president takes the gloves off

813
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,183
Switch

814
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,463
Section 230

815
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,071
They are at Gabby's are violating our rights

816
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,679
He does all of that very boldly

817
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,007
Have a good chance of winning

818
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,919
Things are going to really go downhill

819
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
We are on a Razor's Edge

820
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
I feel

821
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,623
Absolutely one-hundred-percent moral

822
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
Strong

823
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,439
Proud and good

824
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,487
Episodes

825
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:15,071
Wow wow

826
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:24,031
I was really worried you're going to step on that

827
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:30,175
Moab field moral to sell you food

828
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,199
To do for them to win

829
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,991
Need to go to war with China

830
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:39,391
Of course needs to come out against the protests around the country and bring up its soros's

831
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
Rules for social media company

832
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,231
Alex wants a military

833
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,815
Repressive dictatorship to be put into place

834
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,655
Suggesting or nightmarish

835
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,239
Under complete authoritarian rule

836
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
Likely few allies

837
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,895
Too bad idea honestly it just

838
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,175
Keyhole anyting

839
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
Then

840
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,527
Like a manifestation of Alex's desperation

841
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:12,927
Like be ridiculous extent to which the things he wants to see your he's advocating like would be

842
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Disaster

843
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:17,279
Kind of just lead you to be like okay well this is what Alex has to

844
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:23,423
Do to feel anything anymore what he needs to do in order to

845
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:30,335
Get people to give him money anymore

846
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:35,199
Allow my country that I supposedly love with Constitution that I supposedly have read

847
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:39,295
To completely burn in every aspect in be destroyed

848
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:43,135
In order to get back on Facebook because I am hemorrhaging

849
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,207
So because

850
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:50,815
Got a got a cowboy

851
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,095
The sales man

852
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,935

What day is today. I don't know if

859
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:38,943
I don't care

860
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,247
Is something we see very regularly

861
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,087
Less common is the outward at

862
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,183
We're doing ads and then you use them to launch into extremism

863
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:55,583
Is it as common example of it

864
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
It goes off the rails

865
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,983
Available again

866
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,199
We don't win this 157 days

867
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:15,551
Young like a rocket

868
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:35,007
Clock

869
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,967
Very face, did that much

870
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
Literally

871
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:50,111
Sitting there salivating

872
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:55,231
Whatever energy you got

873
00:54:56,255 --> 00:55:02,399
You want to bend over

874
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,359
Housewise defecate every for 25 minutes

875
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,639
Cut off by the brake

876
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,223
Jesus Christ on our side

877
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,527
Housewives shiting everywhere

878
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,087
Yeah I mean that's bad

879
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,671
You're doing your sales pitch and then you like

880
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:31,071
I got to give all these extreme

881
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,143
About the getting beat up and raped in a gulag

882
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
And

883
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:42,079
I think there's a real danger it's Alex being like this is this is where we fight

884
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,103
Constantly

885
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,967
When is the time to start shooting

886
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,087
I can't imagine how you don't hear that is being like

887
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,855
Okay

888
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:57,695
Well the commies are going to take over unless we start shooting

889
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,375
Power stacked

890
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:11,007
Now is the time now we make our stand by buying slightly

891
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:17,407
Less than eight things out of a b

892
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:23,551
The 8-pack power sack of 9th

893
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
I know it wasn't 8

894
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,671
Yeah it's troubling and I think it's probably through

895
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,719
Worst ankle you can have right about now

896
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:35,071
So also the night before I guess in the morning

897
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,375
Yeah it's one of those things X blurry

898
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,679
Prior to this episode

899
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:44,031
CNN reporter Omar Jimenez

900
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:47,871
Interesting take on this

901
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,367
That's why the police finally

902
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,535
Robert Lee directed gangs

903
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,351
Directing

904
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:09,887
This is like

905
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:13,215
Read look at this level of disconnection from reality Alex lives

906
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,007
Perpetuates

907
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:22,175
Thursday early Friday morning

908
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,455
Wanted to cover the protests

909
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,015
Who's a pretty egregious Act of press

910
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,855
Intimidation police responded

911
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:35,999
In a statement the Minneapolis Police said Jimenez was arrested but released when they realize that he was a recorder

912
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,023
Where does make sense

913
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,607
That's considering

914
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,191
Was arrested because he and his crew wouldn't move

915
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:47,007
But there's videos that sentiment has said quote

916
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,799
We can move back to where you like

917
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,943
We're getting out of your way wherever you want us we'll go out of your way

918
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:59,295
Since this point they're a bit of bunch more journalists to seem to be getting targeted

919
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:05,951
Police were clearly intentionally shooting at Kaitlin rust and her crew as they cover

920
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Protested

921
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,839
On Saturday night New York PD rust up and arrested Huffington Post reporter Christmas

922
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,607
Matthias

923
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:15,167
While he was clearly wearing a press badge around his neck

924
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:19,775
Linda tirado photographer in Minneapolis was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet

925
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,615
And it's been told that she's going to be left to eye with scarring and permanent blindness

926
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,639
And I want my

927
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:29,759
Might be too much to save these please seem to be intentionally trying to hurt journalist

928
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:34,367
Going it doesn't seem like they're going out of their way

929
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
In society

930
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:41,791
They blame copter they blame the media because if the media didn't report on it nobody would know and they would be allowed to be left alone

931
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,607
Probably

932
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:47,167
Purpose of First Amendment

933
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:51,775
And that's supposed to include freedom of the press

934
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:56,383
Exactly dissonance work

935
00:58:56,895 --> 00:59:02,271
The claim that Omar Jimenez

936
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,575
In orchestrating the protests

937
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,135
This is some seriously unhinged

938
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:11,487
Excuses for reporters being abused by police

939
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,511
Which is

940
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,559
Kind of counterintuitive documents

941
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:20,959
But which is why we will see a tweet from Trump tomorrow saying that this is run by operatives

942
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Right

943
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:30,687
Yeah there's another narratives playing around on this day and that was the VIP

944
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,503
Everyone Minnesota

945
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:40,415
It's a big part of his coverage

946
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,231
A big part of it is the fake Soros documents

947
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,303
Just showed you the documents where the Smoking Gun

948
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:48,607
Soros funding plan

949
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,399
Martial law

950
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:53,215
Out-of-town group buses almost

951
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,263
White leftist communist

952
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,799
White people butt

953
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,847
All white people

954
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,455
Manipulate black people in the rioting

955
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,247
Oceanwide

956
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,551
Can install the economy for chicon

957
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,391
Is the local police in Minnesota actually announcing

958
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
Preparing from Arlo

959
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,719
Community leaders

960
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,767
Get me the people that were involved

961
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,047
The criminal contact

962
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,583
We're not known many of

963
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,351
Peloton Studio

964
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,887
And so on

965
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
Who were involved

966
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
Last night that.

967
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,543
Just being here from the sea

968
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,591
So the angle that started to

969
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:34,431
To take shape was there people who are being arrested in Minneapolis were from out of

970
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,735
Your Governor Tim walz

971
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,271
The Minneapolis mayor Jacob

972
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:44,415
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter

973
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:49,023
Governor Waltz of the 80% of the rioters were from outside many Minnesota

974
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:54,911
Mayor Frey said quote I want to be very very clear the people that are doing this are not Minneapolis residence

975
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:58,239
They're coming in largely from outside the city outside the region

976
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:01,055
Chipotle on everything we've built over the last several decades

977
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,687
Mayor Carter said quote every single person we arrested last night I'm told was from out of state

978
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:11,039
Kare 11 News Review jail records and found

979
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:17,439
Almost everybody been arrested for unlawful assembly in Minnesota

980
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:23,071
Opposite

981
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:30,495
But it's all the information that's available

982
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:35,615
Their responsibility to then be able to explain why the data seems to contradict those clients

983
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:41,247
All of them are not commented or said they were operating on information that they had at the time

984
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,271
Baby

985
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,295
Hey if the cop

986
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:46,111
Gave them that information I will accept that

987
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,951
They could have received false information on account of the cops are

988
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,743
Probably not on the protest

989
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:57,375
Possible

990
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:02,239
Pretty much every time there's an outburst of protesting and rioting surrounding non-white population

991
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,055
He's demanding to be hurt stranded Justice be respected

992
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,639
Again let's go back to Bill Cooper's coverage of the LA riot

993
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,247
Riverpark Oladipo

994
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,271
Neighborhood

995
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,295
Telephone

996
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,703
Karma the fires started by

997
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,311
This is a trope

998
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,127
It serves a couple of purposes for people like Bill and Alex

999
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:46,271
What are the main functions is to assure their audiences that they really feel motivated for justice

1000
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:50,367
It's an attempt to knock out the Cornerstone of what the protests are actually about

1001
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:55,743
In bills case was the outrage about cops being acquitted for clearly beating a man almost to death on video

1002
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,887
For killing unarmed.

1003
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,959
Dubai very public attempts to get people to take the matter seriously

1004
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
Things like

1005
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,311
People taking a knee

1006
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,335
Things like every

1007
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:16,735
Everything

1008
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:21,343
You robbed the black community the ability to focus on the central grievance

1009
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,111
Where is

1010
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,647
What you should be discussing

1011
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:28,255
Playing on your audience's unexamined racist beliefs that are stupid

1012
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,023
Easily tricked

1013
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,047
Did the pig bike ride

1014
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:35,423
The other main thing that this does is it allows Bill and Alex to redirect the story for their own purpose

1015
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:40,543
For their audiences this is no longer about whatever the protesters supposed to be about

1016
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,823
It's not about the global

1017
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,847
Start a new world order

1018
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:47,711
The rioters are well-meaning folks got tricked into this whole thing by the meddling cabal

1019
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,015
Smart enough to see through the trick

1020
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,087
Nearby they co-opted the story that has nothing to do with them

1021
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,391
And actually being really about their mission

1022
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,159
Of course it is

1023
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,695
It's always about their mission

1024
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,743
It's it see what it is

1025
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:04,607
Is black people

1026
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:08,447
White people come in and they start causing a race war

1027
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:12,031
Secretly they're using it to oppress black people

1028
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:18,431
The black people definitely shouldn't even go out at all there's no point in protesting it's just going to be white people who are making it about

1029
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,831
Exercise your voice

1030
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:31,231
Sure there were plenty of people at every protest we seen this last week who coming from out of town somewhere but I'm not sure what that

1031
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,327
Proves and I'm sure that there's some people who are behaving in ways that

1032
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:39,423
Maybe the central organizers of a rally do not approve

1033
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
I think there's a lot

1034
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
QuikTrip

1035
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:44,287
Should be dealt with and wrestled with in terms of that

1036
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,591
In terms of a lot of the specifics of it

1037
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,871
It's really hard to assess

1038
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,943
Sperm me especially as things are going on

1039
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,479
The level to which that

1040
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:56,319
Invalidates and I have a place to stay

1041
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:02,207
I can't hear people like Alex saying things like this and not recognized

1042
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:09,631
Yeah I heard there's so much misinformation going around

1043
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,655
It's astonish

1044
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
No like last night

1045
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,007
So many people all of a sudden started tweeting about how

1046
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,335
The KKK word Chicago and 38th in Chicago

1047
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:23,199
And it's like if you're not paying attention

1048
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:26,015
You remember those are parallel Street

1049
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,831
Such thing as Chicago and 38

1050
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:32,415
People are saying

1051
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:38,815
Get out of the Chicago right now

1052
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,863
And there's a ton of stuff that might

1053
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,655
Be misinformation that you don't know

1054
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,495
Exact and that's one of the reasons why difficult for me to discuss

1055
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,311
The ongoing situation

1056
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,847
With any kind of like

1057
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:54,175
Real feeling of comfort

1058
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:59,807
And I don't mean comforting some sort of like

1059
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,135
No there's some of the stuff we will discuss

1060
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,159
I'll tell you like

1061
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,207
This is

1062
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,999
No but like

1063
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,863
It's very difficult

1064
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,399
Aquaman is that

1065
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,191
I believe it

1066
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,751
The underlying conversation

1067
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,287
That is around this

1068
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,055
Is

1069
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
Important

1070
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:22,847
It's valuable

1071
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,383
And I don't

1072
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919
That

1073
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:31,295
Whether a genuine part of anything or a sad offshoot

1074
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:36,671
Burning down a Target or whatever to inconsequential compared to

1075
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,951
The real issues at hand

1076
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,999
And I feel like it's a disservice

1077
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,303
To get to bog down inside

1078
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,351
Losing sight

1079
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,375
The

1080
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:51,775
Tons more footage in MN said he can find of people peacefully Gathering and organizing a protest

1081
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:56,127
Videos you can find communities cleaning up after

1082
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,175
Let's say a business has the windows broke

1083
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,271
There's there's all kinds of stuff that are that are really more important

1084
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,039
Tumi

1085
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,831
Van focusing on the

1086
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,623
Sensationalism of

1087
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,647
Fire

1088
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:13,791
The only thing I hear from everybody that makes me so f****** mad

1089
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:19,935
Evereve everybody like Lori Lightfoot gave a press conference today where she lied to her

1090
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,519
Continue

1091
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,543
Yourself

1092
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:29,151
But all of this now is everybody needs to focus on

1093
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,479
Not being violent to focus on not

1094
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:36,575
Doing any of those things

1095
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,855
None of them say

1096
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,415
Hey here's how we're going to stop

1097
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,695
We're going to make a f***

1098
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,303
Not one of them said to do something

1099
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,655
To hold police accountable for ourselves accountable none of them said that

1100
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,935
They said it's your fault

1101
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:55,007
You're the ones who were burning down

1102
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:59,359
Another National Guard will come in

1103
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:03,967
Yeah it's not it's not us with our I don't know millions of years bulshit

1104
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:14,719
Your fault for being unruly there's no reason for you to get violent

1105
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,511
Add slits. These people are

1106
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
F******

1107
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:21,887
Crazy

1108
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,447
Complicated Elementary This and like

1109
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,983
How much can you trust

1110
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:31,615
Everything you see on Twitter when lot of things are really unverifiable

1111
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,175
For some of those reasons

1112
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,527
Think that a lot of my thoughts are best

1113
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,343
In hindsight

1114
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:45,439
I also want to present what Alex says

1115
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:52,863
When do you know when there is things he brings up that are like this is a meme that was going around

1116
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,167
At the same time sometimes I'm just

1117
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,287
It sometimes

1118
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:01,823
But

1119
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,103
Anyway

1120
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,175
Next clip Alex man

1121
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,711
Man-boy

1122
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,807
Dot-dot-dot Dot.

1123
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
Searching about

1124
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,951
Alright you're done

1125
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
Quick

1126
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Break

1127
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,791
You know that's not true

1128
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,887
Kiss your ass all day long

1129
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,191
The other day

1130
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:30,495
You're scared of me walking Street tonight

1131
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,287
What happened

1132
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,383
Democratic party Plantation

1133
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,431
B73

1134
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,223
Pacific

1135
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:45,343
They were some of the most successful groups their own hotels or restaurants

1136
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,671
Oppression

1137
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,951
Stronger

1138
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:52,511
Okay Alex

1139
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:57,375
It's another one of those really bad I'm not saying I'm just saying

1140
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:04,287
I'm just here in my ears

1141
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:10,431
If you go and listen to any kind of like

1142
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:14,783
White nationalist are white supremacist media

1143
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,599
Even people like Jesse Lee Peterson

1144
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:20,415
Constantly talk about how blacks were better off

1145
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
Undergem

1146
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:28,351
Pretty standard mentality

1147
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:33,983
He's too much of a coward to like to stand by that

1148
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,775
He is suggesting that

1149
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,823
No I mean what you're suggesting

1150
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,103
Here's what your suggest

1151
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,407
They were so much more successful

1152
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431
Under Armour

1153
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:00,863
So Alex has his black Blackwater buddy

1154
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,167
I really care what this guy's got

1155
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:07,775
Responsible

1156
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:15,967
Corner at in the autopsy room

1157
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,527
Tim died of a sudden cardiac

1158
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,319
Due to the toxic

1159
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:21,855
Chain

1160
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
Associated with

1161
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,439
Restrain

1162
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,815
When you get out

1163
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:37,727
So this guy from Blackwater is here on the show making up details about the preliminary autopsy that

1164
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,007
Examiner is released

1165
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:45,919
The actions of the police health conditions and quote any potential intoxicants contribute to the debt

1166
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:52,063
I'm guessing it was Alex

1167
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:55,647
And reports that George Floyd had been arrested in December 2000

1168
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,463
For possession of less than

1169
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,791
Which is being reported as in being on cocaine when he was killed

1170
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:05,631
At this point there's no evidence to support this conclusion

1171
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:09,471
That is later shown to be the case these dudes are still just making this up

1172
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,543
They aren't I bet he was on coke

1173
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
Definitive thing

1174
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,335
Which is lying

1175
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:19,199
A strong suspicion that if Lloyd was on cocaine

1176
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:25,343
It's pretty it's a pretty simple test they could run and would likely show up in the coroner's report but instead

1177
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,391
Potential in toxic

1178
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:33,791
Seems weird for the corner to just speculate on whether or not their words

1179
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:37,887
Weird but I don't know

1180
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:44,287
Of course not until there's more information available it's impossible to make a determination

1181
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,311
Assuming facts

1182
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
This case

1183
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:49,151
Alex and his Blackwater buddy aren't playing the same game

1184
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:54,783
They've decided without evidence that was on Koke because that supports the narrative that they're trying to establish

1185
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
Sucks

1186
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:03,999
You know who is it was it who was it that the guy who's like boring isn't torture I'll get waterboarded whenever

1187
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:08,863
My old friend

1188
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,655
No you can't post clips

1189
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:18,591
Yeah yeah that was a guy f****** f****** two seconds or whatever

1190
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,919
Yeah Blackwater guy how about

1191
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
So

1192
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,271
Address of the show's Alex Hawkins

1193
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:32,671
Twitter are witches

1194
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:39,071
Good work Barn I really really wouldn't care about this even under the most boring circumstances

1195
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:43,167
After they have disliked bull session about how great Trump is

1196
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,191
For doing this job

1197
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,983
Alex brings on Andrew torba

1198
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,519
The guy who runs Gab

1199
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:51,359
Really weird to see that be the person who you want to bring

1200
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,407
Discuss transplant executive order

1201
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,687
Because if it goes into effect

1202
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,479
Is basically dead

1203
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,551
There's no way that's I can operate if doorbell becomes

1204
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,831
Personally responsible for

1205
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,623
The things that you post on there

1206
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,903
And guess what

1207
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,487
He's not so stupid to not recognize that that's the case

1208
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,559
Leads Alex getting completely blindsided

1209
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,679
They tried to shut him down that demonize this

1210
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:21,055
And he's here to watch

1211
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,383
This is a very strong-willed what do you think

1212
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,967
Actually totally disagree Alex

1213
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,231
Relation is not

1214
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,791
In this case at least

1215
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:48,191
Understand this conversation back and forth where

1216
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,215
Come to Subaru

1217
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,239
They taught

1218
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:56,639
By recognizing that yeah okay well if you write the executive order only applies to the companies we wanted to apply

1219
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,175
That'll be great

1220
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,015
I'm protected from

1221
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,575
Responsibility

1222
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,855
Yeah I'm fine

1223
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:11,231
As long as I'm not destroyed

1224
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,071
The same mentality

1225
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,863
I'm not going to be sexy

1226
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:23,263
Love it.

1227
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,615
It's this is it one of the Cornerstone

1228
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,175
The school of the right

1229
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,711
Victimhood narrative

1230
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,991
So we jump

1231
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,527
May 30th

1232
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,807
Do you jump to Saturday

1233
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:39,903
And this episode is not very good

1234
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,183
Important to do because

1235
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,743
Is the day that Alex is fake

1236
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:47,327
Gets assaulted in Austin

1237
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,863
Scoresandodds

1238
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:51,679
Excited about that

1239
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,471
It starts before

1240
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,799
So that doesn't have we don't

1241
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,591
Alex

1242
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,175
LPS horses on this story

1243
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
I've been

1244
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,247
Security

1245
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,271
Personal shot

1246
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
And killed

1247
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
Different parts

1248
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:09,855
In the country

1249
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,135
Police have been shot

1250
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
The media

1251
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:19,327
So this is his coverage on Saturday

1252
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,167
Plenty of available

1253
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:25,727
Discuss by police clearly assaulting people on provoke

1254
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:30,847
He's covering the story

1255
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,687
Alex doesn't speak in specifics and he never will because he doesn't know any

1256
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,455
Specifics

1257
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,991
Is about creating a

1258
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,575
To make his audience scared and hateful towards protest

1259
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:46,463
There's only one contractor who was killed

1260
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,815
And there's no evidence even a protester was responsible for that

1261
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:56,191
I don't know what tops Alex's claiming were shot discuss specifics all engaged

1262
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,007
From what I can tell the violence being done

1263
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,799
Polices far outweigh the violence Direct

1264
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,567
Did toward them

1265
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:04,895
But it's complicated situation to extract exact details from

1266
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,431
Still ongoing

1267
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:10,015
Just why it's such a massive disservice for Alex to speak of these vague

1268
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,319
Generalities has nowhere

1269
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,855
Yeah the concrete hasn't tried yet

1270
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:20,511
That's kind of what's going on

1271
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:25,119
Broadcast by centering the idea of violence against police is the most important element of the story

1272
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,167
By doing this if the subject

1273
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,471
The police brutalizing protesters comes up

1274
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:32,799
You can justify it by saying it was only because the cops are getting shot

1275
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,871
This isn't intentional strategy to create

1276
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Yep

1277
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:42,015
So a lot of people sending me messages that

1278
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,295
It was in the tank

1279
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:46,879
When it was two testing Austin

1280
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:47,903
It is not the case

1281
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,927
He was in studio

1282
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,487
Destroyer

1283
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Was there

1284
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,047
Howard but it's interesting because

1285
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,375
When Alex starts off the show he discusses his people in the field

1286
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,935
And if you know who they are

1287
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,263
You come and get a sense of what the game they were trying to play is

1288
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,407
Recovery map

1289
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,551
Demonstration

1290
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
Saturday

1291
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:21,439
You can kind of see how Alex is strategies going to play out

1292
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:24,767
In terms of trying to create a publicity stunt

1293
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,839
He does this by sending to people into the field working

1294
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:30,143
Together but using very different tactic

1295
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,983
Owen Shroyer shows up in the fake tank which is meant to draw

1296
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:39,871
Alex has every reason to know that there's a good chance that things getting egged at least and probably worse

1297
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:44,735
Indian people spray painted on a try to immobilize it and then ultimately chased it off

1298
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,807
This would be good scary footage

1299
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,111
Ultimately

1300
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,903
Supposed to be the guy who

1301
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,183
Stand up

1302
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:58,815
Put them in their place so try to roll a tank into a protest and gets chased off with graffiti on his car

1303
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:05,215
Optics that you want

1304
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,263
Between

1305
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:10,335
Hit them with Tales everybody does that right

1306
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,639
That's where Savannah Hernandez comes in

1307
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,943
She's someone who almost no one knows

1308
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:20,831
Recognizes working for Infowars

1309
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:27,487
She doesn't

1310
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:32,351
From an unrelated outfits

1311
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,679
Maybe even about the attack on Alex's

1312
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:40,031
Completely differently

1313
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,567
We're just going out there getting clown

1314
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
Owen shows up

1315
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,127
To draw the Heat

1316
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,431
He is the Infowars guy who's there

1317
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,991
In Savannah tricks people into thinking that she's not working

1318
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,319
Use to build an arrow

1319
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:55,391
Maybe it's that all the protesters want to kill

1320
01:19:55,647 --> 01:20:00,511
I hate real journalists hate the First Amendment whatever whatever the case is

1321
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,399
And then Savannah cat

1322
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,935
Infowars reporter

1323
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,959
Good cop

1324
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:12,287
It's a pretty clear setup and its Airline

1325
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:17,152
It's one of the reasons why this is a giant

1326
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,992
Catholics to misrepresent who you work for unless your undercover work

1327
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:25,600
This instance is probably one where you could make an argument that Savannah safety could be threatened

1328
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,392
By being an enforcer reporter there

1329
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,416
And that's the like

1330
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,440
Could be justified

1331
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:34,048
But that kind of goes out the window when you consider they're also sending

1332
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,096
It kind of doesn't make sense

1333
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,192
It did disappoint me that they didn't flip it over and Light It Up

1334
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:46,592
Because I would have like to hear Alex scream

1335
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:52,992
He claims that they bought it now original your rentals snow

1336
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,528
The reality of that isn't

1337
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,064
Particularly don't care

1338
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:02,464
Because like

1339
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,768
Yeah it was actually you will get flat

1340
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,840
Oh yeah

1341
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,656
Destroy

1342
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,264
So anyways

1343
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:21,920
Aleksandr blood courses still pushing the fake Soros documents Center

1344
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,480
This is the media winding up

1345
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:26,784
Remember the homeless

1346
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:27,808
Security documents

1347
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
Remember

1348
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,880
Those numbers

1349
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,256
George soros's son with

1350
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,656
Uniform

1351
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:48,544
So now their Homeland Security documents

1352
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:54,944
Jamaican all this s*** KGB Homeland Security MI6

1353
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,760
Whatever China's God according to him

1354
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,296
So CNN

1355
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,600
It's paid by China and therefore

1356
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,368
Reporter

1357
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,648
Orchestrating protest

1358
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,464
Undoubtedly

1359
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,304
China though they're all got their fingers in so many pies

1360
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,584
I mean they bought off

1361
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,120
They bought off

1362
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
Autopsy

1363
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,008
I'll give you fifty bucks

1364
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,032
They bought off

1365
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,824
It's on the news

1366
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,872
When the leaders of those countries

1367
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,784
That I'm going to do a French accent there

1368
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,808
Party paste

1369
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,576
For the gun

1370
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,392
MO

1371
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,160
Of the French

1372
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,024
So cops are bad

1373
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,816
Meu police

1374
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:43,840
84

1375
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,376
G

1376
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,144
G

1377
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,032
Doesn't sound right

1378
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:53,824
Manush

1379
01:22:55,104 --> 01:23:01,248
So I want to make is that at this point I'm not sure Alex even remember his wedgies real name is

1380
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:07,648
Pronounces it that way because it's like a derisive thing or because he

1381
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,464
You doing it wrong

1382
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,304
I don't know

1383
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:20,704
To talk about from all accounts actually buys a lot of Weaponry from European countries

1384
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:26,592
I can't find any sources to back up what he saying it because he's the one making the claim it's his responsibility to cite a source

1385
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,640
He's just making it up

1386
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:35,296
If it isn't the news and it's all over the place back in this up should be no problem for him so I'll wait for that to happen

1387
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:41,952
Knockout is that is it is just these friends L thing thank you China

1388
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,768
Or whatever

1389
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:51,424
It's like a business sponsoring a local Little League team the new China buys of their uniforms they have to put China on

1390
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,752
The back of the

1391
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,544
The next Club Alex I think

1392
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:00,640
I think you think so he's got like a real Haymaker knockout punch

1393
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:03,456
It turns out all he's really doing

1394
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,480
Is revealing

1395
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:08,320
Maybe videos says real white supremacy problem

1396
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,648
Hands up

1397
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,072
Lenny's Rider

1398
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,912
White Liberals are hands of photoshoot

1399
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,496

1400
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:28,800

1401
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,896
Blackhawks panic 112000

1402
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,176
John Black

1403
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:35,968
Wyoming

1404
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,992

1405
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,784
Hispanic on white

1408
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,000
Ratio black-on-white

1409
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,048
And you can argue well

1410
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:04,128
So Alex is driving out some crime statistics in an attempt to make the argument people commit more crimes

1411
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:09,504
I don't want this is an argument that

1412
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,320
Or you can imagine

1413
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,392
Call here isn't to talk about actual Dynamics

1414
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
Some crime

1415
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,208
Violence

1416
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,024
People is the preferred Target of those threats

1417
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:28,192
Supremacist

1418
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,728
Criminality

1419
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,264
It exists in black people

1420
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,104
And even if Alex isn't directly saying that it has built on that sound

1421
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,176
Could possibly not be aware of that

1422
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:40,736
This analysis of crimes

1423
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:44,832
Mystics you know what it what it does is it takes all the context away from numbers

1424
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:52,512
More thorough analyses have been done likely 2014 Bureau statistics Bureau of Justice

1425
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,536
6:30

1426
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:58,912
Differences that you can find Rachel way when you control

1427
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,680
Poverty

1428
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:05,568
They also found her done to alleviate poverty violent crime rates went down regardless of race

1429
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:11,712
Reese's missa interpretations of crime statistics like this are Mainstays and white supremacist discourse

1430

Motivate dylann roof

In Charleston

1435
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:24,512
Whether Alex wants to accept it or not he's continuing in that Legacy

1436
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,560
Also in this is crucially important

1437
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,584
These statistics are

1438
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,376
Completely irrelevant to the conversation

1439
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,192
These protesters are are meant to be forcing

1440
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:37,568
The conversation is around a lack of accountability for police officers who killing victimized non-white people

1441
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,152
And no amount of random out of context crime statistics out

1442
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:41,920
Come up with

1443
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,456
Love any bearing on that

1444
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:50,112
He's trying to move goal post because he feels like this crime statistic conversation is one where is narratives of white victimhood standard

1445
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,392
Better chance of success

1446
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:58,304
All he's doing is making the argument that maybe police should be killing black people kind of

1447
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,376
What he's doing it without having to accept the consequences

1448
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,424
Saying that out loud

1449
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,728
Stocks

1450
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,824
Alright

1451
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,920
Liberal protest

1452
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:20,320
Hands up don't shoot these people are out at protest cops are in discriminately pepper spraying people

1453
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:26,208
These people are out in the streets while fires are going on everywhere around them saying hands up don't shoot

1454
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:28,768
Well you put your dumbfucks in it

1455
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,816
And you don't even go to a

1456
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,096
In protest

1457
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,888
Dairy

1458
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:40,288
Darius on Sunday but I'm not entirely sure

1459
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:46,176
So excessive promoting

1460
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:47,456
I don't know if I want to say I have a

1461
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,760
Call to action but I want to make

1462
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:51,808
Ford.com

1463
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:55,904
4 / 0

1464
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
URL doesn't

1465
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304
Paul Revere

1466
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:10,752
The first thing I think is really funny is that suggesting that his audience post links to

1467
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,032
Videos

1468
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,568
You are else

1469
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,592
Just kind of stupid

1470
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:20,736
All the time and I usually just ignore it

1471
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,504
Discussion

1472
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:26,368
Alex is directly flouting the bands on social media sites and using it as a marketing

1473
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:33,536
Until social media sites wise up and realize they're dealing with people who constantly try to get around the rules because their business model.

1474
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,304
Sonic

1475
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,328
They're going to lose

1476
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:41,984
They sell blockers so Infowars can't go up but I was supposed to all the same articles on newswars of all the same

1477
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:46,336
Incontact

1478
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,456
If the goal is to restrict Infowars ability to perpetuate their lies and misinformation

1479
01:28:57,856 --> 01:29:01,952
Directions are symbolic and ultimately at least partially

1480
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,232
Contagious to Alex

1481
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,024
Don't feel good

1482
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:11,424
Get David Knight off of there too I'm sick of him being unsure.

1483
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:19,360
David

1484
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,736
Impulse

1485
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,296
Yeah he's got to go

1486
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,320
Buckeye

1487
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:34,976
So Alex in the snakes clips

1488
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,280
House which seems like a good idea

1489
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:43,680
Johnny's

1490
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,704
Delivered

1491
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,568
Question you got to ask

1492
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,896
The freaking game folks

1493
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:54,944
Believe

1494
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,736
This isn't like all the BS

1495
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,528
About

1496
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,320
Imaginary

1497
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,368
GameStop

1498
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,144
Hugh tells you don't go out and protest

1499
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:20,800
The White House

1500
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,104
For America for Trump

1501
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,688
Tomorrow morning

1502
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,224
He doesn't know

1503
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:32,320
Some groups that don't do anything don't be involved

1504
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,112
You heard the president tweet

1505
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,904
Today, d.c.

1506
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,184
Surround the White House

1507
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,400
No

1508
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:48,960
No

1509
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,640
There's some good peep

1510
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,736
Alex

1511
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,696
Care about this dangerous

1512
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,232
Everybody has

1513
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,536
The right to protest and what have you but like

1514
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
I think

1515
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,096
The odds are not good

1516
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:21,984
Of people doing so responsibly

1517
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,032
Calling themselves to

1518
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:29,920
Protects the White House of f*** out of here

1519
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,456
To protect the White House

1520
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:37,856
What are the highly most highly guarded places in the f****** world seems like trouble

1521
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:41,440
Millie Weaver was coming up

1522
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:45,536
And tries to tries to start their interview here

1523
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:47,072
We have audio IC

1524
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:50,400
So we are going to go to her

1525
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,472
Male nurse

1526
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:56,544
And then he

1527
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,016
Billy your back

1528
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:08,064
How big is what's happening right now

1529
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,600
What is your Intel

1530
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,768
What's your view

1531
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:26,240
So

1532
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,616
Skeleton Crew

1533
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,384
Figuring it out

1534
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:36,992
Figuring it out should have figured it out

1535
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:40,832
Yeah man

1536
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,648
Exact same scenario playing out so I can

1537
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:48,000
It's cool Alex's chill about it inside like Special Report

1538
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:51,584
Emiliano be fine

1539
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:54,912
Amazing

1540
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:56,960
Skype

1541
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,032
Tomorrow the Sunday show

1542
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,920
No like no one at Alex's with no one can figure this out

1543
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,456
It's a simple issue

1544
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,736
You could have

1545
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,760
Call her

1546
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:12,064
Use the phone

1547
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,856
This is it this is why

1548
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:18,208
Do you have the mark of the beast

1549
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:19,232
Detach

1550
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,512
The best

1551
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:23,328
Like a regular problem

1552
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:29,984
Well we can only use we can only use platforms that have a band music

1553
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,384
We don't need milk

1554
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,408
Because Owen

1555
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,688
Get back to the studio

1556
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:43,040
This point and Analysis

1557
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:45,600
Is so excited

1558
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:50,976
36

1559
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,792
Victory here in Austin on that footage

1560
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,120
I mean you're going to have

1561
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,144
Communist

1562
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,936
Democrat

1563
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:03,008
Out in Austin Texas

1564
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:06,336
Unless 100 immediately

1565
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:10,432
I mean start over

1566
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,248
Piranhas

1567
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:20,160
Alex loves excited about it

1568
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:25,792
Such a good representation

1569
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:38,592
And it gets so good to him and talking about this this attack on his truck

1570
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,872
Really like swing for the fences

1571
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,688
And see these people don't understand that the only reason

1572
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,992
They feel so Robin live

1573
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,784
That is not because other people

1574
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,136
Probably getting ready to

1575
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,160
You know they want to talk

1576
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:03,424
Gallery

1577
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,960
F*** you

1578
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,984
So

1579
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:10,336
Alex

1580
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,896
The Water Guy

1581
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:18,016
No that's why he's special

1582
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,808
Security's got to be in the tank

1583
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:22,368
It's really interesting because

1584
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:28,000
Mirrors the exact same talkingpoi

1585
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:32,864
You know there's still some stuff that needs to be talked about with George Floyd

1586
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:38,240
The autopsy said that he actually died from an overdose

1587
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:42,592
It's not

1588
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:47,712
It's not too effectually backed up trying to craft a new story

1589
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:51,296
The same things that people do nationalist folks

1590
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,576
Cindy all right

1591
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:57,440
In the aftermath of the United right rally with the narrative and talking to Heather heyer

1592
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,720
I had a heart attack

1593
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,512
It's the same

1594
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:03,072
Sort of thing

1595
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:06,144
Free Speech whatsoever

1596
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,168
However

1597
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,960
If you say some b******* like that

1598
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,520
You have to be wearing full KKK rope

1599
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:12,800
That way

1600
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:14,592
Date nobody's restricting your speech

1601
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,640
But everybody knows what you're saying

1602
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,664
I like that

1603
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:20,480
It seems tough to implement

1604
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:23,808
We'll just have one above everyone person's head

1605
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:27,904
Is that can descend to matter where they will report

1606
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:34,048
Suggestion let's send it to the committee I'll see what I can do

1607
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,328
Android

1608
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,352
No

1609
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,168
Blackwater guy discussing

1610
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,472
The protest

1611
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,240
Competitive

1612
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,592
Competitive nature I think

1613
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,872
To some of these groups

1614
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:58,112
Footage

1615
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:00,416
The money and the donations and everything

1616
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,208
To support our cause

1617
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,488
And if you look

1618
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,168
Attacks

1619
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,544
That's exactly what's going on here

1620
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,336
Except the sponsors are

1621
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,616
These big private individual

1622
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:20,896
Ride that donated

1623
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,688
Search

1624
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,224
So what's going on

1625
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,272
Is the protesters

1626
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:32,672
LaRosa's video contest

1627
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,952
Justifying their budget

1628
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,024
Rihanna

1629
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,840
A real mess

1630
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:42,656
About you or around you

1631
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,960
So are we close out this 30th

1632
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:47,776
Special episode

1633
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:51,616
Alex is just like it's

1634
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:56,480
Like we keep saying and have been saying for a while that's like he just wants Trump to become a dictator

1635
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,272
And will accept whatever

1636
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:03,392
Now he's sort of making peace with that a bit more open and upfront about it

1637
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,184
He just

1638
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,352
You got to get behind

1639
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:14,400
What does omnipresent mean

1640
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,520
Short

1641
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:21,568
Along

1642
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,336
150

1643
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,968
Tchaikovsky get behind the president

1644
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,248
I think

1645
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:31,296
Has the people behind him

1646
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:37,184
Think what

1647
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,208
And then

1648
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:41,024
People catch up he needs to take a leak

1649
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,816
Citizenship around the White House

1650
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,144
Take that don't do that

1651
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,336
Yeah I guess

1652
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,640
Great behind the president

1653
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,944
Questioningly

1654
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,576
One thing I think is

1655
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:09,440
It's listening to me

1656
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:11,744
Is that even Owen Shroyer

1657
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,048
Can recognize a lack of leadership

1658
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,840
Even Owen record

1659
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:18,144
Leadership in the wrong direction

1660
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,448
Directions

1661
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,264
They are even able to take a

1662
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,056
Take a finger put it on the pulse

1663
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:28,640
And recognize we have no leadership.

1664
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,688
Yeah

1665
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:36,064
Yep we not jump to the 31st

1666
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,696
You know

1667
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,280
And other number

1668
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,072
Conspiracies that are floating around

1669
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:50,912
Everywhere started to feel a lot like

1670
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:53,472
Going back and looking at the Boston bombing

1671
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:55,008
.

1672
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,848
The immediate aftermath of things happening Alex would just throw whatever

1673
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:05,248
Really feels like on Sunday trying to do he's trying to

1674
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:09,600
Directions as possible

1675
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:11,392
Maybe there was a cop game

1676
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:14,464
There's a bit of a

1677
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,512
But I think it accelerates quite a bit

1678
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,792
And it begins

1679
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:18,560
Immediately

1680
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:20,096
On the 31st

1681
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:23,680
There's an article at infowars.com

1682
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,704
Elsa doll

1683
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:28,288
Bricks delivered

1684
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:29,568
Dallas

1685
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,848
City Hall and police

1686
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:32,896
Fireball

1687
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,176
Minnesota

1688
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:36,992
The left

1689
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,808
Soros

1690
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:43,904
Martial law in America

1691
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:50,816
So the only source Alex has on a brick story is ground on

1692
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:54,400
In a location that was not near any

1693
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:57,472
Construction site and someone must have put them there on purpose

1694
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:06,176
Must have been an employee store

1695
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:13,600
No idea what's going on in that video on Twitter

1696
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:20,000
I've seen some people online say that the bricks were there because there was a construction project at the intersection involving a replace

1697
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:24,352
Couldn't tell you if that's accurate or not I can't find any confirmation

1698
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:30,496
It really doesn't make sense though this would be a spot where Soros and wanted his minions would just drop off a pallet of bricks

1699
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,264
For no reason

1700
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:38,176
Video shot outside of a federal building so you would assume there be a decent chance that there might be some surveillance around it

1701
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:44,064
And I know that we recently just talked about how there were cameras pointed outside the Murrah building in Oklahoma City and that was

1702
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:44,832
Suspicious

1703
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,880
But this is a different situation

1704
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:52,512
The building in this video it was shot outside

1705
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:54,304
Federal Building in Courthouse

1706
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,400
Which was the site of the shooting on June 17th 2019

1707
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,960
If there were some failures and cameras at that point

1708
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:04,032
Afterwards the building raised their security considerably

1709
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:07,360
Someone dropped off a pallet of bricks outside that Federal Building

1710
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:10,176
So let's see if that ever

1711
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,968
Operation

1712
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,736
Dumbo Drop

1713
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,504
Kind of

1714
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:20,160
There's a helicopter would have scattered

1715
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:23,232
The person who made that video It's Been Awhile

1716
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:28,608
Protesters

1717
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:29,376
Cause trouble

1718
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,472
I don't see any confirmation that there

1719
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:36,288
Mysteriously dropped there

1720
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,640
So I'm going to need more on that that's that's not good that's not good enough for me

1721
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,408
Yep

1722
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,944
So

1723
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,504
Has realized that to the National Guard

1724
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,040
Getting involved what you should be against

1725
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,064
You would think

1726
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,112
Against

1727
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:56,512
To send the military into places you should

1728
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:59,584
There's a video

1729
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:05,984
National Guard shooting people on their porches

1730
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,080
He's for it

1731
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,360
Of course

1732
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,920
Minneapolis-Saint Paul

1733
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,456
National Guard

1734
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:23,136
Rubber bullet

1735
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:26,720
Twitter

1736
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:32,608
Dash

1737
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:36,704
Civil War

1738
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:38,752
I asked for

1739
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:44,128
This doesn't seem like what mister anti-police

1740
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:50,784
You shouldn't be like well yeah but we stayed is what you got to do when there's no

1741
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:55,648
Multiple documentaries called police scanner

1742
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:58,976
We're at the point now where he might as well be like

1743
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:02,048
And I do believe that people should have to

1744
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:04,864
Soldiers in their homes

1745
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:09,728
Just do a complete about-face on literally everything

1746
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:14,336
You got you got to give him a bath

1747
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:17,920
The Constitution

1748
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:23,552
So Alex is building here on this episode about his conspiracies about George

1749
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,320
George Floyd

1750
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:25,856
Return to death

1751
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:26,880
Into a grande

1752
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
Conspiracy

1753
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,512
Evolve

1754
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,216
The Smollett case

1755
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:42,240
Just like Stone

1756
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,032
I'm not saying you did

1757
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:56,576
The items I know information about the other cop knowing George Floyd

1758
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,624
More like I can't find any story about it on there

1759
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,440
Also I don't care if someone has done p***

1760
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:05,536
Nomex work doesn't make someone suspicious or more likely to be involved in criminal activity

1761
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:10,400
I want to do whatever you can throw spaghetti

1762
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,936
The guy who Police murdered

1763
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:14,240
In order to make that murder more except

1764
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,264
Audible to his audience

1765
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:21,920
I'm not saying that he's I don't think he deserves to die and I definitely think that there was an incompetent

1766
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,688
Please officer

1767
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:28,832
He regularly drove 25 miles an hour in a 30 mile an hour speed zone so I look

1768
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:31,392
I'm not saying it's not that they deserved

1769
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:35,744
I'm just saying that you know what don't worry about

1770
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,512
Sure

1771
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,792
Good good

1772
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,816
Thanks buddy.

1773
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:45,216
Is also continuing to push the out-of-town

1774
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:49,824
Specials

1775
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,360
Alex is still pushing

1776
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,384
And then

1777
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:58,016
I can't believe how fun it is

1778
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,552
You got all of them coming on

1779
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,344
Couldn't

1780
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,112
Sing

1781
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,136
These are out of town

1782
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,208
The governor's daughter

1783
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,488
Scott Direct

1784
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:18,240
Leaving aside the fact

1785
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:21,056
Governor waltzes

1786
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:24,896
About rumors about the National Guard

1787
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:25,664
Deployed

1788
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,712
Take me to takes time to mobilize them

1789
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:34,368
This is a full-on qanon theory that Alex is repeating

1790
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,392
Issuing directives

1791
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,416
Protesters

1792
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:41,536
Stealthily through Twitter because she tweeted about the National Guard taking time to

1793
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,816
Make no mistake about it

1794
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:49,216
Secret Cove

1795
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:51,520
That's the level of both of these working

1796
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:54,336
The governor's daughter is secretly running antifa

1797
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,896
The governor's daughter is

1798
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:12,000
Somebody's running antifa the governor of Minnesota

1799
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:15,840
What is daughter

1800
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,376
The children

1801
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:27,872
Alex abrines

1802
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,176
House Intrigue around Infowars

1803
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:35,040
Twitter

1804
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,320
You don't matter

1805
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:38,624
Probably not pay did not say that

1806
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:42,720
And you know what

1807
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,816
Newswars.com today

1808
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,376
The pig

1809
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,400
Police

1810
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,424
Kill the police

1811
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,496
Unabomber crap

1812
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,360
Because of these people

1813
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,640
Anti-free speech

1814
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,688
Now there it is

1815
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,296
So it just goes on

1816
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,160
The big Tommy's

1817
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:14,464
I don't know about this man

1818
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:18,816
The only website covering this story is Infowars itself so I don't know about this

1819
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:23,936
Hope it doesn't seem quite right about it

1820
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:28,032
Almost no one outside of his listeners even know exist

1821
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,312
Do that

1822
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:35,200
It makes no sense to have no impact to hack newswars

1823
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,480
Alex

1824
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,784
Don't know exist how we'll get

1825
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:45,184
A huge amount of attention to hack a website and no one will know about right

1826
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:51,584
It's like

1827
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:55,424
If I were Alex I would hundred percent call this a false flag

1828
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:01,056
But I'm not Alex decided take over a site that literally no one cares about

1829
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:03,872
And I'm sure no one would have noticed unless I was brought up

1830
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:04,896
Possible

1831
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:10,528
Completely fabricating DDOS attacks and pasta

1832
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:15,648
Let's move on with some of his previous Behavior

1833
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,952
Bored hacker

1834
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:21,536
Also I don't believe for a second that protesters are saying

1835
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,584
You got kicked off Facebook and Twitter

1836
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:28,704
I also don't believe that Alex is Securities any different

1837
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,264
For newswars and Infowars today

1838
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:34,336
Trying to take over anything it would be

1839
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,432
Distance doesn't pass the smell test I don't think it would be that far

1840
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:42,784
Talk more about this Brick story in Dallas here

1841
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,344
Economy

1842
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,624
By the way

1843
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,232
Boy we have a prize

1844
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:52,768
We haven't

1845
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:56,864
15 bricks

1846
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:08,384
Black folks the people

1847
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,664
Be right there

1848
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:12,736
Fabricating details about that

1849
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:16,320
Multiple pallets 15 police station

1850
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,856
We have them delivering it

1851
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:24,256
We have existed

1852
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:27,840
Twitter of them standing next to some bricks

1853
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:34,240
George Soros

1854
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:37,056
Pallets of bricks

1855
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:45,760
Today

1856
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:47,808
Receipt for Soros

1857
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:48,576
Fork truck

1858
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:53,184
So in addition to Alex's pushing

1859
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:56,256
Narratives that are about

1860
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:58,304
Police setting fires in New York

1861
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,608
Sis South

1862
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:02,400
In a false-flag kind of thing

1863
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,960
People doing

1864
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:08,544
You know my position on all that stuff

1865
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,568
I don't know

1866
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,848
I don't know

1867
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:14,944
If there are instigators who are infiltrating in some

1868
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,504
Capacity check

1869
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,296
White-supremacist folks

1870
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:22,368
Accelerationist types

1871
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:25,952
I don't know some of them are very misguided

1872
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,256
Total anti-statist

1873
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,048
I don't know

1874
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:31,328
Like I can

1875
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:32,352
Pretend to know

1876
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,120
And I don't

1877
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:34,400
We will know

1878
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:38,752
For a while

1879
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:40,800
May be able to identify things

1880
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:43,360
I don't know

1881
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:48,736
But I do think that the way Alex is covering the stuff is still a responsible given that

1882
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,784
He doesn't know either

1883
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,344
Footage in New York

1884
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,648
Volkswagen

1885
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,440
Your classic for this

1886
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:59,744
Very creepy photos looking like the police percent

1887
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,584
Dylan

1888
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,608
We're going to pass

1889
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,144
Configure tonight

1890
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,264
Because the truth

1891
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,688
So it seems like asking those questions is equivalent to Truth for him

1892
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:21,248
And that's a problem

1893
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:23,552
Him asking those questions

1894
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:30,464
Him asking questions

1895
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,232
In order to

1896
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:37,632
Start s*** or whatever he has

1897
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,680
Soros dropped off those bricks

1898
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:41,472
You know that

1899
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:45,056
He is so irresponsible

1900
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:46,336
The asking those questions

1901
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:48,640
You lying for

1902
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:49,664
It's it's

1903
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,480
He just has to recognize at a certain point

1904
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:55,808
Just asking questions

1905
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:57,600
For someone else before him

1906
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:03,744
Dangerous

1907
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:04,768
That's his Northstar

1908
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:09,632
Weird white people tricks

1909
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:12,192
Don't forget

1910
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,216
Left

1911
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:17,568
A little bit of footage that Savannah Hernandez got She Was Out

1912
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:18,336
The field

1913
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:24,736
I think it's about what you'd expect actually it's version for Infowars that could be

1914
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,040
I do think

1915
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:30,624
Sincerely that their intention was to try this thing

1916
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,976
Right and just talked to a communist

1917
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:36,256
Is like ice

1918
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:38,048
Support food not bombs

1919
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:41,120
And they think that this is like a big

1920
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:42,912
They're so stupid

1921
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:44,960
A communist

1922
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:46,752
Austin Texas whiskey

1923
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,544
Reporter

1924
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,688
Run by Communists or

1925
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,480
Not the songwriter

1926
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:57,504
The-Dream

1927
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,296
Where do you think

1928
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,112
We go after this what do you think

1929
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:06,720
Well that's another

1930
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:07,744
Demonstration tomorrow

1931
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:14,400
Is doing

1932
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,664
Organizations

1933
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:26,944
Actually trying to change

1934
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:41,280
So join an organization

1935
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,584
Granix organization

1936
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:45,888
That's what I recommend

1937
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,448
The plan

1938
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:53,824
You can't even figure out how to say hi.

1939
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:02,272
Landslide

1940
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,808
How does that square with

1941
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:08,928
Constant talk about how you go out new Tommy's or sneering and

1942
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:10,464
Demons

1943
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,072
Maybe you don't

1944
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:20,960
I fully agree with the anarchist

1945
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:24,544
And at the same time

1946
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,336
You're the hold old present

1947
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,360
The premises

1948
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:29,920
We need to increase self-governance

1949
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:31,456
Added some

1950
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:33,504
Police reports

1951
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:40,416
Yeah man on the street

1952
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:45,792
Question right

1953
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:48,864
Okay

1954
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:52,448
So now brings up another

1955
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,984
Video that was going around

1956
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,264
And this one

1957
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,800
Not good

1958
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:59,616
Here's just one of the many videos of white people being

1959
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:03,200
We're just being white

1960
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,504
Here is the clip from Dallas

1961
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,408
And is now in a coma in Dallas

1962
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,432
But these white

1963
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,200
Deserves it

1964
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:39,040
Avon so hat tip to our friend Jared Holt

1965
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:43,648
For this one has to get to the bottom of the story

1966
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:48,256
Circulating online

1967
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:50,304
Which was posted by Elijah Schaffer

1968
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:52,864
The works for Glenn Beck's Blaze TV

1969
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:57,984
He was misleading re-edited to appear that it showed a guy who did nothing getting beaten up for no reason

1970
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:04,384
Hours later and after being pestered to do so Schaefer posted the iron version of the video which shows what actually happened

1971
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:11,040
According to CBS 21 Dallas-Fort Worth protesters with a machete

1972
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:15,136
Lee said that he'd shown up to allegedly protect his neighborhood

1973
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,160
Some protesters

1974
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:17,440
What you did

1975
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:24,096
This is not machete

1976
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:29,984
Because this context was removed from the initials

1977
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,032
Established beating up for no reason

1978
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:37,152
By the time the reality was already in place and you see Alex here

1979
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:46,880
And Alex is taking it a step further and lying about two additional aspects

1980
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:51,232
He's saying that it's racism against whites related crime which is

1981
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:52,256
Clearly is not

1982
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:54,048
And he's saying that this guy is in a coma

1983
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,584
There's no evidence

1984
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:00,448
Not mentioned in the CBS 21 story about in which says that he's in stable condition at the hospital

1985
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:02,752
Understand he was tweeting later

1986
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,312
Thanks, sweetie

1987
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:07,616
Regular occurrence nowadays

1988
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:09,920
Do you have these things and like the optic

1989
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:12,224
Pics of a guy obviously if you are

1990
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:14,272
Taking this out of context

1991
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:15,296
I'm showing it it looks

1992
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:16,320
Really bad

1993
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:20,160
The unedited full context

1994
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:22,976
Hey this guy's charging people with a f****** machete

1995
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,048
In these Conte in these situations

1996
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:30,912
I don't know what how you expect you wouldn't get beat up

1997
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:36,032
The definition of self-defense when it comes to a man running at you with a machete

1998
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:39,616
A B for people who love stand your f****** ground laws

1999
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:52,672
The full context of the short version

2000
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:56,512
Problems

2001
01:58:56,768 --> 01:59:01,888
Has decided to add to it

2002
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:09,056
Process that Alex has to report his stories and white

2003
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:10,336
Really dangerous

2004
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:14,432
In these times like we talked about

2005
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,320
Because

2006
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:24,672
It's hard it's hard like I mean I think I probably could have found

2007
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:26,720
This story in CBS

2008
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:35,168
To contact surrounding this

2009
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:39,776
Difficult for someone who's in these right-wing information speakers

2010
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:42,080
To figure out this is bulshit

2011
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:49,504
They have no interest in figuring out if it's b*******

2012
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:50,272
Not there with the machete

2013
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:56,672
It's just a little

2014
01:59:56,928 --> 02:00:03,072
Release the even more full clip of the protesters starting the fight with him and then him pulling the machete out

2015
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:05,632
It's just all

2016
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,424
That's so f***** up

2017
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:10,496
That's so f***** up at guywood additive

2018
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:13,312
That way that's just so f***** up

2019
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:14,336
What am I

2020
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:17,664
You know you want to create the appearance that you want to create

2021
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,688
Natsu

2022
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:24,064
Disqualifying for ever being considered a journalist ever again

2023
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,088
Probably

2024
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:31,232
He's already

2025
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:32,256
What kind of heavy

2026
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,048
Time to lighten up the mood

2027
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:34,816
No

2028
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:36,096
Play morning

2029
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:38,400
My daughter

2030
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,424
Want to go buy some toys

2031
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:44,032
Carter Brothers. But I go there for the

2032
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,360
I didn't need to know that

2033
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,712
Fremont

2034
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:59,392
Make a joke out of it to fill out

2035
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,160
Call Ali

2036
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,304
That's not report

2037
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,328
Also

2038
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:12,448
Such b******* any stores

2039
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:18,848
Fighting with people about

2040
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:23,456
Maybe he can say he hasn't worn a mask or whatever I don't know if I believe that entirely but

2041
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:25,504
He's got too many stores

2042
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:33,696
Just not not judging Latimer liquor store

2043
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:38,048
Where he puts on a dinosaur mask

2044
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:42,656
And walked around Target

2045
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:45,728
Anywhere near there

2046
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:50,080
So Alex spends a lot of time on this episode talking about his truck

2047
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:52,128
How we got

2048
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:54,944
You got beat not why would I expected

2049
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,736
To be about anything other than

2050
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:01,088
This point after talking

2051
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:04,928
And about how do you say I tell him, he's came up and

2052
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:10,048
Could you have

2053
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,352
We were doing it to illustrate

2054
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:14,144
These are anti-free speech

2055
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:15,936
Monster

2056
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:16,960
Monster

2057
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:21,312
So because they're anti-free speech Dirtbag monsters

2058
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:22,848
Hey man

2059
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:25,920
Don't matter no matter what happens to

2060
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:30,016
You got started this

2061
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:38,976
I mean.

2062
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:40,000
There's no

2063
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:42,048
By the way to tell you and I'm not even

2064
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:42,816
I'm proud about it

2065
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,120
Will make sure

2066
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,912
That

2067
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,728
Tell me tell you something

2068
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:51,008
You started this fight

2069
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:54,336
Superman

2070
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:55,104
Presence

2071
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:59,456
You really start a fight

2072
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:00,224
The wrong people

2073
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:03,040
So it's not with me it's not some big Power

2074
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:04,576
Air America

2075
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,344
Bauer

2076
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:08,928
Because once America's under attack you once were Unleashed

2077
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:10,208
There's not

2078
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:10,976
Anywhere you peep

2079
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,840
The figure it out there's no space

2080
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:16,608
Safeway

2081
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:17,632
You guys

2082
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:19,936
You want to fight

2083
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:22,752
Hope you ready for it.

2084
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:24,800
Hope you ready for it

2085
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:31,456
What is the just Alex basically being like my political enemies are fine to go to FEMA camps

2086
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:37,856
Supermax prisons that's no different

2087
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:38,624
Differentiate

2088
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:40,160
Ocean between America and

2089
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:40,928
People

2090
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:42,720
But he sees as his

2091
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:49,888
You know it is hard not to hear that and also think of Trump's comment about Imago people love black people

2092
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:53,216
Being almost two distinct things

2093
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,616
Probably make the argument that he's not talking about

2094
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:01,408
No minorities here

2095
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:02,944
I'm about to eat

2096
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:08,320
Weird white people who are working for China or trying to make these

2097
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:11,904
It's it doesn't matter like his audience is going to hear the way that you're at

2098
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:14,208
That's also Illustrated of of

2099
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:15,744
I hate

2100
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,096
Fundamental cowardice in the same most people on the right

2101
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:23,424
In that kind of militia Circle Sheriff's just that like

2102
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:24,704
Oh I could have

2103
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:25,728
I know I could have

2104
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:27,776
I could have no we could have beat him

2105
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:28,544
Beasley

2106
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,336
And then it's like

2107
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:33,152
They'll see what happens when America wakes up

2108
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:35,712
Cuz obviously all of these people

2109
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:36,992
Joining together in protein

2110
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:40,576
Police brutality

2111
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:41,600
These are just a thought

2112
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:42,624
Protesters

2113
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,928
Sora

2114
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:46,720
Know if it's there

2115
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:47,744
Meddling

2116
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:50,560
2009

2117
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:52,352
There was a my neck report

2118
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:55,424
Bertha came out disgust howl a lot of

2119
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:59,008
Fringe right-wing militia dangerous types

2120
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:03,104
And there was some things that were

2121
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:04,640
Could be associated with them

2122
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:05,920
Some things like

2123
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:08,480
Support for Ron Paul

2124
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:12,832
Ron Paul supporters were all dangerous right-wing militia

2125
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:17,952
Liking the Turner Diaries

2126
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:21,280
Keep an eye on these people

2127
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:28,960
To get this report

2128
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:32,288
This whole thing is trying to say that

2129
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:34,336
Trump

2130
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:35,360
Is hero

2131
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,128
Is come out

2132
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:37,920
And said that he was going to

2133
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:39,456
Label

2134
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,992
Domestic terrorist

2135
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:44,064
That means

2136
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,600
Terrorist as well probably

2137
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:50,208
Control

2138
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:54,048
Trump tweet

2139
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:55,584
United States

2140
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:56,608
America

2141
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:59,168
Will be desert

2142
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:01,984
Esoteric

2143
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,544
Organization

2144
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:12,736
George Soros

2145
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:15,552
And they are trying

2146
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,832
Terrorized the nation

2147
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:20,416
What is jaundice

2148
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:21,440
Alive right now

2149
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:22,976
At what time indeed

2150
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:25,280
This is

2151
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:31,168
Turn of events if only because

2152
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:34,752
That exists is whomever you don't like

2153
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:35,776
That's the problem

2154
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:37,056
Yeah it's a big issue

2155
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:44,224
Heard discussing this the most clearly is a note saying

2156
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:45,504
Is just move

2157
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:47,296
Basically

2158
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:51,648
Whoever you don't want terrorists to

2159
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:53,696
Big tits

2160
02:06:56,512 --> 02:07:02,656
There's a lot of things that you shouldn't be a lot of things you can imagine

2161
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:06,240
And very easily an earlier version of Alex Jones

2162
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:07,008
Very

2163
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:08,544
Falcon worried about

2164
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:14,176
Things like the National Guard shooting paintballs a rubber bullets at people on their porch

2165
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:16,480
Yeah their personal property

2166
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:22,880
The president labeling non-existent non-centralized group terrorist group

2167
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:26,464
Any number of these things

2168
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,256
Alex would be against those things

2169
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:30,304
He was out on the streets

2170
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:32,608
People might have reminded him of that

2171
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:35,680
And here is his rationalization for why

2172
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:36,448
Hey man

2173
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:39,008
I'm still against the police say it

2174
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:42,592
Verde

2175
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:45,664
Every person who I was

2176
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:50,784
You were against the police state

2177
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:53,088
The police

2178
02:07:55,136 --> 02:07:56,160
These people is amazing

2179
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:00,768
I swear there's no rule of law

2180
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,816
Under martial law

2181
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:06,656
Has nothing to do with a cop

2182
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:08,960
What

2183
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:17,152
Policy Meats real

2184
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:21,760
The globalists are trying to train cops

2185
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:22,784
The paint gun

2186
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:26,880
Forcibly take her seven-year-old for a sex change

2187
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:31,488
Personally mad at that

2188
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:32,512
Police officer

2189
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:33,536
Coming to do

2190
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:35,328
Fight them

2191
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:40,192
For the robber

2192
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:42,496
Lisa Road

2193
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:44,288
Translate that for you

2194
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:49,920
Bowie State doesn't mean anything other than police enforcing rules that Alex doesn't like

2195
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:51,200
That is all

2196
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:53,504
Even if they're imaginary it's just

2197
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:56,320
There's nothing to do

2198
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:57,600
The tactics or nothing

2199
02:08:57,856 --> 02:08:58,368
To do with

2200
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,648
Any of the

2201
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:01,696
Larger implications

2202
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:03,744
It has everything to do with

2203
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,280
I know like

2204
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:15,520
Documentaries titled police state

2205
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:18,848
Real bad

2206
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:23,968
What a pathetic loser

2207
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,784
Alex starts to really get wistful

2208
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,344
Remember when I believed

2209
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,112
Stuff

2210
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:32,416
I wish

2211
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:34,976
Instead he starts thinking about like man

2212
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:37,280
There were times when

2213
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,304
So foolish.

2214
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,072
The Dow Trump

2215
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:41,376
How could I have ever been

2216
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:42,144
Name

2217
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:43,936
Here in the year twenty

2218
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:45,728
Adele

2219
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:47,520
God dammit

2220
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:48,544
Questions man

2221
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:49,824
Three nights ago

2222
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:50,592
I stayed up

2223
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:51,616
Mike Wang

2224
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:58,016
I wasn't ashamed but I look down

2225
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:01,088
About 30 minutes

2226
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,464
110 to get a job

2227
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,304
Everytime I second-guess

2228
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,328
Surrounded

2229
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:13,120
He was right about

2230
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:15,168
He still up

2231
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:17,728
Oh my God

2232
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:19,008
This is gross

2233
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:23,360
This is more intensely

2234
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,152
You know

2235
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:27,456
He is the savior he's the chosen one

2236
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:33,856
Been anything I ever heard anyone

2237
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,904
This is obscene

2238
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:38,208
No this is like I had my head down

2239
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:41,536
For 30 minutes and then I lifted it up and I licks Trump's butthole

2240
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:43,072
Cuz I loved it so much

2241
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:46,400
Can't believe that I ever imagined not looking Trump

2242
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:50,240
Alex almost

2243
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:53,568
Cries here talkin about how it happens

2244
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:55,104
We have to support Trump

2245
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,128
Matter what

2246
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,152
F***

2247
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:58,688
The president

2248
02:10:58,944 --> 02:10:59,968
Now we deserve

2249
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,528
So I literally had a moment on Friday night

2250
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:03,552
Publishers I said

2251
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:04,832
Is my gut

2252
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:09,184
Because while we're in this fight

2253
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:10,976
Checking

2254
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:13,024
Is he perfect

2255
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:14,560
From my position of my

2256
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:16,096
Being in the middle of where he is

2257
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:18,656
I told me

2258
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:21,216
Just back the present hundred percent no matter what now

2259
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:22,752
Because if he doesn't get

2260
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:24,800
Spiritual

2261
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:28,640
Metaphysical

2262
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:31,200
Full document

2263
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:32,224
Yes

2264
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:34,784
Thousand percent

2265
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:36,576
He is the champion of

2266
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,624
He has done

2267
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:40,672
Believable

2268
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:41,952
God

2269
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:44,256
This person

2270
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:46,048
No The Patriot

2271
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:54,496
Preparing

2272
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:55,520
Knowing

2273
02:11:55,776 --> 02:11:56,544
What he was doing

2274
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:57,824
For the position

2275
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:00,384
Somebody was metaphysically

2276
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:02,432
That

2277
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:03,200
Position

2278
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:05,504
This is so f*****

2279
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:10,624
Believable transition of power in 2020

2280
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:17,024
Sunday episode

2281
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:23,424
Jesus say Jared crosses are on your head and call yourself

2282
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:29,056
Church today what I did is I got on Aaron at Blue hard about Alexa fine

2283
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:31,360
That is so bad

2284
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:33,152
Yeah that's very weak

2285
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:34,688
Little

2286
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:37,248
Sophos topic for a little bit

2287
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:43,648
Mascaras audience about these

2288
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:48,768
I'm going to blow Trump no matter what he did. Man I think of Courage

2289
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:51,584
Palmer Twitter

2290
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:53,120
Don't have a Twitter

2291
02:12:57,472 --> 02:12:57,984
Tonight's the night

2292
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:58,752
My comrades

2293
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:00,800
Half the city

2294
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:03,360
Hilarious

2295
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:04,384
White

2296
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:07,200
Race-based

2297
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:07,968
Stikbot

2298
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:17,184
So this is an account there's a Tifa underscore us

2299
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:26,400
Constantly gets tricked by these things probably

2300
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:27,680
Also that account

2301
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:29,984
Been suspended by Twitter so Alex is

2302
02:13:33,312 --> 02:13:34,848
States not even a boy

2303
02:13:35,872 --> 02:13:36,640
Too real

2304
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:40,480
I don't know who got called in on the weekend but someone was able to

2305
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:41,248
Skype working

2306
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:46,368
Cuz Millie calls in I want you to

2307
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,904
Make time for this

2308
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,440
I'm going to be honest with you upfront

2309
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:53,024
I have no f****** idea what this really is talking about

2310
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:59,424
I have no idea Alex completely confused by a conspiracy theory that you trying to spend

2311
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:00,192
And

2312
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:06,592
I'd like everyone to remember that Millie Weaver first came to our attention exactly

2313
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:12,992
Hey goofy clown comedy comedy character

2314
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:15,296
This is more than just

2315
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:20,416
This is actually a military Insurrection that's going on right now

2316
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:21,696
This is

2317
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:22,720
Classic

2318
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:25,024
Operation that's

2319
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:27,328
Internet

2320
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,352
Interactive

2321
02:14:30,144 --> 02:14:30,656
Psychological

2322
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:31,424
Operation

2323
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:33,472
Being run on US citizen

2324
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:36,032
This is technology the same

2325
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:37,568
Told you that they use in Ukraine

2326
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:39,104
With their wikistrat

2327
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:40,640
Did they are deploying

2328
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:42,432
On US citizens

2329
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:46,016
Call the government

2330
02:14:46,272 --> 02:14:48,320
Deep State elements are launching this right now

2331
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:51,648
Solutely this is an attack

2332
02:14:51,904 --> 02:14:52,672
Because they know

2333
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:53,696
They have used their

2334
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:54,464
Predictive

2335
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,488
Program soft

2336
02:14:56,256 --> 02:14:58,816
To know that your why Dan is not going to have a

2337
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:00,864
In the 2020 election

2338
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,424
They have prediction

2339
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:04,448
Software

2340
02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:05,984
Can use their

2341
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:14,176
I was just listen to him like I got

2342
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:16,736
I got no interest in this

2343
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:21,344
Okay we got

2344
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,624
F****** future pretty

2345
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,160
Addicting software

2346
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:29,024
And they're worried

2347
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:34,912
So they started some kind of an online interactive simulation where

2348
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:39,008
Please call Pokemon go at the start and now it's

2349
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:41,312
I looked into this a tiny bit

2350
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:42,848
I think she just found a Blog

2351
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:45,152
It's a Munroe to talk with his is a stuff

2352
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:49,760
I have no f****** idea I also don't care

2353
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:53,856
So is Alex disrespectful

2354
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:55,648
He believed

2355
02:15:56,160 --> 02:16:02,304
She wouldn't act this way if you believe

2356
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:04,608
All this is just psych Warfare or something

2357
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:06,912
Keep interrupting Her Like Us

2358
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:09,216
The created shadow

2359
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:11,776
Operations

2360
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:16,896
The way they got a whole Vista

2361
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:19,456
Contract

2362
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:21,248
Corporations to

2363
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:22,016
Secretes

2364
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:27,136
William Jennings been on record

2365
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:30,208
Private contractors

2366
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:31,744
More access to the governor

2367
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:35,072
1000 contractors

2368
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:36,864
Have more access to the Press

2369
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:38,912
Exactly

2370
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:45,568
That's not that's not good communication

2371
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:48,896
Sold information

2372
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:51,200
A little disrespectful

2373
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:54,528
What job should do

2374
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:56,064
Sure about this

2375
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:58,368
Operation or whatever

2376
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:03,488
I don't understand exactly what

2377
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,024
Dirt bike

2378
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:10,912
Basically they want the military to come in to fight against AI I don't know what this means

2379
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:12,448
We do

2380
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:16,544
Trump

2381
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:18,080
I think that Trump needs to crack

2382
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:19,360
Down and try to

2383
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:26,272
Deploy the National Guard but he needs to do it in all these before she brought

2384
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:28,064
30 ruling us or not

2385
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:30,112
He should stand the Armenian

2386
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:33,184
Nearly grabbed control of all this AI that we built

2387
02:17:33,696 --> 02:17:37,280
Billy was saying sending in the National Guard to Aldi's

2388
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:39,840
That's not

2389
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:42,656
Alex I think is talking about sending the Army to Google

2390
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:48,544
Or something like that

2391
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,312
Right

2392
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:53,408
I don't understand how some kind of a giant

2393
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:59,040
Online-based psychological warfare things on two different tracks completely

2394
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:02,112
But they both involve Trump using military force against

2395
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:03,648
Someone they don't like

2396
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:06,208
And neither of them make any sense

2397
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:09,536
Not really I'm amazed

2398
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:12,352
I'm really amazed at the volume of

2399
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:14,656
Times they talked about what Trump

2400
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:15,936
Should do

2401
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:19,008
The subsequent number of times Trump does not do that

2402
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:23,616
And then them claiming that he's fulfilled every promise

2403
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:26,688
Yeah yeah yeah it is

2404
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:28,736
It happens a lot

2405
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:30,528
Imagine all the stuff you don't hear

2406
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:35,904
Yeah but I do tell

2407
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:42,560
Yeah probably

2408
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:44,352
You expect to come there

2409
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,216
It's only going to

2410
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:50,240
Crazier Alex

2411
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:52,032
Try to buy a weapon

2412
02:18:52,288 --> 02:18:53,056
It wasn't enough

2413
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:54,848
Bogus

2414
02:18:57,664 --> 02:18:58,176
Him with every

2415
02:18:58,944 --> 02:18:59,456
American Pie

2416
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:00,224
With everything

2417
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:02,272
Coincidence

2418
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:06,624
As soon as businesses are about to open up the economies about the

2419
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:09,696
Soon as that

2420
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:12,000
They all go out and hit all these bit

2421
02:19:13,024 --> 02:19:14,304
No stop them from opening

2422
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:16,608
Call Mia

2423
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:17,376
As well as

2424
02:19:17,632 --> 02:19:18,144
To try to

2425
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:18,912
Further divide

2426
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:21,728
It's only going to get worse Alex

2427
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:22,752
People need to buy

2428
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:28,128
Please share information with important sharing information

2429
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:29,408
So that we can get that

2430
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:30,176
Shrimp

2431
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:34,784
How to the right people to the Americas a ride it's so precious every person listing however

2432
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:36,832
Rebel radio station TV show

2433
02:19:38,112 --> 02:19:38,624
You're all men

2434
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,696
Did Alex take a sedative

2435
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:48,096
Like he feels like he's about to fall asleep tired of her bulshit

2436
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:58,848
She's presenting

2437
02:20:03,968 --> 02:20:05,760
The military internet

2438
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:07,552
Interactive

2439
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:14,208
Millie what the f*** are you talking about

2440
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:19,840
Editorial stance

2441
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:22,912
Don't forget to eat cuz I rode photography

2442
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:25,472
I would appreciate an Infowars

2443
02:20:25,728 --> 02:20:29,568
The AP style guide

2444
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:32,128
Anytime anytime you're talking about this

2445
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:38,528
Soros

2446
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:40,064
Together

2447
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:41,088
I was thinking like

2448
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:42,368
I wonder I would

2449
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:44,160
To surprise

2450
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:50,816
I don't think this is the case writers rooms over going to whatever it in for the office

2451
02:20:51,584 --> 02:20:53,632
There was some kind of

2452
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:55,680
It went into like here's the

2453
02:20:55,936 --> 02:21:01,568
Type of news here is the product we sell released on this

2454
02:21:01,824 --> 02:21:05,664
Like I wouldn't be too surprised like there was like almost a branching

2455
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:06,432
Like

2456
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:11,296
Treat other reasoning tree of like if this then that

2457
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:14,624
If this then that that would make perfect sense

2458
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:17,696
If they haven't developed that after 20 years or whatever

2459
02:21:17,952 --> 02:21:22,816
Be pretty wild

2460
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:26,144
You would have to read at least four pages for that

2461
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:29,216
Not going to enforce must be literate though it help

2462
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:34,592
Anyway

2463
02:21:34,848 --> 02:21:39,200
Things are going to get worse at everything else but I do think

2464
02:21:39,712 --> 02:21:40,992
I think they're going to keep going

2465
02:21:41,248 --> 02:21:42,528
In the direction that they're going

2466
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:45,856
Absent any kind of leadership any kind of

2467
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:46,880
I reckon

2468
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:48,928
Cognition of conversation

2469
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:50,208
Yeah

2470
02:21:51,232 --> 02:21:52,256
Otzi

2471
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:54,304
It is force is Matt

2472
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:57,376
Force I don't see

2473
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:00,704
I don't see people who are protesting

2474
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:02,752
Any reason

2475
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:03,776
To not

2476
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:05,056
Continue

2477
02:22:05,568 --> 02:22:09,664
Because of the validity and the sincerely held beliefs that are

2478
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:10,432
Find

2479
02:22:11,456 --> 02:22:11,968
The what is

2480
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:12,736
What they're doing

2481
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:14,016
At the same time

2482
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:20,928
Straight

2483
02:22:21,184 --> 02:22:22,208
The bigamist

2484
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:22,976
2

2485
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:25,536
Recognize the complaints

2486
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:26,560
To accept

2487
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:29,120
Conversation

2488
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:32,960
I think there's too much built up into like not looking

2489
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:36,032
And those two forces

2490
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:39,872
Stop against each other intersecting

2491
02:22:40,128 --> 02:22:42,688
I do worry about that

2492
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:44,480
I think all the other stuff is b******* like

2493
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:47,808
Fake impeachment face virus

2494
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:49,856
All I all I can see

2495
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:50,624
From

2496
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:52,416
Because this is the opportunity

2497
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:53,184
4

2498
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:55,488
All of our local leaders to step

2499
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:57,792
And they're absolutely not doing

2500
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:00,608
What is what is the question

2501
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,656
Nobody that they are answering this

2502
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:04,192
What is going to make

2503
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:04,960
The protest stop

2504
02:23:05,472 --> 02:23:08,800
And all of them so far are saying that it will be

2505
02:23:09,056 --> 02:23:09,824
Police brutality

2506
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:11,104
That will stop the pro

2507
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:13,664
Obviously not saying brutality but

2508
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,968
Will be I'll be goddamned if that's not with their banking

2509
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:18,016
How many fats and if that's

2510
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:20,832
Not so if that's not going to stop the protests

2511
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:23,136
We have to provide them with an alternative

2512
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:26,720
Because the protest right now

2513
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:27,744
To stop the protests

2514
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,304
Nobody has the demand nobody is saying

2515
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,840
What we need to do is

2516
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:33,376
You know

2517
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:35,680
Get rid of go through

2518
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:40,800
The cops we have lists of people who have posted on Facebook

2519
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:45,152
We have.

2520
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:45,920
You make

2521
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:52,320
Concerted change within the system and they're not taking any responsibility

2522
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:57,184
I'm sure there have been some

2523
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:59,744
Optimistic

2524
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:01,792
Well it's going to take the leadership

2525
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:06,144
It's going to take like Lori Lightfoot press conference to take them not just saying

2526
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:09,472
8 is what happened to Floyd

2527
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:11,008
It's going to take them saying

2528
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:13,568
Because of our inaction

2529
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:14,336
Ever

2530
02:24:14,592 --> 02:24:16,128
That is why you guys are protests

2531
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:17,664
It is because of us

2532
02:24:18,176 --> 02:24:19,456
We have to change to

2533
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:21,248
And they are not doing that

2534
02:24:21,504 --> 02:24:23,296
It does seem like that

2535
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:25,088
Would be an essential piece of it

2536
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,928
Just keep the same to Soto's

2537
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:34,048
Gut punch all of the narratives that Alex has and all the censorship

2538
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:36,096
You just not say things like this

2539
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:37,120
Millie Weaver think

2540
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:37,888
Thank you so much

2541
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:39,936
Your videos are at Millennium

2542
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:40,960
On on

2543
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:43,520
Thank you so much

2544
02:24:57,344 --> 02:25:00,160
I think you know and

2545
02:25:00,416 --> 02:25:02,464
I think you start to see a little bit of like

2546
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,256
Deers are starting

2547
02:25:04,512 --> 02:25:05,024
Try and work

2548
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:05,792
For Alex

2549
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:08,608
He's trying to create the things that he needs

2550
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:10,656
To create a false narrative

2551
02:25:10,912 --> 02:25:11,424
Out of this

2552
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:15,520
Besoros contracts that are b******* that he's bringing back into the conversation

2553
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:18,848
Shifting the villain from gates to Soros to suit the

2554
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:20,640
David needs of the moment

2555
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:22,432
I think you see

2556
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:27,552
I'm picking up whatever he can in terms of videos that come out

2557
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:30,368
The bricks metal

2558
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:31,904
You got the

2559
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:36,512
The guy getting beat up you just take a note

2560
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:38,560
You see that behavior

2561
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:39,840
Very reminiscent

2562
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:43,168
It's a very it's very much that's Alex Jones what he does

2563
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:48,800
And then at the same time I think probably more offensively the

2564
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:49,568
I just

2565
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:50,336
Complete

2566
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:53,152
Fabrication of embellishment

2567
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:55,456
Speculation wildly about

2568
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:56,736
George Floyd

2569
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:57,504
Himself

2570
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:58,784
In any way that

2571
02:25:59,296 --> 02:26:00,832
Just designed to

2572
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:05,184
Make the audience feel more comfortable with the

2573
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:06,464
But that could he got murder

2574
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:10,816
It's not fun for anybody to die but it's more fine for him to

2575
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:12,352
Yep

2576
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:14,656
I think there's a two-pronged approach

2577
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:17,472
Make this

2578
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:19,520
Not as hard pill to swallow

2579
02:26:20,032 --> 02:26:23,616
Create a narrative

2580
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:26,176
You said it's starting to take shape here

2581
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:29,760
I predict that it will continue and

2582
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:35,392
You know when

2583
02:26:35,648 --> 02:26:40,768
Coronavirus started off really helped out a lot of money

2584
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:41,792
Pretty afloat

2585
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:42,816
For a bit and I'm

2586
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:44,352
Pretty worried that like

2587
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:48,448
This is a ratings Bonanza kind of thing for Alex

2588
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:51,776
Potential

2589
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:53,312
Alex

2590
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:54,592
Most

2591
02:26:54,848 --> 02:26:55,360
Adapt

2592
02:26:55,616 --> 02:26:57,664
Taking things that are really hot

2593
02:26:57,920 --> 02:26:59,456
Unclear

2594
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:01,248
And using them to his advantage

2595
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:06,368
And I do have a real sincere worried that you'll be able to make a lot of money options

2596
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:08,672
God dammit

2597
02:27:08,928 --> 02:27:10,208
Of these people being rewarded

2598
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:11,488
I'm just sick

2599
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:13,280
Hopefully it's

2600
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:17,376
It's followed by consequences of these lawsuits

2601
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:20,192
Crippling him

2602
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:22,752
Jordan

2603
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:26,080
Read website

2604
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:32,736
Go to bed Jordan

2605
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:39,392
Please donate to a bail fund or there are Agra

2606
02:27:39,648 --> 02:27:43,232
Forget bail funds now where you can donate and they will distribute across the

2607
02:27:44,256 --> 02:27:48,608
Yep

2608
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:54,240
George Soros with forklift

2609
02:27:58,592 --> 02:27:59,360
Alex

2610
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:02,176
