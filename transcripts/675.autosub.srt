00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
I need money

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
Quick question

7
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
What's today

8
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
My red spot

9
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,312
History in past

10
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,664
And then shaving my head

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,504
The truth like that the other night

12
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
And

13
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,552
I was very close

14
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,368
Does shaving all my hair off

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,000
Not just any particular ring really has

16
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,280
But feels like it's time

17
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,608
Enjoy having a bald head

18
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,632
It feels kind of good

19
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
We take a shower the water hitting your bald head

20
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
Feels really good at that does feel real

21
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
Really just rolls off you never felt it before

22
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,712
Look forward to it once there once that happened

23
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,320
But then I had this moment

24
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
Shaving my head that I usually have after the fact

25
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
And that is I remembered

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
That I really like the front and top of my head bald

27
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
The back is a disaster I got there okay all right

28
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,032
Hard to shave that of course it's just I realized

29
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,128
Yeah baby the Allure of this is not as good as the reality

30
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664
So I'm going to

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
Tye-dyed iguana pointer that go get a haircut

32
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,832
Because it's progress in the past I would have just gone

33
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Barrel Dennis

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,744
But this time I thought about it and realize no no no the back of my head does exist

35
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:45,376
Wow in hindsight being 20-20 turns into foresight 2020 victory of

36
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Proportions right

37
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:56,128

Coach Coast Church

39
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
Very good

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,344
It's a you know it's about that single person point of view nonfiction kind of think

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,160
It's really enjoyable I wish it was about Cactus Tony of course

42
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,744
A long story of the greatest example of

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,048
The format it is very good

44
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,376
And it's got is about that spiritualism era right

45
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,448
Now that I've always found incredibly fascinating whenever

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,336
So many f****** mediums were going around like it's fine like they were just like let's do this

47
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
Crazy

48
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
Well I'll have to give that a check out

49
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
Cuz I'm good but it is interesting

50
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,552
Jordan today we have a not so awesome episodes

51
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
Kind of figured that this is one of the most

52
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,464
Discordant episodes of Alex's show I've heard in a long time interested

53
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
Absolutely no sense

54
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
And if anything is to be taken seriously it is

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Is deeply deeply disturbing

56
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,448
And we'll get inside before we do looks like a load some new wants

57
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,288

You are now.

72
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Technocrat

73
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
I have

74
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Risen above

75
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
My enemies

76
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,055
A little breaking for me

77
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,639
And then we're going to come back

78
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,711
And I'm going to start the show over

79
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
F*** you

80
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

81
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
F*** you and your new world order

82
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
She wrote in on

83
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
And all your s***

84
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
Maybe later on West Broad

85
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

86
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

87
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
And you never see me again

88
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
That's really what I want to do

89
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
Back here again

90
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
I apologize to

91
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
To the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

92
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,527
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

93
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
I'll be better tomorrow

94
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
He's not

95
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,927
Boy is he not really thinking today was going to

96
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
New

97
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,559
So today we're going to be going over April 25th 2022 that's Monday

98
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
Alright that one actually works

99
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
And this

100
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Was

101
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Upset

102
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,823
This is a disturbing episode and I think

103
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,967
How do I texted you and I was like maybe we need to do Tuesday episode

104
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,295
About 10 minutes into the episode I was like

105
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,647
Worried you are Warrior

106
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
It's not a

107
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:26,815
Common experience that I have it was it was it was a very different vibe that I mean

108
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,167
But here is where the episodes

109
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
This morning while I was reading all the news looking at the research

110
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
About quite a bit here on are in the past but we're now here

111
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
I really think I should take today

112
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
She really

113
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Thank you all

114
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,279
Tell you that I really appreciate you because

115
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,583
We could be off the air

116
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Vomit

117
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,471
Plunged into a massive power outage that will be the beginning of

118
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Martial law

119
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
Cool

120
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
BMX plays the New World Order

121
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,919
The purposeful collapse of civilization

122
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
Chair and massive

123
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
Depopulation

124
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,783
In the next 20 years

125
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,343
That's fast

126
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
Actually happening

127
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,207
I just a Chronicle all the attacks are running right

128
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,511
24-hour show we're going to

129
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
Most important

130
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
All the pieces

131
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,263
I know exactly what's going to happen

132
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
The only question is what is the timetable

133
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,359
I'll let you know what's happening as well

134
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
That was kind of saying goodbye different

135
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,623
Vibe to this than a lot of time

136
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
He talks

137
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Doom

138
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Subdued

139
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,327
Kind of measured presentation to this

140
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Creeps me out

141
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
I mean it doesn't seem like

142
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,775
The normal Outburst of how we're all going to die comes from whenever he's having a bad day

143
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
Today and has lost in some fashion

144
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
Usually in the court

145
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,991
This sounds like he's saying goodbye through this medium of Dance

146
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,343
I suppose the working theory that is

147
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Alex realized

148
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,791
Maybe this bankruptcy thing isn't going to work and that maybe the fact that the US

149
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
Trustees have written this letter

150
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,399
Right

151
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Any system

152
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
Could trigger some kind of examination

153
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
Of his use of bankruptcy

154
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
Could lead to even more trouble

155
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,431
Well I mean when you start to say the words criminal fraud

156
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,551
They were I don't know I don't know any kind of like

157
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,855
Inside information on this or anything but it just

158
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Feels like

159
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,463
My theory is that this is Alex being like

160
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
I'm done.

161
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
I've done everything I can

162
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
Is my last Hail Mary

163
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,959
That's why I'm saying I'm not saying the word

164
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,263
It's criminal fraud but we're in the ballpark

165
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Start to think about

166
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,639
Insinuations and hints

167
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
And it just like this

168
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
Beginning stretch of the episode

169
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Boy howdy

170
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
There's that too great song

171
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Was Elvis

172
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
Already talks about

173
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
Baby alive or told you

174
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
How much I really loved you

175
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
And he goes on to say that

176
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
You're always on my mind

177
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
We're always on my mind

178
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,519
How much I love you and appreciate

179
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,895
I tried to stop him initiating this Final Phase

180
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
To be able to beat them

181
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
In a long-run butt

182
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
I really need to just

183
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
Continue on as long as possible

184
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
Years

185
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,047
You need to get ready to get your family ready

186
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,375
And I've really been holding off telling you all this but I

187
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
I just I think you already know

188
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
But

189
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
Everything you see

190
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
Everything standing

191
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Everything that's been here

192
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
Atlas

193
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
I want to dance on the left of them in the

194
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
Quislings

195
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
It'll be too late for them and too late for us

196
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
Just get right with God

197
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Okay

198
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
So

199
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
This is bad

200
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,655
Here's what I couldn't get out of my head I couldn't get out of my head

201
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,727
Whenever NBC-2

202
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007

203
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,335

Are we awesome

205
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
Instead of that like great

206
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:04,063
Beat but not giving into cynicism

207
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:10,463
Listen they took this show for me they're going to take everything from you going to kill all of us 90%

208
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
Everything that is here will be gone

209
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,703
The monument rebuilt to the Past will crumble and be taken over by ivy

210
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Directors is like

211
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
That sounds right

212
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
That would be a lot of fun

213
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
Just f***** up

214
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,295
Acceptable Lottery level

215
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
Thursday there's the

216
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,927
Sort of presentation of it like you got to prepare your family

217
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,487
Bishop going down

218
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
Next 8 years 90% of everybody's going to be dead

219
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
Really constant

220
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,703
Since the beginning of this episode that like this

221
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Can't be stopped

222
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
There's nothing we could write

223
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
Really care about the screw

224
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
Care about all you I care about my family

225
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,479
I just have a really sad feeling

226
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Didn't stop the story of the best Shelby

227
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
They are

228
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
Dismantling every facet of civilization

229
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:20,863
World is completely collapsed hundreds of millions are on their way now to Europe in the United States in North America

230
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,471
What Mexico completely collapsed we will collapse just like the most cities

231
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Where do I find

232
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
The powers

233
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
Britain start failing

234
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
Republic bag

235
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
For stability

236
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,695
Yeah it mean if this is business extreme and nonsensical

237
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,255
There are some similarities

238
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,327
Do like what a lot of people believe will happen

239
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
Do like

240
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Do climate

241
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,983
Areas are going to become uninhabitable

242
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,287
It's just a reality of how things

243
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
And there are going to

244
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,407
Be massive inflows of refugees

245
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
Pretending

246
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
That they are used as a weapon by the global is right

247
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
As opposed

248
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
To forcibly displaced

249
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
Weaponizing

250
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
A potential real

251
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,375
Issue that we're going to be dealing with in the future

252
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
And that's

253
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Insidious

254
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
It's pretty nefarie

255
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
Yeah I mean it is hard

256
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,055
To argue with a prediction that

257
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
Things are going to get

258
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Bad right now

259
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:41,503
It does seem impossible for you to like listen to look at the ipcc reports

260
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,599
Where scientists are getting our waxing philosophic

261
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
Nicole about

262
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
What it would be like to live on Nova Planet the functions and then see Biden being like

263
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
I mean yeah drilling is great

264
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
But

265
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Not this way

266
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Not how it's going to go

267
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,263
So look it's been great knowing you

268
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Audience

269
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Quote Alex

270
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
I just need to take this opportunity today

271
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,759
And also I really just feel like talking about how great

272
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
And

273
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
Just in case

274
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
A tweaker next month

275
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
Because it's that close

276
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
. swimming pool.

277
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
We have a puppet president

278
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
Text Direction on television from the Easter Bunny

279
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
A joke that's very serious

280
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
Quite serious

281
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,495
Very serious

282
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:39,103
Did you know that

283
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
But I've always

284
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
Suspected and I feel right now it's amazing

285
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
Right I mean like

286
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
Obviously Maybe

287
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
The person who was in the Easter bunny suit at the White House's celebration wasn't a random person

288
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Easter Bunny

289
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,279
Maybe that was like a secret service agent

290
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Or something

291
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
You probably want a random person and Easter bunny suit

292
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,567
15 Survival let's get out of here we don't have any internal Easter bunnies

293
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,967
Dr. Just not the same if it's an agent portraying

294
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Easter Bunny

295
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,575
Professional

296
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
Google be sad

297
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
So yeah because you just nonsense

298
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
B

299
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,023
We've we've heard Alex say stuff like that movie like it's

300
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Been good to know you

301
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,399
And things like that in the past but I really do need to stress out different the

302
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
Dark

303
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,543
The Andre could be gone in a week

304
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,615
A lot of that feels like all of my attempt

305
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
To put off the inevitable

306
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Have

307
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,527
That is kind of you all of my boobs are gone I'm in checkmate

308
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
Right it does feel like he is admitting that out loud

309
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
I mean

310
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Obviously

311
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
And I would be tough to prove

312
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Definitively sure

313
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
It certainly fits

314
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
Text

315
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
What's going on in the larger sense

316
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,679
Which we could be reading too much into as we have in the past

317
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
A possible

318
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823

My God

322
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
What have we done what Have We Become

323
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,143
Airborne

324
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
We're the Bad Guys

325
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,007

00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
New tagline

329
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:53,503
No longer tomorrow's news today Network chronicling the Apocalypse

Pirate Radio from

331
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Apocalypse Now

332
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Yeah

333
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
Yeah I think that's good brand

334
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
I think it's so much

335
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,743
Easier to feel

336
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Morley soup

337
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
Superior to your enemies

338
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,191
Whenever you have them fictionally writing laws to just murder babies

339
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
That's great

340
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,335
You know like it is in a nuanced world I have to wrestle with sometimes nose like

341
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
Where what would I do in their shoes

342
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
Would I be

343
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,479
You know a person who if he obtained

344
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Billions of dollars

345
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,063
Would go mad with power and B

346
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,623
You know that was pretty easy though he's mine

347
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
Sure I monster

348
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Anyways

349
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
It's way better

350
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
Unreal problem

351
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,839
That's just kind of an offshoot of his whole thing

352
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
And where it's right

353
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,471
Really easy to be better than your enemy when your enemy is the f****** devil

354
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Yeah

355
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
And it's imaginary

356
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
I am but a fallen

357
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Vessel

358
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
But

359
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,199
Compare me to the devil anti I'm so great

360
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,319
And whenever your enemy complements you it's like

361
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
Every time I played White

362
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
Against myself lying black

363
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
I tell myself I'm the best

364
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,815
Player there's ever been nobody who could beat me

365
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Across the table

366
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
So that's all like the beginning

367
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
The segment episode

368
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Into the show proper

369
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
Cuz a lot of that's not actually

370
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Broadcast on the radio

371
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,895

00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,455

379
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
Has confirmed

380
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
Multinational

381
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
Authoritarian called

382
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Is actively

383
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
Attacking every

384
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Fashion

385
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
Are the planets supply-chain

386
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,503
Davis Group is a mouthpiece of this psychotic multinational corporate back

387
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
Post-humans Revolution

388
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
Thank you not realize that when I would read out of

389
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,255
Problem Roman un documents in operation w.

390
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
Rockefeller Foundation

391
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,863
British Ministry of Defense reports

392
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
20

393
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
Power 2 plus years until

394
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,943
That wasn't making it up and I wasn't exaggerating

395
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
They weren't playing games

396
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,551
So the first thing to point out here is it

397
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,903
Infowars hasn't confirmed s*** yet they're running headline is it for doing some real reporter

398
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
This is just s*** talkin be presented as fact

399
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,559
Second none of the documents that Alex is referencing at the Ender have

400
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
Anything to do with backing

401
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
His claims

402
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
Operation lockstep isn't a real

403
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,567
In that document from the Rockefeller Foundation exercise the pandemic that's involved in the lockstep scenario

404
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
It begins in 2012

405
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,687
The depiction of the situation that you know this imagine

406
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,503
Future involves it does extend to 2026

407
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,831
Where the last event mentioned is protesters in Nigeria over

408
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
We're throwing the governor

409
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,927
Along the way the document explicitly mentioned something

410
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
Fictional things that never happened

411
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:20,607
Protalix guide love to hear him explain 2013 cellular cellular Networks

412
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
Completely crashed

413
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Oregon 2017 quote

414
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,495
Italy addresses immigrant caregiver Gap with robot

415
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
Woo that sounds fun

416
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
Alex explained

417
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:34,175
Explain the prognosticating Wizards

418
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,503
Explain why I was just Italy

419
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
Did that we need robot

420
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
Caregivers to

421
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
Complete

422
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,415
Sketch of the world is a little blurb

423
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:51,071
We've been over this but it always needs to be called out that Alex is maliciously lying and making things up about a scenario exercise

424
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,631
Technological advancement in the developing world

425
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,703
So it will work better as a thing to scare his listeners with

426
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
It's b******* his behaviors in

427
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Excusable

428
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
The club of Rome documents talking about his limits to

429
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:07,455
Growth which I know because it's literally the only Club of Rome publication he's ever mention

430
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:14,367
Limits to growth was written in 1972 and I'm certain Alex's never read it because it's a very detailed breakdown

431
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
How to various factors

432
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
Is that the authors believe

433
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,488
Will be contributors to limiting the carrying capacity of the plant

434
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:25,376
These involve things like pollution but they also touch on the total amount of arable land versus

435
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
The demand for food

436
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
And like things I've known quantities of

437
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,264
The finite resources versus the increasing demand

438
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
As population goes up

439
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,872
In each case they have estimates for the point at which

440
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,688
There are these lines intersect on a graph

441
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,760
But they're also very clear that these are based on trends

442
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Continuing

443
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
And if some of the factors aren't even predicted

444
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Even so they can

445
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,976
Conclude that without any major changes will hit a resource crunch within 100 years

446
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
Azure by 20

447
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
2072

448
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,840
I was just making up as they predicted the crisis of being 20

449
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,144
20 because of better suits his purposes now

450
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Fresno connect

451
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Directions to reality

452
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
Another book on this kind of theme but Alex might be referencing is Paul airlux 1968 population bomb

453
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
But that wasn't affiliated with

454
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
The club of Rome

455
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,944
Brings up some valid points

456
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,016
But a number of the predictions and it were not good

457
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,064
Still none of them involve 2020

458
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Ehrlich

459
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,880
Adom was coming by the 1980s

460
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,952
Alex's casually referencing these documents

461
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
Forgive his career full of

462
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,536
Failed doomsday predictions the appearance of being

463
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
Something research

464
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Unscholarly

465
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,704
This should be saying means nothing he's just trying to take the audience into thinking there's more behind his words

466
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Just some idiots imagine

467
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
Imagination

468
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
You're really all of it

469
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
And of course

470
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Prophetic dream

471
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
MCS had and weird

472
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:45,248
Visions we really don't deal enough with how much it may just be a dream

473
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:51,136
Because all the time and then he finds some random ass documents if somebody's is like

474
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,464
Dream I had dream

475
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,072
Informed by growing up in a John Birch Society household where he read these

476
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,376
He's f***** up books at like age 12

477
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,936
And then just internalized them into his world

478
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
Yeah and now he pretends he was a Satan

479
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
All this b*******

480
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,360
Yeah there's really only two ways to go from that child

481
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,432
I live right there was serial killer and then Infowars

482
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,760
And everybody already done serial killer so he was like I suppose.

483
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
I guess there's another way to go

484
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,160
Therapy anyway considered

485
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,024
What you're saying in the first segment

486
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,560
It carries over

487
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
Because

488
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
Irreversible

489
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
Ford Escape reversible

490
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
Genie back in the bottle

491
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
It could be 10 or 20 times worse if they get

492
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
What they're actually looking for

493
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
6 billion + 10

494
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
They don't have

495
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
Noah Harari

496
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Klaus Schwab

497
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,264
And Wall Street Journal New York Times

498
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Looking forward

499
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
To the end of humanity

500
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,944
People set themselves on fire in front of building

501
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
Contraband fossil fuels

502
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
Corsair to use fossil fuels to do it

503
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Mobile.

504
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
That's

505
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,840
Doing all of this to play games

506
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,400
Well I guess Alex good is wrap it up then

507
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
Just closed up shop

508
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,984
The goal was to stop the globalist and now the whole thing

509
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,288
Think happy stopped he's failed and he should go home

510
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Intent was hopefully miserable life

511
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,408
F*** this dude yeah useless now

512
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,016
Also looking forward to the end of humanity was an op-ed that actually makes the opposite point that Alec

513
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,064
What's thinks it does cuz it's only read the headline

514
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,624
Hey U-Haul Noah Harari is a historian

515
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,928
The future is that Alex has recently decided

516
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,488
Patty's going to pretend Disney globulus soothsayer

517
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
If I had to guess this is because Ray Kurzweil hasn't said anything weird in a while so Alex had to find a new character to fill that Gap

518
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,728
When Bruce Lee was the name of the man who self-immolated

519
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,776
In front of the Supreme Court building recently

520
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,080
Hoping to bring attention to the climate crisis

521
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,664
Do he was passionate about climate change Bruce's action as

522
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
Has nothing to do with Klaus Schwab or the globalist

523
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
It's a desperate Act

524
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
I meant to bring it to folks

525
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,088
Crispy severity of the issues that he cares about

526
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,368
He's not the only person

527
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:34,464
Some to do this even if you exclude all of the cases of protest outside the United States

528
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:40,096
Sprint since David Buckle died by self-immolation of the protest about the climate in 2018

529
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:43,680
This is basically Alex's way of not taking Bruce's action

530
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
Seriously by pretending

531
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,752
Some Grand conspiracy

532
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,848
Hmmm by making clip joke about how his self-immolation requires fossil fuels

533
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,944
Alex is doing this because on some level he can't even imagine having the

534
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
What about something

535
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
They would take to self-immolate

536
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
Do protest

537
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
Serious cause

538
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
Cuz he's just pretend

539
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
It-it's

540
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648
Be allowed to see

541
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
No I think it's

542
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
It's pretty

543
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Deportes

544
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,072
But I guess this will go ballistic KB stop now and ever going to die

545
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
It's real shame

546
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
Yeah I'm confused we had a good run

547
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
Yeah let's let's

548
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Children

549
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
You know

550
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,384
I mean if it's irreversible I'm confused why so sad the only argument is that he saying you could

551
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,248
Could be 20 times worse which implies that by some action it could be twenty times last

552
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
Bad

553
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,040
Okay

554
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
I guess we only have

555
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,136
Hundreds of millions dying

556
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
Yeah okay

557
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,976
Honestly I really think

558
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,000
This line

559
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
Of rhetoric is pretty Danger

560
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,120
Because I think that there's really only a couple Direction

561
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Things you can go with

562
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:52,800
The first is doomsday prepping and maybe you and your family run to the woods Arizona made out

563
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,360
I think that's a unwise

564
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
His decision for most people probably

565
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,992
Maybe some people could pull it off and have a nice life out in the woods

566
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,784
I don't know but I think the

567
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,136
By and large it's probably irresponsible to give this advice.

568
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
The second thing I think

569
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
You could lead people to estate of

570
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
Real

571
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,328
Terror and maybe they would go

572
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,864
Consider ending their life

573
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Because

574
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,472
What's coming could be something so horrible I have saw the Mist

575
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,032
Remember whenever the guy

576
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:33,504
Famous ending I might I might not be right with the title but the famous ending is the guy is

577
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,808
With his family in the truck

578
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:40,160
Any kills his wife and daughter to save them from the horrors and he's about to kill himself

579
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,232
The Mist parts and he can see people coming towards

580
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
Until it's like

581
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
Man 5 minutes

582
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Sure

583
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
You hear stuff about people to

584
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,752
Taking the War of the World seriously when I was on the radio and

585
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Genelec

586
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,616
You could see you could see some people in Alex's audience if they take it seriously enough

587
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
Could reach the spare

588
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:07,552
Second or third you could end up with people who are just like well I got a gun ho support Alex

589
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,112
Does just a dead end

590
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
I love the other alternative is like

591
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
Well if the globalist plans

592
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Unstoppable

593
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
I'm dead

594
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
My life

595
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
Is already over

596
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,936
I can do something that will

597
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:30,336
Possibly make a less people die why would I not engage in a suicide bombing against the world economic forum

598
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
Or something like that

599
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,920
Why wouldn't you do that

600
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
If the globalists are going

601
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
To kill off

602
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,272
Billions of people within the next

603
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
8 years

604
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,576
Unstoppable

605
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
The plans that they put in place

606
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
The information War

607
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,208
Quite frankly no more purpose

608
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,768
There is no reason to be engaging

609
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
In politics

610
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
There is no reason to be engaging

611
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
Even if culture stuff

612
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,544
What does it matter if your gay marriage world

613
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
Deadman

614
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
What are we doing

615
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Yeah of course

616
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,736
I don't understand how you can be really concerned with

617
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:15,136
The imagination of slow erosion of civilization when it's a couple years left a minute

618
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
2gobazaar

619
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
Kill everybody off

620
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
It is

621
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
An excuse

622
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
4 people in the audience

623
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,632
It's to carry out violent if they are so inclined

624
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:29,216
And Alex is a person who does believe the TV is talking

625
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032
You should be very under

626
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
Understanding of what

627
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,616
People in his audience who might believe that these

628
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,408
Speaking directly to them

629
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,480
Right but he also is deeply invested in

630
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,040
Not take responsibility for anything so fair

631
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:47,136
Obviously this will be turned around to be like why would anyone actually listen to me

632
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,160
Yeah yeah

633
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
Yep it's just

634
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
F***** up and

635
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,536
So irresponsible

636
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:57,376
They decided the public is dumb and lazy and weak

637
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
And the decision has been made to kill you

638
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
And me

639
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,152
This issue is

640
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,456
The only political

641
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,528
Economic cultural issue in Coruscant spiritual in nature

642
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
The battle between good vs Evil

643
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Deborah Glendive

644
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
Good good versus evil

645
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
I mean you know I know nobody listens to his show

646
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:30,144
Hey that TuneIn like Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan they don't actually listen to a show

647
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
Probably not

648
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,264
Because if you're listening to this s*** when you need some explanation format

649
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,408
Application for wire support

650
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:47,808
Alex Jones is right about stuff but I should also be clear that I do not believe it when he says that nevermind

651
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:54,208
And everybody needs to get right with God and yes prophetic vision

652
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,048
Do you think that you did maybe

653
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
Couch some of your your commentary about how he is

654
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:06,496
Write about most you mean now it does seem like Joe would have to come out and be like hey listen

655
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,312
Alex says we're all going to die in 8 years

656
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:14,688
So since I believe Alex has been right about things the whole f****** time

657
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
We all have

658
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,760
To go do s*** now

659
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:23,136
I don't believe that all these people actually believe him and then like

660
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Look

661
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
The amount of money that you on Musk

662
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Princeton

663
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:36,192
Alex also has been saying that Elon Musk really believes in him when he's fighting the globalist he's on that team Alex

664
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,032
Yeah the money that Joe Rogan and Elon Musk

665
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
I have

666
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,616
Could get him out of trouble

667
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
In a heartbeat

668
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
And you got to wonder why that is

669
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
It's

670
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:54,880
Fun to signal that you believe that Alex is right whatever meets the road no one gives a

671
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
The s*** about him and they don't answer

672
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
We believe this stuff

673
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
Cuz he's a Madman

674
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
Yelling nonsense

675
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
Why is Alex looking

676
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,328
For $2000000

677
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
From his audience

678
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,656
If Elon Musk

679
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,216
100% behind the the movie

680
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:13,056
Would give him the amount if he gave him $2000000 that's what

681
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
Feel it

682
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
Spin A Penny

683
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,688
To help you

684
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,320
Legitimately in anybody believe that it was a matter of life and death that Alex beyond the air

685
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
It would be so easy

686
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
Ephraim Ephraim

687
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,000
These right-wing dingdong absolutely

688
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
News

689
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,400
I told you two plus years ago they would start Environmental

690
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,680
Lockdowns

691
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
Once you were trained

692
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,056
India and Italy of an ounce

693
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,104
Lockdown shooting

694
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
Electricity only

695
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
What time is it

696
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
The quote

697
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
And because the resources have been cut off

698
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
Which one

699
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,696
Destroy

700
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:08,608
The situations in India and Italy are far more complicated than Alex is reporting them because he has no idea what he's talking about

701
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
Skim to headline is not trying to make

702
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:14,496
Make up what he thinks these articles are about to we can jam them it was narratives

703
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
Let's start with Italy

704
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:22,176
Exaggerating an amendment to an Italian government decree that has

705
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Headed by The Parlor

706
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Yet

707
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,528
If it passes summer you not

708
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,856
Have your AC set lower than 25 degrees Celsius

709
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,904
It in the winter you can set your heat

710
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,768
Above 21 degrees Celsius

711
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
True

712
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
This is not

713
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,632
Climate-related issue nor is it even connected to covid

714
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,680
It has to do with a sharp drop in gas

715
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
Supplies in Italy that comes

716
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
From not dealing with Russia

717
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,800
40% of Italian oil comes

718
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,128
From Russia so there's a considerable

719
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
We're trying to find ways to make this work

720
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:59,296
The temperature decrees are one such effort although I don't believe for a second that there'll be a way that I could make this

721
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,576
Is enforceable at all

722
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:06,976
But as a way to make up for the Lost Imports also they're trying to cut new deals with the Republic of Congo and

723
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
And Angola

724
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
The Trion

725
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
Find some more resources

726
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:16,192
India Alex doesn't even flash up a headline on screen without one or situs or some kind of left my own.

727
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
Figure out what he's talking about

728
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,848
Last October there was a big deal with Indian power plant saying that the only an average

729
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
4 days worth of

730
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
Tacoland stock

731
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,968
Which is due to a much larger constellation of influence

732
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,248
Then just

733
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
Covid or

734
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:35,392
I don't like Alex breaking up India on his show just because

735
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,440
It's so vast in Coppell

736
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,232
Located that even if he

737
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Studied

738
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
Realtor

739
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,864
He would be completely and woefully incapable of talking

740
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
And the Dynamics with the Colts

741
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,704
Supply in that region of the world

742
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,104
There's some talk of like morkel related issues in the present-day but there's also reports that the coal stock is fine

743
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,688
It's actually kind of hard to tell what the situation is but I can find no evidence

744
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
To the clients

745
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
What is making about

746
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,296
About India

747
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,112
It's not the same thing that I was just saying but

748
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
No it is

749
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,440
It is a decree that you got to keep your temper

750
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,464
Turn these lines

751
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,840
Like having a dad in your house too worried about the thermostat

752
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
Put a sweater on

753
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,936
Bright but that's really more of like a

754
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,520
That's that's like a government saying hey we're all in this together

755
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:29,152
You know we've chosen this path forward as a team and so we're also going to have to deal with the consequences

756
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,736
I can't fully understand

757
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,528
How you would go about like

758
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,856
Do they have inspectors coming in with thermometers or

759
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:42,976
But I mean that's again that's the point is like this is not something we're going to come into your home

760
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,280
But we are doing anything

761
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,816
In support of Ukraine

762
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,632
Yep I don't know it's

763
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
And so

764
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,448
I guess the world is going to lose this kind of

765
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,568
Duff great commentary no

766
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
This whole thing

767
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,944
Defeating the globalist I mean we've been doing it for 20 years

768
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
Break it down

769
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Chronicle

770
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,856
And then hit leaders who compartmentalize to wake up

771
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
It could have been stopped

772
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
But now the collapses

773
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,048
Desperate

774
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
That we warn everybody

775
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,168
I understand that those initiated the collapse

776
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,568
Are now the ones that are going to preside over the

777
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
Isis

778
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
Composer for savior

779
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,688
I just put out the cover story to the public

780
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,344
Deadly viruses cause global warming

781
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,160
Bridge collapse the food chain because of global warming

782
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,232
We got to do all this because of your bad

783
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Humans are bad

784
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
And then

785
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,864
Collapse depopulation in

786
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
Total trans humans take over whoever is left

787
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
At the end of that

788
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,312
Beyond dystopic system that they have an issue

789
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
Nothing in that clip has any relation

790
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
Reality

791
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Taco salad

792
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
Expressing his feelings of preempt

793
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,272
Distrust about world events that hasn't even happened yet

794
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,576
In the real world there are

795
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,112
Very complete explanation

796
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,392
Changing climate

797
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,952
Severe consequences in terms of famines and droughts

798
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:22,048
So there is a drought scientist can say it was caused by climate change and Alex

799
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Can say it's a giant

800
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,632
Conspiracy proven by imaginary white papers and then

801
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
We're eating it

802
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,032
Exotic illnesses it's super clear the role climate change

803
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,104
Azan that with animals

804
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
Them to migrate to new areas

805
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,944
And decreasing the likelihood that they may contact us

806
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
People where they wouldn't have otherwise

807
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,112
This necessarily increases the odds that new viruses and bacteria can be exchanged in from there

808
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
The potential for new outbreaks goes up

809
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,720
Alex Gonzales audience on his explanation

810
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,536
Compare everything because his explanation for everything is the same

811
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Call the club

812
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
They're doing everything

813
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,936
It's totally definitively proven in this document that Alex refuses to speak to

814
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
Specifically about

815
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
Almost as if it doesn't

816
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,312
Existen Alex doesn't

817
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:10,176
This is the same sort of dynamic he has with like the prospect of climate

818
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:16,576
Did you know it's a pre-emptive explanation that it's all just the globalist as conspiracy to attack all of us

819
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:21,440
Imperative these things that are likely outcomes of the trends that we're seeing with

820
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,232
The climate weather it's

821
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:28,864
A change in the amount of usable land that we have for farming or the

822
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,936
Likelihood of encountering species that could introduce new

823
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,496
Viruses and bacteria

824
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
These are real things

825
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,056
He's created preemptive

826
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,616
Excuse where it's all a conspiracy until bulshit

827
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,640
I mean the problem

828
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
With the

829
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,200
Preemptive is that most of the stuff is

830
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
Currently

831
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:45,760
You know like

832
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,600
This is not tough weed this used to be the trends that you would talk about

833
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Coming

834
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,952
In the near future or you know shortly future

835
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,232
Edits plugin

836
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,560
He's denying something that he can look outside and see

837
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,608
Emma in a faction

838
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,424
It's happening but it probably will be happening much

839
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,752
More severely in a way that impact people much more

840
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,544
It hit hard in his audience

841
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Yes in the future

842
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,616
That's kind of what I mean by that

843
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,920
But I do agree

844
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Is wealth

845
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,736
That is better than Fairborn

846
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,040
So Alex just

847
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
Rambling about it

848
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,624
Extermination now we're all going to die

849
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
TextNow

850
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,464
We are on it today how it's on his mind

851
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,512
It's always on his mind

852
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,792
Iraqi articles

853
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,936
Land of humanity The Wall Street Journal nbcnews

854
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,496
Times of London

855
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,616
We need dictatorship

856
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
This isn't coming out of evil

857
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,224
This is hundreds of years of preparation

858
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Waiting

859
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,552
Building their Networks

860
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
While they were rich and Powerful presiding over

861
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Humanity

862
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,696
Level

863
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,000
Super technology

864
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,728
To this because

865
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,776
Out of the mash of the public

866
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
Which on average is dumb down

867
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,664
Super Geniuses come out of those groups

868
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,968
Always overthrow

869
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,016
The previous

870
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
Generational and the cycle continues

871
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,184
So now the story is that the globalist don't want all of us in the cheap seats getting our hands on life

872
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,816
Engine technology and they're going to need to kill off all the population because from the multitude of the stupid masses

873
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,912
They fear that is super genius will arise to take down their system and I'm going to go

874
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Right now

875
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,752
Alex thinks he's back super Tuesday

876
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
Pretty good

877
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
I guess either way none of this means anything

878
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,944
I just want to touch on the article that Alex mentioned at the top of the cliff

879
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:55,296
The first is that op-ed that Alex hasn't read but likes to say the title and the others

880
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,648
This is Alex referencing an op-ed in Bloomberg titled

881
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,952
To save democracy we need a few good dict

882
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:08,096
This is written by Robert Kaplan and think about him he'd know the Kaplan has been saying s*** like this

883
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
4 / 8

884
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,192
Just a quick Google search turned up an article that he wrote

885
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
2012

886
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
Good movies

887
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,592
Tablet isn't calling for a dictatorship in the United

888
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,688
Specifically about less-developed countries and how often times

889
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
For citizens in most countries

890
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,040
The Democratic process is less important than achieving

891
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
Fundamental rights

892
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
And things

893
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,368
It could be achieved Within

894
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,160
In the context of Greater stability

895
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
I think a lot of his points

896
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,560
A half cooked at best but Alex is absolutely misusing bad line if it's opinion

897
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
But he definitely didn't read

898
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,168
Reed's we can use it for his own purposes

899
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,192
Which is his MO

900
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
I mean if I remember Kaplan

901
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,568
I've read some of that crap and it's essentially like

902
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:54,431
He's he's is shity argument is like right now dictatorships are bad

903
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,759
They we want to get them towards a democratic system

904
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,551
So we need some sort of

905
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,855
Philosopher-king to bridge the gap

906
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,903
Between dictator and

907
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:10,303
I'm not sure I haven't read all of his articles but the sense that I got was generally speaking that

908
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
The functioning democracy

909
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,703
Can grow out of stability and a strong institutional base

910
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,519
But that is something

911
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,847
Is that a lot of developing countries don't generally have

912
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,895
When it democracies are attempted

913
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
I think

914
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,711
B how he would

915
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
Put it is

916
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
That

917
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
Dictatorship

918
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,647
Would allow these countries to solidify create better

919
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
Tuschen Heaven from there

920
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,719
Go into a democracy

921
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,535
I don't know if I agree with this

922
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,583
I don't know but

923
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,143
It's not it's not the point that Alex is trying to make it out to be

924
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
80 was an iPad

925
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,007
Anyways

926
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,055
Sure sure

927
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,103
Alex has his hand on the pulse

928
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Nino's

929
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
About sayings

930
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,479
Those headlines

931
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,063
Other terms

932
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
And

933
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
History

934
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,927
No super jelly doesn't have those groups

935
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,535
The previous Elites

936
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,327
Generation

937
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,143
The globalist call this an Obama talks about it

938
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
What

939
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,543
Weather corporate Tony controls

940
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
Biological reproduction

941
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,919
Over your mind surveilling everything you do

942
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,503
The human system as we know it

943
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,783
Is ended

944
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,879
Because it runs the CIA today

945
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,743
Was given the charter to end War

946
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,535
And the answer was end

947
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,655
In all of human competition

948
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Corporate

949
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,263
Medical biomedical tyranny

950
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:00,895
Over the public were humans are produced that are even allowed to live that are not purely human but are

951
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,199
Chimaeric species

952
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,551
Brave New World published in 19

953
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,111
One brother of Huxley

954
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
Julian Huxley

955
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,767
Run the UN for two decades

956
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,607
Watson Tavistock Institute

957
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,871
I was just talking out of his ass here trying to grasp whatever straws he thinks he can pull the sound like he's making the real point

958
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,431
First problem is that he has no idea.

959
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,223
The end of History refers to

960
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,319
Comes from a book written in 1992 by Francis fukuyama

961
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:45,183
The central thesis of the book is that no political philosophy is better than liberal democracy

962
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:50,559
And that all human history is bending toward a greater number of people in the world living under liberal

963
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,655
History of the state when all countries are

964
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,751
Rightly so since 1992 the book has been criticized

965
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
Is being very naive

966
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,567
Expand the current world but

967
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
Alex has no idea what he's talking

968
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:11,551
The rest of the clip may as well just been word salad with Alex's free associating as best as he can but there's a few quick points I want to bring

969
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,415
One of the Carnegie endowment doesn't run the CIA

970
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:22,815
Infused diamond for International Peace did not decide to end War by ending men and women in the family and all that

971
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,887
Competition

972
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,727
Alex is confusing him with John D Rockefeller who says competition is a sin

973
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,775
Three the Carnegie endowment

974
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,103
Didn't propose making the plot of Brave New World into a reality

975
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,967
For Julian Huxley didn't found the UN he was the first Secretary General

976
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:44,063
Of the United Nations educational and scientific organization or UNESCO

977
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,367
A position he was in 42 years not 20

978
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,647
5

979
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
Julian Huxley didn't found the Tavistock

980
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
6

981
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
I wasn't using the Tavistock in

982
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
Institute and the Tavistock Clinic

983
00:45:55,071 --> 00:46:00,447
The clinic has a history of being involved in providing Healthcare surrounding trans issues whereas the Tavistock

984
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,495
Dude is the center of a

985
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
Trying to dunk

986
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
Conspiracy theories

987
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,871
The Institute is involved in research and projects largely related

988
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:12,479
Two social sciences so people have pretty much every conspiracy you can come up with

989
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:18,111
Swimming Institute spot off from the clinic in 1947 the clinic remained as part of the NHS

990
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,183
Those are six massive problems of the funk

991
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,743
Conspiracy that Alex is just ripping out on the show but

992
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,791
If you're just passively listening to this

993
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:29,119
Something Alex knows what he's talking about it sounds like this guy really

994
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,399
Pieces together but

995
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,191
Total b*******

996
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
I was I was listening to that and I was like

997
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,287
Keeping count that was like a great

998
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
Best hits in one sentence

999
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,127
The things that even I remember is being less

1000
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,175
The moment he said Tavistock I was like

1001
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
Nope he got it wrong again

1002
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Every time

1003
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,295
Beautiful day we die he's not going to understand Tavistock

1004
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,087
Yeah I'm like

1005
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,159
He didn't even get the Carnegie endowment like

1006
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,719
Involvement after World War II

1007
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
Conspiracy Corral

1008
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,327
Cuz largely the conspiracy is that they

1009
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,143
Decided that war was a preferable state

1010
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
And so

1011
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,983
Okay that's why I why they

1012
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,263
Made World War

1013
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,079
Conspiracy theories

1014
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
Like exist

1015
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,407
Inverting that entire thing

1016
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:20,063
There is a very useful when you can make them up on the Fly and don't need anybody to

1017
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,087
Protect you

1018
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,391
My man that's why they exist that is

1019
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,487
Alex goes out to break

1020
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
Monogram note

1021
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,607
Play sinan

1022
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,887
4 pieces

1023
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
Supposedly

1024
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,383
And a w

1025
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,175
Agenda

1026
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,735
Then they're not going to get away with

1027
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,551
I'm using this collapse to

1028
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:57,951
Totally depopulate in Waterloo

1029
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,047
You trust your mother right

1030
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,327
Oops

1031
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,143
What's the weather commercial

1032
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:12,287
I guess it is kind of stoppable

1033
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,567
Yeah

1034
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,359
We're all going to die but

1035
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,663
If we do the right things afterwards

1036
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,943
Yeah we'll be fine

1037
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
The survivors

1038
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,271
Will be able to

1039
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,807
He's Harry Selden

1040
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,623
Pulling some foundation bulshit on us

1041
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:30,719
And the collapse will only be 1,000 years instead of the 10,000

1042
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,791
Has been prescribed I should be also clear

1043
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,327
This is the first Sigma

1044
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
But still we're still in

1045
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
First Tech

1046
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,167
Is up till like

1047
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,727
14 minutes into the show

1048
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:48,895
Is in a mood and It's upsetting but I'm feeling upset about his boots so far

1049
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,455
We were talking fine before the show started

1050
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
Getting infected with it

1051
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,271
Yes he's at that's

1052
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:57,599
The gift of his oratory skills

1053
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
Yeah

1054
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,903
So

1055
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,999
Alex comes back from break and by that I mean Alex doesn't come back from break

1056
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,559
Smart

1057
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,607
Instead he's playing a clip

1058
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,655
Tucker Carlson interviewing

1059
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,471
Alex's former employee Savannah

1060
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,799
And I found a couple things kind of interesting about the

1061
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,847
This clip play a little bit of a

1062
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,663
Maybe

1063
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
What's Alex Jones

1064
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:30,879
Talk to him to this day think that he's great and I think that

1065
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,183
Many more people should have been

1066
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:38,559
When she was in there because I was actually there I remember

1067
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,863
Yeah I was in Labrador

1068
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,655
And I've regretted it ever since

1069
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,191
I didn't come out of the box

1070
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Wow

1071
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,335
You are dead Tucker 90% of the world's population is dead

1072
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,383
Special you cuz Patriots are f******

1073
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,991
Alex should still be on the air

1074
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,807
Don't you think it's so funny though the alike

1075
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,367
Yeah I didn't support him cuz I was fishing.

1076
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,975
Yep

1077
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:12,863
Either it's too late

1078
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,399
I do I do love that

1079
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,935
So I think

1080
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,239
All of Alex's employees

1081
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,543
The exception of maybe David Knight

1082
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
Maybe

1083
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,127
No something

1084
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,687
Sure he was wrong about a lot of stuff

1085
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,991
But he seemed like he knew something

1086
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
Sure

1087
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,319
Pretty much everybody else at Alex's hired has been

1088
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,367
Drastically unqualified

1089
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,415
Most of them won contests

1090
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:42,815
People at rallies and yelled at them and then edited videos of him

1091
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Himself doing that

1092
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,143
And also that great demo tape

1093
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,191
Some people just make dank memes for him

1094
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,263
Count to dankula

1095
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
Carpe donktum

1096
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:58,943
Yeah it so Savannah is talking to Tucker and I think that she was

1097
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,735
Dreadfully unqualified

1098
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,575
I really didn't have an introduction into politics but

1099
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,367
Adorned a lot of

1100
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,159
Alex Jones

1101
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,183
Front end

1102
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:15,583
Everything that she was telling me was not false the people who condemned him and say that he's a crazy conspiracy theorist do not listen to his show every

1103
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,655
Free single day because I work for him for two and a half

1104
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,959
The three branches of government when I started

1105
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,007
That's going to be I think

1106
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:27,359
Probably a deal-breaker I'm running a news and political theme

1107
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,711
Maybe learn a little bit more and reapply

1108
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:33,759
I don't

1109
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:38,367
Think that you can handle this I think for Alex is actually perfect because

1110
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,415
Cheese and know so little

1111
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:46,303
That you get to inform all of her opinions and ideas about what is real and what is that I think Alex

1112
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,607
Is specifically hires tabula rasa

1113
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:54,239
If you will

1114
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:59,359
What do you think the three branches of government

1115
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:05,759
Are you sure you still do the Deep state.

1116
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:10,367
Liberty that's got to be one of the Rhinos now the branches are on the tree of Liberty

1117
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,183
So one more clippings stalker thing

1118
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:19,327
Savannah is talking about why no one defended Alex when he was getting kicked off everything

1119
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,375
And this is just so fun

1120
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
Talking funny

1121
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
Why do you think

1122
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,215
I didn't

1123
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,751
Alex Jones today

1124
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,567
But why do you

1125
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,383
Think that morn conservative media didn't take a poop

1126
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,431
Principled stand against censorship

1127
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,479
Because Alex was off-limits

1128
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:41,599
Look at the fact that right now talk are so many and conservative media who wouldn't even mention Alex Jones's name

1129
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,439
Now say his name on a regular basis so Alex Jones Is Right Alex Jones

1130
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,231
We see this constantly okay

1131
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:53,631
The people in the conservative media

1132
00:52:53,887 --> 00:53:00,031
Truth until it goes mainstream and they're allowed to do it even in the conservative right-wing

1133
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,871
Action the reason why we lose it's because we continue to wait for the left

1134
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:10,527
Deliver media the mainstream media to allow us to tell us when we are allowed to tell the truth

1135
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,295
About Tucker

1136
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,343
That's what Tucker did

1137
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,439
100%

1138
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:22,047
Exactly what Tucker did it might have been slightly ahead of some other

1139
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,191
Folks but some people still are I mean

1140
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
You had

1141
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,799
Plenty of Infowars employees on your show in the past few years since

1142
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,335
Alex has been kicked off.

1143
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:38,175
Not really reference them as Infowars under their credit

1144
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
Well not really

1145
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,807
I don't know I mean send Savannah Hernandez

1146
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:47,135
He played that video of Harrison

1147
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,719
But he didn't have him off I don't think

1148
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
I don't know yeah

1149
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
Play Imagine

1150
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,815
Rambo Joby

1151
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:01,215
Ignitor showed up he hasn't he hasn't pulled all this stuff and been like directly from end

1152
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,519
Infowars my buddy you know

1153
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,079
He's very clearly they're not me

1154
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,615
It should be the easiest thing in the world

1155
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,407
I mean it's their main credit

1156
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,455
But also could be made

1157
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:15,295
That like

1158
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,623
You're arguing perhaps that maybe you should have had Alex on himself

1159
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
Why why not

1160
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,927
Arguing

1161
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,695
It's telling that

1162
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
He wouldn't reference

1163
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,767
It's them as being Infowars employees

1164
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,327
Or because they'll be taking more serious or

1165
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
Have Alex on

1166
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:33,215
Himself absolutely maybe he realizes

1167
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,263
But that would be a disservice

1168
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,103
To trying to rehab Alex's in it

1169
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,127
Actually on

1170
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,663
Probably would hurt

1171
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
The cars

1172
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,735
Alex

1173
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:50,111
These people all have these very major and obvious criticisms of you what's your response

1174
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:56,255
I was just going to do all of those Alex has a lampshade on his head

1175
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,047
Oh okay that's why you got bad

1176
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,399
Clip of Mike Tyson on Rogan talk

1177
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,959
About how Alex is right about stuff

1178
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,239
And then Mike Tyson

1179
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,519
And starts talking about how he's

1180
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,079
Convinced that somewhere in the world rich people are hunt

1181
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,359
Looking for people for sport

1182
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,127
Well

1183
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:16,223
I don't know if that's one of his big issues but

1184
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
I mean

1185
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:23,903
The plot of the most dangerous game is a very easy one to just transpose into real life in a lot of movies

1186
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,439
Particularly one

1187
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,255
Got really upset about not too long ago

1188
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,303
So it's comes back

1189
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,095
But he's interest back

1190
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
Until my great frustration

1191
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
Is this

1192
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:41,823
If you go back to shows we did 28 years ago 25 years ago 20 years ago

1193
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
We talked about

1194
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,151
Infrastructure

1195
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,991
Slowly destroy civilization

1196
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,551
Integrated global

1197
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,135
Crisis out of which the One World Government

1198
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,415
What the hell

1199
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
Now

1200
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,071
I don't deserve credit

1201
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,863
For knowing that

1202
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
No no you don't

1203
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:10,495
This is a fairly generous way to sum up Alex's career and I will grant

1204
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:16,383
That these are all themes that he's filled with throughout his time on air but I have some serious problems without this is being

1205
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,151
Disgust

1206
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:20,991
The first is that he's being so vague as to render what he saying meaning

1207
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:26,623
Define anything is slowly destroying society and then give yourself an unearned pat on the back

1208
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,951
The second problem is more serious and that is that Alex did

1209
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,743
Say that the globalists are trying to order

1210
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,791
Castrate a collapse for the past 28 years

1211
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,863
He said that specific things that have happened

1212
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,399
And were the globalists trying to order

1213
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,191
Orchestrated collapse that never came

1214
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,495
Over and over and over

1215
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,055
Every year was the summer of Rage

1216
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,103
Back when I was talking to

1217
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:52,223
Gold every single comment from the fed and every geopolitical issue was proof of the globalist are about to

1218
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,247
Crash the dollar

1219
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,527
You should probably buy some

1220
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,599
Anytime Alex has been on air there is even better

1221
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,623
Actual collapse

1222
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,183
Sits and we've recovered from that which shouldn't have happened

1223
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,975
If they were truly the globalist plot

1224
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,767
To bring in there one world government

1225
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,839
A 2008-2009 it should have been over

1226
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,119
And yet it was

1227
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,935
Alex isn't right and he's never been right

1228
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:16,031
The only way to make him seem right is taken statements completely out of context

1229
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,335
And deprive them of the meaning

1230
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,127
In which he said that

1231
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,919
Authorial intent

1232
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:24,735
Is critical theory

1233
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,551
However in terms of finding out whether Alex

1234
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,319
Full of b*******

1235
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,111
But yeah

1236
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:36,511
This clip here where he's talking about how he doesn't deserve credit for the revelations he's had throughout his career as a way for him to weave into

1237
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,327
Some of his major sources

1238
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,607
Throughout his career

1239
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,679
Imma take them one by one because I think it's a pretty shocking list

1240
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,239
Definitely wouldn't cop to some of this

1241
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,031
At other points in his career

1242
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:51,103
This seems like a bit of a reveal

1243
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
There's a person

1244
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,431
I don't deserve credit

1245
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,223
For knowing that

1246
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,319
John Coleman was high-level MI6

1247
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,599
He came out with the plan

1248
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
Thirty-plus years ago

1249
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:09,023
Alex around much and maybe part of that with death due to the fact that

1250
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
House inside a bit crazy

1251
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:14,655
Coleman wrote a book in 1992 called conspirators hierarchy

1252
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,959
The story of the committee of 300

1253
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:23,103
I can find no evidence that he's actually former MI6 and given the track record of people who we run into from this show

1254
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,431
I don't accept lofty resumes without some sort of verification

1255
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:31,551
It's possible that he was actually an agent and I'll assume it is true because I don't care

1256
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:38,207
You know what's crazy he was also a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu

1257
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:41,791
41

1258
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:45,119
So I decided to take a little look at this book and immediately at the broad

1259
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:51,519
Introduction Coleman is explaining that he came to the United States in 1969 and no one knew about all these

1260
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:55,359
Secret societies that he was talking about to put out a little tape to educate folks

1261
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,407
People started dropping all the

1262
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,687
These names that like

1263
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:03,039
I think they knew s*** about the Venetian black nobility there but I didn't know anything about it

1264
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,343
This leads him to say quote

1265
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,183
I consoled myself with the thought that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery

1266
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:13,023
I pursued my investigations pressing on in the face of severe risk

1267
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,583
The tax on myself in my wife Financial losses

1268
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,607
Does continual harassment

1269
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Threats

1270
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
I'm km

1271
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:24,543
All part of a carefully crafted and orchestrated program to discredit me run by government agents and informers

1272
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:29,407
Embedded in the so-called Christian right-wing the identity movement did right-wing paper eeotic group

1273
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:36,063
These agents operated and still operate under cover of strong and fearless outspoken opposition to Judaism

1274
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,111
Their main enemy they would have us believe

1275
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:43,487
Correctly these agents were sent it to Christian identity movement type groups

1276
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
Credit Karma

1277
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:48,607
And they maintain their cover by being really anti-semitic so they would fit in

1278
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
Yeah

1279
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,655
So far so good

1280
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,191
Call swag

1281
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,239
Coleman goes on to explain who these folks were

1282
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,263
Quotes

1283
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,055
These agent informers are letting

1284
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:03,199
Controlled by a group of homosexuals who are well-liked and well-respected

1285
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,991
Wait so

1286
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,063
These hidden people

1287
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,647
Undercover anti-semite

1288
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,231
Who are actually

1289
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:20,095
But they're actually part of the

1290
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
I mean like

1291
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,399
Gay agenda

1292
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,423
Or whatever it is

1293
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:29,055
I'm not sure if he's saying that they themselves are gay but they're yes they work for

1294
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,919
Well-liked and well-respected

1295
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
It's a mess

1296
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:37,503
This group is a sprawling, bulshit

1297
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,063
At one point Coleman claims at the Tavistock in

1298
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,927
Who created The Beatles in order to introduce destructive ideas into American culture such as the word

1299
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,463
Cool and teenager

1300
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,511
That sounds true

1301
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,559
12/8 tonal music systems

1302
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:55,679
Quote taken from the music of the cult of Dionysus and the ball priesthood of adorno

1303
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:59,775
That does explain why the Beatles got popular cuz they weren't that good man

1304
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:05,919
I was looking over his references page in his book and I noticed a strange quote he was taking from an HG Wells book

1305
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:10,271
It's kind of foundational in terms of his argument that this Committee of 300

1306
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,807
Had plans to kill everyone

1307
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,087
Coban wrap

1308
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,159
Quote in this work Wells describes how the new world order

1309
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,975
There which he calls the new Republic useless

1310
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,791
Skeeter's excess population will be getting rid of

1311
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,839
So you know they're going to

1312
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,119
Go off everybody sure

1313
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,423
He cites this is coming from the open

1314
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,495
Conspiracy but it actually comes from another book all together

1315
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,519
It's from the book

1316
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,543
Anticipation

1317
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,847
Switch doesn't have quite as useful of a title

1318
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:38,431
The premise of anticipation does Wells dealing with like

1319
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,711
Future predictions

1320
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
Sled like

1321
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,759
One of the big ones is the

1322
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,295
Invention and proliferation

1323
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,087
The automobile and he predicts

1324
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,367
Some stuff in this book like

1325
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
Thetollroads

1326
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:53,535
And it's cities will become more distributed basically what we now call the suburbs

1327
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,583
Like yeah the write-up

1328
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
Good work HG

1329
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:03,007
Unfortunately the last chapter

1330
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,543
Particularly not great

1331
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,639
Hold I anticipate that a certain portion of the population

1332
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:13,247
A small minority for example of selected with indisputable e transmittable diseases

1333
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:17,087
With transmissible mental disorders such as the idiots incurable habits

1334
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,111
The mind is the

1335
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,647
Craven for intoxication

1336
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,439
They exist only on suffering

1337
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:25,279
Out of pity and patience and all the understanding that they do not propagate

1338
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,583
And I don't foresee any reason to stay

1339
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,863
Suppose that they will hesitate

1340
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:34,495
To kill one that suffering has abused goddamnit

1341
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,263
Alright

1342
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:41,663
Sickness there is no way around this that chapter is horrible so horrible infected within a few years of writing the book Wells was

1343
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,431
Is arguing against

1344
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,735
Yeah yeah yeah

1345
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:48,319
This was published in 1901 and could be argued to be his first

1346
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,367
Book of this sort and it's really only just

1347
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:53,183
A few years after he published War of the Worlds

1348
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,487
None of this makes these positions of a text

1349
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:59,071
It's okay or any better but it's disingenuous to characterize well

1350
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,095
Entire career base

1351
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,935
I bring this up because this is a huge knock-on cold

1352
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:10,591
A giant part of the whole conspiracy thing is that HG Wells book proves that the elites plan to kill everyone off

1353
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,127
And he gets the book wrong

1354
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,175
And it's not just in the reference page

1355
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:21,087
What he's talking about the committee of 300 he says quote it strives towards a One World Government rather well described

1356
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,135
By one of its late members h.g. Wells

1357
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:27,231
It is work commissioned by the committee which Wells boldly called the open

1358
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
Conspiracy

1359
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,559
Did King Leonidas call for that himself

1360
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:37,471
I do believe that at Harkins to that clear

1361
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:41,567
Call themselves The Olympian

1362
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:47,967
Appears he has a better name and it was written 27 years later when Wells was in full swing and his philosophy

1363
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,735
Happy career

1364
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,551
So it seems worse that he'll be riding that kind of s*** at that

1365
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:57,439
I think that's part of this name at this point Coleman does something really sneaky though in the text

1366
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,719
He's established

1367
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,279
The pattern of presenting quotes from other text

1368
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
In Italian

1369
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,375
So he includes a mostly but I am passage from Wells

1370
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,655
Then says quote

1371
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:12,031
Like George Orwell's 1984 Wells of the count is a Mass Appeal for a one world government

1372
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,079
Summarize the intent and purpose

1373
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,615
Of the committee of 300

1374
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,895
Pasty following

1375
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,663
Conditions

1376
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:21,247
After this point there were three and a half full pages of italic

1377
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:25,343
Which is obviously meant to give the appearance of this is something that Wells had

1378
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,439
Right right and you can see this misrepresentation paying dividends

1379
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,463
To this day

1380
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,743
Some great

1381
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,071
Reset conspiracy theory beam every use part of this passage

1382
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,863
Attributing it to Klaus Schwab

1383
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,911
And others to h.g. Wells

1384
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,935
But in reality

1385
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:44,031
It's just something Coleman tried to pass off as a quotation by making it up himself

1386
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:48,383
And presented in italics it is

1387
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,175
Yep the passage is as follows

1388
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:56,575
At least four billion useless eaters shall be eliminated by the year 2050 by means of limited Wars organized

1389
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:59,903
Epidemics of fatal rapid-acting diseases and starvation

1390
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:03,999
Energy food and water shall be kept at subsistence levels for the non-elite

1391
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:09,119
Starting with the white populations of Western Europe and North America and then spreading to other races

1392
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:15,007
The population of Canada Western Europe in United States will be decimated more rapidly than on other continents

1393
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,591
Until the world population reaches a manageable level of 1 billion

1394
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,639
With 500 million will

1395
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,687
Consists of Chinese and Japanese races

1396
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:26,015
Selected because they are people who have been regimented for centuries

1397
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,831
At work accustomed to obeying Authority without question

1398
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,903
Really doesn't take much of a scratch

1399
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,695
To get to the races

1400
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,999
Under most if not all of these

1401
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:36,767
Maybe a lot of

1402
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
What

1403
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,631
Racism

1404
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:47,007
Vertigo everywhere abuse of the way that information

1405
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,799
Presented

1406
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,591
Like you can trace it through

1407
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,383
Misunderstandings and

1408
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,687
Conspiracy bulshit

1409
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,711
Since then

1410
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,479
I mean

1411
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,503
You know it is

1412
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,063
It is one of those things where are you

1413
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,599
It is so fascinating

1414
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,927
Because we get to the you find like the progenitor of these

1415
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:08,511
These things and it sucks you up because you kind of don't think these things have

1416
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
Gabrielle beginning

1417
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,839
You know like they just kind of congealed

1418
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:15,167
Like the first time I found out Dusty Baker invented the high five

1419
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
It's like

1420
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,983
That can't be real

1421
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:21,567
It's only that old WhatsApp

1422
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,151
So I wasn't

1423
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,711
No I don't know if

1424
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,807
If he actually was the original progenitor of these ideas

1425
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
But

1426
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,367
In his book which is

1427
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,903
By this revelation

1428
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:39,743
His traces back like a lot of things

1429
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:43,839
Especially this HD Wells station being misused

1430
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:47,167
It traces back to him but he may have gotten it from some like

1431
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:53,567
Newsletter or something or some other Bowl

1432
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,847
Percent

1433
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,151
This is a heavily influential thing

1434
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,687
It's totally full of s***

1435
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
Anyway

1436
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,759
Long story short this book is full of s***

1437
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:05,855
But you can definitely see how some of the ways that this is influenced Alex's worldview

1438
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,695
Also there's a weirdly long section about the killing of Aldo Moro in

1439
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:12,767
Steve pieczenik doesn't come up at all which I found defensive

1440
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,791
Crazy

1441
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,327
Why I don't know

1442
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:21,727
Alex's First Source is a crazy assholes who also thinks you can get arrested in Canada if you dare try to expose the fact

1443
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,263
The Jews run the country

1444
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,799
I forgot to mention that earlier hated to

1445
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,895
Generally speaking if you

1446
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,431
So we're off to a good start

1447
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:36,319
In terms of his citation this is Sparta

1448
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,087
Here's an extra

1449
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,975
He told me all of this

1450
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:46,559
According to his profile on the Air Force's website

1451
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,095
Parton was a quote

1452
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,911
The deputy for systems Aeronautical Systems

1453
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,935
Division

1454
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,471
At Wright-Patterson Air Force

1455
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,311
1955 you didn't exchange program with the ballistic

1456
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:00,639
Six Research Laboratories where he worked on it Armament project

1457
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:03,967
Which led to him being assigned to the

1458
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:07,807
Directorate as a assistant for advanced weapons concept

1459
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:12,415
70 was the commander of the Air Force Armament Laboratories

1460
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:17,023
So there's definitely some truth that he had experience in this area and had a pretty good resume

1461
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,815
That's what I can find no evidence

1462
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,351
That he wasn't any Secret

1463
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,911
Space program but I guess if I could then it wouldn't be

1464
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,935
Be so Secret

1465
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,703
I mean

1466
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,007
I assume he's still alive and rip

1467
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,567
So that would explain those

1468
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:34,687
I think that the secret space program thing Alex's mixing partner up with General stubblebine

1469
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,991
I think it is conflating there

1470
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
Import

1471
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,039
In terms of his

1472
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:44,415
I have no idea what else has told Alex but his

1473
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,207
Main significance to the

1474
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:51,071
Conspiracy world is that he insisted that the Oklahoma City bombing couldn't have been caused by mcveigh's bomb

1475
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,655
He tried to presented evidence to a grand jury and they were not

1476
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,679
Tim Preston said

1477
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
No thank you

1478
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:03,103
All the same he became a huge hero in the right-wing militia type Community because he lends an air of credibility to the theory

1479
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,127
The baby to be except

1480
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,431
Blame someone else for Timothy McVeigh terrorist

1481
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,479
I've dabbled in Parton

1482
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,759
And stuff and I don't really take

1483
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:14,879
Any of it very seriously and I don't know how much he has to say outside of the OKC stuff

1484
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:20,767
Susan weird inclusion in the list unless Alex is trying to come up with the most credible sounding people that he's

1485
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,327
Been able to get to be on his show

1486
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:26,143
I got my assumed the next one is just

1487
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
Zach

1488
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:33,311
No we pretend that didn't happen

1489
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,175
I like that

1490
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:38,943
Ganga

1491
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,759
High-level FBI agent Ted Gunderson told me every

1492
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:48,159
Was it one point in the FBI is reputation

1493
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:48,927
The fires of

1494
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,463
The satanic panic in general

1495
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,255
And the McMartin preschool case in

1496
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,023
Pacific

1497
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,351
We've gone over tab in the past so I'm going to let this be a briefs

1498
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,119
Synopsis

1499
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,935
Ted was a craven opportunistic lunatic

1500
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,799
Who makes sense that Alex's all reverent of them though so

1501
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,383
Call Alex is doing the trying to profit off another satanic panic

1502
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:12,991
You just tried to pull a Gundersen without having an impressive FBI resume to throw away doing

1503
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,783
Yeah I mean

1504
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,087
In his situation that's way better than gundry

1505
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:21,183
I mean aside from the view can be sued into Oblivion

1506
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:24,511
Sure

1507
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,119
Series of luminaries

1508
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,679
Each at the top of their field

1509
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,703
Play the highest

1510
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,543
Batman the Band-Aid comes off

1511
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,079
Those men now

1512
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
In hindsight

1513
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,151
Society

1514
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,991
Got it 100

1515
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:45,759
Depression trial

1516
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,551
We stand on their shoulders

1517
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,855
Show me other people getting killed right now

1518
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,671
What an absolute pile of s*** coward Alex's

1519
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:58,047
The reason is getting chills is cuz he's finally just letting it out and expressing what he's believed all along the tri-tip

1520
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:58,815
What time do you do

1521
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:01,631
For most of his career Alex pretended not to be into

1522
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,935
The John Birch Society because he knew damn well that if he

1523
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,959
He said that he was Saudi

1524
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:10,079
Deeply inspired by them you'd be seen as aperture and no one would take him seriously because people were where

1525
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,639
The John Birch Society and thought they were a bunch of assholes

1526
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,711
People also correctly knew that they were in

1527
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,759
Extremely right-wing organization

1528
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:22,367
There was no way to pretend to be above the left-right Paradigm farewell knew you were a Bircher

1529
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:27,231
Essentially brand you accurately is a fringe right-wing figure and then all

1530
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,535
The criticisms of people like Bush that you're making

1531
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,583
Would be better understood for what they were

1532
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:36,703
Alex had that stuff because it was important to his career and critical to him being taken

1533
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,263
At all seriously by anybody in the 90s

1534
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:46,431
The idiots mindlessly tweeting Alex Jones was right memes probably have no idea who the birchers were what they say

1535
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,711
Pretty much safer

1536
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
To come clean

1537
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:52,575
Alex has been pretty much mask off about his bigotry in the last few years but this

1538
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:55,647
Feels like an intellectual mask off kind of moment

1539
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,463
He's giving it up to these icons who were right about everything

1540
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,999
A frog lunatic

1541
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:05,119
In OKC bombing truther a guy who ruin people's lives in the satanic panic and the John

1542
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,143
Society

1543
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,423
What a loser

1544
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:12,543
Wow also to be clear if Alex believes that the JBS was right about everything that's basically him opening

1545
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,847
Declaring his opposition to civil rights

1546
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
Good for him

1547
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,895
I mean I think he was

1548
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,431
Fairly open to that

1549
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:23,551
Before but if you say that you're a big fan of the John Birch Society they were one hundred percent right

1550
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:27,135
You are also saying that we should live in a white male dominated Society

1551
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,671
Purely Prada

1552
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,463
Stand

1553
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,487
A lot of

1554
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:39,167
Pinterest ruling everything I mean that's that's just baked in there you know you can't let rich people develop a fart

1555
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,215
Society in trouble

1556
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,007
So after giving it up

1557
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:47,615
Relatively speaking in my world Somali pirates

1558
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,895
Existence

1559
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,431
Alex brings up the heat

1560
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,967
He couldn't go on-air last segment

1561
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,759
That's why you played those videos

1562
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
He's

1563
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,063
It's crying

1564
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:00,159
Maybe a little bit of Tears might be a little we play little soft

1565
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,487
Please w

1566
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,471
If we warn people we would have a chance to stop it

1567
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,823
But I also thought about looking out of the future

1568
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,895
What it would be like if we failed to stop

1569
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,455
The initiation of their final plan

1570
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,735
What would be like

1571
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,575
I couldn't even go on

1572
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:30,367
Eclipse

1573
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,415
Because

1574
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,351
I love you a lot

1575
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,143
I really appreciate you

1576
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,447
I got terminal cancer

1577
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,239
Play she'll be dead in six months

1578
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,335
A couple times

1579
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:55,199
And I smile at you like tell you they love you and then you're at the funeral they're dead

1580
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,575
And that's what this is I'm here

1581
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
Telling you

1582
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,159
Die

1583
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,183
You're going to die

1584
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:05,951
We're all going to die

1585
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,791
I like your grandma sitting there having a cup of coffee across the table from you

1586
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,119
Tell her that she's always going to love you and always going to be there

1587
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,167
The Chicago Died

1588
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,495
Life Goes On

1589
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,287
To children and grandchildren does

1590
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,591
This planet doesn't go on

1591
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,407
Wentworth

1592
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,711
Holy

1593
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,783
S*** Isis bad

1594
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:37,183
Who's bad

1595
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
Not least

1596
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,999
Because this is more like

1597
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,559
Your grandma coming to you

1598
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,839
For every 6 months

1599
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,631
What's for the past 20 years saying

1600
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,655
6 months

1601
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:49,471
Bright going to be dead in six months

1602
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:52,543
I meant also conspicuously this time when it

1603
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:55,359
It seems a little bit more severe than sometimes in the past

1604
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,919
It coincides with her

1605
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
Having a

1606
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:01,503
Huge lawsuit he's going to lose

1607
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,783
I'm going to be dead in six months

1608
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
But what's important

1609
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,111
It's now my narcissism has allowed me to

1610
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,927
You finally cross that bridge and say if I die

1611
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,743
The world ends with me still just

1612
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,511
Essentially

1613
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,279
Projection

1614
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,559
Of his own

1615
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,863
Individual experience being

1616
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,679
Forced onto his audience

1617
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,471
View vet like whatever is happen

1618
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,263
Nothing to me is happening to the world

1619
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:24,799
Yeah

1620
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,079
It look I mean

1621
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:26,847
This

1622
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,151
You know something all of your children are going to die

1623
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,711
Your ancestral memories while

1624
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,271
Be carried on into the future or whatever

1625
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,807
Wake me up it is

1626
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,087
You know what what's happening

1627
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:40,415
What all of the ancestors from the past are crying out

1628
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,487
Alright

1629
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
Yeah

1630
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,815
Domata grandmother saying

1631
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,863
I want to go home my family.

1632
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
I'm going to stop

1633
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,935
Good night too I'm ready to die

1634
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,239
You say I understand Irish

1635
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
But your decision

1636
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
Limelife

1637
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,615
You live on

1638
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,175
Your children and their children good people

1639
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:06,271
Their life meant something and if they cut us off like this

1640
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:09,599
And this incredibly ancient journey of our species it is

1641
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:13,183
It is a crime never before committed on this planet

1642
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:17,279
That is just so unspeakable to commit a lot

1643
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,047
Kryoz

1644
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,839
All of my will

1645
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:20,863
Cries Out

1646
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,679
I just bags all of your allies

1647
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,983
Distractions

1648
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,287
They're all interesting in fondant

1649
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,335
How old is news is amazing

1650
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,895
Impartial

1651
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,943
I'm a spiritual fall of Man

1652
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,735
Spiritual battle were in

1653
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,807
And the fact that were undoubtedly

1654
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,111
The end of days

1655
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,415
Being initiated by

1656
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,695
The Antichrist

1657
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,719
Forces

1658
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,511
Making the way

1659
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,791
Transhumanist

1660
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,167
And so on my metaphysical mean

1661
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
I

1662
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,031
Beg you on my knees

1663
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,079
Paralyzed

1664
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,663
This is the transmission

1665
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,991
This is the Waring this is why they fear us

1666
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,039
This is why they hate me above

1667
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
Anyone else

1668
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,367
It's because I know they're playing

1669
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,183
I was putting this position

1670
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,207
By God

1671
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,231
Okay

1672
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:22,815
Chosen by God

1673
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:28,447
Freaking me out I am I am calling for a 10-year moratorium

1674
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,471
On the entire

1675
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:36,383
Nobody can claim it's the end times for a decade with a f****** break

1676
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:39,711
Make us miss you card predictions

1677
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,247
Has it not been the end

1678
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,271
Yeah

1679
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,807
You know just give me 10 years

1680
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:47,391
8 frankly maybe that's a smart for you cuz I don't finally

1681
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,695
Can happen

1682
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:56,095
In wrestling terms of the end times are Overexposed

1683
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:00,191
Play come back baby exactly you might need to go get a new gimmick

1684
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:06,591
Bring it back and would like it more

1685
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,127
D Revelation right

1686
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,663
You can't tell you can't make it

1687
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:16,063
Is stunning Steve Austin or the the ringmaster got to go away and come back balls

1688
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:21,439
Yes I guess the system hates Alex cuz God chose him

1689
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,743
To just send his message of warning

1690
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,767
This is Cher

1691
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,327
Messed up

1692
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
What do you think about the

1693
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:28,863
I mean

1694
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,631
Wow

1695
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:32,703
Just real sad this interesting

1696
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:36,287
Hernandez will come on Tucker show and say

1697
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,823
They hate Alex because he

1698
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,639
He tells the truth and they're worried about how he

1699
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,967
He's honest about things where's Alex his own version of it is

1700
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:47,807
The devil right as manifested by

1701
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,367
Social media companies

1702
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:53,951
It's naturally they're scared that he was chosen by God

1703
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:56,511
To destroy they're planted by the system

1704
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,071
Find it offense

1705
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,703
Savannah Hernandez actually I find it offensive that

1706
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,495
Anybody on this f****** planet

1707
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,543
Can say that the problem

1708
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,079
We that you have is that you

1709
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,871
You don't watch Alex everyday

1710
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:18,271
What you existed across the world should be towed

1711
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:21,855
Totally transparent about this anymore

1712
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:30,303
Long stretches where I bought today

1713
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,351
Play more than

1714
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,631
Is it healthy

1715
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:37,727
But yeah I can't I can't bear the the like

1716
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,495
Boredom

1717
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,543
Of watching everyday

1718
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,079
Yeah but you did your

1719
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:45,151
Time to stretch in solitaire

1720
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:54,111
Yeah I can say pretty can greatly that the problem isn't that people aren't watching enough of them

1721
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,415
Load of s*** how dare you

1722
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,439
Yelp

1723
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,231
Sunway Alex was prepared

1724
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,255
To be euhus

1725
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,303
This voice

1726
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,327
From God

1727
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:09,983
Claims that he's not been taught lesson and after lesson after lesson in Iowa I would suggest that they sell Mike's Beer

1728
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,311

1729
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,408
No constantly make similar Miss

1730
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,480
Witness Protection

1731
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
By God

1732
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,528
None of it is May

1733
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,600
Very long

1734
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,416
Responsibility

1735
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,464
Where We Are

1736
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,304
Idaho weather event are you are now

1737
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,096
To be a light in the world

1738
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,400
In this coming total darkness

1739
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,824
The Bible tells is one-fourth of yours will be killed

1740
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:47,616
For the planets reversed

1741
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:52,480
And he's going to be action that will reverse that plan

1742
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,088
A lot of us aren't going to make it

1743
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,672
But that's okay because our Spirits are eternal

1744
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,208
But I want you to know

1745
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,232
That I love you

1746
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,280
And I appreciate you

1747
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,096
I stand with you

1748
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,632
Forever

1749
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,680
How do you sing with me

1750
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,984
What's a quarter of the world is going to die

1751
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,776
Best-case scenario

1752
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,800
I'm telling you

1753
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:20,384
It does not get more like oh that's how you were raised

1754
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,920
Then a

1755
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:26,272
Half hour stretch of you're all going to die everything's awful

1756
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,040
But listen

1757
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,600
I love you and you're very important

1758
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,624
Exactly

1759
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,952
And

1760
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,976
What's f******

1761
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,024
Text stop pretending

1762
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,888
This is like a day and a half after he finished his Moneyball

1763
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:50,336
Yeah that's a really good point Towers

1764
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:54,432
Reflector raised $2000000 to keep it for now we're all dead

1765
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,992
And no matter what we do 6 months from now

1766
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,528
Okay

1767
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,696
Connect

1768
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,232
Very specifically

1769
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:11,584
If the world is going to end only 48 hours after a money Bob

1770
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:18,752
Or conversely it did go well he got what he needed out of it and I also got some

1771
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,544
Bad News Bear

1772
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,872
I paid off that million-dollar

1773
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,896
Probably or at least

1774
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,664
Recoup

1775
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,224
Write what you would do right

1776
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,760
Now that we're cooking

1777
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,064
Anyway devil doesn't want us to go to space

1778
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:32,832
Metro

1779
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,624
And there are a lot of very twisted

1780
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,184
Very old forces that hate us

1781
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,976
Because of our success

1782
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,536
We've already done

1783
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,328
Cosmos

1784
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,400
That are attempting

1785
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,936
To stop us here

1786
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:52,288
Before this important mission is launched

1787
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,664
Admission

1788
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,760
Taking place in the third heaven

1789
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,296
What

1790
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,320
F*** off

1791
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,256
Did not even try to describe to you

1792
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:19,680
This is a say one cannot be told about the Matrix you must see

1793
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,216
The devil's false constructs

1794
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,496
Well it is even

1795
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,544
More attached to try to describe

1796
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,080
The next one

1797
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:29,664
So is Alex applying the mission

1798
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,992
To go to space so you can be reinforcements for a battle in heaven

1799
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:33,760
I guess

1800
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,552
I know what it sounds like

1801
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,088
And you know

1802
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,904
What's weird about this in my head

1803
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,208
Is that the Hubble Space Telescope

1804
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,768
Is almost completely alive

1805
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,096
It's almost perfect right now they've sent back the most

1806
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:51,168
The highest resolution image

1807
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,728
We can literally see in a photograph

1808
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,032
Billions of years in the past

1809
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:59,360
Billions are almost to the very beginning of the universe

1810
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,688
Did you see a third heaven in there

1811
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,224
No but why would you

1812
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,064
So the chick the use of the term third heaven is

1813
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,880
Audubon brand for Alex actually you know that term

1814
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,928
It's all a bit strange to hear that

1815
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,744
It's a term associated with the Church of Latter-day Saints

1816
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,512
It's largely

1817
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:22,144
And a lot of figures that Alex looks up to from the extreme right-wing anti-communism World we're Mormon

1818
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,448
Looks like the sky was in family room

1819
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:30,592
They're references to the third heaven and extra biblical text but also one and second

1820
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,360
10 Corinthians

1821
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,640
In the Bible

1822
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:35,968
And there's understanding that usually start around 2

1823
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,504
The first Heaven is the sky

1824
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,320
The second is space and then the third is where the angels

1825
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,088
And God bless

1826
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:45,696
It's pretty obscure terminology so it's weird

1827
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,464
To be using it

1828
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:51,328
It's great to hear that Alex is reporting to his audience that there's a war going on in heaven

1829
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,936
There's never

1830
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,960
A moment

1831
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:03,872
Even that's the worst part even though he's been yelling at us all this time about how he's safe and God and everything

1832
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:07,456
All of a sudden now I found out even when I die

1833
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:10,272
I'm going to have to go fight another f****** War

1834
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,552
That's brutal

1835
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:13,600
Universe

1836
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:15,392
Yeah

1837
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
I was wrong

1838
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,208
Great news.

1839
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,512
Even if he is right

1840
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,304
Don't be mad at God

1841
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,912
Destroyermen

1842
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,448
The blueprint

1843
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,496
Download

1844
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,776
Defeatist

1845
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
And

1846
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,384
That is a great Solace we have

1847
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,944
But we must not hate God

1848
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,624
Consciousness

1849
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,464
We must first before giving Godlike power

1850
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,768
Stacy Wilson

1851
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:55,328
Physically cellular leaffilter

1852
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,912
So that we will not be part of the future

1853
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,728
God is going to put us through

1854
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,008
Garbage can

1855
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,640
So I guess a

1856
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:11,456
Quarter of the world dying as a cleansing ritual

1857
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,248
Yep sweet

1858
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
Sweet

1859
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,856
Yeah so wait is he

1860
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,160
For Oregon

1861
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,696
Ninety percent of the population

1862
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,512
Be at least in favor it seems of

1863
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,536
Recorder

1864
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,840
Yeah I mean

1865
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:34,240
It really does seem like God's plan in the globalist playing sooner or later start dovetailing together every time

1866
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:37,824
Kind of like a Continuum problem

1867
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,848
Right right

1868
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:44,736
Play one is too high the others to Lowe's in the middle never find the

1869
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,504
Zaxby

1870
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,832
40% of the world dying

1871
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,600
I don't know

1872
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:52,160
It anything over 50 is not accept

1873
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,208
Obviously

1874
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:58,304
To kill off a quarter of the population that I guess that Alec with Alex's describing is that

1875
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,072
God's will

1876
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,120
Carrying out God's will

1877
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,680
I don't know this is just dumb

1878
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,704
Anyway

1879
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,752
Now that everything changes

1880
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:15,456
And now for something completely different because the second hour start in Rochester

1881
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,528
Here's where we're at

1882
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:21,344
As our mutual friend Tucker Carlson says

1883
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,624
They don't have

1884
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,672
White people who have a lot of time

1885
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:28,256
They act like people who are frantic to cancel the Constitution

1886
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,608
Because they are running out of time

1887
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,888
Minority

1888
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:35,680
They know that we are the majority

1889
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,216
They know people are waking up

1890
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,008
They know Infowars and

1891
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,032
Frank's Beach.

1892
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,360
A handful of others real America's voice

1893
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,432
Right side broadcasting is a very few

1894
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:47,968
Patriotic

1895
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:50,528
Lights out there the where the truth can still be heard

1896
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,320
But the American people are waking up

1897
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,368
And that's because of him for Wars

1898
01:27:56,416 --> 01:28:00,000
Everybody else's

1899
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:03,584
The public

1900
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,888
ProTrac comforce destroying us

1901
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,960
All of us America too far away

1902
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:18,176
I agree with that Alex we can win now. We were all going to die

1903
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:26,624
I I know he apologized and said sorry and said we were all going to die

1904
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,720
And then he said he loves us

1905
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:33,024
And now we're going to be fine

1906
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,072
But Rogers here now

1907
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,400
Yeah it's hurts so much

1908
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,704
Drew believes that

1909
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:44,032
GOP can win whatever in the midterm

1910
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,312
Cherokee

1911
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,896
Having some crazy people in there

1912
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:52,480
William like real Fringe lunatic

1913
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,504
She's got to be

1914
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,552
The key

1915
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,112
The key you should not donate to the GOP

1916
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,696
People who voted for Joe Biden come up to me in public and say

1917
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,768
They made show there is a red

1918
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,048
Tide coming

1919
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,376
But it's important that people understand that the election

1920
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,424
A republican majority

1921
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,448
In the house

1922
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:16,032
Will change nothing whatsoever

1923
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,848
The key here is to have a subset

1924
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:19,872
Patriots

1925
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,200
In both houses could be 10 to 15

1926
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,736
Women

1927
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
In the house

1928
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,320
As many as three or four in the Senate

1929
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:31,648
Who can use their leverage to change the agenda

1930
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,184
Save the country

1931
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,840
The Republican establishment

1932
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,656
Shutdown

1933
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,192
Populist movement

1934
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,472
They fear that came through

1935
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:47,264
The others

1936
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:54,688
The key here is realizing just getting Republicans elected it's on a fantasy of the 70s hardcore groups

1937
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,248
Bully pulpit

1938
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:01,088
There's no question.

1939
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,392
Are money the Republican National Committee

1940
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:07,488
We're sending their money to the Republican Congressional committee has senatorial committee

1941
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,512
Please folks

1942
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,328
Guardian foresight said that contribution here

1943
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:16,960
Legal defense fund

1944
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,728
So

1945
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,008
Alex

1946
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,544
Uno

1947
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,616
I don't even understand

1948
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,408
The margins of

1949
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,456
Electoral like

1950
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:31,040
A few people in there matter this is Unstoppable I think Rodger stone is right

1951
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,088
No Rodger is right

1952
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,112
No I mean like

1953
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:36,416
For his world

1954
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,488
Strategically Q correct

1955
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,816
Having some crazy people in there in order to be blocks

1956
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,096
That the

1957
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:47,424
Mainline party needs in order to get things done

1958
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:51,008
Is the best way to force your agenda through

1959
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:54,336
Bucket money versus big

1960
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,104
Yes

1961
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,664
He's coming from place that makes coherent

1962
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,944
Does not

1963
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,504
The rest of the ship

1964
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:04,832
Yeah

1965
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,600
Yeah

1966
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,160
But you know yours were

1967
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,696
Aware of

1968
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:12,256
That hour-by-hour

1969
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:18,912
Whether or not we live or die this is like Schrodinger's genocide I totally agree

1970
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:22,240
Like I can't I can't put this more bluntly then

1971
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:27,104
The experience of listening to the show if you believe him has got to be bewildering

1972
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
And

1973
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,896
Threatening

1974
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,920
Yeah I mean

1975
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,688
That's

1976
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:35,552
Go through the emotional experience of what that first hour would have been

1977
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,088
To someone who believes them

1978
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:40,160
And then the jarring arrival of Rodger Stone

1979
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:40,928
And it seems like

1980
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:41,952
Nothing

1981
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,512
Nothing that was said earlier matters

1982
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:48,352
Or was real now electoral victories are somehow relevant

1983
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:50,400
Again it's ridiculous

1984
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:52,960
Iowa Biden going to be gone soon

1985
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,776
After the election

1986
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:58,592
They will they themselves will enact

1987
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,896
The 25th Amendment and removed

1988
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:03,968
And they were lionize your mother doing it

1989
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:07,296
This great Statesman is just too ill to do the job

1990
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:10,112
He gave 100-percent to his country

1991
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,648
Because he's not well

1992
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,696
We have to sideline him

1993
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,720
For his own good

1994
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,000
Remember it takes

1995
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,024
A majority

1996
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:17,792
Of the

1997
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:18,816
Cabinet

1998
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,608
Plus the vice president

1999
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,144
Under the 25th Amendment

2000
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,168
To remove gel by

2001
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,448
So when does it happen

2002
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:27,008
Right after the election almost immediately after the election

2003
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,056
So let's keep an eye on that

2004
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:35,712
So who's going to be the new president this time, Harris probably

2005
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,272
That's boring for the globalist

2006
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:44,672
Right now it's going to happen, Harris will become president the speaker will be vice president

2007
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:48,000
No that's how that works out

2008
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,280
Yes that'll be Hillary

2009
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,144
Bringing Satan

2010
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,192
And then Obama will be the king of

2011
01:32:56,448 --> 01:33:02,592
Hell because he's the hell will become a Muslim caliphate

2012
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:07,456
Isn't that what we're become dukes and duchesses

2013
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,040
Let's bring it all together better

2014
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:17,696
How many times have we heard that the president is going to be removed and replaced by the vice president to

2015
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:20,768
We got a real hard deadline on this one so that you would happen

2016
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,816
Rodger also think

2017
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:26,400
Kevin McCarthy the leader of the GOP is not

2018
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,680
Cutthroat enough

2019
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,544
But we already have 4 McCarthy there it is

2020
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,568
He doesn't

2021
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,360
He's not playing for

2022
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,664
This guy doesn't have the courage

2023
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,968
To be reviewing way of saying that

2024
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:41,248
Fight to the Democrats

2025
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,040
Against

2026
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:44,832
What

2027
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,880
He lives with Frank Lawrence

2028
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:49,184
Izzy Izzy blackmailed is he like

2029
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,560
Alex is my ghost

2030
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,328
Wild

2031
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,888
Lot of revealing their thought patterns here

2032
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:00,192
While delivering in tokatli

2033
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:05,824
You've trapped in those early days of anti-communism

2034
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:06,848
Hey man

2035
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:07,616
If he's gay

2036
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,896
We can probably blackmail

2037
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,944
That's probably I was going to work

2038
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:14,784
Do you have to be so you take a note

2039
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:19,392
I I just think that Rodger saying not Playing for Keeps has the most

2040
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,928
Revealing statement that you

2041
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,952
You can make because yes

2042
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:22,976
He's right

2043
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,768
Kevin McCarthy is playing

2044
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,048
For an election

2045
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,120
Yeah assuming that one can be won or lost

2046
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,912
Rodger stone is playing

2047
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,496
Ford no electrical power

2048
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,032
Forever absolute

2049
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,336
Part of that also is

2050
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,616
Is there preemptive

2051
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:42,944
Declaration that the election will be stolen of course

2052
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,992
That's part of that Playing for Keeps

2053
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,784
Videos Rodger getting in that

2054
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,832
Of course

2055
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,440
Questioning

2056
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,976
Election outcomes

2057
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,024
What are you predicting for 2022

2058
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,840
My prediction is pretty

2059
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:00,864
Is pretty dire

2060
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:09,824
Excuse

2061
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,128
4 lockdowns but more precisely

2062
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:15,200
They will rush through legislation which will be sign

2063
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:15,968
It says

2064
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,760
Now

2065
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,832
Because it's too dangerous for folks to go to polling places

2066
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:24,672
It's too dangerous for them to show up on

2067
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,720
Here's a chip off Alex

2068
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,536
I don't think anybody voted for macaron

2069
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,304
Interesting

2070
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,072
Interesting

2071
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:32,608
Iris

2072
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:35,680
Anybody voted for macro nobody

2073
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,984
It's going to be great to be someone

2074
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,008
On Infowars

2075
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:39,776
Because you can

2076
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,824
Just improvise stuff and riff

2077
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:42,848
Thoughts

2078
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,664
I called them predictions and that there is no Conte

2079
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,968
Consequence when all of your predictions are s***

2080
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,320
I don't think it should be against the law

2081
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,856
To claim that intellect

2082
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:54,624
Installing

2083
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:55,904
No

2084
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,184
I do think there should be stay

2085
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,720
At this point

2086
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:01,024
If you're going to claim that the election is stolen

2087
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,072
You've got to have something

2088
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:06,400
That hanging over your head if you're wrong like

2089
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,960
I don't know I mean like

2090
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,520
Let's let's take it to place where the steaks

2091
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,056
Pixar even just

2092
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,592
Understood on the terms of like

2093
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:15,616
Credibility

2094
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:19,456
You have two tattoo on your forehead I was wrong about the election being stolen

2095
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:24,576
Ever so if you do TV then guess what everybody's going to see the first thing

2096
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:30,976
I was wrong about the election being maybe I'm okay with that in a metaphor

2097
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,256
There should be

2098
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,816
Some sort of a

2099
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,352
Consequence

2100
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,888
Is a broad term

2101
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:41,728
And I think there should be some kind of like a detriment

2102
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,752
2

2103
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:46,848
I think that's the same thing with like so much of the Infowars.

2104
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:51,968
100 albatrosses around Alex's failed

2105
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992
Nonsense

2106
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:53,760
Bulshit

2107
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:56,832
But he's carrying around with him and pretending he never said

2108
01:36:57,088 --> 01:37:00,160
I'm sure will likely be the case

2109
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:06,560
Rodger know that's what I'm saying we need to turn the albatross from metaphorical to

2110
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,328
Literal

2111
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,888
A Paris shirt

2112
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:16,288
It says you need to be a public and constant reminder of what you are I think what you're getting at

2113
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:22,688
Getting at 2 is that like the reason that this is allowed to go on and then get away with it as there's literally no

2114
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:23,712
Accountability

2115
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,480
And

2116
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,272
Somehow that

2117
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,064
Changing would be

2118
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:33,184
I mean I think

2119
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:39,584
Quote unquote

2120
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,424
Earlier in the show we heard Alex say that God chose him

2121
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:45,472
For this mission

2122
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,288
Now he's hedging things a little

2123
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,360
A revolutionary leader

2124
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,944
The globalist see me is that

2125
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:59,808
Firestone and a few others is that so

2126
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:02,368
We are your Champions champions

2127
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,416
But

2128
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,952
I tell you that

2129
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,232
This is big legs

2130
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:09,792
Point Blank Range

2131
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:15,424
We're coming into them because they know that

2132
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:16,960
Where is

2133
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:19,520
Call

2134
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,288
Blue people

2135
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:23,104
Make donations infowarsstore.com

2136
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:26,688
Thank you and salute you

2137
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,992
You are 1776 2.0

2138
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:33,600
I want a t-shirt books filmed

2139
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:38,976
Rodger seems to have reinvigorated Alex's beliefs

2140
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:39,744
So tomorrow is

2141
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,536
I'm just

2142
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:49,472
Yeah it is really do have a lot more energy than I do a parent

2143
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:52,544
Or it takes less energy to be full of s*** that it does

2144
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,312
To figure out

2145
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,080
They're full of s***

2146
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,384
Yeah

2147
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,712
Yeah I think trying to disentangle their nonsense is exhausting

2148
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,736
That makes Morse

2149
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,808
This is this is a load of s***

2150
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,880
Basically

2151
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,160
Expressing

2152
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:11,488
He'll say that it's not support of Russia

2153
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:17,632
Functionally it is

2154
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,216
My family members were mowed down by Russian tanks

2155
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:21,984
In Budapest

2156
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,520
In 1956

2157
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,056
Alex Jones

2158
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,616
All your Rodger Stone

2159
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:30,688
Can you tell the truth about what's really happening in Ukraine

2160
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:35,296
Million-dollar

2161
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:41,184
Dominium in Miami Beach by the way

2162
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:45,792
He's playing the role of the president

2163
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,840
This war is not about

2164
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:48,864
Say it's about

2165
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:52,448
Is the narrative it's based on a comedy sketch that delinsky did back in

2166
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:54,496
Taxing day is that

2167
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,288
Stewed crowds have discovered

2168
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,824
And they're pretending it's Gaper

2169
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,432
It's pretty telling that Alex is pushing this very stupid in.

2170
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:05,504
Really illustrates how bad the information he passes on to his audio

2171
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:08,320
So this is the second time that he's used

2172
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:11,392
False or misleading information to claim that someone's gay and being black

2173
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,232
More than should happen in a day it's very weird

2174
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,256
Yeah it's very weird

2175
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,608
Superheroes mind is going

2176
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,912
And I think that's

2177
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,472
God damn if you are ancestors

2178
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:32,384
Are you erase memory they're crying out and they are crying out because of stuff I would imagine that

2179
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,432
If I was Rodger Stone the ancestor

2180
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,968
Who had been murdered by the Russian

2181
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:36,736
Pinstripe

2182
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,296
I would not be on board

2183
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,344
Stop

2184
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,368
Oroville

2185
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:45,440
Get out get out I'm just saying maybe they're crying

2186
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:49,024
So the third hour is Rodger and Alex

2187
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,072
Hanging out with Bobby Barnes

2188
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,168
To give some World analysis

2189
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,960
What a trio shitbags

2190
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,752
Yes and I don't care

2191
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,032
I'm not interested at all

2192
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:05,664
I listen to it and was bored but he did say one thing that is felt like I want to touch on

2193
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,200
Component

2194
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,736
The French elections today

2195
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,528
A pen

2196
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:22,048
Territories outside of the Continental control in other places like Martinique wailupe excetera

2197
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,584
These places showed up

2198
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:27,424
3240 Point swing from 2017 to 2022

2199
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,960
In favor of Le Pen

2200
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,264
Yet no no place inside the

2201
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,032
The continent

2202
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,080
In France

2203
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:40,224
Showed any such similar swing

2204
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,760
Royal she lost

2205
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:44,576
Exactly and he replaces that she lost by

2206
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,600
By 50 points last

2207
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,392
I mean it

2208
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,928
That kind of margin swing

2209
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:50,464
Cbiz a fun game

2210
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:56,864
Bring the pain did much better than expected in French territories outside the borders of France like Guadalupe Martinique in

2211
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,632
Reunions

2212
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:04,032
In order to explain this Barnes has decided to suggest that this is proof that macron was able to steal the election in places in

2213
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:04,800
Inside France

2214
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:06,848
What's on my wasn't able to affect the vote totals

2215
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,128
In these other territory

2216
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:08,896
It's too far away

2217
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:11,712
Using the exact same information and evidence

2218
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,504
Why not play the opposite game

2219
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,088
Minecraft The Conspiracy that lepere was able to steal a lot more votes in the

2220
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:19,136
Cuz they were outside of

2221
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,160
The country's borders

2222
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:24,768
You could use the geographical distance to pretend that they must have shotty ballot condole

2223
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:30,912
I know you're using a different point of view I mean it makes just as much sense it's all arbitrary bulshit

2224
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,704
The point here is that this

2225
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,984
Conspiracy hinges on nothing

2226
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,008
And the alternative

2227
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:36,288
Conspiracy makes as much

2228
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:43,456
Barnes is covering the story this way because lappin is an extreme right-wing figure matches the model of a l Barnes would want in the world

2229
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:45,760
Regardless of the excuses

2230
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,808
Every failing of such a leader needs

2231
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,856
It speaks playing by them getting screwed by

2232
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:50,624
Vasken's

2233
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:55,744
In reality lapenna macron both lost in the first round of voting in these / 2

2234
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,792
These territories to the far-left candidates

2235
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,328
Jean-Luc melenchon

2236
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,608
Which

2237
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:02,400
In the context of the later vote

2238
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:05,728
There's a one element of this that was like today

2239
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:12,128
Before right mobilizing some votes but probably a much larger part of it is people in these territories not liking how things are going

2240
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,408
Going for them under macron

2241
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,176
And voting

2242
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,712
Against him as opposed to vote

2243
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,480
For the pain

2244
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:21,344
It's a bit unpredicted and political scientist who spoke to the guardian where cut

2245
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,880
Slightly off guard but it also makes

2246
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,648
Complete science

2247
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,464
People in these territories have different immediate

2248
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,256
Concerns the books of Mainland France

2249
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:30,560
It makes sense that you might see slightly

2250
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,584
Voting patterns

2251
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,864
Based on those

2252
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,632
Immediate

2253
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,680
Well I mean it's not like

2254
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:41,312
Macron or the last president or the president before that or the present before that is really done much

2255
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:44,128
To make their lives a lot better so true

2256
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,152
Yeah it's kind

2257
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,432
End of the way there and their

2258
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,456
The preferred candidate

2259
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,736
What's going to try

2260
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,528
Network for somebody

2261
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,064
Or or

2262
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:56,672
Maybe macron did rig all of those in France that somehow wasn't able to

2263
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,000
Forgot to do the overseas vote

2264
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,536
I love the idea that

2265
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,560
No one voted for

2266
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,328
Macron

2267
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,352
I want it

2268
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:08,704
Well that's Roger's idea Barnes a little more nuanced Roots build

2269
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,496
The big swing

2270
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,032
Now he needs

2271
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,568
The train under Steve

2272
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:16,640
So we come to the end of the Sandman I will say

2273
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:19,968
I don't know what to think

2274
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,064
Honestly like obviously the second and third hours

2275
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,856
When Alex has people around

2276
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:28,160
He certainly in a much different mood

2277
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:33,024
What's the first hour to me in a way that a lot of times

2278
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:34,048
Things.

2279
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,584
Because it is incest

2280
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,632
It goes on and on

2281
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:39,168
He doesn't storm off

2282
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:39,936
You just

2283
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:40,960
Doesn't start

2284
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:41,728
The

2285
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,800
Did the second segment is clips

2286
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:48,640
Feels more like somebody who's actually in a like

2287
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,432
Yeah

2288
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:54,016
Yeah I personally don't appreciate being told I'm going to die

2289
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:55,040
By anybody

2290
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:57,088
Barbecue no like I don't take it

2291
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:58,368
Fun

2292
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:02,208
But generally speaking it's been prior to some very negative

2293
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,768
Outcomes

2294
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:07,072
And then the other time it was like guide

2295
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,096
The doctor

2296
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680
Yes

2297
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:15,008
And I'm interested to see where it goes

2298
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:21,920
We're recording this on Tuesday and into a little bit of his show today

2299
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:26,784
He was back in a down mood when he was talking alone

2300
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:30,112
What does responding to the news that Elon Musk bought Twitter

2301
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,904
Andy was not

2302
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,696
Convinced it was going to change much

2303
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:40,608
That's the first good analysis I think I've seen from him in a long long. He's up maybe we'll maybe we'll get back on we'll see

2304
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,400
Still kind of morose

2305
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:46,240
I don't know what to believe

2306
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,544
That the first hour was

2307
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:49,568
Him

2308
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:53,920
Externalizing and projecting his own situation on the audience

2309
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:56,480
The legal situation that he's in is

2310
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:59,040
Unstoppable at this point

2311
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:01,856
And so the global is Doom is Unstoppable

2312
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,696
Once he had someone like Rodger around and then Barnes

2313
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:09,536
Think about self each other and some of that Gloom lifted for him and

2314
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:15,936
Be kind of forgot about his troubles Chicken around about maybe some people are gay and blackmail

2315
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:22,336
Right right right now when I'm on my downstate and I'm left alone with my thoughts that's that's the worst time to be left alone with my

2316
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:26,176
I'm grateful that I don't have a radio show that I have to do

2317
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:30,528
So I can project them onto everybody feeling an hour telling everyone they're going to die

2318
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:34,624
Every time I'm always like that God I'm not telling everybody they're going to die right now

2319
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:39,744
The bottom line that I would say regardless of what the explanation for any of the stuff is

2320
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,768
The invisible

2321
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,304
The essential thing is this is

2322
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,072
F****** Urus

2323
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:46,144
You can't do sit like this

2324
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:46,912
You can't

2325
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:47,936
Because he's not

2326
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:51,776
He's not saying these kind of things as like abstract possibilities

2327
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:52,544
If you saying

2328
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,824
This can't be stopped

2329
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,616
Within a few years

2330
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:56,384
Lisa

2331
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:59,456
Quarter of the world will be dead because of the globalist

2332
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:02,016
Plants that again cannot be stopped right

2333
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:02,784
Amarin

2334
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,832
Sticking around about like

2335
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:06,624
Trivial electoral politics

2336
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,672
And who Trump is going to endorse

2337
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,952
The next hour

2338
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:11,232
Inappropriate

2339
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,000
This is just

2340
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:12,768
Bulshit

2341
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:17,632
Yeah I mean it'll be a little bit like hey everybody going to die alright

2342
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:19,168
Now let's get to the car dash

2343
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:21,472
Lawsuit

2344
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:27,872
You take a lawsuit very serious saving us from 90s

2345
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:29,408
Percent dead or whatever

2346
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:33,504
I'm interested to see what comes of this but

2347
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,808
It may be nothing

2348
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,088
Maybe Alex will be off air

2349
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,208
A whole lot of faith in making that predict

2350
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,232
Action based on by

2351
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,000
Years of

2352
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,816
Play Doom and Gloom Celtics

2353
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,120
Something that feels different about that

2354
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:51,168
Who knows maybe that's just me

2355
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:51,936
Overthinking

2356
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:55,520
We'll see if Alex is correct

2357
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:07,808
Will be back but until then

2358
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,832
Like to wish you all

2359
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:10,112
Happy dreamy creamy sauce

2360
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:14,976
Holding

2361
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:20,608
Alexandra Thurston color
