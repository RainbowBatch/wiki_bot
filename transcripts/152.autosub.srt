Somewhere Out There

00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,616

63
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
At 1 with Julia Stiles

10 Things I Hate About You Feel like she's really good actress

65
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
Field where they are

66
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
No that's

67
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
Dystopian novels

68
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,615
Actually that's just our world being dystopian where Spider-Man

69
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
Rebooted every other week

70
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
Presence

71
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Like

72
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
Oregon Farms

73
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
Sure do like a bunch of

74
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Clones and shitgate

75
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
Entire lives

76
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
Is there to give away their organs

77
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,583
It's brutal okay it's kind of a bad mood but I loved

78
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,775
Relate to you on a human level

79
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
Well you know what I mean

80
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319
Relates me on a human level is

81
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
You can do so by going to their website knowledge feit.com and couldn't support the show we really appreciate it so much at

82
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,119
No that's not that bad

83
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
It's done long-ass f****** name

84
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:06,335
Everybody

85
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,943
We're really making strides we're almost at the point where this is a viable life

86
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
For me in terms of a

87
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
And

88
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
I'm starting to realize that I hate

89
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,207
Do so much business up top for get to the actual show but I realized we just crossed our original goal

90
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
There we sat back when we started

91
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
Accepting donations

92
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
We would never reach

93
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:40,639
A breakdown of one of Alex's documentaries

94
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
We've already.

95
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,247
So we can't do that to reward people

96
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,551
No you could finish the f****** bracket

97
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:53,439
Oh boy I can do that I will work on that put the other thing is if we

98
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,095
We're close to reaching another goal or maybe 75% of the way to another goal

99
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:06,495
Other words that go with we would do a live show in Chicago which we've already done

100
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,847
We are really bad at rewarding people

101
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:18,783
Do the things that we say we're going to hold off on

102
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
Did not tell you that

103
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:25,951
If you have any ideas suggestions

104
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,767
See as rewards for us reaching milestones

105
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
Why would I be very open

106
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,447
Do you like to tweet those at us or reach out to us at our group

107
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
Go home and tell your mother

108
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
And now it's on Facebook

109
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:46,431
If we reach another what I would say another $2,000 in donations

110
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,599
Holy

111
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
We go to Sweden

112
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,047
That for that kind of money I go to Sweden or Finland listeners

113
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
But

114
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,663
Thursday April 19th

115
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,711
Amadeus

116
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,575
Nothing to do with that show

117
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:29,695
We're going to be going over Thursday April 8th

118
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,303
This is the day after the news breaks that Alex Jones

119
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
Course season 2 strain

120
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,263
Mood I don't want to talk too much about that come up at the end of the

121
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
Episode so don't think we're ignoring me

122
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,407
He's going to give a statement on it he's going to talk about it

123
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,991
He said he's going to give up that us the whole truth and nothing but the truth

124
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,271
Does not say so

125
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Classic

126
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
Alex

127
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
Not does not anywhere help me God

128
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,743
Note that Willy doesn't need God's help to give the truth dance

129
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,863
Is it real hard and only gets booed at the end of the episode

130
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
When we get there

131
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
You'll do a little dance

132
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,919
About about

133
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
We will

134
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Be discussing a number of

135
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
Shocking revelations were myth

136
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:33,439
People do not listen to the entire show. No one understands why you do

137
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Thank God I don't even

138
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
Call me

139
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
No

140
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
Former director of the FBI

141
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,847
I keep trying to come up with a middle name I don't know what his middle name is

142
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,759
Pictures of him hanging out with Method Man Ghostface on

143
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,159
People in so many ways are you just wanted to find out it was backstage at a talk show

144
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,231
Did they just hang out

145
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,631
And cigarettes with Bill Murray just hundred percent

146
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
Very hurt

147
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:22,335
Boston built like the idea of like if you went back to like the early nineties and you were like

148
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
36 Chambers it just come out

149
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
You know what

150
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,223
About 25 27 years

151
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,551
You are going to be hanging out backstage at a talk show

152
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,879
With the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

153
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,951
And it's going to be cool yeah they're going to word

154
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:43,839
No reason really we are in the

155
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,447
Alex talks about Jim Comey

156
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
You need to give me

157
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
I need the tracking

158
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,055
And that is the he's aware that like

159
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Boy people keep suing me

160
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
I'm a pervert

161
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,303
Child molester

162
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Okay

163
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
Here's the difference

164
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:28,127
Between those two things first of all I love the

165
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
Now I am watching every single thing I say for whether or not I will be soon but I'm going to pretend like I do

166
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,183
Care about very clear that I said

167
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Think you look like

168
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Maybe you didn't

169
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
Or whatever

170
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
Show me was being interviewed and talking about that like

171
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
Reason he said that is because

172
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Navigation

173
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
They was inconclusive

174
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
And he was asked about it

175
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,695
Couldn't prove it

176
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
Night talk show hosts

177
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
George Stephanopoulos about it

178
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
He can't say

179
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Of course he did

180
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
You can't say

181
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
No

182
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:27,263
He also probably can't do the like I can neither confirm or deny that sort of boilerplate language

183
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Appointed in

184
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:34,175
Pissed off about that look

185
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
This is this is the worst

186
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
F*** the head of the FBI f*****

187
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
The former head of the FBI

188
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,903
Puppy FBI.

189
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,791
I'm sorry request station

190
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
Into whether or not this is real

191
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
And he's like I don't know

192
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
I don't know

193
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:00,031
He doesn't look like a pedophile

194
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
No one asked him

195
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,639
His thoughts on the matter it's just a complete

196
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
It's a very bad equipped

197
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
Little bit

198
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,599
Little kids

199
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,487
Martian from Pluto

200
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
What do you want

201
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
Victory or death no surrender

202
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,759
We all can remember back in April of last year and is being sued by Hamdi ulukaya of Chobani yogurt

203
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
Till my dying day

204
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,135
On this I will stand

205
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:53,535
I apologize by the way Slater public apology

206
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,703
100 percentage they wanted a lot of money and I totally forgot

207
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,287
Defamation

208
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
Also

209
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:10,175
I think you're pushing the envelope

210
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,479
Do it when you're in Alex Jones

211
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
In that last bit of it when he's like

212
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
Maybe you have sex with children

213
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,327
Defensible insofar as maybe everybody does or does not have

214
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:37,055
Also call me is like 66 he like he's super.

215
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,175
Too far for Alex Alex call me probably

216
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
No chance I bet Method Man

217
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Basketball game

218
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
Huge

219
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
Basketball

220
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,911
I'm living back in the 90s

221
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,567
It's all about analytics

222
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,175
No my premises out the window

223
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
Victory or death

224
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,999
Haha

225
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
I get it

226
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Rapping

227
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
Bring up a little bit

228
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
Skin in the game

229
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
I lost a lot of skin

230
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,511
Angelina's

231
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
Because

232
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
In the middle of Jones

233
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:10,239
Doesn't the future

234
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,591
You should ask your house

235
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
Gyros

236
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
Call Joan

237
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,135
Destruction

238
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,535
I think he's talking about Star Wars

239
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
No

240
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,399
You strike me down

241
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,239
Yeah you don't Alex

242
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
One everybody like us is like

243
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Well I guess we got to move on

244
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
Or to Everett

245
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,551
I mean if he does like let's say someone kills him

246
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Something like that

247
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Terrible

248
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
You'd always be bad

249
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,255
And I'd be like

250
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,327
What kind of cute

251
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,167
The shame icer item not for it but I would look at it

252
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
These are kind of the consequences of this

253
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:19,359
Credibly bigoted violent

254
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
To end up getting

255
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,223
People so activated in a certain way

256
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,879
I see how that happened

257
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:38,047
The house of Jones getting taken down is not the Red Wedding the house of Jones getting taken down as the Lannisters getting murdered

258
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
Is it

259
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,911
Cool with that you bring that up cuz Alex Jones

260
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:48,031
Straight up steals the Game of Thrones theme song and uses it for a clip video

261
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:55,455
It is a new world order

262
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
Organization

263
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,927
So it goes on Friday

264
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:11,327
That goes on like to have three minutes at the entire game

265
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,679
I don't think that falls under fair use I think they probably is illegal

266
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
Opera

267
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
Looking to go with that

268
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,615
Secure the rights for the composer of Game of Thrones theme

269
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:30,015
And see if he's interested

270
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
Stop

271
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
He seems like a cool guy

272
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Soundtracks

273
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
Set the Riza

274
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:43,071
Full circle

275
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
Coolio if you are listening

276
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,335
Just kind of Imagine our pre-show conversation

277
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
Always be

278
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
There's alot going on

279
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,551
Anyway

280
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
First of all

281
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Thrifty dude

282
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,439
Integrity with money

283
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:14,303
All-time eyes traffic infowars.com

284
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
Ford.com

285
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,335
50 million-dollar

286
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:48,863
I mean I am a machine

287
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,167
You're committed to go all the way to the end

288
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,079
We're winning and they know it and their fifth

289
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
Nope really don't think so

290
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,503
Also wasn't the reign of terror almost over and at the same time

291
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,183
When you think of War Machine you think about that Ultimate Fighter who beat the

292
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
The s*** out of his girlfriend because he thought he was

293
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
He was cheating on her

294
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
Completely

295
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
I want to watch revenge

296
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,615
Warmachine is relevant

297
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,991
Is he paralyzed for like

298
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
Water

299
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,599
45 seconds and then immediately was saved by start

300
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,951
I don't watch Nerd movie

301
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:52,095
Anyway

302
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,935
How much of that money is coming from the operation how much

303
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
Could you save

304
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
Flies with those boats

305
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
Coach

306
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,431
Can you imagine

307
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
One of his boats

308
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,575
You don't even have the windows 10

309
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
Ridiculous

310
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,208
I'm so sitting right next to Alex Jones

311
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
United flight

312
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
Yeah I can

313
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,704
Number no

314
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,896
How do I talk with him

315
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,968
We see how susceptible years used

316
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Alex

317
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
I got to tell you

318
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Out

319
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
I was born in

320
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
One of the proto-celtic

321
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,584
You know what though I actually could f*** with him

322
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
Because I talked about this before on the air

323
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
Not like not like that

324
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,872
B interesting like parallel to Barack Obama

325
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
Throughout some of his

326
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,480
Education early life

327
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,344
No not that part call Larry Nichols

328
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,160
My dad was at Harvard

329
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
Same time

330
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,072
Was that the East-West Center which is a research organization

331
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,472
You got his doctorate

332
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,264
Episode

333
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
What do you mean

334
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,104
I mean are you going to eat are you Easter you with

335
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,176
It's about but merging

336
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:48,064
Terms of studying cultural studies

337
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
The conspiracy

338
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
I've been there many times

339
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:56,000
In my early life

340
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
My dad is deeply involved

341
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,352
Understandable I'd like

342
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:08,288
I could do something like that it would be fun it was really fun if I was stuck on a plane

343
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,616
I could really f*** with his head just a guy

344
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
F*** that

345
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
He would suck to be out

346
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,296
Right

347
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,112
Conspiracy that's that's the only way you play it on that plane

348
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Anyway

349
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Order conspiracy

350
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
People say that a lot of different

351
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:35,680
Evergreen

352
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:41,056
We deal with recent events

353
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
Positive made

354
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,664
Mad and rightfully so

355
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
USA

356
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:55,136
Almost

357
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,768
The further create white guilt

358
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
In restaurant

359
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,544
Your policy that you can't do that

360
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,152
What restaurant

361
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:41,216
So earlier in the show

362
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,032
Rooms are for customers only

363
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,640
There's a clip earlier in the show that I didn't cut

364
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
Because it was sort of

365
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,968
It got muddy and he started yelling about

366
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
And being on the right side

367
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
Civil rights

368
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:59,136
I don't want to deal with it

369
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
Two Gentlemen who got arrested

370
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,464
Starbucks

371
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Vista

372
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Aretha

373
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Rashawn Nelson

374
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,376
Initially brushed it off with a Starbucks manager told him he couldn't use the restroom

375
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
Because it wasn't

376
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
He thought nothing of it when he and his childhood

377
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,544
Friend and business partner Dante Robinson were approached

378
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
If they needed

379
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
Twenty-three-year-old on spinners

380
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,408
The client explaining that they were just waiting for a business

381
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
A few minutes later they started noticing

382
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,040
Hardly notice to the coffee shop

383
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,600
Until

384
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,904
Sushi called

385
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,928
The police on us

386
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,536
Video of

387
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
April 12th

388
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Trespassing arrest

389
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,912
Post office in the United States over racial profiling

390
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
Or shopping while black

391
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
Nelson Robbins

392
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
In the cities well-to-do

393
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
House Square neighborhood

394
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
An incident recorded on Waco

395
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
Customer cell phone

396
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,736
In the weeks since the 9th of May with a Starbucks apologetic

397
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
Lasting change

398
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
Is it coffee shop chain including new policies

399
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Discrimination

400
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,904
Aiden

401
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Quote

402
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,512
We do want to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody again Robin

403
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,560
Sunset

404
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,632
What is it was a kid but didn't know somebody that knew somebody

405
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
Do they make it to jail what happened

406
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:21,056
On Thursday they also got an apology from the Philadelphia police commissioner Richard Ross

407
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,872
A black man who defended his officers

408
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,992
I should have said that the officers acted within the scope of the law

409
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,040
And not that they didn't do anything wrong

410
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
Words are very important

411
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,392
At a press conference at snowbird

412
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,720
No

413
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
Miserably

414
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
In addressing the arrest

415
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Shouldn't be

416
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
Shouldn't be the person bacon

417
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Things worse

418
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Shame on me

419
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Is it anyway I've done

420
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,568
That you got to realize is

421
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
I don't know

422
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
I don't know man

423
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,712
Understand

424
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
These two dudes ended up

425
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,296
Spending all about 12 hours in prison

426
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:09,184
What didn't get out until midnight they were held in prison until midnight

427
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
And they only got out because

428
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
The district attorney

429
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Klein to Prosser

430
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
Like this is

431
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:19,680
There's a really f***** up thing they make

432
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,520
B made them sit in his cell point where one of them was at

433
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
Specifically went on record

434
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,872
I don't think I'm going to make it out

435
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,432
I don't think I'm going to survive this

436
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,504
It's incredibly f***** up in the idea that Alex is just

437
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
Dismissing it as like

438
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
Hey how would I buy

439
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,672
Publicity stunt

440
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
What

441
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
What

442
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,072
Razee

443
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,864
If you are white they would have said

444
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Hey

445
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
Go away

446
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,752
Even if the cops were called the cops would have been like okay

447
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
Now you have left Starbucks

448
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:01,152
So go home I can do something else I can't count the number of times

449
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
But I've gone into Starbucks use the bathroom

450
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
I can't count the number of time

451
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,064
I've been to my therapist office too early

452
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,392
There's a Starbucks down the street I sit there for like 15 minutes

453
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,792
No one bothers me I don't buy anything they said f****** matter

454
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
Used to manage a Starbucks

455
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
Rhino about their corporate policy

456
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,168
Threat so that comes into play

457
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,728
A little bit next clip

458
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,288
A card or something that allows you to

459
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
Be part of any

460
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,384
Like any Starbucks you ever want to go to you just

461
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,784
Unceremoniously

462
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,368
If anything they should be bothering me

463
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,928
Did you call the police when I show up based on me

464
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,000
You come in to manage the store tomorrow got a better job

465
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Got to go

466
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
What are the reasons Alex is talking about Starbucks is in response

467
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
Uproar

468
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
About this

469
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,592
Legitimately f*****-up

470
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
In the public eye

471
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
The f******

472
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,456
What what

473
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
Word 2018

474
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,856
Imagine how long we've been going through this year

475
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
It's all

476
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,464
Ate all of the time

477
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,768
All the time in America

478
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
Two black men cannot

479
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,840
Anythink

480
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
Without

481
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
Being a taste

482
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
2% raise

483
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
Of having

484
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,728
Cops

485
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
Come down to

486
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,336
Forget that last quit

487
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,896
Is this trend that dumb people have

488
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,248
People with unexamined bigotry and bias

489
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,088
Otherwise known as

490
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,648
Well that I think we all have some sort of bigotry

491
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,952
We try and work again

492
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
The problem is my son examine

493
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,792
And when you just allow it to

494
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Exist

495
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
And what it does

496
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,680
Is it criminalizes

497
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,264
Black behavior that you would forgive and look the other way when wiping

498
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:07,104
Recognized

499
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
But that is

500
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
Something they do

501
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
It's very threatening

502
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
Complete mess

503
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
It's

504
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Disgraceful

505
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
Yeah well no other,

506
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,208
60% of 1

507
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
That's it

508
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,096
No I think it's actually I think it's closer to like 8

509
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
I think it was.

510
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,960
Evangelical Christian

511
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,360
I think it was like made 270

512
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,432
Support communities

513
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
The General Public

514
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
Real

515
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
Starbucks

516
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,392
Starbucks

517
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Which is good

518
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
I don't know if it'll work

519
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
But

520
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,536
God bless

521
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,816
For trying something

522
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,912
Research Subway to give those guys

523
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
12 hours of their life back

524
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,008
Isaac

525
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,592
Very glad that

526
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
Murder

527
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,928
That's a totally legitimate fear

528
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Totally legitimate

529
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
To Starbucks

530
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,792
Business

531
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
Then I will

532
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Was murdered by the

533
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
The f****** cock

534
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,192
There was a f******

535
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
60

536
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,568
40 chance that was going to happen

537
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,944
It's about so it is good to address these issues

538
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
He's out Noah corporations are best

539
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:55,648
No answer answer is no

540
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
And stuff like that

541
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
No one

542
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,304
Serious workout

543
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,656
I don't know if it's going to be affected be that as it may

544
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
What happened

545
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
There was an uproar about it

546
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,776
And then some guy made a video

547
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,176
I think it's coming from you

548
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,504
Video of him going into Starbucks

549
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,088
Watch the rest of his videos he might be totaled

550
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
But it seems to me this guy

551
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
Watch the video in question

552
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,976
Hey Tim

553
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
I'm about to go into the Starbucks

554
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,792
Get my reparation

555
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:40,192
Coffee coffee

556
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
I heard y'all are racist

557
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
I want a free coffee

558
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,920
That story is really f***** up y'all give you a coffee

559
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,736
So that is all right now I just

560
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
Alex is going to set it up and then

561
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,160
Again as someone who has managed to Starbucks

562
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,720
I have some things to say on the other end of the

563
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
Call Mitch

564
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,864
There's a

565
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
Natural Ally about Starbucks

566
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,640
Starbucks

567
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,064
Association

568
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,728
I heard about that

569
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,824
Free coffee

570
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,408
Video

571
00:33:54,176 --> 00:34:00,320
Coincide

572
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:11,328
He's mugging to the camera and likes having a great time

573
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:16,192
A person is working I have a really nice conversation

574
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,520
Before I end up going back

575
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:25,920
Everybody have a good day

576
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,456
Because

577
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
Stunt didn't quite work

578
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,112
Comedy video

579
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,160
And the person behind the counter was

580
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,440
Super nice I mean

581
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:43,328
The plan was actually to make a whole mess of things

582
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,424
Going to be like

583
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,776
It's unclear exactly

584
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,312
Starbucks

585
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
If

586
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,384
Starbucks headset okay

587
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
Change the game

588
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:02,016
We're not closing 8000 stores for race bias training

589
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,344
Every black person gets free coffee for a day

590
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,416
That's a whole weirder situation

591
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:16,096
It's like when Taco Bell gives you a free taco

592
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,888
Whatever Little Dipper

593
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,192
Idream interviews

594
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
They make her coffee

595
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,872
Avery about 2 hours you got to flip it

596
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,968
Tons of coffee that they don't end up selling

597
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
The company is

598
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,784
Keenly aware of that

599
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,552
To nurture

600
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,088
The image of being

601
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,368
The friendly establishment

602
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,672
So generally speaking

603
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,976
Managers are trained

604
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
22in

605
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,560
Courage costume

606
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,376
To give coffee to homeless people to come in

607
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,448
Because they know it's just going down the drain anyway

608
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,496
If you can create this place

609
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
People feel safe

610
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
Feel cared for that sort of thing

611
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,896
You get much more mileage out of that that the coffee you're going to

612
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,200
Cuz it's not fresh anymore

613
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,272
You'd always be given coffee to people who come in

614
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
That doesn't address

615
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
The other pieces

616
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,416
They know there's room way to coffee

617
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,976
And they know that these people are

618
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,024
Close to minimum wage

619
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
Locate employees

620
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,888
So if anyone comes in and is like

621
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,168
I demand

622
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Wires

623
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
You just give it

624
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Because that's how it works

625
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,848
In the service industry generally speaking when there's no loss for the company

626
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
And

627
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:36,992
Do you want your employee to get into a fight with this guy who's clearly videotaping whatever

628
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
It's it's

629
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,064
Absolutely protocol for you to be like

630
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,696
Employees are trained to be like

631
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,048
Let It Go

632
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
Not worth it to argue it's not worth it

633
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,400
To try and Chase down

634
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,960
Insured anyway or in the walk

635
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,032
Unless you're Orlando Jones in the replace

636
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Sure

637
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,848
Don't remember that movie

638
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408
At least

639
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
3 *

640
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
You think

641
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,272
Did I can take away from this

642
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,064
Really anti-union

643
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Which is strange

644
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Yeah

645
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:19,488
Yeah it's super and analyze what's going on inside that movie

646
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
Purely anti-union

647
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
Ownership

648
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Banana

649
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,192
It's like every is every argument that you've ever heard somebody

650
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,752
Players are overpaid

651
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:35,104
If they didn't get the money it's going more towards billionaire

652
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
Yeah there's all that money

653
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
10 make it all the goods

654
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
Anyways

655
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,832
I'm sorry I'll be there in about replace the replacements

656
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:50,208
For so long I've been saying that will replace blade Trinity free show

657
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
So

658
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,512
Nothing

659
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:57,632
The little bit later Alex does say something to the effect

660
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,704
If black people are happy Africa

661
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,104
9

662
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,176
White people ugly

663
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,504
Territory

664
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,576
Eclipse about that and I've seen it posted in like

665
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
Hansa racist thing

666
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,256
I think that this one is I don't think we've ever documented any

667
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,816
I think this one is actually slightly unfair

668
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,352
Cuz I think people are taking him

669
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,400
Little bit out of context

670
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,984
Cuz he's not go back to Africa or anything like that

671
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
What do you think isn't

672
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
Okay

673
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,408
And what isn't being captured by people

674
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
Is what he's saying is

675
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,272
You should look at what's going on over there

676
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
And be like

677
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:52,416
It's still bad at H2 blockers

678
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
Too bad it's not worse

679
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,976
It's still bad

680
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:00,608
But it's not the same thing as like

681
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
I think that argument is

682
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,520
F****** insane because you can do that you can use that for literally anyting

683
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:12,384
You can get for any like you care about human trafficking

684
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Human traffic

685
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Looking elsewhere

686
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:17,504
Be happy with the status quo wherever you're at

687
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:23,392
Really offensive argument any human it is offensive and it only

688
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
Complacent

689
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:34,656
Play cats like whenever people are like you think there's no difference between the Democrats in the

690
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
Republican the Democrats say that we should

691
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,800
To be incrementally better in some respect

692
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
And then support the status quo

693
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
When every other

694
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,992
On every other thing you maybe maybe right

695
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
I don't know

696
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,112
It's interesting outright white nationalism of you don't like it

697
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
Could get out

698
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
Versus the

699
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:01,792
Elsewhere

700
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Point

701
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:09,216
I don't know how to unpack that really they're both bad

702
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,032
So either of those things

703
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,312
Dumbass

704
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
Speaker not great

705
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
We got a new guest in the house

706
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,944
Great transition

707
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
Excited

708
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,600
Alright

709
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:34,560
I like the one word

710
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Anything

711
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,240
You really have going on here is a guy who

712
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
Used to

713
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
And still does

714
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,848
Post a bunch of like a pro Trump

715
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:52,224
And I went to his website and I checked it out

716
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,784
Just weird Photoshop

717
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,880
Things of like Trump being awesome and giving the bird

718
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
Weird

719
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,464
Hillary Clinton with a bunch

720
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
The prison

721
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Boob

722
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
Really

723
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
Feel like

724
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,376
More ironic

725
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:15,776
The only funnier when you realize that it's straight up

726
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,080
It's all just Trump propaganda

727
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,640
It's a complete

728
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,224
Trump if you saw street art with Trump giving you the finger you be like

729
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Familiar

730
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,512
Did he

731
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,584
The thing that I think is really f******

732
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,888
Funny

733
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,424
Motto ethos

734
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,960
Is conservatism

735
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,240
Is the new Punk

736
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,544
And he's very clear

737
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,592
Conservatism is this Trump

738
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
No nothing a nativist

739
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:01,087
And I what is the 80s and it's

740
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Right so

741
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
I would say

742
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,207
The conservatory

743
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,255
Conservatism

744
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Punk

745
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,303
Would make sense

746
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
If

747
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,167
Back in the

748
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,447
The Sex Pistols

749
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:22,079
All of their songs were just about the Dupont family

750
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,943
We all remember

751
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,015
All of those great classics by The Ramones

752
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:35,647
About Howard Hughes know what was amazing about the Velvet

753
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
Love the world

754
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,303
Is is a mess

755
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,375
But you should. You should expect that Kieran this first clip

756
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
Are we find out

757
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
The Company You Keep

758
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,031
I'm with the proud boys

759
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:58,431
Officially they said

760
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,575
The left is going to do it

761
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
Yeah

762
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
Rihanna

763
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,439
Sure you don't want the proud boys in your bar

764
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,231
Authoritarian

765
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,535
Trapezoid

766
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,863
Corporate CEOs thing that he mentioned earlier

767
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:21,471
Like what he was talking about was the tax repatriation I assume

768
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,287
Fireleaf facilitated

769
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
Yeah

770
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
Gold

771
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
Imagine that

772
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,223
Some sort of global is plot

773
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
Isn't safe

774
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,295
It's ridiculous

775
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
Out-and-out

776
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
Trying to change

777
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
Reality

778
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
Into something

779
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
Thing that fits within your narrative

780
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,975
No I know this isn't unusual

781
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,999
For Alex Jones

782
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,047
I know this isn't unusual for what we're talking

783
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
About here

784
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,143
It's even more egregious

785
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
This is f******

786
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Stupid

787
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
I think

788
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,007
The problem should be banned from every

789
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
F******

790
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,823
Business if there's ever been

791
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
There should be

792
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,919
Look up Starbucks closes 8000 stores

793
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,967
For racial bias training

794
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,783
They should also close 8000

795
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,087
About the problem

796
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,903
I had to throw them out.

797
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,303
Just keep yelling cereal name that them will get really excited to be impressed you can name cereals

798
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
Well everybody

799
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:27,519
Bear from the chat room at the California Uber Alles about to Jerry Brown

800
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
What's this

801
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
Being

802
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,991
Good work I was going to try and pivot that into

803
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
Something about

804
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,807
Your transition skills failed

805
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,415
Work that into another punk band riding song about

806
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,951
Gia Koka

807
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,767
Just because his name came to me randomly alright

808
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,351
Nope not saying be that as it may

809
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,959
Didn't write a song about how great Trump

810
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,823
Throughout this entire thing Alex is like

811
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
Street art

812
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
Love Street

813
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,431
He's like we got to get it in

814
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,479
Infowars art

815
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
You

816
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,295
Ben Garrison let's do this

817
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,415
Make a

818
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,767
It's not going to happen to go down that much like the Patriots

819
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
Music

820
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,095
Record label

821
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
I'm so

822
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,959
Answer want this weird line

823
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Because

824
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,007
Vandalism is illegal

825
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
Doing these

826
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,079
Street art things

827
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,871
Installation

828
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
Technically illegal

829
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:53,023
Remind people about how much

830
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:59,423
Eyebright

831
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,287
Really weird

832
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
Encourage his audience

833
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,455
He knows that it's illegal it's very weird

834
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,039
So yesterday yesterday it's a sort of

835
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
Figure it out

836
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,343
And I do the best you can

837
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
In this next clip

838
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,671
Sabo talk about the difference

839
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
His school

840
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
Conservatives

841
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
Dumb dumb liberals

842
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,887
Republican

843
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,519
Everyone

844
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:40,895
To learn to do the same

845
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
Yeah

846
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,903
Looking to work

847
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,999
I think Alex thinks that is

848
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
Hail Marys Street Art

849
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,071
Because you talked

850
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:06,495
Chameleon susceptible to literally anything anyone says

851
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:11,103
Whatever you talk about

852
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,431
Might not

853
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,967
No that's ages

854
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,527
Old school information Warfare

855
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,063
Random pain

856
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,183
For a different reason

857
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,719
I think that

858
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:31,071
These Republican conservatives that he's talked about you just want to have a barbecue

859
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:34,143
And they want to ignore that the comfort that they're enjoying

860
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,447
Is built on the back of exploitation

861
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,471
That's usually races

862
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
Justin Texas to Nature

863
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
A nightmare

864
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,871
Which is what deliveries

865
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:49,247
But the Liberals they're particularly mad at

866
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,343
Are the people who have gotten to the point where they realize

867
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
Oh s***

868
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:57,695
What Comfort is based on basically a Whipping Boy

869
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,999
A metaphorical Whipping Boy in terms of

870
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,279
Underprivileged class

871
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:05,887
And for us to just sit back and enjoy your barbecue while we know that that's

872
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,447
The case is the moral equivalent of a

873
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:13,055
Actively supporting that system is very politically motivated

874
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,103
So I agree with you

875
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,431
I agree with policies that are essentially

876
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,711
Supremacist in

877
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
Action

878
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,271
Whether or not they are whites

879
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,319
Supremacist in

880
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,135
What expression

881
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,671
You are still a way

882
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
National

883
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,535
Like that is what you are doing it by your energy

884
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,191
Experiment are the ones who walk away from Amalia

885
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:46,591
I believe this apron outside would you rather fight a duck-sized horse or a lot of horses

886
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,943
Now that's a radical question it's a would you rather

887
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,271
Would you rather would you fight yourself or f*****

888
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
Yourself if there is a

889
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,063
I believe that

890
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,951
Text Pulaski

891
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,999
From the ethics class I took

892
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
Chicken College

893
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,631
Comfortable and utopian

894
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,983
And everybody when they get to a certain age

895
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,519
It's revealed to them

896
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,847
Utopian

897
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,383
Is that one kid

898
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
Is being beaten

899
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Like a dog

900
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,735
Dog jackets

901
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,015
No just a h

902
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,831
Miserable

903
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,879
But because of that everyone else

904
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
Be super happy

905
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,999
Okay and the idea is that needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few

906
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:41,119
Walk away from that idyllic community and that's knowing

907
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,679
That is built on the back of brutal abuse

908
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,471
Of an innocent person

909
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,495
And

910
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:55,967
And conservatism right now absolutely was elucidation of what it's like to be

911
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
Black in this country

912
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,015
That might be what's up

913
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,831
Behind it

914
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,855
Experiment

915
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,415
Student ends up running

916
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,463
Right but I remember it so Vanessa

917
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,887
That's basically the would you save five people by

918
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,191
Purposefully killing one

919
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,983
Or would you through in Acts

920
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
Oceanwide up killing

921
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,359
It's not as it's not as dry as

922
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
Sabo

923
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
Accidentally

924
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
Sabo

925
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
In this next

926
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
He talks

927
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,023
About a billboard

928
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,607
Wichita

929
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,679
Like I told you

930
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:53,823
Well so long as he doesn't deface Saba the Great Chicago Rapper put out wonderful

931
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,151
We need him to go against Obama

932
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
GoNoodle

933
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,783
What you've got here is

934
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,319
He's talking about this billboard

935
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,671
And what he did is there was a woman on

936
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:11,487
Figure skater

937
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
A picture

938
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,095
That picture of Al Franken

939
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
Who looks

940
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,655
He's groping that list

941
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,983
Remember that whole lot

942
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
8

943
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,775
Is Al Franken

944
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
Ramen

945
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,335
Blown up

946
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,615
And put on that billboard

947
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
Now

948
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
Here's where he f**** up

949
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,015
He says that someone contacted

950
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,087
I told him to make that billboard

951
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
Zeebo is admitting

952
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,207
Noticed but the story was too

953
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
Coming out

954
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,511
Which is incredibly

955
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
Listen to this

956
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:52,191
I have people to call me up and say hey I have some of the state department is going to go

957
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,471
Speaker

958
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:59,103
Thunder

959
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,663
Tim McGraw

960
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,631
I just know that

961
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,959
National

962
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,983
And

963
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,639
I told my crew

964
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,175
If you don't want

965
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,455
Tell me now

966
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:41,855
And they said nope let's do this over and over and over again until it became

967
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
Dance

968
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:46,975
And we got that thing up there like 15 minutes

969
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,559
He had very short notice like the love.

970
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,863
He had very short notice from

971
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
Somebody

972
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:02,847
Self-aggrandizing

973
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,383
Ready to get Steelers and didn't hire any

974
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
Bluffing

975
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,247
Things seem more important

976
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,527
Then it was

977
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
Quote

978
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,415
From the CBS News article

979
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
Hours before the allegations

980
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:23,583
Against Senator Al Franken became public Thursday Trump Ally Rodger Stone,

981
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:29,727
A Twitter account linked to the farmer trumpet

982
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,287
Stone in the early hours Thursday morning

983
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,615
The expected allegations involving the Minnesota democratic

984
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,431
Rodger Stone says it's Al Franken

985
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,455
Time in the barrel

986
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,759
Franken next in a long list of Democrats

987
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,551
To be accused of grabby Behavior

988
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,879
Later in the morning that story

989
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,903
Came out

990
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,975
Went on to

991
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
Except Frank

992
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,071
Apology and

993
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
Suspicious

994
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,423
I have

995
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
Very little doubt

996
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,495
That the person who

997
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:06,591
I told him hey overnight we need to get this billboard up

998
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
Was one

999
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,895
Rodger Stone

1000
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,991
And because Sabo is so he's an asset casual

1001
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:19,391
He's like a fifty-year-old dude her so like

1002
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,999
Say what you want about Izzard I don't really I can't

1003
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:29,119
Pretty art I'm not that I don't have that skill set can do is draw parallels

1004
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,679
Not media-savvy

1005
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,775
Accidentally saying on Alex Jones Show that someone contacted him

1006
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,055
And paid him

1007
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,871
To make this billboard on short notice

1008
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,919
Clearly physically overnight

1009
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,991
Rodger Stone hours before

1010
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
Came out

1011
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
It seems like there's

1012
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
Probably

1013
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:51,647
Maybe Rodger Stone everywhere they might be able

1014
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
It's probably

1015
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,719
Rodger Stone

1016
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
So many

1017
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
Bulshit

1018
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,047
Probably going to

1019
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,327
No I don't think so

1020
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,607
You know what though

1021
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,447
Might actually control everything

1022
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:07,519
It made me think of Steve

1023
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Pieczenik

1024
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
Collaborating

1025
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,431
Okay I think it's Rodger

1026
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:20,831
Throwing around State Department references or whatever

1027
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
Massive

1028
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Slip

1029
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
Hamer Park

1030
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,487
Like the idea that street artist

1031
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,511
Play bow

1032
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,071
New about the Al Franken stuff before

1033
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,143
Rodger Stone Infowars

1034
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,495
Narrative

1035
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,519
Specialist

1036
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,055
I don't know

1037
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:47,455
Trickster God executive producer and dirty trickster knew about it in the same time frame

1038
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,479
Loki Stone

1039
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:54,879
Rodger propagandists street artist to make propaganda

1040
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,415
Is it going to come out it just seems

1041
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,439
Likely

1042
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,999
Crazy

1043
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,327
Turn Rodger Stones Powers 4

1044
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,351
For good

1045
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:11,775
I feel like there's some sort of 40th Street

1046
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:15,359
That we could pull Rodger Stone into right now

1047
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:19,455
Tragically heroic way the redeeming of the anti-hero

1048
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,479
Come on man

1049
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,015
Now you're going Star Wars song

1050
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
No

1051
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,087
We have one more Clippers say about real quick

1052
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,367
Before we got to take a break

1053
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,951
Did everyone get industry

1054
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:35,071
Everybody we are fighting for our lives

1055
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,607
Onto the street

1056
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,375
And then

1057
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,447
From the Spanish

1058
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:50,175
And you know what all you have to do is get your butt up on one billboard and you'll realize

1059
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,967
What to do and what not to do

1060
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:58,623
The first one's always scary the second one's kind of scary but you're right Jack Dorsey the CEO Twitter

1061
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:10,399
Twitter

1062
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:16,799
Real your listeners just get up on billboards the first one's going to be better

1063
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,823
Who knows

1064
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
Admission

1065
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455

1066
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Third dimension

1067
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,503
Back in

1068
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,319
Right

1069
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
Right

1070
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,903
So we had to Quick break use the restroom

1071
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,951

Alright

1078
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:50,335
We generally don't talk about her all that much on this show we need to discuss this

1079
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:54,943
Cuz it's a next-level stupid

1080
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,967
Just about 2 minutes

1081
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,991
We will be right back

What happened

1090
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:23,103
Would love to work on the road

1091
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,663
Why was there great cameraman editor

1092
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,687

Questions about the Clinton

History of sexual assault

1096
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,231
Oh my

1097
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,511
What a scoop

1098
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
What is Coupe

1099
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,327
So what do you think about that

1100
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,495
I think

1101
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,799
Protective

1102
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:57,919
Powers that that is an issue that

1103
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
Like the fact

1104
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,759
It is a

1105
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,295
Mensing it's a

1106
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,343
A party

1107
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
Not a

1108
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,647
An

1109
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
It's something that

1110
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,207
Men should be

1111
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,231
Parking

1112
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
Regulator

1113
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,559
So yeah

1114
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,327
Deportment

1115
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,567
It's not going to go well this is not go well.

1116
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,639
What ends up happening

1117
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:32,223
I don't remember exactly how these clips go

1118
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,503
But

1119
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,783
I think I think it was

1120
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,599
First clip of Mount Millie's actual report

1121
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,903
We get to hear the question

1122
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
I'm not entirely sure

1123
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
This might

1124
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:44,767
I don't know

1125
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
I need the label

1126
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:52,703
Basically Tarana Burke got really upset when I asked about

1127
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,983
The

1128
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,799
Possibility of the hashtag me-too movement

1129
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:03,455
Becoming too partisan and being used as a political weapon and if it was going to take away from

1130
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,503
The mission which is to help

1131
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:12,927
Which immediately then she turned nasty was like oh I wonder who you voted for

1132
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,695
And just

1133
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:17,023
Suck her mob audience on me with this

1134
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:22,399
Mob like mentality that all started cheering her on and supporting her in

1135
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,727
Trying to bully and intimidate me into silence

1136
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,007
So

1137
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,543
I would I would

1138
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,823
A couple of important

1139
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,151
And

1140
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,687
What is accusing

1141
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,271
What is accusing

1142
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,807
#me too

1143
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,343
Meeting of being

1144
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,623
Is too partisan

1145
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
Or that it's being

1146
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,695
You're turning it into a partisan

1147
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
Something

1148
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,511
That is what Millie is in

1149
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,071
Intending to do by going there and ask

1150
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:57,215
Accusing them

1151
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:57,983
It's it's

1152
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,031
Banana impossible for her.

1153
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,591
Philosophically it is mind-blowing

1154
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,663
Cuz it's not inability to realize

1155
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,223
I disagree I think they are

1156
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,503
Legitimately

1157
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:13,087
To dump to examine their own actions

1158
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,623
This is a set-up

1159
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:18,719
Like this isn't like we talk about good and bad face all the time

1160
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,511
The definition of bad faith

1161
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:24,351
Well no not even that cuz I think those words are too

1162
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,631
Loaded

1163
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,655
I've been good

1164
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
Bad faith

1165
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,519
Is much more relevant and important

1166
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,055
With a video camera

1167
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,615
Like if she doesn't live in f****** Akron

1168
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,431
She flew the screen to go to this f****** complete

1169
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,991
And she did so specifically

1170
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,527
In order to

1171
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,831
Hopefully antagonizer respond

1172
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:51,231
That you can get on video that will feed into the narrative that she wants to push

1173
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,767
All he wanted

1174
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,047
To do is find out the

1175
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:58,143
Truth wasn't about

1176
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,983
Can you imagine a scenario where she goes to Akron

1177
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,263
She's like

1178
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,335
Here's my question

1179
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
It's like

1180
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:11,199
That's a very good point conversation that needs

1181
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:15,551
We are having it and I think that you might just be missing some pieces of it

1182
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
And it's actually just like

1183
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,367
Not great video

1184
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,183
She goes on Alex's show the next day

1185
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:24,255
Hey it's really amazing actually I went there and they were real

1186
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,815
They were willing to have a dialogue

1187
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:35,775
There's no way that that works that doesn't fly for Alex that doesn't fly for what

1188
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,543
She gets paid

1189
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
To do

1190
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,383
In order to ask

1191
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,943
The question that was meant to antagonize

1192
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,735
And meant to accuse

1193
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,039
It was not meant to be like hey

1194
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,879
I care about Juanita broaddrick I care about Kathleen Willey

1195
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:54,719
I care about these people that Bill Clinton has allegedly sexually assaulted

1196
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,023
I care about that it was

1197
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,559
What the f*** is wrong with you

1198
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,863
Care about Democrat

1199
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,143
Assault

1200
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,727
I think that's intellectually dishonest

1201
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,007
Because I think

1202
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,287
Isaac

1203
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:13,151
What is it is just like

1204
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,943
Alex whenever he pulls that b*******

1205
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,271
Immediately after some sort of tragedy happen

1206
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,319
He has no concept of like

1207
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:24,415
I feel empathy for the victim

1208
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
None

1209
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,487
Batman it is purely

1210
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,583
Worse

1211
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,607
Yeah

1212
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,655
Is 2

1213
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,191
Give I could not give

1214
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,471
Let's of a s*** about

1215
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
Who he hurts

1216
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,543
All I wanted is

1217
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,567
Hip

1218
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,847
It has nothing

1219
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
To do with

1220
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,407
And it's not even retribution

1221
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,455
I want to I want to hurt him

1222
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,271
In response to the damage that he's caused

1223
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,087
It's just I am irrationally

1224
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,415
Driven by Larry Nichols bulshit

1225
01:03:56,671 --> 01:04:01,023
A rookie Rabbitt of her actual presentation of the question in a little bit

1226
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,303
And we'll we'll see what

1227
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,887
I assume that it is very fair-minded

1228
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:09,727
She's got a

1229
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,055
If I know anything about Millie Weaver

1230
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
It's that

1231
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,359
She is about

1232
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:26,111
Hugely and a great way to have a podcast on maximum fun she's so into the nuisance

1233
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,647
Yep

1234
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,719
She is all about.

1235
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,583
Not at all

1236
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,375
Complete bulshit version

1237
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,399
Do things in order

1238
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,703
So in the next

1239
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,263
She talks more about what she

1240
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,287
She had to endure

1241
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,359
Mad at this place

1242
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,919
In the name of Journalism

1243
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,319
A mob of protesters came out I wasn't even sure what it was about because

1244
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,599
Their Banner said

1245
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,391
Take me

1246
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
Real quick

1247
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,975
I wasn't sure

1248
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,279
Do able to go to the

1249
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,047
Facebook

1250
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:12,447
Group what she's describing here is going to come back and play out later but she's describing is

1251
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,031
She's setting up a narrative cuz she's edited her video

1252
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,591
She wants to make it seem like

1253
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:21,407
She asked this question got kicked out

1254
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:25,247
And she walked out and all of a sudden there was a protest going on

1255
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,551
It wasn't before

1256
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,367
It's a mystery protein ever where did it come from

1257
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:34,719
So as I'm approaching it I start getting flipped off

1258
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:39,327
And having women yelling at me and that's when I realized wait a second this

1259
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,887
Is the hashtag me-too movement

1260
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:47,007
And they were probably observing in a separate room cuz they were streaming the video to other room

1261
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,567
And that's what I realized oh my gosh

1262
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,639
They're very mad at me

1263
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,175
Essentially

1264
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,991
Tarana Burke gave them permission

1265
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:02,367
Because they had all established rapport with her she did a really good job throughout the

1266
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,671
Meeting the the speech

1267
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:11,071
To make everyone establish rapport with her and seeming like she's just trying to help everyone and she's just the same plant

1268
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,631
4ukey

1269
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:21,055
Night

1270
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:27,455
Self-help

1271
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:40,255
So that's vectors like they built The Narrative of what

1272
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,815
We should really be

1273
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,839
Like

1274
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,935
Not make bones about what this is about

1275
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,239
This is what this is about

1276
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:11,743
Denise Campbell that's why we need your financial support we got products

1277
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:18,399
So uses uses all of this b******* that Millie is spinning out of this story

1278
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,495
We couldn't afford to pay a bunch of you having

1279
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:26,079
Bought a Nelly's weirdo husband could come along

1280
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
Sign up

1281
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
Auto

1282
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:32,735
But because you did

1283
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:33,759
We're going to

1284
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,807
In a way that

1285
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,855
Exactly what we are

1286
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,391
Maybe

1287
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:42,463
So I believe is the point of the actual question

1288
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,239
With sexual allegations against

1289
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,567
Decades ago

1290
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:06,015
Someone whose power

1291
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,671
They weren't

1292
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,951
So very quick

1293
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,231
Important

1294
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,535
Her response was

1295
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,839
Who said they were excluded

1296
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
Which is

1297
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,375
A fair question

1298
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,911
Here's Millie's response

1299
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,007
Included

1300
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,567
I would say ask Time Magazine about that

1301
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,359
That's an editorial issue

1302
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,383
Not even like

1303
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,687
Wasn't

1304
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
Control of what

1305
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:42,367
The time mag this directed question you're angry about nothing

1306
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,647
You're Clear Lake it's

1307
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,695
We're what you're doing

1308
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
This isn't about

1309
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
What's your question

1310
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,279
Article

1311
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:57,215
Worried at all the hashtag me-too movement

1312
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:03,871
Partisan

1313
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,711
Who did you vote for

1314
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,071
This is where that like accusing

1315
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,631
Your enemy of doing what you're doing

1316
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:29,471
Is is happening in real time

1317
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,263
It's because it's so murky

1318
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,079
It's really easy to Bates

1319
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:34,847
Someone interest

1320
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
Situation like

1321
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:40,479
It's very easy for this collection of people who are just having a

1322
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:43,039
Meeting about sexual assault

1323
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,319
To be painted

1324
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,087
As

1325
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,135
Liberal or prolapse

1326
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,231
Someone who is there

1327
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,047
Physically antagonizing

1328
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,863
In order to push them in that direction

1329
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:01,215
Are you worried that the partisan dance

1330
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:07,359
What if the me-too movement doesn't vote for the guy who is relaxing protection

1331
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:10,431
Do that women need even more

1332
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:15,039
Why would you think that they aren't as valuable in the Moon

1333
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,087
Is there any reason why the

1334
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,183
The guy who

1335
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,207
Making the

1336
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255
Poop

1337
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,119
Clearly

1338
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:29,887
Partisanship

1339
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,167
It's not party

1340
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,447
The very stated

1341
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,727
F*****'-a

1342
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,519
Group

1343
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
To fight against

1344
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,055
Assholes

1345
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:42,431
Sexual assault but she works for Infowars and she's coming in to ask

1346
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:44,223
Speak clearly partisan question

1347
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,991
In order to

1348
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,271
Partisan

1349
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,807
Gunship on the group

1350
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,647
I mean if I were to wargame this

1351
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,439
I know the reason is

1352
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:56,255
Because some of the most valid criticism

1353
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,791
And very soon

1354
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
Related

1355
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,887
The sexual assault

1356
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:08,287
That some of the most common all the sexually assault

1357
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,847
Might have something to do with that

1358
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,639
The fact that our president is a

1359
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,175
F****** rapist

1360
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,247
Is deflection

1361
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,295
Service

1362
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,575
They don't care about

1363
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
This for any other reason

1364
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,391
This is

1365
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,439
In order to work

1366
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,975
Towards that

1367
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,303
Control

1368
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,863
It's rampant liberalism run amok

1369
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,399
Gorski even University

1370
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:40,543
Interacting with Millie

1371
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:45,151
If you want to talk about even earlier stuff we got to talk about Anita Hill

1372
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,711
And the crowd claps

1373
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,527
Alex Fierro is like

1374
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,063
Like what

1375
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,599
Because I asked her out

1376
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:00,511
I didn't think if you want to talk about this. What about

1377
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:01,791
You know

1378
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,071
He was a patriot

1379
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:09,983
Dial what about the governor of Missouri

1380
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:15,615
Do is throw a Republican

1381
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,295
That is what your B was

1382
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:27,647
Pointing out examples where it was Democrats

1383
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,695
When you came in

1384
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,999
The accusation that you made

1385
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,791
Was about people from us

1386
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,815
Specific party

1387
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:38,655
Why is it

1388
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,495
F****** together

1389
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,799
Nothing to do with part

1390
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,591
And anytime you give a

1391
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,431
He's going to f****** up music

1392
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:53,503
What is what's going on

1393
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:57,087
You know I don't even care if you give a dude power

1394
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,623
Super cute

1395
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
Direct

1396
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,207
Towards women

1397
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,511
I'm sure Lewis

1398
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,559
CK was very liberal

1399
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:13,215
To be pretty liberal politics Donald Rumsfeld

1400
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:16,799
The lizard on the Opie and Anthony show

1401
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,383
Non partisan issue

1402
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,919
You know what I mean

1403
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,783
It's just disgraceful

1404
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:38,815
Winner

1405
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,583
Propaganda

1406
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,911
Updo treated

1407
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:43,679
The chat room

1408
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:47,519
Mark Dice was skulking in the bushes with a petition

1409
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:57,503
Fresno that's super funny

1410
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:02,111
Real bad

1411
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,415
Streetman pieces

1412
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:08,255
Dice dice we're going to have to let you go

1413
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,047
Anybody turned

1414
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:14,399
Really bad at this job everybody who has not listened to

1415
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Tons of episodes

1416
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,447
I must

1417
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,215
Tri-State

1418
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,007
Go on YouTube

1419
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,287
And just type in

1420
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,823
Mark Dice bloopers

1421
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,871
It is not to be believed

1422
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,759
It's the least funny s*** in the world

1423
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,527
So

1424
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,295
At this point

1425
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,599
Millie Briggs

1426
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,135
She's doing her

1427
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,671
We've heard her ask her question

1428
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,695
And she gets

1429
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:41,791
Thrown out if someone clear because the camera work is really bad

1430
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,815
She's just not have a phone

1431
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:43,839
Doing it

1432
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,191
It's either someone grabbed the phone to look like

1433
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:52,031
She's being pushed really hard

1434
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,639
I don't know because I seen so many of those like

1435
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:01,247
Second external views of Mike cernovich acting like Ryan

1436
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:07,647
And it's just three people standing behind him

1437
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:12,255
Who's going to the Rock taking a stunner

1438
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,791
Flopping all over the place

1439
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,631
I think that's

1440
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,191
That is kind of a crystallization

1441
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,751
My Philosophy on

1442
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,543
How you should respond to

1443
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:26,335
Is

1444
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,103
Don't

1445
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,127
Don't bother

1446
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:34,015
Like there shouldn't have been a a response to that there should have been like well what about Roy Moore

1447
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:38,111
There's to be a what about there needs to be a bye

1448
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:42,719
In front of the live crowd

1449
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:44,511
You know you know that is

1450
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,071
Comedian in front of

1451
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,375
Have a crowd

1452
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,959
Your mind will go to just like this is a good point

1453
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,775
Wendy's

1454
01:15:56,031 --> 01:16:00,639
You're talkin to the My Philosophy with Heckler like I don't want

1455
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,663
Jordans

1456
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:04,991
Comedian destroys heckler

1457
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:11,391
Jordan is like a wonderful agreement with a Heckler about how life should be

1458
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:15,743
That's my situation

1459
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,399
Jordan helps heckler actualize

1460
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:25,471
I would not get as many click

1461
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:33,151
I've got a bit of stuff but there's

1462
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:33,919
Because someone grabbed

1463
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:36,223
The phone

1464
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,759
Convenient way for her

1465
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,527
2

1466
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,343
Edit

1467
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,007
About how

1468
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:13,087
Oppressed

1469
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,279
So here's what

1470
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,047
Seems like

1471
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:22,815
You can't really dis

1472
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:23,583
Disagree with that

1473
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,607
Here's what happened

1474
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,143
After this

1475
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:26,911
Speech

1476
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
There was a mark

1477
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:35,615
She has added its selectively to make it seem like she gets thrown out this

1478
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:42,015
I guarantee there's like an hour of her sitting around waiting for it

1479
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:47,135
He could create this for the parade

1480
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:47,903
Exactly

1481
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,975
And so when March comes but that

1482
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,743
I bet that March

1483
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:55,839
People start flipping or off which is

1484
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,375
As the cost

1485
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,215
You play the game

1486
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:03,775
And that

1487
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:08,383
Cuz they engaged

1488
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:12,223
You came over

1489
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,063
Telling her like

1490
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
Why can't

1491
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
We just have

1492
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,415
Useful things

1493
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,439
Rite Aid

1494
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,975
NuWave

1495
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,791
Play the with the video is

1496
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,839
The girl who

1497
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:28,863
Telling her why can

1498
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,679
Nothing is about the March

1499
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
Which would

1500
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,495
Crazy

1501
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
Because

1502
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,567
The way she presented

1503
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,871
This March just happened out of nowhere

1504
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,919
And all of a sudden they come up to her

1505
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,479
Hayward defensive about our March

1506
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,295
Stopping Billy hasn't said anything

1507
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,343
Clearly it's referring to

1508
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,391
Earlier maybe an hour earlier

1509
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:55,231
All those people who are Marching were inside at the speech

1510
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:58,303
And they saw her antagonistically ask

1511
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:03,935
The question that wasn't questioned while people were like

1512
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,751
Why are you asking

1513
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:15,199
2.2 display is delightful

1514

Opaganda esta

1515
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,527
It's so hot

1516
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,623
People get tricked by mistake

1517
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,207
I8

1518
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:26,975
Cancun

1519
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:29,023
Conclusion which is the

1520
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,071
Does the whole point that I make is that

1521
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,119
Millie Weaver

1522
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,423
If you can't recognize

1523
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,447
That these

1524
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,471
People are

1525
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,263
Trying to not make

1526
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,055
Just their lives better

1527
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,359
Your life better is what

1528
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,383
Why did

1529
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,687
57% of white women vote for

1530
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,223
Like that kind of bull

1531
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,015
Like if you're doing this

1532
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:54,623
If you can't recognize if you were living in a right-to-work state and you're against

1533
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,391
Union

1534
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,415
They're at

1535
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,207
Ghibli making your life

1536
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:02,559
Better by Thursday Samantha

F*** off

1539
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,775
Really exciting

1540
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:15,360
That last episode this week got into something we cover

1541
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:19,200
Oh yeah I think it's one of the first times we've beat them

1542
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:25,600
Thule half a story Chinese Exclusion Act

1543
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:31,488
I'm game, is the reason that I thought about that was

1544
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,256
Because of the

1545
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,352
Who cares anyway

1546
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,376
Repeat

1547
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,008
How do I Petty about that

1548
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,032
There's a lot of reasons

1549
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,824
Your patio

1550
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,200
Alex

1551
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,504
That that protest

1552
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,552
That Millie Weaver walked into

1553
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,856
Just because Millie was

1554
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,208
Ladies and gentlemen is always the same

1555
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:07,584
Videotape

1556
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:18,592
Why can't we just

1557
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,624
I like I like the idea that

1558
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,904
People have

1559
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
Protest

1560
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,720
Just in case there's a counter

1561
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,512
He was

1562
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
Caulking

1563
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,584
Was troubling because he's like

1564
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,888
They got activated from a garage

1565
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,680
Garage sale

1566
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:46,240
Garage

1567
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:49,056
And because Millie Weaver was there

1568
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,712
Merely got a flight to Ohio

1569
01:21:55,968 --> 01:22:02,112
We have been preparing for Billy Weaver to come to Ohio

1570
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:08,512
But we're ready for never saw it coming

1571
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
But

01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
Because there's

1573
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,840
So scared

1574
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:16,448
Every single time there is

1575
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,984
Anywhere around the country

1576
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,776
They're just waiting in that garage

1577
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:20,800

01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,104

Next time to go right out of the fucken garage

This is like this is desperate

1585
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:48,704
This is so sad because it's very cool

1586
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,496
If you watch it the whole video you can

1587
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,800
It's there it's very

1588
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,616

Like I'm just messing up the stuff cuz I did watch it and like

1591
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:02,784
I know this

1592
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,416
I don't want us to get into the same

1593
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
Position

1594
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,512

I don't want to discourage people from actually checking right you can

1598
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:24,288
I respect that it's a weird

1599
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,336
I will tell you it's boring

1600
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:29,664
In the same way that like reading a lot of these books that he references

1601
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688

1602
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:33,248
I don't know

1603
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,624
It's a tough position for me to be hard part

1604
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,440
We are coming from a place of

1605
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,464

Cross-check I like we're going to be wrong eventually casting rod

1609

I don't know how this twitch chat works

1613
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,976

1614
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:19,584
It seems like a

1615
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,144
It seems very nice and I appreciate it.

1616
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,008

I don't have Snapchat

1620
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,136
I really don't know what's going on there

1621
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,416
As much as I love news

1622
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,440
I should know about it

1623
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,976
Anyway

1624
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,536
That's a great

1625
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,888
As much as I love nude

01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,872
Information with the Middle East

1628
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:07,968
We have a situation where it's very clear that you have

1629
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,760
Part of me

1630
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,808
Actor like she's a crisis

1631
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:18,464
Yeah she's Hamming it up I'm saying she is

1632
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,024
Who is doing the

1633
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,072
The acting in the

1634
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,864
Chico's

1635
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,656
And she has bad face

1636
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,448
Cheesy antagon

1637
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,008
Yeah she goes specifically in order to

1638
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,056
To create some sort of

1639
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,336
Response

1640
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,616
In this meeting

1641
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,456
Without her being there

1642
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,016
Knows what you need to do

1643
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:45,344
You need to get some footage Alex needs for the show

1644
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:48,160
The Sandy Hooks is going on you need help

1645
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,280
And so she does

1646
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,560
Accusing

1647
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,352
Me too

1648
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,144
Being too political

1649
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:58,912
Bye

1650
01:25:59,424 --> 01:25:59,936
Bring in Polish

1651
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:04,544
And then staging this idea

1652
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:09,408
Materializes out of nowhere because she's there

1653
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,176
Tumi

1654
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,248
That invention invalidation like in the movie

1655
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,296
Inception whatever that whenever you start

1656
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:18,368
Threaten the The-Dream all of the

1657
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,648
Dream people

1658
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,672
Start to attack

1659
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:24,000
Twirkle invalidation of

1660
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,536
The right to conquer

1661
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,072
And the right to protest

1662
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,120
Like the right

1663
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:31,168
Protest if you disagree with conservatives

1664
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,960
Position

1665
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:35,008
That's f******

1666
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,848
I'm looking over at the chatroom in sharks

1667
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,384
You know our view on the gays

1668
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,920
Big fan

1669
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,064
Great

1670
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,624
I'm so

1671
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,120
If if we don't talk anymore

1672
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,936
Liberal positions

1673
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,960
Somehow

1674
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:09,056
Marriage

1675
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:20,576
How do you feel about homosexuals exist

1676
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:27,488
What are the most liberal sounding Arabians there are

1677
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,072
Elizabeth correct I think trans people should have

1678
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:33,888
Absolute protection in moat

1679
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:36,704
Bill Gates

1680
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:43,872
For real you should be allowed to identify as whatever it is you want

1681
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:47,456
Also skin colors about your character

1682
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,600
Phrenology

1683
01:27:53,856 --> 01:28:00,000
Not do you know what we might have accidentally stumbled into a really good sketch kit that would never work

1684
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:07,680
Like good characters Right Stuff

1685
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:14,080
Battles of already been fought

1686
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:17,920
No no I think racism is a real thing I think I think

1687
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,224
I think that's just reality

1688
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,760
But at the same time

1689
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:24,320
I take care of trans rights

1690
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:30,976
Conservatives going

1691
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:35,072
The hatred of Jews that they wind up advocating for Progressive policy

1692
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:40,192
I fear that we've gone too far based on this

1693
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,984
Fair enough

1694
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,264
Let's move on.

1695
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,032
Comment

1696
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:48,384
Millie Weaver sheets done

1697
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,152
It's embarrassing

1698
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,968
Aziz

1699
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,016
This point Alex

1700
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:56,064
Get the call from

1701
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,600
Zach

1702
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,136
It's make intelligent source

1703
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:05,536
He very clearly has to take

1704
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,096
Hate Mars

1705
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,912
We heard from Zach

1706
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,960
Was on the Friday show

1707
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,496
Where Alex turned on Trump

1708
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:16,032
And Zack was

1709
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:19,872
Back it up on that and also say

1710
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,688
War for Mars

1711
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:25,504
They're trying to get us back onto the planet

1712
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,320
They're not trying to let us go to the

1713
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:34,208
Everyone's trying to fight for Mars and the Moon

1714
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:38,816
Stance and he's bringing back another week later in order to make

1715
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:44,192
Sure that Alex Jones held accountable is good and I appreciate that but you jumped the gun

1716
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:46,752
Cuz I wanted to say other shity things about today

1717
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:53,920
Also the last time we also the last time we saw him on that Friday he did not know who the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1718
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:59,808
Not a good idea he thought that McMaster had not been fired

1719
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:03,136
Possibly McMaster was a Joint Chiefs of Staff when he was the Nationals

1720
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,160
Security advisor

1721
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,440
All of those things

1722
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,976
Should be something

1723
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,536
High-level intelligence

1724
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,072
Gym source

1725
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:13,120
Kind of invalidate

1726
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,240
Literal job to know

1727
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,544
So here's the other reason I know that Zack is

1728
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,080
Vegas bomb

1729
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,360
Besides all of a sudden

1730
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,152
Alex

1731
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,456
MBA interview with Millie Weaver by saying

1732
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,760
Like

1733
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:30,784
He's in a rush

1734
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:35,904
In the middle of Zacks interview he goes

1735
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,672
Commercial

1736
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:42,048
He blows hard for about 2 minutes about things he's mad about

1737
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,328
Amen he does

1738
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,608
He does a reed

1739
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:51,008
Well Zack is waiting on hold intelligent source is coming in

1740
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:55,360
And he's got information that you got to get you on a short time frame

1741
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,640
3 things

1742
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:59,200
Kill time while he's waiting on

1743
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:03,296
It leads me to believe you don't take him all that seriously.

1744
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:06,368
Playing to find out where he's got to go

1745
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,672
Aldi

1746
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,768
So f***** up because it's like

1747
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,328
I don't I don't believe any of it

1748
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,096
The end

1749
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,888
Call was like I know you're on your lunch break

1750
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,496
Replace spray

1751
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:24,800
I don't go by federal law

1752
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,848
You do have to give people a 30-minute lunch

1753
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:29,152
But I feel like high-level intelligence

1754
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,200
Since people probably work out a little bit more of a

1755
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:37,600
Swinging schedules and people who like if you're not back at your desk in 30 minutes

1756
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:40,160
I would I would

1757
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:43,488
Maybe high-level intelligence

1758
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,816
Put in late nights of urine high-level intelligence

1759
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,376
So f******

1760
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,400
Stupid

1761
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,704
That like

1762
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,728
Okay so what

1763
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,408
I know I've tried

1764
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,968
An early-season

1765
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,760
Lock is pretending

1766
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,552
Is about to do it

1767
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,600
And now I'm going to

1768
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:14,208
Lock role-plays of the general

1769
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,488
The whole situation

1770
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:20,096
Like a dungeon dragon

1771
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,936
Anyway

1772
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:28,544
And yet you still want to get it out here's a great idea

1773
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,360
One of the new possible Rewards

1774
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,432
Is we'll just do a podcast about lost for a week

1775
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,456
I don't know for a week

1776
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:37,248
We do the whole series

1777
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:41,856
No there's already plenty of podcast

1778
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,648
That doesn't make sense

1779
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:50,048
I know a lot about lost want to know anything about laws

1780
01:32:53,888 --> 01:33:00,032
That's a good point chime in at our Facebook group go home and tell your mother your brilliant if you want us to do that horrible idea.

1781
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,848
Anyway

1782
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:05,408
I feel like what we have here

1783
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,712
Is a situation where Zack works

1784
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:09,504
Add a job of some sort

1785
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,064
You didn't need to get back to

1786
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,928
The time that he could make a call to Alex

1787
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,000
Here we go

1788
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,072
The only thing that you want to do is sort of

1789
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,864
Reinforce Alex's narrative

1790
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,400
He's already

1791
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:28,960
From the

1792
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
Trump is f******

1793
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,496
Dover

1794
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
Into like

1795
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,032
Oh no

1796
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,592
New narrative

1797
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:37,920
It's mysterious how this high-level intelligence guy seems to

1798
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:41,248
Blow in the wind the exact same way that Alex

1799
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:43,808
Yeah

1800
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,832
Probably just

1801
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,624
Because Alex is so InTouch

1802
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,928
Anyway here's what he wants

1803
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:56,608
Anybody's looking into the death of the plant Nikki Haley's looking to run in 2020 with Mike Pence they're hoping

1804
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:13,504
Toronto 2020 live

1805
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,832
And all of them for months are acting like this

1806
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,856
He's the guy

1807
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:31,680
Always says Pence is perfect

1808
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:45,760
Seriously pro-gay conversion conversion therapy Mike Pence

1809
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,576
Alex

1810
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,344
To your question

1811
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:52,672
Of whether I've noticed the media saying that

1812
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,696
Can do no wrong

1813
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,720
Hard

1814
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:58,048
No

1815
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,328
Ulta

1816
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,632
Well one

1817
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,936
We've never had a vice president

1818
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,312
Campaign

1819
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:15,712
With a challenger 2 in the primary for that present would be weird

1820
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:18,528
Because what is that

1821
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:23,392
Yeah so but Nikki Haley

1822
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,160
President

1823
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:29,536
Become president

1824
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:32,352
I think he

1825
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:35,168
Kinda is implying that Haley is running for

1826
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:35,936
President

1827
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:40,288
With pants as her vice president is also saying they're going to get

1828
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,312
Trump impeached

1829
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,872
That would mean the president

1830
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,640
There's no

1831
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,992
New regardless of what you think about any of these people

1832
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,016
There's no

1833
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,296
F****** way

1834
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:53,344
Did you end up with an impeached

1835
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,648
President to the vice president becomes president

1836
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:58,976
Then two years later

1837
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:06,912
I like you better

1838
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:14,592
I bet you would like it better

1839
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:22,016
Look in the in the chaotic dark timeline that we live in

1840
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:27,136
That's the only

1841
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,184
Weird-ass world we live in

1842
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,464
Currently the

1843
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:34,560
And I'm campaigning for a lesser role

1844
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,096
As

1845
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:38,144
Nikki

1846
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,192
As her Vice

1847
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:42,240
She's going to serve two terms

1848
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,080
I'm going to campaign with Paul Ryan

1849
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,360
As he is

1850
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,384
How

1851
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,152
Okay

1852
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,176
Here's a good question

1853
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,712
How many terms

1854
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,272
Yeah I don't know

1855
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:56,576
I don't know

1856
01:36:57,088 --> 01:37:03,232
That's a really interesting that I've never considered that would come up

1857
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,024
Forever ever one's kind of

1858
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,560
Who cares that right

1859
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,120
I'm super interested

1860
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,912
I want I want that now

1861
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,192
Outlook

1862
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:17,824
Is President Grover Cleveland serving two non-consecutive terms

1863
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:18,848
That's fantastic

1864
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,920
But Mike Pence being vice president for life

1865
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:26,016
I don't even know how to deal

1866
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:35,744
Exactly

1867
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,072
He's done with his lunch break

1868
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,704
And so Alex

1869
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,984
Finally is left

1870
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,264
Without any more gas

1871
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,544
Millie Weaver is gone

1872
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:52,384
The great street artist anymore

1873
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,432
He's finally got to get to

1874
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,200
Sandy Hook

1875
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,736
He's going to talk about it

1876
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:06,720
You know I'm so truthful and Loveless respect me so much and I know

1877
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:11,840
You are great

1878
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,704
All the time

1879
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:18,752
Sandy Hook secret is this

1880
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,032
2017

1881
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,592
I'll go ahead and say it all on here

1882
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:30,272
Because I backed off saying I didn't say call Sandy Hook

1883
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,040
Wheel

1884
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:48,448
We have

1885
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,264
2015 I can pull up the entire list

1886
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,056
If you give me just a second

1887
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
Virus

1888
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,456
Call Olga

1889
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,576
She needs to have

1890
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,112
Glimmer of light

1891
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:14,048
My lawyers strongly advised me not to do this

1892
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,352
Bright orange

1893
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,400
Because they love the billable hours

1894
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:24,800
On January 13th 2015 to go to knowledge fight.com we do have a link up to this you can find the in

1895
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:26,336
Entire episode

1896
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,104
On video

1897
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:28,384
But again

1898
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,176
Replace the Clipper number of time

1899
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,160
What I'm curious about is

1900
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,952
Do you think that there's a new

1901
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:45,024
Level of sophistication with a lot of these false flag

1902
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,304
Where

1903
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,864
A couple of pieces of

1904
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:53,728
Flimsy evidence that get everybody talking and Stearman the wrong direction

1905
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:06,784
It's just that when you did that they were funded by Western Funding

1906
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,464
Provocateurs

1907
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:21,376
Becomes a red herring

1908
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:22,656
Because

1909
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,960
They have staged events before

1910
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:30,336
But

1911
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:34,688
Bowers and

1912
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,992
Then I tear the building down

1913
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:43,648
Email Bloomberg

1914
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:47,744
Reselling is people get ready in the next 24 hours to capitalize on a shooting

1915
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,536
Yeah show

1916
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:52,608
Use a synthetic

1917
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:54,144
Completely fake

1918
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:58,752
In my view manufacture I couldn't believe it at first

1919
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,944
That they clearly

1920
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,968
Used

1921
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,368
That is what you said

1922
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:16,416
Is it was your position

1923
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,184
Consistently

1924
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,464
For a very long time

1925
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:22,560
I'm sorry about the audio being much higher on that babe

1926
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:25,120
Just refuses to say it

1927
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:25,888
As Darrell

1928
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:29,472
So I went when it first

1929
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,496
Came out

1930
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,264
He got

1931
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,032
Sued

1932
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:34,080
I thought

1933
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,640
Because of the time

1934
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,432
Frame of it

1935
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,968
He did most of his

1936
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:40,992
Brutal work

1937
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,272
Long ago

1938
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:48,416
You're too which is it within the statute of limitation

1939
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,952
For definition

1940
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:53,024
Is not it is much more insinuation base

1941
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:56,352
And I've come to the position where I don't really understand

1942
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,912
So I don't know I don't know

1943
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:03,264
This could go either way but it is really sad the

1944
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,544
Situation

1945
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:05,824
Forever

1946
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,640
It's real sad.

1947
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:10,176
Are you spinning cuz it's all lies

1948
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,296
Brackets

1949
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,320
Congrats

1950
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,856
You said it over and over again

1951
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:19,648
In this next clip

1952
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,672
From

1953
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,208
The 18th

1954
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,488
In present day

1955
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:38,336
Are you saying a year after the shooting

1956
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:40,896
Shooting happened in December of 2012

1957
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,432
That would have been 20

1958
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,504
Yeah least a year and a couple months

1959
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,576
Before

1960
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,344
The clipse

1961
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,368
Did we just play

1962
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,928
School shootings happen

1963
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:19,552
From 2016

1964
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:22,624
Did

1965
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:58,464
My lawyers

1966
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:01,536
Strongly advise

1967
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,584
Sociopath

1968
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:17,152
So he's saying that for years ago he went to his staff

1969
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,432
And told them to

1970
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,456
Stop

1971
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,248
Looking into sand

1972
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:23,552
Sandy Hook

1973
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,112
Said that it was

1974
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,648
2 weeks ago

1975
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:33,536
Going to say it over and over again for like 4 years ago we're looking at April 28th

1976
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,816
Now Debbie April

1977
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:35,840
2014

1978
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,912
This was this to me was

1979
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:39,936
Complete

1980
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,032
Front

1981
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,568
Because

1982
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,848
We did a

1983
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,384
Long investigation

1984
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,408
2015

1985
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,688
And we saw a bunch of

1986
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:53,248
. like there was a school shooting at college

1987
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,272
In Oregon

1988
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:58,624
Ain't on the October 20th 2015 show Alex

1989
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:02,208
False flag like Newtown

1990
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:04,000
These nuts

1991
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:04,768
Specifically

1992
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:14,240
Do you know what

1993
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,288
Associate

1994
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,568
To not look into

1995
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:19,104
The new town and not look into

1996
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,408
4 years ago

1997
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,176
Which makes it

1998
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:24,480
Very difficult to understand how this has

1999
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,528
But now

2000
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:30,624
Your uncle John do Navy SEAL

2001
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:34,720
What's a successful security company

2002
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:49,824
About yesterday

2003
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,360
Therefore

2004
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:53,408
The city council hearings about

2005
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:57,248
He had sent a reporter to Newtown

2006
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,528
In July of

2007
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,808
2015

2008
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:02,624
In order to cover hearings about it in order to

2009
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,392
Juice up

2010
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,928
It being a false flag

2011
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:07,488
If you told his staff not to cover it

2012
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,328
In 2014 why is he sending someone in 2015

2013
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,864
That

2014
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:17,728
Uncle

2015
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:20,544
Would we covered back in the 2015 investigation

2016
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,312
And

2017
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,616
Rob didn't say anything

2018
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:25,408
That was suspicious you just said

2019
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,688
I've never seen anything like this

2020
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,456
This is

2021
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,224
That sort of thing

2022
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:33,344
But that doesn't stop Alex from trying to get robbed a manufacturer quote about it

2023
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:43,072
It doesn't add up

2024
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,688
Go back to the

2025
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,504
I'll think about the exact words but

2026
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,552
From what I'm getting from what I remember

2027
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:08,416
Good cuz I was in the car driving laws talking to edit

2028
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:13,792
Because I wanted to get something out of before we did that cuz we did the show that night on the 4th that day on the 4th

2029
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:17,120
Talk about a short interview with you

2030
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:23,008
And you're saying it's strange it doesn't add up he's like I've never been in a court proceeding like that ever wear

2031
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,288
People don't know anything

2032
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:27,616
That he's giving

2033
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:31,456
Very easily be rationalized as being

2034
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:34,272
I've never been in a court proceeding

2035
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,064
That was about

2036
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,088
20 murdered

2037
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:37,856
Elementary

2038
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,696
Visit I mean

2039
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:42,720
Embarrassing

2040
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:46,048
About what

2041
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,328
You have done

2042
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:49,376
In the past as a journalist

2043
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:51,680
And quote

2044
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,984
It indicates that your

2045
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:54,752
Covering some

2046
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:58,336
Something up you know what I know that would

2047
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,360
Be admissible

2048
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:06,272
Court based on the defamation laws

2049
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,600
Dr.lee shirts

2050
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,368
But

2051
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,136
Like

2052
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:14,720
When you lie to this level you're lying for a reason

2053
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:17,792
You're covering something up and it's that you know you did

2054
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:20,096
So anyway

2055
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,656
We should be prepared for this

2056
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:23,936
Emotionally

2057
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:24,960
Already

2058
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,240
But you know what this

2059
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:28,800
This is how we close

2060
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:31,616
Fashion Valley San Diego

2061
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:41,344
Forget this is in present-day this is from 28

2062
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,160
Call Lizzie

2063
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:48,768
Call Alex races that doesn't work in calling Russian that Things Fall Apart

2064
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:55,168
He is and they said that you saw him a few months ago about

2065
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,288
Didn't work for the truth

2066
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,896
To be fair you had Mike Adams on repeatedly guy who created a website

2067
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,432
Specifically to Bowie of Vick's

2068
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,200
Some of that shoot

2069
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:08,224
Because you disagree with it

2070
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:08,992
Is politics

2071
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,272
