1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,120
Alex

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:11,520
In color

3
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:17,920
Sit around and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
Like a

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,480
Oh man like a

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:26,880
Turn like a hard turn

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:32,256
Alex Jones going over

8
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,536
V

9
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,352
What I'm going to call

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,144
Not totally correct about this

11
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,216
But I'm going to call this the end of our 2015 investor

12
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
Combination of discoveries and

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,336
Complete and utter exhaustion

14
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:51,200
It's not exhausting I could I could do this forever

15
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,344
Quite frankly that's if you really look at it the

16
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,904
Well we've been doing this investigation

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
20th installment

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
What is installment of his investigation we've learned so much about Alex Jones that has nothing to do

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Who is Donald Trump

20
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,960
We've learned tons about his Civil War revisionism

21
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:19,360
He's learned a whole last episode of Ken Burns

22
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,664
In honor of the Vietnam documentary

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
Yeah

24
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:27,552
So nothing the thing is we we learned at under we never expected to learn we didn't expect

25
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,648
Defeat all of the pro-russia sentiments we didn't

26
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
To see him be debriefed

27
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,144
Food Services little things that we pick up along the way in

28
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,704
And so I am going to I believe

29
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
I think they're what comes next after

30
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
I think until the end of

31
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
2017

32
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,152
We need to keep investigating

33
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,456
To try and figure out when he loses his mind

34
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,784
He still hasn't quite lost his mind

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
And I think

36
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
That comes

37
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
Probably pretty

38
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,232
Him started to scream all the time all the

39
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
Renaissance

40
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,096
2.0 until the end of the year

41
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,168
The investigation will take a horse to Pivot

42
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
And I want to go over starting in January

43
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
The entire year of like

44
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
2013

45
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
Okay just jump back

46
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,944
Further in time or even farther back if I can figure it out

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
And then try and cover the month

48
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
Of January and January

49
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
Month of February

50
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Alex Jones

51
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,768
Your optimism on us reaching January

52
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
Is delightful

53
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
It's

54
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
Yeah I know

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,960
We'll see anyway that's that that's where my plan will see what happens

56
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520
I have another plan though and that is

57
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,360
To give a shout out to our new donator what's going on

58
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
I'm a policy wonk

59
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,040
Very thrilled to have it is delightful to hear

60
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
Absolutely

61
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,304
Burlington back on Henry V8

62
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
I don't I don't believe that's the same

63
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,728
I don't know what you doing I don't know what to do in man

64
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,336
Thank you I really appreciate it means a lot to have you back on board

65
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
Before we get in today

66
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
Installment

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
Primarily

68
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
3 days

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
In December of 2015

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,368
We have December 16th

71
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
And then December 29th

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Which is an absurd

73
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Set piece

74
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Okay but another one of those episode where Alex Jones is clearly doing drama December 30th

75
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
I think is RI closures

76
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
Before we do that

77
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Here's an out-of-context

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Drop of Alex Jones

79
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
Adolf Hitler Joseph Stalin

80
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Photos

81
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Hayward complete stop

82
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:19,839
Not talkin about a football offensive line

83
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
They were just f******

84
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
Stud that's

85
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
Not great in your Blind Side do you know why cuz he made people blind

86
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
That's what Stalin did Hitler

87
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,711
Hitler you got to have front-and-center he's got to distract you got to take all of those people

88
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,343
Mouth Mouse quarterback in that shed

89
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,463
2864

90
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,815
You see Hitler that guy's got cardio for days

91
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,167
Daikin just go

92
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
No that's crazy

93
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
Not great

94
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
The globalists I get other people to do their bidding

95
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
The badass

96
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
I don't like that

97
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
No

98
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:22,047
Making really where was it

99
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
Right I don't think you want to associate that with

100
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,263
Positive in that camp as well

101
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,383
Definitely motivated in more billionaires

102
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Alex is really dumb

103
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Is what I'm getting

104
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
I think it's

105
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
Always

106
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:52,255
Andy is a boner for strong-armed authoritarian dictators

107
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,583
Absolutely

108
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,959
Write whenever he talks about how much you love these dudes like or that they're studs

109
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,359
He'll just walk it back like

110
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,663
Right now it's the same

111
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
He wants authoritarian rule

112
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
But it has to be

113
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
On his term

114
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,903
That's what we get to know he has no idea that it will in turn

115
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
A hundred percent

116
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:28,863
You know what one history authoritarian regimes are not loyal to their propaganda

117
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,679
Get killed every f***

118
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,263
You go off the reservation a little bit

119
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
I don't understand how stupid these

120
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
It's pretty crazy

121
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:44,991
Fighting against the very thing that they're pushing themselves towards

122
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,551
Human beings at our psychology is

123
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
Spectacular

124
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
And it's going to get us all killed

125
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
So that's nice

126
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:57,791
It's very depressing

127
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,655
My favorite extinction-level event was the Busta Rhymes album

128
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,471
Ele extinction level event

129
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:12,127
Great as the great song with Mystikal is they getting rowdy with us if you want with us

130
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,087
Again Busta Rhymes head that song where they saw who could rap

131
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Faster

132
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
Nelly

133
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Get to the episode

134
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
Start today on December

135
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
16th 2015

136
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
On December 15th

137
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
There was the final

138
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
Republican debate

139
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,847
And here's Alex opening up the show giving little bit of assess

140
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,295
Congrats

141
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
Was on

142
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
Revealing

143
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,975
It was one of these

144
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
Are completely unstable

145
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
Launching giant Wars

146
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
Let's be clear

147
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
Really wrong

148
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,991
On so many all the levels

149
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,831
They did and this isn't even the conversation where he calls them studs

150
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
He brings them up

151
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Not good

152
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,999
Other countries

153
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
Superpowers aircraft

154
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,655
What is John Kasich

155
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
In the

156
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
And the debate says that we need

157
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
The punch Russia in the nose

158
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Right

159
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,591
But he was speaking metaphorically and was he

160
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
What is argument was

161
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
The Weave let them get away with too much

162
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
And they're being uncheck

163
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,551
You who has an argument now

164
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,367
Considered a hindsight is interesting

165
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
And lamp

166
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,647
Really powerful information came out yesterday

167
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Clemson

168
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,511
Doesn't play very many of us

169
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
It's interesting cuz he plays a number of them where they're like

170
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Trump

171
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
Just sort of

172
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
Going locking horn

173
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,055
I want to become such a sad thing to remember

174
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
Never had a chance

175
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
No but you know what's really fascinating what

176
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
Jeb was getting like

177
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
Applause break

178
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,039
Like crazy when he was attacking

179
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Trump

180
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
Like you told Trump is

181
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
You can't insult your way to the present

182
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
The place went crazy

183
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Everyone was like

184
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,655
They were a man

185
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
Yeah well I mean

186
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,055
Trump hadn't yet seated all of his public appearances with his own

187
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
There was part of it and then

188
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Think also there was a part that was like

189
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
I think they were

190
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
Cheering for blood

191
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,295
Other close to cheering for Jack absolutely

192
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
But the Optics

193
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
The clips it really looks like everyone is into

194
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
Kind of is weird

195
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:45,119
What is narrative

196
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
A f******

197
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
Horrific nightmare

198
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,311
Idiot yelling bulshit at each other

199
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,615
And then

200
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,735
Jeb Bush wants to raise taxes on poor people now that's not true you do

201
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,903
So In that clip even he said that

202
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
Which is what we would expect from him

203
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,255
Paul

204
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,327
No but I don't remember rampaul evershine

205
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,167
I will give you a spoiler alert the only reason that he says the Rand Paul shine

206
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Is because

207
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Kasich

208
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,823
Maru the other one was but someone else in the debate said negative things about Russia

209
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
And Rand Paul said

210
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
If you want to elect

211
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,711
Someone will bring us to World War 3

212
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,295
Right but he was just basically saying hey let's not attack Russia

213
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,671
That's the only positive thing he has to think about Rams

214
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:47,071
Appearance of mr. that's so suspiciously

215
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,143
Is there a what happened

216
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:56,543
I think it's going to blow your mind everything that we already know

217
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
December 29th

218
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:03,967
Might be one of the craziest things I've ever heard

219
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Alex Jones

220
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
Thanks the Donald Trump

221
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Spectacularly

222
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
Cuz you got a Big Sur

223
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Queen

224
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
Trump

225
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,023
11 Troost

226
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Jailbay

227
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
And I told you that

228
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
And I told you that

229
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,519
So bored

230
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Let me tell you something

231
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,687
Last night

232
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
Disguise

233
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
Now he's for real though

234
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
I went to the real f****** simple

235
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
Easy easiest person to f****** fool

236
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
Granted apparently it took a while

237
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
But I can't imagine

238
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
How easy this was 9-11 truther

239
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
I love it

240
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,799
VSCO

241
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
You get the sense that like

242
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
Someone around Trump was probably just like

243
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,735
Hey throw a couple bone Alex Jones will f****** love you

244
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
You just a couple crazy things

245
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,879
I kind of believe those crazy things

246
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
Exchange

247
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
Whenever Jeb Bush looks at him

248
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
Will

249
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
I don't think he ever finds

250
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
People hate mango

251
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,151
Because they own the fraudulent delegate

252
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
She will get the nomination

253
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
They are bragging

254
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
About this

255
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,159
Another night and that did not happen

256
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Is that kind of cute

257
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,047
Although we were so we were

258
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,399
Well it took was one bad video to destroy Jab

259
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:36,543
I mean he wasn't doing great before that but that was a death blood

260
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
That's what killed him

261
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,151
I mean he wasn't doing good before that it was like

262
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
So sad

263
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
So sad

264
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,271
It made me feel awful for a war criminal

265
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,647
Watching the coverage of it

266
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
And hearing

267
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
Jeb Bush say like

268
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
This guy isn't serious

269
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,071
Right like talking about

270
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
This is not a serious proposal he's talking about banning immigrants from our country that's just not that's not something

271
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
He has no policy experience experience from television what are we doing

272
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Man I hate you but

273
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:20,319
You're the hero here

274
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
Yo it's just like what the f*** it's a very conflicted headspace to be in to be like I don't like any of these guys

275
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,887
Batman amazing that more people remember that media is

276
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
It's f******

277
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Off the rail

278
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,799
Like the whole reason that they wanted him to stay in his because he was great for Ratings like

279
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
Les moonves from CBS said

280
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,151
But he's good for us

281
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
Billionaires are monsters people who don't care about how many people died in the f***

282
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,159
Don't f****** give a s***

283
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,255
About 3.6 million Americans in Puerto Rico

284
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,655
Which American

285
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,983
Because we spent 800 billion dollars on her f****** military

286
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,287
A little bit of an Elsa

287
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
Inspire no

288
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Instead

289
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
It's f****** let

290
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
People

291
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Yeah

292
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
Fear seventeen

293
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
I mean

294
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
Just because it's like

295
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Everyone else

296
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Look I'm not uncaring

297
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
Support all sorts of

298
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
Relief efforts and all that stuff but

299
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,655
Quite frankly I think there are tons of organizations that do a much better job of covering

300
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,007
So I don't want to

301
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
Who's Trump

302
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,871
Commuting with now it's he's a f****** f****** killing people

303
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,967
Direct murder

304
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
And I hope

305
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,039
Mike it's my dream do you want to know my dream

306
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
What

307
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
I imagine that

308
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
The FBI

309
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
Somebody working for it realizes

310
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
And they go crazy

311
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
And then they go assassin

312
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
That's my dream scenario

313
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,727
That's problematic for us

314
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
I mean

315
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:19,103
Deer now playing into Alex Jones's hands

316
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,247
Enjoying a little bit of a quick second to have an on-air show me

317
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,671
Believe that everybody who's against him wants to or fantasizes about Trump being killed

318
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
Optically

319
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Where Alex

320
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
Defined our show

321
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
I've been here that

322
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
That reaffirms his belief

323
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:45,727
You understand what does it matter

324
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,823
Lie about it anyway

325
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
I don't like the idea of you

326
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Are you fantasizing

327
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,831
Man so many people I fantasize about being assassinated I honestly think that's a little bit negative

328
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:07,999
I know you think it's a little bit negative for me to fantasize about somebody holding a beheaded Koch brothers

329
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,071
Aloft on top of a mountain screaming

330
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,351
I have control

331
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Sometimes

332
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
He's got to do what you got to do

333
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Alright

334
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,007
The Dollar Tree does not stuck-up

335
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
As a show we don't

336
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
We don't fully support

337
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Views that are being a Sprouts

338
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
I don't want it I don't want to say that I don't want

339
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
I want Trump gone

340
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,463
Not killed but gone I want him out of powers

341
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
You f****** up ever

342
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
But

343
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
I don't know what's wrong I want them all

344
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,471
And they're all they're all thieves

345
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,519
They've all stolen so much money from us

346
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,847
They've all they've all contributed to the deaths of

347
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,687
Thousands of people

348
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
That's bad

349
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
So

350
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,039
Let's get back to this debate coverage

351
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
I'm pretty positive

352
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
We also started

353
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
The Show by saying

354
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
Rampaul shine

355
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
I think I've isolated the

356
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,535
The exact makeup

357
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Actually

358
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,935
That could be what he's talking about

359
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
Took over and Alex

360
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
His mind

361
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,519
Alex flips

362
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Script

363
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Grandpa

364
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
I think it's right

365
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
A 1,000 people in Syria and Libya

366
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
Hillary

367
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
1520

368
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,415
Revolutionary sex that's why I'm

369
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,495
O'Reilly

370
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,639
Just like you said

371
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,295
And I'll just jump on this

372
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
Wolfpack

373
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Shark

374
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,671
Attack that is so sexy

375
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,703
And no

376
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,495
I know you're a gentleman

377
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
Russia

378
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
Your father I know full well

379
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
You got working for you do that

380
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
Your father

381
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,095
George Washington material interview

382
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,935
You know that and your dad brought you

383
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,151
Little boy

384
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,063
More fun to talk about Jeb Bush

385
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
But I mean I think there

386
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
The cracks are showing he's

387
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
He's cracking on on Rainbow

388
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,536
Absolutely stupid Trump

389
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,840
Safeties defending Trump as a

390
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
Supposed to Rand Paul

391
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
Supporting

392
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,264
I would rather defend Trump

393
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:37,920
Play Eli Kyu calling him crazy that's what people say about you that's a big

394
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
That's big

395
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,248
Yeah he even said Ted Cruz is smart witch

396
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,552
Something that you only say

397
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
Whenever your guys

398
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
Failing away that you didn't know it's off

399
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,464
The extent that

400
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
He flips on

401
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:58,144
Cruise once it comes down to just Cruisin Trump

402
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:06,080
That's fair I lost my eyes red that's the equivalent of a Mickey

403
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:11,712
Yeah first kernels of Alex Jones

404
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
Insanity

405
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Insanity

406
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
Start to emerge

407
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
I think you'll see where it is

408
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
This is a n a

409
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
He has kit Daniels one of his reporters

410
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
I have to talk about what he thought about

411
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Debate

412
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
Do we see one of these

413
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
Edwards make it probably first appearance

414
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,776
Debate

415
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,360
Is a microcosm

416
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
I mean

417
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,880
What song is focused on the fact that he's pulling the Overton window

418
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Towards Liberty

419
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,744
Researching history

420
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,328
Since the Revolutionary War

421
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,704
We see a populist like Trump showing up

422
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,104
7076

423
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,760
Sorry

424
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
62.0 and acts

425
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:24,416
That's fair

426
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,608
That is sort of a catchphrase that he has in terms of like

427
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:39,008
The answer to 1984 1776 Morgan yelled at Embassy

428
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
1876 will commence

429
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
If you try and take our guns

430
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
He does bring up 7

431
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,664
1376 a lot

432
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
But this is the first time I've heard him reference

433
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Trump

434
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
In relation to 7

435
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
1976

436
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
Of course and that's big

437
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
That's monumental

438
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,696
Right knowing what we know about the future

439
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
Yogi's like

440
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
He is the new George Washington

441
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,352
Is the beginning of that narrative starting

442
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
Oh I should also say

443
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
That

444
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,984
Trump was on

445
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,544
Alex Jones Show before this

446
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
Yes

447
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
He came on at the beginning of

448
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
December I believe it was December 4th

449
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,944
And the reason I don't have any clips of that

450
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,016
Is because we've all everyone's heard the eclipse

451
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,040
The big one

452
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
Did people attack him with it or like

453
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:32,000
Trump saying your record is spotless

454
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
Yeah yeah

455
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,840
The reason that I don't include a lot of that

456
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
Is because

457
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:41,216
That episode is really just strfkr like Alex being like

458
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:46,080
Believe Trump would be on my show

459
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
Worship heavy

460
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
Call celebrity

461
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
Bright and then

462
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,248
2 days later on December 3rd

463
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,904
He's like I don't know about drop I still love Rand Paul

464
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,952
We thought would absolutely

465
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,792
I think it doesn't subtle ways I think his mentality start

466
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
Lean much more towards Trump when he realizes like

467
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:15,008
Come on my show all these crazy things that I love

468
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,568
But I don't think until after this debate

469
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,896
It really crystallizes and I think a large part of that is

470
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Is because

471
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Like

472
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
Bringing up 9/11 truth

473
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,296
Right he's yelling at age

474
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
Wichita

475
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,880
It is fun he's living vicariously through

476
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,208
It is and I think he's just gotten to a point where the

477
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,256
It's like why am I fighting this

478
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
Rand Paul is crazy

479
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,144
He's not going to do what I wanted to do track his heart is pure

480
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,448
He's a loser in a rom-com

481
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:49,568
Yep he's been a long relationship Grandpa was very reliable

482
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,968
Says a lot of the things he's liked but guess what there's this flashy new lady now

483
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,504
New York

484
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,368
Juggle both her job and running for president

485
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,256
Now gives off all of her responsibilities to her kids and it's time for her to f***

486
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
And who's there

487
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560
Whatever happened

488
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:16,192
Alex Jones now if this is a traditional romantic comedy which I like this picture

489
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,104
The third act has to be Alex coming back to Rand Paul and realizing he was

490
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,504
By the big-city guy

491
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,112
I should have never left Kentucky

492
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
Trump is impeached

493
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:41,536
Then we go right back to R & B Jones for not seeing through it until it

494
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
I was too late now I don't

495
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,608
Think so I think Grant got a big heart

496
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,912
Is dumb

497
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,704
Psyquel

498
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,384
Do you really want to be sidled up with the high-profile Russia connected guy who ended up winning the presidency is

499
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,432
Probably going to get indicted for it

500
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,248
Or do you want to go with the down-home

501
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,320
Pure libertarian guy who you love who's also

502
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
Suspiciously connected with Russia

503
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,136
Which one do you want

504
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
You go with me

505
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
The under-the-radar guy

506
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,488
I think that's the smart money

507
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,840
Also I'm bringing up Russia because I just whenever he says like

508
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,400
The libertarian there's something

509
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
Things Trump says that I don't

510
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,288
Libertarian and conservative and Republican

511
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,128
All these people really want is to watch whatever liberals

512
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,664
Wanted or did

513
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,016
Liberal tears

514
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:39,392
They don't have any ideology liberals

515
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,744
Trump

516
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,144
Movement with you want to call it alright alt-lite any of that nonsense

517
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,960
Yes certainly

518
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240
Organization

519
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,568
So much

520
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
To the internet

521
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
Trolls of the world

522
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,896
Is because of that

523
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:06,272
It's not about productivity it's not building up anything it is just about this

524
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,928
Rule destruction those online communities are really into

525
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
They're into

526
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,024
Needling and and hurting people

527
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,656
They don't care about games or

528
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
Ethics

529
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,984
Gamer journalism

530
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,080
F*** is that I don't know they care about destroying some young woman's life

531
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,128
Because it gives them a sense of satisfaction

532
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
Not just one

533
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
Oh yeah

534
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
Russia came up

535
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,016
When my Alaska

536
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,552
For the ramp there

537
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
His little thing about Russia

538
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,792
Incredible

539
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,864
And this is the most powerful

540
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,472
Because of this statement

541
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,104
Respond

542
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,896
Calmly great lovingly

543
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,856
Bloodthirsty piranha Behavior

544
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,672
So they go into like

545
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
The clips OKC

546
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,328
Chris Christie saying that

547
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
Blood

548
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,448
Oh yeah Chris Christie's things that if

549
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
They shoot down

550
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,800
Or if they fly in no-fly zone

551
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:38,688
Cuz that's what a no-fly zone is

552
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,480
Who's against no-fly zones

553
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
Just a way to start a war with Russia

554
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
I don't want to unpack that

555
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,368
That very well might be the case

556
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,976
At the same time these aren't like bloodthirsty cries for war they're more like

557
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,376
We need to have some sort of reasonable pushback

558
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,216
In the Ukraine whenever they just go

559
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
Yeah

560
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
A lot of other

561
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,504
That's a lot of other pretty much the entire Soviet Bloc

562
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
Yeah

563
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
I think

564
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,368
What this demonstrates

565
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,440
Is that he's turning on a little bit

566
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,744
Inasmuch as he's lashing out at him

567
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,768
In favor of threat

568
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,560
Also

569
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,400
Write Rand Paul has won this debate I think it's meaningless

570
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
You pushing back against

571
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,240
Criticisms of Russia

572
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
Okay great

573
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:40,384
The only run the who win who won the Republican debate

574
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
Was the America

575
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,992
Absolutely I think we got everything we wanted at

576
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,784
So other than

577
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,160
That I mean there is there's a number of things that come up in the in the meantime

578
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
Before we jump

579
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:58,816
But a lot of it is really not even worth covering it's also repetitive

580
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,888
There's all just nonsense like pro-russia sentiment

581
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,936
Muslim sentiment

582
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
Anti-immigrant stuff

583
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
Hillary bashing

584
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,544
It's just

585
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,360
It's log

586
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,712
From the middle of November where we last left off on our investigation

587
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
December 6th

588
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
And even

589
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
December 6th

590
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,576
Up until December

591
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
429

592
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,368
A lot of it

593
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,184
It is a little bit more exciting

594
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
Hello more entertaining

595
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,280
And the November 5th November to December

596
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
460

597
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
Braves

598
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,704
It's the third period of this first playoff game I guess

599
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
You understand

600
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
It's just

601
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:45,664
I could we could spend the next six months talking about how lord monckton loves Russia to

602
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,760
Or you know these various other things that I've discovered along the way

603
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,064
Well I've I'm sure that he wasn't invited

604
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Paris

605
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
What's

606
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
But I remember Alex

607
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,352
Alex Eclipse only remember the first time he tells me something

608
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Edline

609
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
So

610
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,192
We jump to the 29th

611
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,008
And I have a series about what happened on this

612
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,848
I don't know how to lay this out

613
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,176
So I'm just going to go ahead and play this first clip

614
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,272
I will confuse that advent calendar went all the way to the 29th

615
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
That's not it

616
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,344
That's not the confusion

617
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,648
There's a big narrative going on

618
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,024
This is going to be very difficult for us to untwine

619
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Okay but I have a fever

620
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,152
With a wide-scale across-the-board attempted takeover Infowars a different accounts

621
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,832
So I'm going to just come out and tell you I don't

622
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
Attack happened there is

623
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
A hack attack

624
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,768
But also can happen in a hockey game

625
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
Right right

626
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,608
As opposed to a basketball game which would be a shack attack

627
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,680
I don't believe this attack happen

628
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,592
I think it's

629
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,640
Details a little bit

630
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,688
Evidence

631
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
The only evidence

632
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,624
Is an article that went up on infowars.com alright was later taken it is

633
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,160
They got some

634
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
Combat intelligence

635
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:37,024
Wroetoshaw article

636
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
And this entire hacking narrative

637
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
Is b*******

638
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864
To use as

639
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
Cover

640
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,960
And to validate the gas that they have coming up

641
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,520
Which will play out throughout the next couple clips

642
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,360
But I think Occam's razor tells me that's the case because the next day off

643
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:57,504
Does not bring up this happy at all

644
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:10,560
He just moves along and Hillary sucks

645
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,960
Behave at later on to show how much he's being attacked all the time it's like

646
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:24,128
Well yeah he's going to get into some stuff back

647
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
And it's troubling

648
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,480
Understood

649
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,320
Across-the-board

650
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
From our Facebook account

651
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
Twitter account

652
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,496
And we are writing stories about it right now

653
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:57,408
Comware one of the fax was successful

654
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
11 minutes

655
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,648
And of course I had changed

656
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
Account

657
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,912
We'll put Paul Watson Twitter account

658
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,728
Prison Planet

659
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,640
Islamic

660
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,176
States currently

661
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,064
On-the-ground yesterday

662
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,584
Watch your six

663
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,960
I basically already put my finger

664
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
What's going on here

665
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,288
So

666
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,824
Because it was very simple

667
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,640
PJ Watson tweeted out some b******* and they were like

668
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:06,784
We got to pretend that he got hacked with Watson put out was about erdewan

669
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
It was about

670
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,368
There was a UFO

671
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,208
Iambadder Dhawan was taking shelter at us

672
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Air Base

673
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
Participated in the fake narrative that put out so that he could jail at arrest

674
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,448
All of his

675
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,752
That might not be something that you want

676
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,312
On your own belt

677
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,640
You might want to pretend

678
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,224
Now

679
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,576
Actually I don't know if these dates match

680
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,952
Like I don't know what the date is for like when the coup happen

681
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,000
Fake to in

682
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
Interesting

683
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
Fulfill some

684
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
People still believe that was a real coup like

685
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:01,568
If you see every action mode on Facebook doesn't match up that was 26

686
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,616
I was in July of 20

687
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:12,832
This is a different

688
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,672
This is a different thing that he's evoking but

689
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
Dicey

690
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,024
Yeah this seems like something Paul Joseph Watson

691
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,072
Might have gotten the bad tip on

692
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,096
As We Know

693
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,400
His DMS are wide open

694
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,704
At least they were at this point

695
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,824
And we have repeated evidence of him just taking anonymous source information

696
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,408
Then writing about it on Infowars about 3 million immigrants

697
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,712
Absolutely

698
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,272
Also from my Twitter

699
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,064
True Souls there

700
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
I think

701
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,904
What we're seeing here is

702
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,464
A little bit of ice covering

703
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,840
Let's get this because Alex needs to make this deliciously convoluted

704
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,496
Article

705
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,568
A bunch of others

706
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,272
Operation

707
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,672
Calling themselves the Syrian electronic Army

708
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,072
Gmail

709
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,632
Thousand colleges with 2000 plus

710
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,760
Syrian electronic Army

711
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
That's not what happened

712
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
In concert American Patriot

713
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,168
Do you see what's going on here

714
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,984
So he's acknowledging

715
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,520
Russia

716
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
Attacking the American cover

717
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,176
But not the Patriots

718
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
G

719
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
Is

720
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:25,696
With Russians carrying out massive heckenkamp

721
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,000
And using said influence information

722
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
To influence

723
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,400
A couple of those things that you bring up War propaganda

724
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,032
Totally on board with them

725
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
Using

726
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,848
Fake information

727
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,152
Witches witches fascinating because

728
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:49,760
That means that he believes in global

729
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,088
Cooperation organization to root out the globalist

730
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
Yeah

731
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
Interesting

732
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:59,744
There's a lot of there's a lot of

733
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,096
I've never seen that before from Alex this is incredibly weird

734
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
Just

735
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,936
It belies so many other things

736
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,240
He claims now which is like

737
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:16,640
Irisher doesn't

738
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:23,040
A bill when you said that

739
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,600
Legoland stuff is it's crazy

740
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,928
The Syrian electronic Army

741
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:33,536
Are you now saying that

742
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
You

743
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,120
Is that what you're saying what is the case

744
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
I don't know

745
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
I don't know

746
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
Do you think

747
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,240
That is that is interesting

748
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,800
That's so many patriots

749
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080
Of America

750
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,360
Freely Russia

751
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,688
Absolutely happy with another country taking us over

752
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,736
It's a very fascinating patriotic Arkansas

753
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,272
Well it's just because I mean

754
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
I'm

755
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
Starting to believe

756
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,904
That about 90%

757
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,208
Of the people who think that way

758
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,744
Think exactly the same

759
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,536
Yeah they think

760
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,888
Our country is taken over by

761
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:14,496
Right and that Russia is the are the only people who could say because

762
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
It's already

763
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
Anatol

764
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
Cockamamie line of b*******

765
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,896
Most likely put out by

766
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,736
It's very interesting

767
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,272
Oligarchs alone is

768
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
Crazy

769
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,880
Maybe he kicked out the other oligarchs

770
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,976
Play balls

771
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:41,376
But I'll be goddamn she doesn't have a whole network of his owner

772
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,400
Not know that

773
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:48,800
He just doesn't like the liberal order of the world doesn't like the idea that freedom is come

774
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:54,175
The shape that it has

775
00:41:54,431 --> 00:42:00,575
In society because they're f****** weird to him

776
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,159
Yeah or Christian or Christian or

777
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:11,839
Male shoe against the Catholic Church

778
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:22,591
Do you want them to feel the exact role that works for men

779
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,479
Dino there's a lot to unpack in that word it's accurate but it

780
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,551
It's more you need to play the role that we need you to play

781
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,599
I guess that is subjugation but it's

782
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
Booked

783
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
Perfect order

784
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,231
And he knows

785
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,559
That the only way to get that is by bringing liberty and prosperity

786
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,911
Riordan Salisbury nasm

787
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:51,007
Could be that those two things are capable of freedom is oftentimes chaos

788
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:55,871
I suggested that last clip like the Russians

789
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,687
Is the Russians hacking what's the narrative

790
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,063
And II

791
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
Very high-level chess

792
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
Definitely not

793
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,223
We knew at

794
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,063
That we can get the military informed of this

795
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,671
Christian areas of Syria over Al-Qaeda save everybody

796
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
Not okay

797
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,815
As the Syrian electronic Army continued

798
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,703
Infowars.com

799
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,031
Posted

800
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,407
Skype

801
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Twitter account

802
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,783
Response to bet

803
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,367
Out of Turkey

804
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,999
Infowars

805
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Electronic

806
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,399
Which hasn't happened yet

807
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,703
Okay that is

808
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,263
I believe

809
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,871
So

810
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
Right

811
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
They just

812
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,319
Did Infowars know that was the Syrian electronic Army who he knows is Russia

813
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,879
So the Syrian electronic Army

814
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
They hacked

815
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:49,279
BNN what-have-you in posted Infowars article in an attempt to spread the truth

816
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,935
So they were on the good side of things that was wrong that was Russia nowcast

817
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:02,335
Okay this is a group trying to pretend to be the Syrian electronic Army but it's actually

818
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,895
Affiliated

819
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:11,295
Right but doesn't he not know that so many of his boys have

820
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,855
Problem in a few clips

821
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,647
That is going to snow again

822
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,303
Not Al Qaeda

823
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
Productivity

824
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,887
Do not work without absolute I think that's true

825
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,423
I agree with him there

826
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:33,823
When he's right he's right you got to give him that looking at you guy whose name I forgot that was in the news for a long time

827
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
What's that guy's name

828
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:42,527
Know that guy that white guy who went over and joined outside and his big media sensation for a little while

829
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:48,927
Remember that guy's name whatever happened to that guy probably alive

830
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:54,047
Alex Jones discusses the actual article that was put on Infowars by this alleged

831
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
Which again I don't believe

832
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:03,263
US Airways

833
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
That was

834
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,151
Someone

835
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:14,527
I began running around

836
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,439
So that we can survive attack

837
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,631
By the way I'm going to Facebook

838
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,447
Great I think he's talking about a Hydra not whack-a-mole

839
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
Totally

840
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:40,383
X

841
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:46,783
Prairie espresso

842
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,599
Find any loses track of metaphors a lot but

843
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:50,879
Like

844
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
This doesn't

845
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:59,327
Strike me first of all all outside of the normal for something they would post

846
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,143
Journalistic standards are in the toilet

847
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
And have been for

848
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,519
Nayan two-decade

849
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
Sanders at 1

850
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,479
The idea that they were supposed to be like oh

851
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
S***

852
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,343
Someone sucking with us

853
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,135
Secondarily

854
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:28,767
The idea that I was running around trying to sort this out investigating a pre-show then get on air

855
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,559
And be calm like this

856
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
He's not yelling

857
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,631
He's not making threats

858
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,679
This isn't how Alex Jones behave

859
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,263
If you had a narrative in place

860
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,311
And he knew nothing was going on

861
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,127
This is this is bulshit this is a Man actor

862
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
You would not

863
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:51,039
It's easy to figure out if it's an actual Infowars article

864
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
Read it

865
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,671
Sound the same but they're all written by the same voice

866
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:02,815
No there

867
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:09,215
That's not true couple Riders who don't know how to read we find out what

868
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Defensive like

869
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,055
We haven't distributed across multiple platforms

870
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,079
To protect against

871
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:19,711
The tax rate

872
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:26,111
We are expanding across all of those who we have to go check them you take down one at 5

873
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:30,719
Take down 550 pop up

874
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,279
He's saying that he has a lot of tentacles again

875
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:39,423
That's what he saying he's one of our tentacles five of our technical pop-up attacks

876
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:44,031
That got that backwards

877
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:50,431
That is very dumb we get to learn what exactly happened with this hack what was what was taken in

878
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
Downtown Augusta

879
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:08,863
He forgot it at bottom

880
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
The Flash

881
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,079
Show they clearly.

882
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,663
Someone account

883
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
It had

884
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
.

885
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:32,159
Triple security company show

886
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
Secure and safe

887
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
Riverdale

888
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:53,407
I've been saying that they're really the last 20 years

889
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,479
I just don't I don't

890
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
Believe that

891
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
At all

892
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,343
It's very convenient that like

893
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,135
There's a high level

894
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,927
Super

895
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,951
Organized

896
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,023
Cyber-attack going up against him

897
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,071
And everything important

898
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,375
It it doesn't

899
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:20,031
Cuz like if I was putting up a fake article right that's the worst hacking out

900
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
In history

901
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,127
Real hackers can get into Banks

902
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:29,503
It's not like older to Triple protected by a bank agency

903
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:35,903
It's not it is just doesn't ring true it smells real bad

904
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,183
In terms of like

905
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:37,951
The truth test

906
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
So

907
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:43,583
I told you that I think that he's lying because they put up a bad article and they want

908
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,607
To pretend that they didn't

909
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
Conspiracy theory

910
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,423
Okay

911
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,191
Was

912
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,239
Pjw

913
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,031
Guessing really well and make

914
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,055
Picking up a narrative

915
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
That

916
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,383
Turkey was eventually going to have a fake coup

917
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,735
Get the idea

918
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,063
I don't know. Maybe it's

919
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,159
What was that that was the fake propaganda baby it's neither

920
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,767
I don't know or both I don't know I can't unpack that although I do like it is

921
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,815
Conspiracy theory

922
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,631
Because must be in

923
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:24,031
In contact with manafort and those guys in Flint probably

924
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,079
Maybe put it out and they were like

925
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:32,223
You got to take that down I would like I would like for you to hold onto this

926
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,807
Conspiracy theory especially the direction you're going

927
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,599
Four clips

928
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,903
Cuz we are going to get to

929
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:47,327
My little bit

930
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,863
Okay it's crucial

931
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,143
I got to follow the money

932
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,447
No go to follow till I

933
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,471
Back

934
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,007
Bead hack Eli

935
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,799
So what

936
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:00,639
I think they're covering to this story but then they also want to add gravitas

937
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,919
To a guest that they're having

938
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:07,039
Because coincidentally if he's a cybersecurity expert

939
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:11,647
Whistleblower

940
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
Who is

941
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
Allegedly

942
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,975
He works

943
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
On getting people out of Isis

944
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
In Turkey

945
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,375
Which is very convenient for Alex's theory about who is

946
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
Fake hacking

947
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:28,543
It's weird that he came on to talk about sex scandals in the Vatican

948
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:33,151
Not in a wig

949
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,175
But

950
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:43,903
Adorable

951
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:48,511
They end up coming on over Skype

952
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
And it's terrible

953
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,559
Skype connection doesn't work

954
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:54,911
But he also has the guy who hooked Alex with his Turkish

955
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,983
Whistleblower guy named Pat Riley

956
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
Nope

957
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,359
What does hair

958
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,943
Is guinan Kirsten I landed LeBron

959
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,223
Now I'm going to Lantern

960
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,015
It's a guy named Kevin Booth

961
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,807
And we don't know who that guy is yet

962
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
And I will find

963
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,671
Are on Showtime

964
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
And on HBO

965
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,535
Networks

966
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Shop

967
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,839
Documentary filmmaker

968
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,143
HGTV

969
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
Producer

970
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,543
Studio

971
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,671
So

972
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,975
The reason that I am bringing this up

973
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,327
More evidence that this whole hacks thing is

974
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Is fake

975
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,399
Is if we work all about

976
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,959
Let's say 5 6 months ago

977
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,751
We did an episode where Alex Jones

978
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,519
Clearly fake

979
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,311
A GoFundMe

980
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,847
Being taken down

981
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,431
The song man Sawyer

982
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,247
And his attempt to out pedophile

983
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,783
Or whatever their plan was

984
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:21,183
They put on a piece of Theatre wherein they knew they needed to a up the real

985
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
Holiday Inn quote

986
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:25,535
Of what they're doing and so they have the external stimulus

987
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Which is

988
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,631
They put up something on gofundme.com new would be taken down

989
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:35,007
Like what

990
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,543
Stride Rite

991
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,639
We went through the terms of service and filed at least 6 in fraction

992
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:47,039
At the very least it was extra vigilante

993
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:53,439
GoFundMe does not usually support like you can't put up a GoFundMe for getting together a poppy to Roundup them Barman

994
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
They

995
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,303
They have a tradition of doing

996
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
And I think

997
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,935
Especially because we see no evidence of it and Alex drops the narrative

998
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,215
Pretty f****** fast

999
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,007
I think this hack

1000
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Is fake

1001
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:13,407
In order to be like we're having this Turkish whistleblower on and they want to take us down

1002
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
Because we're having

1003
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,247
This is too dangerous and the Turkish guy is hiding

1004
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,295
From isisaurus

1005
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,343
From Turkey a f****** everybody

1006
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,951
You hiding out here in the United States

1007
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,487
Pencil that's fine

1008
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,047
But here's the next

1009
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,119
There's the next clip where Alex

1010
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,935
Talked about how under attack he is in general

1011
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,847
Realization and lies

1012
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,015
Local papers

1013
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
So

1014
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,887
I want to tell you what I think is happen

1015
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,191
For twenty years

1016
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,239
There was a tacit agreement

1017
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
In the world

1018
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,311
It was an uneasy truce

1019
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,615
Between Alex Jones underworld

1020
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,151
And that was

1021
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,687
Stay in your lane

1022
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,991
And some people will make fun of you

1023
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,527
Bubble leave you alone

1024
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,319
There was just a thing

1025
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,343
Scream about

1026
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
Conspiracies

1027
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,671
Scream about chimeras all you want right

1028
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,695
Fear fun

1029
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,767
Some people will enjoy you and they'll be led down the wrong path

1030
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
But we don't care

1031
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,583
Whatever

1032
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,351
A couple months

1033
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,911
Before this point at the end of 2015

1034
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,191
Alex Jones

1035
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,471
Start

1036
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,031
Get far more active

1037
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,055
Interim

1038
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,079
Of politics

1039
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
Then he has been in the

1040
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,431
He screamed about politicians in the past

1041
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,967
But there's never been

1042
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,247
What appears to be

1043
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,015
Coordination

1044
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,111
Between him and people involved with a presidential candidate

1045
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,183
Well there's that too

1046
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,719
But I think it's more like

1047
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,255
People started to

1048
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,023
See

1049
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:09,631
Like Rodger Stone coming on his show

1050
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
People like

1051
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,423
All right we got it

1052
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,471
Look at the wackamole metaphor

1053
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,751
We got to knock this one down

1054
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,799
With people start

1055
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
Situation

1056
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,407
The infinite whack-a-mole did workout someone

1057
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,711
Put back I think it's just that he breached

1058
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,527
The social contract that you may be unaware of it is like

1059
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,063
Just just don't

1060
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:34,463
Just f****** stay over there and we're fine he started to get involved in the real world

1061
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,303
We got to pay attention to you and we're going to make fun of you

1062
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,327
Right

1063
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:44,191
We didn't want to be doing this Alex let me stay over there

1064
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:50,079
You were fine over here and we got to we got to do something been spouting

1065
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,895
Borderline to over racist

1066
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:59,295
Bulshit your worldviews clearly based on Let It Go

1067
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,111
We've allowed you to make a lot of money just

1068
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,415
Just stay over there and now

1069
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
He's creeping in

1070
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,463
Creepin in

1071
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,511
Starting to affect things that people are like

1072
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
Shut it down

1073
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,815
That's not being a

1074
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,095
Text message Sara Lee

1075
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,399
That's just like you're out of your depth

1076
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:17,727
And unfortunately

1077
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,055
Yeah unfortunately I don't think people did it the right way

1078
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:27,455
And it's lets us to where we are now but

1079
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,527
Popped up and then form

1080
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,855
There was such a better way

1081
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
16

1082
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,463
There's a better way to defuse Alex

1083
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,047
I think missed our opportunity we might be able to

1084
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,351
Some Headway but back then it would have been

1085
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:49,983
Bearded man here's the clip where we find out it is very similar

1086
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,335
How we're dealing with every single time I set up a few interrupt me

1087
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,343
Conversationally little frustrating

1088
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:12,511
Prefer

1089
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:17,375
It's that there are pros and cons to eat outside

1090
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,959
I'm just saying it

1091
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:24,287
It's interesting that the way we deal with the disinformation

1092
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,847
Is the exact same way we're dealing with

1093
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,407
Hurricanes and earthquakes

1094
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
Texaco in all of this stuff is

1095
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,479
We could have

1096
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,575
We could have gotten there earlier

1097
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,111
We could have prepared for all of the

1098
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:42,207
We all knew that this type of ship was going to go down

1099
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,999
And instead we're waiting until the

1100
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
Catastrophe hits

1101
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,327
And now we're trying to go back and

1102
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,631
Actually do something about it when it's too late

1103
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:03,199
Worth interrupting my deduction for sure Alex gets down to who he thinks

1104
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,527
Again

1105
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,575
Alex

1106
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,623
8 who he thinks is behind the attack

1107
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
His.

1108
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,415
And it's wild

1109
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:27,263
Welfare

1110
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,615
500

1111
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
Plus from

1112
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,407
Taxpayers

1113
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,735
Charter School

1114
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,527
Islamic

1115
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
Caliphate

1116
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,719
Arnold School

1117
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:54,143
High School

1118
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
Is it connect

1119
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,319
President of Turkey erdogan

1120
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
Because

1121
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,823
Because everyone

1122
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,247
That's

1123
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:46,623
That's amazing

1124
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,671
Muzzles are always fighting come on

1125
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:53,023
We get it you got crabs

1126
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,047
So

1127
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,607
Alex

1128
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,447
On real shaky territory

1129
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,471
Call Owen

1130
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,519
Well

1131
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,799
It's

1132
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,127
Airgun

1133
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,431
Did he just say that he is suing

1134
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
Schools in

1135
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:13,759
America

1136
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,063
No that is that

1137
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,087
Turkey

1138
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,367
Erdewan

1139
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
Is doing

1140
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,487
Cuz

1141
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
A caliphate

1142
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
Which they're not

1143
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:31,679
I mean I would assume

1144
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,727
Live with that I have a lot of school

1145
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,751
Established Charter

1146
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,055
Schools

1147
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,079
United States

1148
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,615
And

1149
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:43,711
Your ears yours if they would that that they say about them

1150
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:44,991
The Islamic

1151
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,271
Aspect of it

1152
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,087
Play Darko New York Times

1153
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:54,719
Pakistan Islam in their dormitory

1154
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:58,559
And describe the Turkish schools as offering a gentler approach to Islam

1155
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,863
They could help reduce the influence of extreme

1156
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,143
However

1157
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,191
Schools are not for Muslims alone

1158
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,263
General curriculum for the network schools

1159
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,799
Prescribes one hour of religious

1160
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
Construction per week

1161
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,103
Well in many countries

1162
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,919
Schools do not offer any religious instruction at all

1163
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,223
With the exception of a few

1164
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
Schools abroad

1165
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,783
And not in the United States

1166
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,807
These Institution

1167
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,879
Hardly be considered Islamic schools

1168
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:23,647
Any strict

1169
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,719
Considered illegal in the United States

1170
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,743
I think

1171
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:37,471
Without headlines

1172
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:43,871
No there's a lot of

1173
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,175
Also the ones that are in America is 100

1174
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:46,943
20 of them

1175
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,223
25 States

1176
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,271
There's no formal networking of the

1177
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
The schools

1178
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,343
They're not even collected

1179
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,135
Together they don't really even work together

1180
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,671
So

1181
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,463
Not formally

1182
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,743
Not in not in the

1183
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:04,351
Public eye but if you're going to

1184
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,679
You activate those

1185
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:12,031
That's bulshit but the bigger issue is

1186
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:12,799
What's that

1187
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:16,895
Mike Flynn General Flynn

1188
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:21,759
Vallarta 18 extradite

1189
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
Gulen

1190
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:29,439
Exactly like what are you from

1191
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
His clearance forms

1192
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
Cute

1193
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
Out of money

1194
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:37,375
To try and do this because it would be illegal to extradite

1195
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,447
He is the one who in 2016

1196
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:46,847
Erdewan blames for the fake to that

1197
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,687
Alex

1198
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,527
Cultural revolution what's Alex doing

1199
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,831
I think

1200
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
He's giving him cover

1201
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,135
And saying that

1202
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,439
He's the bad guy

1203
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:10,143
Christine I can't imagine why interesting

1204
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,471
He loves them I think there's something Smith suspicious

1205
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:17,823
Who has that

1206
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,871
Power about how we are funding ice

1207
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:20,895
Course

1208
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Because Mike Flynn

1209
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
It's crazy

1210
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,991
Crazy in the same way that Alex

1211
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,831
This is really a big problem

1212
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:33,695
The fact that he's blaming to pin the blame on this

1213
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,719
On the gulen

1214
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,487
People

1215
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,511
The gulen

1216
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,791
Organization

1217
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,863
That's probably behind

1218
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,911
Which I don't believe are real

1219
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,703
That's f***** up

1220
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,239
That's really f***** up

1221
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,031
Very f*****-up

1222
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:52,383
It is so tight into all of this s***

1223
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,151
Yeah

1224
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,199
He's so tied into it

1225
01:05:55,455 --> 01:06:01,599
How is it that we're getting an angle

1226
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:05,951
Walking chimeras I know

1227
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:12,351
We're not really getting to the bottom of it but we're seeing indications were getting a view

1228
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,887
There are probably

1229
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,679
Reno Paper Trails and

1230
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,471
Much further Evidence

1231
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,519
When you see Alex Jones is Almost

1232
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,543
Like I hate

1233
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,335
We're like

1234
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,383
You really connect to this

1235
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,431
Anti-bullying propaganda

1236
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
2

1237
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,479
A guy who's

1238
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,015
Superpro Russia

1239
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,039
You got

1240
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:31,807
Trump

1241
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:32,831
Hahaha

1242
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,111
Pro ortolan

1243
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,391
Pro Putin

1244
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,463
It's like a Clearinghouse of all this s***

1245
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,023
It's very bizarre and I do think that it's

1246
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,303
F***** up that more people are

1247
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,607
Deep dive

1248
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:50,239
I think we should be doing a lot of this weird conservative propaganda

1249
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,055
Diane

1250
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,847
Quite frankly someone

1251
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,895
Soros give me some goddamn money

1252
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,943
Like I could do this

1253
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,991
I can't do much deeper dive into this

1254
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,551
If I had the f****** time I didn't have to go to work

1255
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,879
But be that as it may that's a plate for another day

1256
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:09,695
He brings in Kevin Booth

1257
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:13,279
Who as we heard was that he's a filmmaker in

1258
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,327
Worked with Bill Hicks wink wink

1259
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,863
Formerly Kevin Federline

1260
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
Wink wink

1261
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,911
You worked with Bill Hicks

1262
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,679
I get it

1263
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,703
Link

1264
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,007
He has a couple times

1265
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,823
It's called Alex bill on the couch

1266
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,847
I get it.

1267
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:32,735
I get it I was going crazy I'm watching

1268
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,831
It's hilarious

1269
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,111
But the one

1270
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,439
That is actually subtle

1271
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
And fun

1272
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,767
It's not subtle

1273
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:49,119
Point of course not actually doing it but the point that it is

1274
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,399
Rare and

1275
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,423
Silly

1276
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,239
Xavier

1277
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,799
Comes in

1278
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,103
Oh boy

1279
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,895
This next clip

1280
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:02,943
Bitconnect

1281
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,967
A couple of dots

1282
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,247
Accidentally

1283
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:08,063
Do you would never pick up on if you weren't paying attention

1284
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,135
It's troubling

1285
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:22,655
Robert Steele helped us get in there Fleet or not

1286
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,287
Outland kalugin

1287
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:35,711
Umbrella

1288
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:41,343
But I'm all these things connect and then Robert ended up getting us into the Russian Embassy

1289
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,391
And so we've actually been meeting with

1290
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,047
Bring the door inside

1291
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:59,007
You know what that implies right there that end of the clip

1292
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:04,383
Implies that Kevin Booth knows that he shouldn't come on to Infowars

1293
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,199
Trout it implies some foreknowledge

1294
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,991
But that is not what we do here

1295
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:14,367
To make Putin look bad when in reality you can just look at

1296
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:19,999
No the other thing people who don't understand what's going on with notice

1297
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:26,399
Is that he says that Robert David Steele got him into the Russian Embassy

1298
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,447
Must have connection

1299
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:30,751
At the Russian Embassy who doesn't

1300
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,543
That's

1301
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:38,943
Troubling that we don't have connected Robert David Steele believes that the zionists are trying to diss

1302
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,503
Destroy him and the globalist

1303
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,039
That guy

1304
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:49,439
Come on Alex Jones's show and now in present day in 2017 Alex fix

1305
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
Might've been trying to

1306
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
Set Alex up

1307
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:54,303
Yeah of course with that Mars base stuff

1308
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:58,655
That's that's the guy who connected Kevin Booth with the Russian Embassy

1309
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,191
Wild

1310
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
I mean that's

1311
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:01,983
That's obvious

1312
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,055
Now what's the Bulgarian umbrella

1313
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,359
I don't particularly

1314
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:11,455
But he didn't I mean like a MacGuffin in a James Bond movie

1315
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,479
Maybe

1316
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,247
It's probably

1317
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,575
Assertive

1318
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:22,975
Fish bass

1319
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:26,047
Delicious got to go to the shop downtown

1320
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:29,119
On the corner

1321
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:35,519
Very dry

1322
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,847
Clip we find out how Kevin Booth Matt his guests

1323
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,639
He's bringing on to Alex

1324
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,247
Guests coming

1325
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,783
On a little bit later

1326
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,367
Well I once again Ray Roberts

1327
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:55,743
Professor I'm at yala he is recently had to flee the country

1328
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:58,303
Because he was interrogating

1329
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,351
Former Isis Fighters

1330
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,399
Isis Fighters that have defected

1331
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:08,799
And some people that here involved with have been hunted down and murdered and so he decided he needed to leave

1332
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,079
United States right now

1333
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,431
A little bit

1334
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:18,783
But it is like I don't I don't care now about this interview

1335
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:24,671
I don't I don't care at all it has no credibility it's no wonder Roberts

1336
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,951
That's not good

1337
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,999
Crazy

1338
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,047
No

1339
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,839
There's a high probability

1340
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,423
Strongly disagree with your assessment

1341
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,959
Strongly disagree

1342
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,983
There's a chance

1343
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,775
No

1344
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,591
Robert Steele

1345
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:48,479
It's possible but unfortunately the interview ends up having a lot of difficulties and I didn't keep any of it

1346
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,271
And because it's just like I don't

1347
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,319
I don't care what this guy says

1348
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:57,439
Because I'm willing to believe that yes there are Isis people in Turkey

1349
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:01,023
Of course I'm willing to believe this guy

1350
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,607
Has worked with getting some to get out of ice

1351
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,959
Possible that has nothing to do with the substantive claims

1352
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,495
Alex is making

1353
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,519
Pactiv

1354
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:17,663
Right cuz the former Isis people that this guy do on behalf of ice

1355
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:23,039
They're all together right on together

1356
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,087
Put together

1357
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:31,487
Here is a dictators and fascism has taken over almost entirely

1358
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:35,071
Kevin Booth talking about stuff

1359
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,119
Alex said something

1360
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:45,055
And it wasn't even our plan to go to Turkey

1361
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,943
Turtle frog

1362
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,039
I said you better see the West

1363
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,495
I need a film

1364
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,903
Bombay Grill

1365
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:36,255
You know what happened right after Putin took power in 2000

1366
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:41,119
Cracking down on the Press really hard so stories like that wouldn't come out

1367
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:46,495
Jesus

1368
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,407
Is actually

1369
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:01,343
Actually the same p**** Riot is in our movie

1370
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:06,463
To tell the whole rest in the story was quite a big deal to get them in early I just like saying the name

1371
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:21,055
But it's

1372
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:21,823
Messenger

1373
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
Geezers

1374
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,783
One Direction

1375
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,183
Oh boy

1376
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:42,303
So I understand the old geezers at the cia's plan properly

1377
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,447
The complete Nutter opposite of a boy band

1378
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,311
Apparently

1379
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,383
The CIA thought of p**** Riot

1380
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,455
The old geezers at the CIA were like

1381
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
I know

1382
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,759
P**** Riot

1383
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,063
Put series old guys at the CIA

1384
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,135
I mean look unless unless

1385
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:12,767
Lance bangs playing out your thought

1386
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,047
So then they do that

1387
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,839
P**** Riot

1388
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,119
Then

1389
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,167
What

1390
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:21,983
Carries out the CIA plan of being

1391
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:26,079
Alright playing a punk music

1392
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:26,847
But

1393
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,383
Perhaps even better at

1394
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,175
Social activism yes

1395
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:32,223
They will play in a

1396
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,759
Russian Orthodox Church

1397
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:36,063
Putin will then arrest them

1398
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,367
Bright for no reason

1399
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,415
And then

1400
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,463
He will look like a thug

1401
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,071
Did the CIA put together an entire plan to turn people against Putin

1402
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,095
When

1403
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,887
They could have just like shown

1404
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,447
Any number of situations where he is already at

1405
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:59,103
Pre-existing ones remind everybody about those apartment bombing

1406
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:05,503
Here's the thing known soros-funded p**** Riot

1407
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:13,951
Just making me look into that with a clear

1408
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,559
Alex you're dumb

1409
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:21,119
The other thing that we need to talk about

1410
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
Is

1411
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,655
That

1412
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,215
If you trace a line

1413
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,775
The people that he says are soros-funded

1414
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,311
Soros

1415
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,407
You'll notice

1416
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,687
That the

1417
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,455
Impetus

1418
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,479
Behind that

1419
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:40,319
He's trying to take agency away from women and minority

1420
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,367
That is why he does this

1421
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:46,463
Things he says that p**** Riot is run by Soros

1422
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,303
Because it's unfathomable to him women would have political ideas

1423
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,583
You never be

1424
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:54,143
Couldn't believe that they would of their own volition

1425
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:57,983
Go out and do social activism making themselves

1426
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,799
To try and help

1427
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:07,455
Haven't can't imagine that these African Americans that he obviously on some

1428
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,271
Visceral level thinks are dumb

1429
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,319
Would get get together and

1430
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,087
Protest

1431
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:15,903
For a battering of their social

1432
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,671
Situation

1433
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,975
He can't imagine that so he has to believe

1434
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:24,607
That there is this Shadow who is directing all of it

1435
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,911
Because they could never think of this on their own

1436
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
And that is

1437
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,983
Classically racist

1438
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,543
It's classically misogynistic

1439
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:35,871
It is just this idea that non-white males

1440
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,711
It's impossible that they come up with this on their own

1441
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,783
Boogeyman

1442
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:43,807
And that

1443
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,575
I mean

1444
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:45,855
Somebody does all the

1445
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:49,695
That's a bummer agency than that means

1446
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:53,279
Or at least wrestle with their point as opposed to being like now

1447
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,327
CIA

1448
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,911
Get proven

1449
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,447
Cruise ship

1450
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,983
Prove anything

1451
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:06,591
I listen to 10 months of Alex Jones Show proved anything

1452
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,663
Not one thing

1453
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:13,247
Julia Hsu

1454
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:19,135
You just said it to the Wikileaks everyone knows the sea is known

1455
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,207
We've proven more

1456
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,511
I think that's all you trying to

1457
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
Frustrating

1458
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,583
So that's the end of the 29

1459
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,119
For our coverage

1460
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399
Just

1461
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:33,215
There's no resolution to the hacking narrative

1462
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,495
You just let it drop

1463
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,543
And again

1464
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,823
It's

1465
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,103
Just attention

1466
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
Campaign

1467
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,151
It's just him trying to

1468
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:44,223
To make himself

1469
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,759
I just can't stop thank

1470
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:46,783
About

1471
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,367
The writers room in the CIA when they're trying to come up with

1472
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,391
Female punk band

1473
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,183
Russian group

1474
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,207
Haha like

1475
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:58,815
Hey let's go with let's go with vagina dentata

1476
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,607
That's already movie

1477
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:04,959
That's too bad let's go with a vulva

1478
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:08,031
Velvet

1479
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,311
Yeah

1480
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:14,431
Vulva

1481
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,991
P**** Riot doesn't even rhyme

1482
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:21,343
Not even alliterative

1483
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:26,719
Sodium

1484
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,303
And now I think we will see Alex Jones

1485
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,839
Deciding

1486
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,143
Full hog

1487
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
To be a trump

1488
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:38,495
I don't think that there is ever a moment

1489
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,031
From everything that I've listened

1490
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:43,103
I'm too I don't think there's a moment where he says

1491
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,895
I support Trump

1492
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,663
Unequivocal

1493
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,199
I think it just

1494
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
It's just creeping

1495
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:52,063
December 30th

1496
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,087
He knows

1497
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:53,855
I'm about to go

1498
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:59,743
It's the New Year sucking just do this

1499
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,023
Do this and I weekend

1500
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,559
Come back in the new year

1501
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:08,959
And I'll have you can really absorb the respond

1502
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:12,543
From people and if it's come back in your life

1503
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:18,944
Full force and if not you can come up with a way to get out of it

1504
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,736
The best

1505
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,016
You know

1506
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,552
You have a couple days to come up with

1507
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:27,136
But the narrative you got a couple days for the Riders to sit down

1508
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:30,208
You're the angle absolute

1509
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,232
Exact moment

1510
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:33,024
Sprouts Jones realizes

1511
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:33,792
I'm on

1512
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,040
I didn't add any

1513
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,832
I didn't pause it

1514
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,112
As long as

1515
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,648
Super long

1516
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,208
Still gone

1517
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,984
I can't stress this enough

1518
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,264
In the video

1519
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,056
He's staring into the middle distance

1520
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,128
He's not doing anything you just like

1521
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,736
It's almost like a like a

1522
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:27,552
Wiring didn't

1523
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:31,648
It's pretty creepy out of that I would say

1524
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,976
9 second pause probably maybe more

1525
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,280
Jumps back after the fake line

1526
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,472
The fact that the

1527
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,544
You need to go after Hillary

1528
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:51,360
She was on the ground

1529
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,312
Trump replace

1530
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,480
Sean

1531
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,272
You can't

1532
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:36,160
Roundtable discussion on what we should do with the Patriots

1533
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,976
With the truth with a narrative the fight the blob

1534
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:43,328
Just generally

1535
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,936
So two days after this

1536
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:52,544
The beginning of the new year

1537
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,824
One of his economist

1538
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,360
He says

1539
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:58,944
The 2016 will be the worst year for the stock market ever

1540
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,480
Dating

1541
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,016
To the Great Depression

1542
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:05,856
2016 will be like we haven't seen since 1930

1543
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,136
I remember that

1544
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,976
Track record is open Bowl

1545
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:17,376
Buy-Back coins

1546
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,424
Pentecostal Doomsday Preppers

1547
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:24,288
Who continue to say that mathematically the end of the world is happening here and then they're like

1548
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:29,664
Everything is outstanding

1549
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:36,064
Like if you think that I don't know hold on we haven't seen the end of this yet

1550
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:36,832
You're describing

1551
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,856
With doomsday people

1552
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:44,256
Is absolutely not the case you have made them use made discreet predictions of all been wrong

1553
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,024
You

1554
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,328
And all of your guests Alex have the worst

1555
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,864
Track record of any

1556
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,704
Hyundai I've ever heard that's including Rush

1557
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,496
Savage

1558
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,032
That's including

1559
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,080
Glenn Beck even

1560
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:01,664
Impeccable

1561
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,712
In that they are consistent

1562
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,760
And they are always wrong

1563
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,808
Sometimes sometimes Rush

1564
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,576
Got it right

1565
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,624
They're dirty Infowars

1566
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:17,280
Never to get it right ever their track record is amazing and as much as it amazes

1567
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:21,632
Is 1 lb wrong they can be every single step of the way

1568
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:23,168
It's it's impeccable work

1569
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,704
Next clip

1570
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,008
We take a break from anything serious and Alex Jones

1571
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,824
Thinks about his daughters and how they're growing up

1572
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,920
Washing my daughter's

1573
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
Camp

1574
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,528
And I am free

1575
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,344
This morning

1576
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,904
It is the number one most dangerous thing in their life

1577
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,952
As I watch the

1578
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:49,792
Not art camp SUV Broadway

1579
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,336
I Hold On

1580
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,104
Hold on

1581
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,664
This metaphor is going to get really weird

1582
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,968
But before we get into the metaphor

1583
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,760
I would like to explain to Alex

1584
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:10,784
But the reason

1585
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:14,368
That automobile deaths have gone down is regulation

1586
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
Reviews

1587
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,952
Belt laws

1588
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,048
Emissions test a

1589
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,864
He's evil break standards

1590
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:31,520
Things that explode

1591
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:36,640
Proposed on the automotive industry let's say or the reason that those deaths have gone down

1592
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,432
Prosperity

1593
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:42,272
You're against regulation is the thing that is

1594
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:44,064
Going to protect your daughters

1595
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,392
Statistically f****** metaphor

1596
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,048
That kids make

1597
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,032
I got to go out and hunt

1598
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,448
Don't wander off too

1599
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:36,800
Traveling

1600
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,480
Operation manager

1601
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,952
Go to user race memory

1602
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:59,584
I don't see what you think is going very serious concern for a parent

1603
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,448
That

1604
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,728
Made things

1605
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:06,496
Crystal clear

1606
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,520
Does very weird

1607
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,568
Crystal clear

1608
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:15,968
I think you could probably come up with a better analogy parent misogyny in the younger male

1609
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:19,040
Tell telling them not to wander off he has no idea

1610
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,344
Just doesn't understand that

1611
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,904
Call Andy ideafit like

1612
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:30,304
I would like I would prefer to drive them around all the time cuz I know they can't

1613
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:36,960
Cuz they're going to get eaten by Sabertooth sabertooth tiger

1614
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:43,360
Reverse of the you got to let them touch a hot oven

1615
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:47,968
Burn the f*** out of yourself and then they'll be like

1616
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
That's not a good I

1617
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,760
Right

1618
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:50,784
It's dumb

1619
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,832
I think I either weird parrot

1620
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,904
I'm so now get back into politics

1621
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:58,208
This is a troubling clip that he has on the

1622
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,488
December 30th

1623
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,560
Until you obviously talking to folks

1624
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,192
Trump use genuine

1625
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,240
And actually knows

1626
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,104
Trump wants

1627
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,152
And you see the relationship

1628
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:18,944
Oh

1629
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,344
Establishment

1630
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,648
So

1631
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,672
Follow through with all

1632
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:33,024
Proposed tax plan

1633
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,072
Billionaires in the oligarchs roughly

1634
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,864
2 trillion dollars

1635
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:42,752
Nope

1636
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,544
He's got to take him down

1637
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,640
He's draining the swamp he definitely didn't fill the swamp with more Goldman Sachs

1638
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:51,456
Even as

1639
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,504
Early

1640
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,528
Or whatever

1641
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,064
As December 30th

1642
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,856
2015 Alex's

1643
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:01,184
Do you know who are the Trump is working with Putin

1644
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,768
He says as much on his show and visit where is he

1645
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:05,536
Have to have gotten

1646
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:09,632
From one of these birdies but he's talking to

1647
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:18,592
If you don't leave it at that you're going to get f****** subpoenaed out

1648
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,872
Got a subpoena Alex

1649
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:27,552
Adelaide clearly have some awareness of course this is right when these attacks were starting to happen

1650
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:34,208
Is when it ramped up that's when the influence campaign

1651
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,744
Was getting going

1652
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,352
No man Alex knows about

1653
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:44,192
No there's no chance

1654
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,032
Exactly

1655
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,056
You know what would happen

1656
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:51,104
You would probably request

1657
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,128
A

1658
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,152
Private

1659
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,176
Interview

1660
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:56,992
And then he would lie about what he said in the interview

1661
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,808
When Rodger Stone deadline

1662
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:03,648
He would probably request a private interview and f****** spill guts

1663
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,952
Because he be like I'm in way over my head

1664
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,512
Starting globos. Real

1665
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,560
S*** I've been LED down the wrong path

1666
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,584
Why am I

1667
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,168
But it's so many times where it's like oh man

1668
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,192
These guys

1669
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:22,592
Could accidentally like if Larry Nichols accidentally takes down the GOP

1670
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:27,200
Alex Jones is the linchpin Witness

1671
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:29,504
In the case to take down Trump

1672
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,784
And impeach him

1673
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:35,648
How f****** delightful would be the easiest

1674
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,416
Horse

1675
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:41,792
You'd be super easy

1676
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:45,888
If they gave him a public interview

1677
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:52,288
He would grandstand it Scream by 1776

1678
01:30:55,872 --> 01:31:02,016
Heltah skeltah Robert Mueller

1679
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,296
F****** great

1680
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:06,624
Just Elizabeth Warren having to deal with

1681
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,464
Golf Ranking

1682
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,512
So in this next clip

1683
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,328
Alex Jones has Paul Craig Roberts

1684
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:18,144
And we talked about him a little bit in the past

1685
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,680
He's a cookie weirdo

1686
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,728
And on this

1687
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,496
Day

1688
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:24,288
Call Craig Robertson

1689
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:27,104
In this clip he expresses some suspicion about our

1690
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,384
Alex

1691
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,152
He loves Alex

1692
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,944
But suspicions about Trump

1693
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:33,504
And then Alex

1694
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:36,576
And by doing so accidentally reveals something

1695
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:39,136
That I think would also be germane to being

1696
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,152
On a

1697
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:06,272
I should come in and help because

1698
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:12,160
I mean I mean obviously

1699
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:17,024
Obviously

1700
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:19,328
Not scare the establishment as much either

1701
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,544
What is that

1702
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:44,416
I don't think you understand

1703
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:48,000
Open Mike Flynn

1704
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:51,072
So

1705
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:54,144
Robert David Steele and

1706
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,728
Beyond

1707
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:58,752
Not understanding

1708
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,776
Conspiracy theorists

1709
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,312
That need apply

1710
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,592
Is that

1711
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:04,128
Alex Jones reveals

1712
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:07,712
Whether it's real or not or Alex's perception

1713
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:10,272
He has some sway over

1714
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:15,904
I sent you the stone stone stone send you to him

1715
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,440
He has a line

1716
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,720
Within the campaign

1717
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:22,048
And may or may not be

1718
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:24,096
In Athen Subway influential

1719
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:27,168
I think a lot of it is probably Alex's grandiosity

1720
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,960
Overblown

1721
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:33,056
I would say

1722
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,360
Communication well and even beyond that

1723
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:41,760
Take away the reality and Bluster whatever it may be what's most important is Alex Jones now I

1724
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,040
Identifies as being part of

1725
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:50,720
True because I was using an interview with someone on his show to spell

1726
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:57,120
Policy advisors for Donald Trump now is not just someone who likes him

1727
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,448
Ostensibly

1728
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:02,240
Piece of it and legal aid

1729
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,264
He is a part of

1730
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,824
No I don't know about that but

1731
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:11,200
I don't know about that I don't know we were legal lines are drawn but in his head

1732
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,224
He is

1733
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,248
And that's important

1734
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,320
That is a big chain

1735
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,976
He's not a part of you never was

1736
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:29,376
I don't think I've ever heard him say would you like to advise

1737
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:35,520
I spoke to rent on the show

1738
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,848
That's f***** up that's f*****

1739
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:41,152
15

1740
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,176
The evolution

1741
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,200
Completely

1742
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:45,760
Taken place

1743
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:48,832
He's now in Trump campaign I've two more clips

1744
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:50,880
To play before we get out of here for this invest

1745
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,672
The first one

1746
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:55,488
The second one is a f******

1747
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,256
Huge

1748
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
F******

1749
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,376
But the first one

1750
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,680
Alex Jones has an interview with Seymour

1751
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,704
On this episode

1752
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
On the 3rd

1753
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,008
Hirsch

1754
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:10,848
Disgusting the past is often been tricked by fake

1755
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:11,616
Intelligence

1756
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:13,664
Sourcing issue

1757
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,504
Is also broken some massive stories can't take that away from me

1758
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,344
He's the one who when he's talking is like I don't have to tell the truth

1759
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,648
Well

1760
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,976
Right he hides a little bit of that the context of

1761
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,048
But he's made behind

1762
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:31,840
And idea that like when I'm speaking

1763
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:32,608
Can fudge

1764
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
In order to protect

1765
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,424
Information

1766
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,984
Doesn't hold water

1767
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,008
Course not

1768
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:41,056
They have an interview

1769
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,872
Really what I think is

1770
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,896
Is Big scoops

1771
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:47,456
Listen big journalistic accomplishments

1772
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:51,552
I think he might be now at the point where he believes a lot of nonsense

1773
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,856
And the might be crazy

1774
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,928
And here is the clip I'm going to play from

1775
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,488
The interview that they have that leads me to believe

1776
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,024
That this dude might be

1777
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:02,816
Well

1778
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:05,888
Remember the president is the current president joke that

1779
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:11,264
If you know his daughters are getting to be dating a charmila humor

1780
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:14,848
It was one of these annual

1781
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:15,872
Needing prayer

1782
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:19,456
Given the White House Correspondents Dinner

1783
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:22,016
Which I think is Scandal

1784
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:25,088
Like to see which guy can be at their table

1785
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,904
Minnesota Vikings

1786
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,672
Come by

1787
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,720
You have

1788
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,000
Diver watch

1789
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,304
Funny they're dating his daughter

1790
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,096
Very attractive

1791
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,376
Women

1792
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:40,960
You better watch out because you can always say the schedule Jones Friday

1793
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:42,240
I thought that was

1794
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,544
You kidding me

1795
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,824
You know that

1796
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:48,128
Best over the line themes to me

1797
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
Okay

1798
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:58,880
Is troubling because about the fact that he has the power of life

1799
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:01,952
Life and death over innocent people exercise

1800
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,000
But in that context

1801
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:08,608
F*** off Seymour

1802
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:13,984
It is true that our president

1803
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,800
Literally orders extra. Extra.

1804
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:19,360
Judicial today

1805
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,152
I don't know what it is

1806
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:22,944
Listen

1807
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,224
It's Gallows humor

1808
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:28,320
Ecstatic

1809
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,392
Look

1810
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,440
Correspondents Dinner

1811
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,024
Is always hosted by a comedian

1812
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,048
I don't understand

1813
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,072
There's a lot of

1814
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,864
Comedy that takes place

1815
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,656
At The Correspondents Dinner

1816
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:45,984
Also

1817
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,288
Okay Aiden right

1818
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:54,176
Probably absolutely Hasbro

1819
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,456
He's not a comic

1820
01:37:55,712 --> 01:38:00,832
I know that's what I'm saying he didn't write that cuz he didn't even write the joke

1821
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:03,392
Do you know you don't think that's actually a negative

1822
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:08,000
Know every president is

1823
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:14,400
You're going to have to call you later if you're not Obama

1824
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:20,800
Timer doing

1825
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:27,200
All over again

1826
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:27,968
Why would I do that

1827
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:34,368
Because you're a mistake.

1828
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,976
The thing that I I'm getting Atmore is it Seymour Hersh

1829
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,256
Is taking

1830
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,560
Very clearly a joke and being like this

1831
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,864
This is very unprofessional

1832
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,400
No

1833
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,960
You're not telling a joke has not improved

1834
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,240
You're not you're not

1835
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,008
Serious

1836
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:56,128
You're not a serious investigative journalist if that is something that is holding you up

1837
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:03,552
I mean call Dad narrative recall that criticism at the time

1838
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:06,880
Also a selfie

1839
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,416
Glenn Greenwald

1840
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:11,232
Take on it as well acupuncture exactly

1841
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,280
I'm not playing

1842
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:17,888
Glenn Greenwald doesn't have his Seymour Hersh moments

1843
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:20,704
But he's also broken some huge stories Olive

1844
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,472
Seymour Hersh

1845
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,496
Reality winner

1846
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:26,592
Yeah

1847
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,920
That you make about

1848
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:32,480
Drone strikes not being a laughing matter

1849
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,248
Is valid

1850
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:35,808
Seymour Hersh

1851
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,832
This complaint is not

1852
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:38,624
So anyway

1853
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,184
And this

1854
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,488
Steam

1855
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,512
Alex Jones

1856
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,560
Entirely in Trump's case

1857
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,888
Put the mic down for this clip because

1858
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:53,216
He accidentally says the truest s*** I've ever heard

1859
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,800
At the end of this December 30th episode

1860
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,848
And this is such a bummer

1861
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,248
I guess Brothers

1862
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,344
Wonder why

1863
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,232
He's on a journey getting more sophisticated

1864
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:17,536
That's not why

1865
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:18,304
Trump

1866
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:25,984
Then

1867
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:26,752
I've been cool

1868
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:34,688
I think Trump should be dangerous coronavirus I think Trump is a wild man

1869
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:39,040
Definitely a dumb person

1870
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,672
Loyalty

1871
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:46,720
Sociopath

1872
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,304
Rules

1873
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,096
No

1874
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:54,912
Royalties

1875
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:57,472
Live in squalor

1876
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,008
No

1877
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,056
That's not what loyalty is

1878
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,592
That's our loyalty is

1879
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:05,408
Nope

1880
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,272
Are you sure

1881
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:15,648
I think that you could make an argument that it is but I think it's a little soft

1882
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,440
And it's unnecessary because

1883
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:23,840
Let's stretch when you don't really need to go that far

1884
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,608
Is like that's

1885
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,376
Loyalty

1886
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:30,240
Is it is not an ingrained desire not to live in squalor

1887
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:35,872
Sorry stuck in sentence I've ever heard is Trump's real or I've been fooled

1888
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:38,432
And I don't get fooled very often

1889
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:39,456
When we have

1890
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,248
A long history of him

1891
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,808
Just kidding.

1892
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:52,000
Like if you really break down one of the one of the parts of logic

1893
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,024
I'm studying logic

1894
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,560
Is that true

1895
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,096
About truth preservation

1896
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,888
That's what the main emphasis

1897
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:58,912
Sentential

1898
01:41:59,168 --> 01:41:59,936
Predicate logic

1899
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:02,752
So whenever you have a sentence

1900
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:06,080
That hasn't it when you have a disjunction

1901
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,872
We have a or b

1902
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:09,920
That sounds is always true as long as

1903
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,712
Is one of those things is true

1904
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:15,040
Both can be true but as long as one is true that babies true

1905
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,088
Trump is real

1906
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,624
F******

1907
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,160
You better believe it that's

1908
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,696
So sad

1909
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,488
It's so sad

1910
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:25,280
Alex is so dumb

1911
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,304
Is that

1912
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,328
Ultra

1913
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:35,520
And they were all fooled

1914
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:41,920
The people have been fooled by different Republican comments are going to make the middle

1915
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:47,040
Classic splode Riggins voodoo doll

1916
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,064
Stupid

1917
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:51,136
The people who fooled by Rick by f****** Mixon

1918
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:53,696
Stupid every single one of these f******

1919
01:42:53,952 --> 01:43:00,096
People has been stupid. Food multiple times

1920
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:05,984
You're right Alex's number two

1921
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,032
It's always a bigger idiot

1922
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:09,824
F****** bummer

1923
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:13,408
Where we are in this investigation

1924
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,944
We jumped ahead

1925
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:15,968
We found it

1926
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:17,248
We found the point

1927
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:19,296
The hinge and the jump off

1928
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:23,136
Yeah this is where it gets very real

1929
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:27,232
Even though you still

1930
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,328
Dumb

1931
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,864
Still not crazy

1932
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,424
Or he's crazy but he's not that crazy

1933
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:38,240
He's not the crazy he's not Unleashed

1934
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:42,080
I'm so we will pick back up the investigation

1935
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:44,128
At least for the next couple months

1936
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:46,432
Barring a nuclear winter

1937
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:50,016
We will pick it up at the beginning of 2016

1938
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,320
See what happens

1939
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:56,672
And see where we go in this second phase of the investigation

1940
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:58,976
Now that we when does Alex lose his mind

1941
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,256
We've figured out

1942
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,304
But he joined up with Team Trump

1943
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:04,096
Out of ego

1944
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,888
Because he thinks he's a part of it

1945
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:09,472
Because he's being lied to by Rodger Stone and Steve

1946
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,776
And because

1947
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:21,248
I don't think I don't think anybody in the world

1948
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,528
Quite frankly

1949
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,552
Any journalist

1950
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,600
Anybody who covers

1951
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,928
Outside of you and me

1952
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:35,328
Listen to all of our episodes anyone understands this nearly as fully as we do

1953
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:39,168
A lot of people think likewise

1954
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,448
They're both bigots

1955
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:44,544
And there's some truth to it we originally thought we thought

1956
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:45,568
Bigotry

1957
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:48,640
Money and what

1958
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,432
I thought sure.

1959
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:51,200
For sure

1960
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:55,296
I mean there is all those things are little tiny pieces of it but I don't think

1961
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,576
I don't think

1962
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,880
Are people outside of the knowledge fights

1963
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,416
We are really get the

1964
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:05,792
The event also just be Celestial body play

1965
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:08,096
All These Little Things add into it

1966
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:10,912
But the things that are the most important are Alex's

1967
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,936
Ego and Russia

1968
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,520
Barber

1969
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:19,104
I wish more people understood that but now what's most important to us

1970
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,128
Is figuring out where he

1971
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,408
She forsakes all out

1972
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,688
And becomes

1973
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,968
Only about Trump

1974
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,760
Because at this point

1975
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:30,624
Still talking about you still talking about that how we scared about his kids

1976
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,464
It'll probably still always be there at what point

1977
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:39,328
Is it like until it does

1978
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:41,632
She say f*** you Ted Cruz you're not smart

1979
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:42,400
Yeah

1980
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,424
Is it just one

1981
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,496
We got to find out

1982
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,800
So that'll be the next stage of this investigation

1983
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,176
Alright

1984
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,088
Do you think we make it out of this

1985
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,368
You and I

1986
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,160
No I mean like just

1987
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:05,952
No

1988
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,232
I don't see anyway

1989
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:13,632
Like I know it seems every generation thinks the world is ending

1990
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:18,240
Parallels between this and the Civil Rights Movement

1991
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,520
Not

1992
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:20,544
Regards

1993
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:22,336
Certain

1994
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:28,992
Spray different Charles Nelson

1995
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:30,272
Riley didn't become private

1996
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,832
That's true or someone else on Match Game

1997
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:37,184
You don't like 80 and it didn't you didn't end up with Richard Dawson

1998
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:43,584
Is he at least I kissed all the women

1999
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,864
Dawson was a bigot

2000
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,656
And became president back then

2001
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:53,056
Then you'd have an argument for every generation feels like shift going south

2002
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:53,824
Sounds of life

2003
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,152
Where are

2004
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:03,296
Rex Tillerson said that we are talking to North Korea and our president went on Twitter to say

2005
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,832
Don't worry about it

2006
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,368
We'll take care of it

2007
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:09,184
Is own Secretary of State

2008
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:09,952
It's not good

2009
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:18,144
How do you even deal with that

2010
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:22,496
You know you talked about normalizing Behavior but that's f****** outside of anything

2011
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:26,592
If I had to give my process that it's still eluded

2012
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,616
It's wild

2013
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:30,176
8 minutes of subjugation of your own past

2014
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,712
Decision

2015
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:35,040
The layers of like what are you fighting against

2016
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:35,808
Cuz it's clearly

2017
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,856
Yourself on some level

2018
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:44,256
Shadow Boxing with all sorts of weird things

2019
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:47,584
I think that he like one of the things that Alex Jones got

2020
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,376
Sing now in 2017

2021
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:52,192
Doesn't really matter it's the movement

2022
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:54,496
If Trump goes out

2023
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:57,056
Then we still have our movement

2024
01:47:57,312 --> 01:48:00,640
Yeah I think there is some truth to that I'm obviously Trump has to go

2025
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:01,408
He is

2026
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:05,248
Destroying everything in his path and he is a National Disgrace

2027
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,296
But at the same time

2028
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:09,856
Your question are we

2029
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:10,624
The Earth

2030
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:12,672
Your question

2031
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:14,208
Are we going to make it out of here

2032
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:15,744
That sort of thing

2033
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,792
Yeah I think there's a chance

2034
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,072
But it

2035
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:20,096
Contingent

2036
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:23,424
On people understanding what the actual battle is

2037
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:25,728
And I don't think a lot of people are

2038
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:30,336
Because I think there's a lot of people who are still hung up on this idea

2039
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,640
Republican vs Democrat

2040
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:38,016
Very right.

2041
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:39,040
Because a lot of

2042
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,064
Direct action

2043
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:43,136
Is really required in order to preserve a lot of the right

2044
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,672
And protect a lot of dis

2045
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:45,696
Franchise people

2046
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,744
So I don't think they're doing anything wrong

2047
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,072
But I do think there is a greater awareness

2048
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,632
To be in the Public's mind

2049
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:57,728
That we are coming up on

2050
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:58,496
And

2051
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:01,312
Unfortunately might have already entered

2052
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,616
What will be

2053
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,408
A make-or-break

2054
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:07,200
Moment for civilization

2055
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:10,528
And I don't mean this to sound like Alex Jones

2056
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:11,808
But it might

2057
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,368
And he related to me unpack what I'm trying to say

2058
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,672
Throughout our history

2059
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,464
We've had

2060
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:21,792
Not just America

2061
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,072
Human history

2062
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:26,400
Sure maybe can't go all the way back

2063
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:27,168
Rihanna

2064
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,448
We will born

2065
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:32,288
Is this your Attenborough impression

2066
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:35,872
Publix throughout history we've had a lot of different versions of

2067
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:37,152
Social

2068
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:39,200
When you had

2069
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,224
Do you know

2070
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:45,856
More primitive people they had liquid just got this you have matrilineal societies you have some that have

2071
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:52,512
Representation in the underlings to vote for

2072
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:54,816
Some of that are just

2073
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:55,840
Very

2074
01:49:56,096 --> 01:50:02,240
Much like

2075
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:08,128
Alpha alpha male gorilla community

2076
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,432
You have those in the Primitive times

2077
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:12,480
Monarchies

2078
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:18,368
A lot of that has gone away and like towards representative democracy that's how.

2079
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,648
Gorillaz

2080
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,416
Right

2081
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:22,208
Just get rid of them

2082
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:25,792
I understand

2083
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,864
I threw out with

2084
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:32,960
The representative democracy is but a common sort of

2085
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:34,496
Replace most monarchies

2086
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:37,312
And you have like people like we still at the queen

2087
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:41,408
Figurehead it's not there not running thing

2088
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,992
You still have dictatorships around

2089
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:47,552
Do you still have remnants of that sort of monarch

2090
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,112
Breccia

2091
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:55,488
North Korea you have a number of those places

2092
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:59,072
What I think is going on

2093
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,608
If I can be

2094
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,632
Totally blonde

2095
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,936
Is we are in a phase

2096
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,472
Much like

2097
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:11,104
I wouldn't like it it's a 1776

2098
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:13,920
I wouldn't I wouldn't like an inch of that

2099
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:16,480
But I

2100
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:19,296
I think we're

2101
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:21,088
Kierkegaard is belief

2102
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:23,136
Is that the human matures

2103
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:23,904
Through Christ

2104
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,440
He believes that

2105
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:28,000
At various points in your life you have a crisis

2106
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:28,768
Can you grow through

2107
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,328
Like one of the crazies would be separation

2108
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:32,096
Fromjapan

2109
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:34,656
Right and then you you have it

2110
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,192
Terrible. Of time

2111
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:39,776
Where you're freaking out and then eventually come out the other end of it and you mature

2112
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:41,312
I become more of a whole person

2113
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:44,128
I think that what we're seeing right now

2114
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,152
Is possibly

2115
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:47,456
A crisis of democracy

2116
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:49,504
I think we're seeing a crisis

2117
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,528
Capitalism

2118
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,576
I didn't receive those systems

2119
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:56,672
Are not working anymore in the same way being a child

2120
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:58,720
And having your parents take care of everything

2121
01:51:58,976 --> 01:51:59,488
Doesn't work

2122
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:00,512
At a certain point

2123
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:01,792
And I'm not saying

2124
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:02,560
Is a condemnation

2125
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,584
Welfare

2126
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,400
Or any of that sort of thing I actually think

2127
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:09,984
But I think they were coming to a point now and

2128
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,776
Who knows when it'll bubble over

2129
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:12,800
But the crisis

2130
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:13,824
We have to

2131
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:14,848
Come up with something

2132
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,152
Capitalism

2133
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:18,944
Late-stage that we're in now

2134
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:19,968
Doesn't work

2135
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:23,040
It's exploitative and it kills everybody

2136
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:28,416
But it's more aggressive than adorable

2137
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:33,280
It goes like this is a

2138
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:36,096
Marauding cannibalistic system that is going

2139
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:36,864
Destroy every

2140
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,424
We're seeing the democracy

2141
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:41,216
Representative democracy

2142
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:43,264
Wild Wonderful and ambitions

2143
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,544
Very clearly

2144
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,360
Converted

2145
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:48,384
Unchecked

2146
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:49,664
Totally

2147
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,944
Because the people who have

2148
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,784
Tons and tons of the economic power

2149
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,576
Find it very easy to

2150
01:52:56,832 --> 01:53:00,416
Gerrymander for example

2151
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:01,184
Don't have it

2152
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,720
And so I think

2153
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,488
That

2154
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,536
This is one of the

2155
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,560
Wanda problem

2156
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:08,352
I'm not certain

2157
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:10,144
The Democratic Socialist

2158
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:11,936
Are the right one

2159
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:13,472
I'm not sure

2160
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:15,008
They intrigue me

2161
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:15,776
As

2162
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,592
What sounds like a better idea

2163
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,384
And I've looked into them a bit

2164
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,664
Centrist

2165
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:24,480
No this is Dan be cautious

2166
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,552
Cautious River

2167
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:31,904
I think probably to implement a lot of their ideas

2168
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:32,928
I think that

2169
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,464
Does create a better world

2170
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,256
I think that's probably true

2171
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:37,792
But I don't know if it's enough

2172
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,328
Because right now

2173
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:43,680
His forces that are against the progress

2174
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:47,264
They're against the coming out the right end of growing pain

2175
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,056
It's like

2176
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,336
Alex Jones

2177
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,616
Donald Trump

2178
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,152
Russia

2179
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,688
All of these figures

2180
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,480
In many ways

2181
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,016
They are the child

2182
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:00,064
It doesn't want to get out of their parents house

2183
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:02,368
Ffi

2184
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,392
Seems

2185
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,440
They are the people who want

2186
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:07,744
Cole they want harsh capital

2187
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:09,536
They want this

2188
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:11,328
Cruel brutal system

2189
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,608
To stay in place

2190
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:15,936
A bear

2191
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,728
Trying to stop us

2192
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,264
From successfully come

2193
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,288
Completing the crisis

2194
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,896
I would say the crisis already

2195
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:28,736
And I think we're at the point now where is

2196
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:32,576
It's very strongly disagree I think we're still made prices

2197
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:38,976
I disagree I think we are I think or we are past it and now we have event

2198
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:41,280
When did it end

2199
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:44,096
I would say it ended in 2008

2200
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:47,168
I would say that all of this is

2201
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:48,704
Is ultimately a reaction

2202
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:52,544
Iran deal

2203
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:55,104
No it's a reaction to

2204
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:55,872
Reagan

2205
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:59,456
Beginning to dismantle the New Deal

2206
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:01,248
Which is what allowed

2207
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:02,528
The oligarchs

2208
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,320
Consolidate so much power and such

2209
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,088
Such a small

2210
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:06,368
A group of people

2211
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,160
And then it was in reaction

2212
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:12,768
2080

2213
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:13,792
Right

2214
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:14,560
LabCorp

2215
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:15,840
People still further

2216
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:18,656
I agree all the games all of the games

2217
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:23,776
Since 2008 have gone to the wealthy but crisis Point pass

2218
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,056
Now we're in

2219
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:28,640
We're in very narrow pathway hypothesis

2220
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:31,200
Or if it is blood I posit that that's

2221
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:31,968
The beginning of

2222
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:32,736
Of the crisis

2223
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:36,320
Okay

2224
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,600
I don't think that's

2225
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:38,368
The end of it

2226
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:42,720
I think that's the beginning of when something new must

2227
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:43,488
To be birthed

2228
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:44,256
Right

2229
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:48,096
So I look at it

2230
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,912
Weird spitballing here this is not like

2231
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:52,192
I don't have

2232
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:55,520
I don't have a degree in predicting things

2233
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:59,104
Whatever we're we're talking about our ass to ascertain

2234
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,664
Dum-dums in Chicago

2235
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:04,224
I do I choose to look at it is

2236
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,760
That is the MoMA

2237
01:56:08,576 --> 01:56:09,344
Capitalism

2238
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:11,392
And the oligarchy

2239
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:16,512
That we have in our own country was a step too far

2240
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:18,304
And something needed to be done

2241
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,608
Right and the beginnings of

2242
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:21,888
The crisis

2243
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:23,424
Came into effect

2244
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,984
You choose to look at it is the end of a crisis

2245
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:28,288
And I would disagree I would say that it's

2246
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,824
The end of when

2247
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,872
A crisis coming could be ignored

2248
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:34,688
I respect that

2249
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,248
And I can see I can see where you're coming from

2250
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,552
I'm going to look back at

2251
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,600
The Great Depression

2252
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:44,672
And all of the people who starve to death and died back

2253
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,208
That was the price

2254
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:51,072
Collapse but was the crisis

2255
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,120
No end to get out of that

2256
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:54,400
FDR Institute

2257
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:58,752
Strongly disagree I don't think that is I don't think that was a civilizational crisis

2258
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:02,080
If I think that was a crisis with capitalism

2259
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:03,104
That's my that's

2260
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,384
Kind of my point

2261
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,664
Okay

2262
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:06,432
That was some

2263
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:07,712
Something that can be grown

2264
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:13,088
Herbert Hoover's disastrous response to

2265
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,160
And so

2266
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:16,928
Through

2267
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:17,952
Democracy

2268
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:19,488
We did a beta

2269
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:21,280
Even though

2270
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:24,608
The stripped-out by

2271
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:25,632
The same oligarchs

2272
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:29,728
I think we're dealing more along the lines of

2273
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,544
Old-timer

2274
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,312
Monarchy

2275
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:35,616
A much larger

2276
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:36,896
Where in

2277
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,176
I've the

2278
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:38,944
The monarchs

2279
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,712
Controlled everything

2280
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:42,784
Sooner or later they treated their people poorly in

2281
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,064
That they started robot

2282
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:45,856
Yeah that Rebellion

2283
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:47,136
Always ended with

2284
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:48,416
Blood or surf

2285
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:51,488
Pretty much where I think we're at right now

2286
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:53,280
Well that will be the end of the

2287
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:58,144
Your argument that the crisis ended in 2008

2288
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,912
I don't buy

2289
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:03,264
I think the closest we've come

2290
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,568
I'm sure there have been other times

2291
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:07,104
And and maybe even

2292
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:10,432
I mean you could look at the beginnings of like workers right

2293
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:12,224
And the unionization

2294
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,760
And stuff like that

2295
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,296
Temperature

2296
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:16,064
To shift things

2297
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:16,832
Entirely

2298
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:19,648
But I would argue that still living

2299
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:21,184
Existing framework

2300
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:27,840
And just trying to gain power for the people within it the possibility of destroy

2301
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:30,656
Bring your world right entrance of worker

2302
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:35,008
The stakes are so much higher in the same way that I

2303
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,032
Describing the

2304
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:39,360
The feudal listed the feudal system

2305
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:41,152
In older Europe

2306
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:44,224
And then we're literally

2307
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:49,344
Life-or-death if if the castle is if the Monarch Falls

2308
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:52,416
You're going to then be taken over by your neighboring

2309
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:54,720
That's the type of

2310
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,256
Who sings we're dealing with in which

2311
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:58,048
America is going to

2312
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:58,816
Fall

2313
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:01,376
Yeah and that's that's all

2314
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:03,424
That's why the crisis happening

2315
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,192
2008

2316
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:08,288
Because that was the moment we're really we could have stopped America

2317
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:09,056
Falling

2318
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:12,896
V just inertia of History

2319
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:14,176
End of the way

2320
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,456
People working the way

2321
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,224
Generac

2322
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:17,760
That's the way it's going to go

2323
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:19,808
Well that with

2324
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:22,112
Climate control with climate change

2325
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:24,672
National disasters that are going to

2326
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,696
Multiply

2327
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:27,744
They're already so bad

2328
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,536
Can't really deal with them

2329
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:30,304
ShopRite

2330
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,584
I don't like

2331
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:32,864
How is it

2332
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,680
Why aren't people in Puerto Rico rioting

2333
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:37,216
Cuz they're on a Nile

2334
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:43,872
Under hungry imagine 3.6 million people in Chicago Chicago

2335
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:46,432
All of us are left without homes or power

2336
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:50,016
Wego

2337
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:52,064
We go somewhere to start

2338
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:55,392
We go to Gary Indiana to buy guns

2339
01:59:55,648 --> 02:00:01,792
A raid

2340
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:05,888
Porto shop

2341
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,704
But I think I think what you're saying

2342
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:09,728
But

2343
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:12,032
Thing that I would put on it

2344
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:14,080
I don't think

2345
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:15,104
That

2346
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:18,176
Throughout our our illustrious history

2347
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:20,224
There has been a time

2348
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:23,296
When it's been abundantly clear that we need

2349
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,576
To change everything

2350
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,904
Except for the 60s

2351
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:28,672
Enderle 7

2352
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,976
I believe that was a time

2353
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,512
Social movements

2354
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:33,280
Was towards

2355
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:34,048
Throwing out

2356
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:35,840
Baton of s*** that was unnecessary

2357
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:38,656
And making a fundamental shift

2358
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:39,936
And the way that ever was

2359
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:41,216
Everyone lives

2360
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:44,288
And forcing it but like making

2361
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:45,568
Making

2362
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,896
A foundational different

2363
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:49,920
As opposed

2364
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:51,456
Changing something within

2365
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:53,504
A system making a new system

2366
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:55,040
I don't think we finish

2367
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:57,600
Everybody who is

2368
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:59,392
Kilt right and I don't think

2369
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:05,792
I think I was Martin Luther King jr. RFK and Fred

2370
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:08,352
You're going to

2371
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:10,656
Yeah and you end up with math

2372
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:15,264
The distance disillusionment the first

2373
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,288
Attempt at Accra

2374
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:17,824
The first

2375
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,360
The temp to the crisis of growth in

2376
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:20,384
It was held at Bay

2377
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,152
Held back

2378
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:24,224
And now I think it's bubbling up again

2379
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,760
We're going to

2380
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:26,784
Seeing what we have been

2381
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,064
Like I said

2382
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,368
I think the Democratic socialists are a big

2383
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,136
Piece of this

2384
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:32,160
Attempted

2385
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:33,696
To do some of that stuff

2386
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:34,976
That was done

2387
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:35,744
In the

2388
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,024
The sixties and seventies

2389
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:38,816
On a more organized front

2390
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:40,608
And doing it without

2391
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,144
Flowers in Your Hair

2392
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:43,680
Hippy dippy nonsense

2393
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:46,240
All that stuff that everyone attacks

2394
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:49,056
And this to me is the Azan

2395
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:49,824
Sense of what I'm getting

2396
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:50,848
I think

2397
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,664
We stand

2398
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,200
Rip

2399
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:57,504
A past example of what happens if

2400
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,272
If this doesn't work

2401
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:00,320
And that is

2402
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:01,344
Nixon

2403
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,112
Reagan

2404
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,392
That sort of

2405
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:06,464
That's where we end up going down if it doesn't work

2406
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,744
If people get this illusion

2407
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:13,376
Submitting and ending up pretty disappointed in we have the pasta

2408
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:14,656
But we've gone down since

2409
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,216
There is

2410
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:18,752
A force that wants that

2411
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:19,776
And that is Alex

2412
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,312
That is

2413
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:22,592
That is

2414
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:23,360
Be alright

2415
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:24,640
That is neo-Nazi

2416
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:25,920
That is

2417
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,968
Well and their minions

2418
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,760
It turned

2419
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:31,808
Well no it turns out

2420
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:34,880
These people who are super rich and holding people down

2421
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:37,184
Quite frankly I'll probably thrilled

2422
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:38,464
If people like Alex Jones

2423
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:43,840
Horse they are they absolutely

2424
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,376
Encourage this

2425
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:51,264
Yeah of course they do they would love the neo-nazis paying for Milo yiannopoulos

2426
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,032
Every

2427
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:58,688
Even after everything that has come out about him is come out

2428
02:02:58,944 --> 02:03:00,992
That's because he still

2429
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:04,064
Eddie still angers liberals

2430
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,112
Prescriptive

2431
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:07,136
But I'm going to put it

2432
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:11,232
Like like I said

2433
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:13,280
What amount

2434
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:15,328
More less crossword

2435
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:18,400
And one one way or another something's going to

2436
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:22,240
Crossroads

2437
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:23,776
Look weekend

2438
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:28,640
Look we have

2439
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:30,688
We have

2440
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:31,712
3

2441
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:33,760
I don't know I don't know what to do

2442
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:39,904
Prescriptives

2443
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:45,792
Creating and hilarious and tragic and an

2444
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:50,144
Deal with all these emotions anymore the thing to do is

2445
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:52,448
Herbal Essence

2446
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,216
From

2447
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,520
4050 years ago

2448
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:56,544
What happened

2449
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:59,104
We can we can take one lesson

2450
02:03:59,360 --> 02:03:59,872
And that is

2451
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:02,176
Folk music

2452
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:03,968
So I can change the world

2453
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:07,808
Is avoid dissolution

2454
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:09,856
Avoid the

2455
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:13,184
If some positive leader gets killed

2456
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:14,720
Don't let that stuff

2457
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:17,280
Don't think that means that the world is

2458
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,072
Because I

2459
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:19,840
Do think

2460
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,120
Vet in the

2461
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:22,144
60

2462
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:24,704
There been less

2463
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:26,496
Investment

2464
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:28,544
People as singular figurehead

2465
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:30,336
Right then there would have been

2466
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,664
Stop would have been followed through a lot better

2467
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,200
The great man theory of History

2468
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:36,992
No

2469
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:38,272
Beyond that

2470
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:41,856
We must fight

2471
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:46,976
We must fight them on the

2472
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:47,744
Yeah

2473
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:54,912
Ultimately what you are looking at it and or or serfdom

2474
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:59,264
Well that's pretty much I don't see any other option

2475
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,824
I think that that is our inevitable future

2476
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:04,640
Unless we successfully passed through the crisis

2477
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:05,920
That was present

2478
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:08,992
To do us fifty fifty years ago and we sailed to growth

2479
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:11,040
I believe that

2480
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:12,064
Society

2481
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:14,880
As a whole failed to growth

2482
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:16,672
I mean we did get Medicare Medicaid

2483
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:18,208
Play past and the Civil Rights Act

2484
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,840
We didn't actually solve the issue

2485
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:28,192
I would like a monster is awesome

2486
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:31,776
Awesome and I'm not taking away from it but I would argue

2487
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:32,800
That's the equivalent

2488
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:33,824
Getting a c on it

2489
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:41,504
Yeah cuz I don't want it I don't want to impugn the Civil Rights Act or anything like that

2490
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,576
It's not the it wasn't the revolutionaries

2491
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:52,000
Upheaval of everything that we need

2492
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:53,536
That I brought that up

2493
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:57,632
Because I do kind of find that to be in a certain way home

2494
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,168
The fact that they

2495
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:00,960
It did do things

2496
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:02,752
It did get stuff done

2497
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:06,592
Look at how many lives Medicare and Medicaid have saved

2498
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,616
How many

2499
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:09,408
The Civil Rights Act

2500
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:12,224
Definitely didn't do everything at f****** needed

2501
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:14,784
But you can't argue

2502
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:15,808
I'm libertarian

2503
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,344
I'll go f*** themselves

2504
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,184
Yeah

2505
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,256
It did accomplish something

2506
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:27,328
And so if you want to if you want to argue that

2507
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,888
Incremental change is possible

2508
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:35,776
Then we'll good example the flip side

2509
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:40,896
The flip side of it is yes it did all this great things but it also came along with

2510
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,176
Pretty much

2511
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:43,200
Perpetual War

2512
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:44,736
So

2513
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:45,760
I don't think

2514
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:47,040
I think they're

2515
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:49,600
You know you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater

2516
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:50,624
As they say

2517
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,416
But at the same time it is

2518
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:53,184
I think

2519
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:54,976
A little bit foolish

2520
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:56,000
2

2521
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:56,768
Think that that's

2522
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:57,792
Progress

2523
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,704
Is completely overhaul the entire

2524
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:08,544
Ideas that we have about what our means

2525
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:11,616
Overhaul the entire idea of

2526
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,712
Capitalism is one of the bigger

2527
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:17,248
Yes problems of this entire

2528
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:21,344
And I don't I don't

2529
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:23,392
I don't know what the answer

2530
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:28,768
Socialism is the right answer but we have now does not work

2531
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:32,864
That's the crisis we Face 50 years ago

2532
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:35,680
And that's that's why I'm saying that it's

2533
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:36,960
It's too late

2534
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:39,520
The inertia of capitalism is such

2535
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:42,080
The only way to actually defeat it

2536
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:45,152
Would be with something that is strong enough to move that office

2537
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,944
And that has to happen

2538
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:47,712
Amelia

2539
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:52,576
I would hope it's the cancer of capitalism has

2540
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:55,392
Exercise so much faster than any of us are really willing

2541
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,160
2

2542
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:56,928
To deal with

2543
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,464
And so it's

2544
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,512
Where are responses going to be

2545
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:01,536
Bernie Sanders

2546
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:04,864
It's still saying you know we need single-payer healthcare

2547
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:05,888
But

2548
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:09,472
What we're going to have to do is fix Obamacare first

2549
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:11,776
And then gradually move towards

2550
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:13,312
Socialized Healthcare

2551
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:14,336
And there isn't time

2552
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:15,872
There's not enough time

2553
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:16,896
Bishop needs to

2554
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:17,920
Go down

2555
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:18,944
Soon

2556
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:22,016
And the only way to organize enough of a

2557
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:23,808
Enough of a

2558
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:26,112
A large enough group of people to do this

2559
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:26,880
Is

2560
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:29,440
I mean eventually through wide-scale anger

2561
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:30,976
Right

2562
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,560
Once you get too far on that we're talking again

2563
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:35,328
About

2564
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:40,192
Cuz it cuz

2565
02:08:41,472 --> 02:08:41,984
I mean

2566
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,520
We live in a

2567
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:45,824
Very very

2568
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:47,360
Build a comfy

2569
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:51,200
It does not build agency does not build

2570
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:54,016
Anything other than the

2571
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:55,552
All cities of the America

2572
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,856
Almost like that some of the messages Alex

2573
02:08:58,112 --> 02:08:59,392
You should have taken from A Brave New World

2574
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,416
Yeah what I thought

2575
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:07,072
And so it's just it's just not going to it's just not going to happen

2576
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:08,096
But I'm the only

2577
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:09,888
The only question is

2578
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:12,448
PowToon

2579
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:13,984
What happens along the way

2580
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:17,056
Cuz cuz

2581
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:18,848
And there's another thing to remember

2582
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:20,640
Go to the runner

2583
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:22,176
In this case

2584
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:24,736
In the sense that

2585
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:26,272
Like the status quo

2586
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:28,320
Get something they win ties

2587
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:30,624
Salute

2588
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,648
Nothing nothing

2589
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:35,488
Inactivity doesn't work

2590
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:37,280
It breeds further inactive

2591
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:41,120
We're rambling here

2592
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:47,520
Or not rambling we're discussing the inevitable end of the world and who thinks it's going to come sooner you take a negative stance on it

2593
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:51,104
Take positive stance I think there is a possibility we grow through it and

2594
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,640
Name something beautiful come

2595
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:53,920
Out but in

2596
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:54,688
In the meantime

2597
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,480
There are growing pains

2598
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:57,248
And blood

2599
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:58,272
Is inevitable

2600
02:09:58,784 --> 02:09:59,808
Serfdom is not nest

2601
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:00,832
Sara Lee inevitable

2602
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:02,368
It is

2603
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:03,136
If we don't

2604
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:05,440
But the Blood

2605
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:06,464
Probably enough

2606
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:08,256
There will be

2607
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:12,352
There will be

2608
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:15,168
There was a retired but let me tell you some

2609
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:18,496
This is the role of his career man

2610
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:19,264
Trump

2611
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:20,800
Daniel Day-Lewis

2612
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:21,568
Wood

2613
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:22,592
Rush that row

2614
02:10:27,456 --> 02:10:30,528
Seriousness that Daniel Day-Lewis well he's got range

2615
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:33,856
Tony's gyro

2616
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:34,880
So

2617
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:38,720
Optimistic stance on at UFO

2618
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,560
The guy who started with

2619
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:47,168
Dreams of headless Koch brothers is going to have a negative assessment of the world

2620
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:49,984
I know and I will see what happens

2621
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:53,056
My doom-and-gloom perspective is

2622
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:55,104
Probably will end up with the tie going to

2623
02:10:55,360 --> 02:11:00,736
We'll be back to where we are again

2624
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:04,576
I believe we will

2625
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:05,344
Climate change

2626
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,112
Say it

2627
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:07,392
2052a

2628
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:08,160
2100

2629
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:09,696
Entire world

2630
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:13,280
Destroyed it's just

2631
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:14,304
Climate change

2632
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,328
That the world is going

2633
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:16,608
Half-alive beak

2634
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:18,656
People are going to eat

2635
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:25,312
The world's going to be fine when we're gone that's the world been around 454 however

2636
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:26,592
Billion years or whatever

2637
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:28,128
To think if we grow through the

2638
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:30,688
The crisis that we're supposed to grow through

2639
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:31,712
We can adapt

2640
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,480
The climate

2641
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:33,760
I mean I mean

2642
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:34,528
Photographer

2643
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:40,928
The runner right everything by Evanescence

2644
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:42,208
I mean I don't know

2645
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:44,768
Time does speeding up a little bit

2646
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:45,792
And maybe

2647
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:50,144
Maybe we don't go through this crisis we have it again in 10 years as opposed to 50 years

2648
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:52,960
Just because of the inevitability of it and

2649
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:55,008
And the increasing pressures

2650
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:57,056
The climate-change putting on

2651
02:11:57,312 --> 02:11:58,080
Yu-Gi-Oh

2652
02:11:58,336 --> 02:11:59,104
Growth

2653
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,920
It's it's possible but

2654
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:03,456
I would like to see

2655
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:04,224
CS go through it

2656
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:05,504
I think

2657
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:07,552
I think that the traits

2658
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:08,320
But you'd like

2659
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:09,344
2cm precise

2660
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:10,112
Is there a thing

2661
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:11,136
Empathy

2662
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:12,160
Things like

2663
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:14,208
Care

2664
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:16,256
That's things like

2665
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,888
I think those are the things you'd like to see

2666
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:24,704
And if we do that that could be

2667
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:25,728
Revolution

2668
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:27,520
Possible

2669
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:28,288
I don't know

2670
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:33,152
But all that can go away

2671
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:34,176
Already loose

2672
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:36,736
All of it real

2673
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:38,528
I will finish

2674
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:46,464
If you want to find out what f*****-up thing Dan is about to say

2675
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:52,864
I might write about it on Thursday

2676
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:58,240
But go to knowledge, all of our stuff

2677
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:02,336
You can also follow us on Twitter that knowledge underscore fight

2678
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:05,664
I've given look us up on iTunes Road Facebook

2679
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:07,712
Leave a review we are of course on

2680
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:13,344
Facebook

2681
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:20,000
Yeah and then

2682
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:21,792
Quite frankly

2683
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:25,376
I think wants to be a fun exploration of Alex Jones being an idiot

2684
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:28,448
Not peddling pedantic theories that I have

2685
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:33,056
About how we can save the world

2686
02:13:33,312 --> 02:13:34,848
Right

2687
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:35,872
I mean

2688
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:38,944
I think these are really the conversations that everybody should

2689
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:40,224
To be having pretty much all the

2690
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:41,248
Time right now

2691
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:42,272
I'd like

2692
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:44,064
If we're going to do this

2693
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:45,344
How are we going to do it

2694
02:13:45,856 --> 02:13:46,368
That kind of thing

2695
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:47,904
Angela

2696
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:50,976
More thoughts about concrete

2697
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:51,744
Steps

2698
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:52,512
Stuff like that the weekend

2699
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:54,304
Can take really helpful

2700
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:56,864
Maybe another show

2701
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:01,216
Yeah go ahead

2702
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:09,152
One guy who has never grown through a crisis

2703
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:11,712
His teeth definitely didn't go through a crisis

2704
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:16,320
Evil guy with a crisis of should I put up this picture and he fails at every single time

2705
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:20,160
50 years ago there was a movement to put up that picture

2706
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:21,696
Didn't succeed

2707
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:23,488
Did not go through that, now

2708
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:25,024
And

2709
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:29,376
What would you

2710
02:14:29,632 --> 02:14:30,400
What would you say to this

2711
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:31,936
You should go f*** himself

2712
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,984
His name is John Rappaport

2713
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:35,520
Jon rappoport

2714
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:43,968
Alex
