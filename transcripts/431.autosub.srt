00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge fight

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Let's sit around and talk a little bit about Alex

6
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
What

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,264
I think for a minute

9
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
Card game partner and I we run out of

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064
Board games

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
Play the little heads up poker 888 whenever you take crazy insane risks and have

12
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,328
No interested but it sure has more than two people

13
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
Quit being Nikki giftisa live together we had a running tally Board of like heads up poker game

14
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,896
It was just so boring

15
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,944
Just don't be able to each other and stuff

16
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
It's hard to play card games between two people sometimes

17
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
The things that you shorten up the game and I like to play Spades and you get rid of everything below 10

18
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
Two people I'm telling you it's great Cards into a hat

19
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
SoundCloud second next week

20
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,312
I guess for me my bright spot we was going to go with the food one

21
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,664
I tried these cookies called a crispy crepes

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,272
And they're like rolled up little mini crepes

23
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,624
So good maybe my favorite thing ever

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
They're very tasty

25
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,048
Not to their small you don't end up eating too many of them unless you

26
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:48,448
Can't stop if you see the whole box of something I do but if you can restrain yourself

27
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,288
It's a really good like little cookie thing that's not too unhealthy and

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
Potassium

29
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,664
Even even if they work small and like

30
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
Reasonably

31
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,856
Acceptable if you're dry and good

32
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
How do you offer

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,976
I've got one more

34
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,816
I wish today wasn't food-based but

35
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
Oh well

36
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,384

How's your 401k

What's the business

Heroin

48
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223

Ida Claire

Infowars

51
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:53,119
Generosity and direct

52
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
Georgia

53
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,823
That would be wonderful as well

54
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,223
Almost a week ahead and believe that we're already into this incredibly exciting

55
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,463
To get the 500 we're supposed to be at about 10 or 10

56
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:24,863
At this point

57
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,703
Been trying to go through the Waterloo Seltzer's

58
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
Waterloo

59
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,895
Dubai water

60
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:46,367
I want to see the Waterloo is a rangy beast of seltzer

61
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:53,535
Watermelon variety coming in 67

62
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:59,167
A lot of black cherry

63
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Nelly

64
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
That gutter really good

65
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
So bad

66
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
There's something wrong

67
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:14,271
Flavored wrong with that Seltzer a f***** up something that it's not good

68
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Chris

69
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Chiropractic

70
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:21,439
It's just water.

71
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:27,327
Is something wrong in the other direction with that Waterloo black cherry and I don't know what it is and I do appreciate it

72
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,423
Also I tried this is hi ball Energy Water

73
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,823
All energy is one of the cans of the other ones is a grapefruit one

74
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Hey there's a vanilla

75
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:44,991
It smelled just like maybe a Seltzer version of a cream soda

76
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391
Terrible I trash 21/100 that's bad

77
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,791
Throw it out the window in this installment of

78
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
The year the South air

79
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:03,167
But that's to be expected and I'm glad you know just middle-of-the-road stuff

80
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,567
Boring not all that exciting I would rather encounter a2153

81
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
Probably

82
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
I believe you

83
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,759
Streams are we will see you again

84
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
Next time I'll be over this album

85
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:25,951
Today we got going is I was looking over our episodes and I realized like 10

86
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:32,351
Episodes straight that we've been in the present avallac'h

87
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
Another Alex Jones episode for this one just be able to cover Friday's episode of a show

88
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,591
They will be able to have

89
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,431
More content to go over a little more more time for things

90
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,247
Now's as good a time as any for a break

91
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
I wanted to see what our old Harry Caray

92
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
Over there was up to talking about aliens and what have you

93
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
Be coronavirus may or may not have been turning Chinese people into vampire

94
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Steel City

95
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,055
That was the working Theory over there

96
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
And

97
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
I don't know if that bread continues okay

98
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,575
What we have today is an interview that Kerry did her most recent episode where she was talking

99
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,391
Tui super Soldier by the name of Anthony Zender

100
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
This is his third time being interviewed on the show and I want to make something abundantly clear before we begin

101
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
That's what we're what

102
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
I know Alex has some thoughts about Sarah's Ender's Game

103
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,471
No one thing I want to make

104
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,287
Is that I don't make fun of Anthony himself

105
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,871
I don't know of what he's dealing with

106
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:53,759
From listening to his first interview with Carrie there was some discussion of him being in a rock

107
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,855
And possibility of some PTSD type of situation

108
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
So I don't want to sit here and beat up on him

109
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
And I'm not going to

110
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
We probably wouldn't cover this too much

111
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
If it weren't for

112
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,119
The way that it's being used

113
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,007
The information that he's presenting and carry is allowing to be presented

114
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,079
You stuff deserves to be talked about

115
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
And

116
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:25,503
I think this is just on the other line of my only this allowed

117
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:31,903
I don't I don't know what it is going on in his world doesn't seem like some of these people

118
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,975
On Project Camelot that I'd be like I'm not even touching this

119
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,815
I still have a lot of empathy for him and I would

120
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
Prefer to err on the side

121
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,167
Of not beating up on him

122
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
But

123
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,823
That doesn't mean that this interview itself is necessarily off-limits there's some teachable moments

124
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
And some things to be learned through it so

125
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,223
Generally speaking of somebody with PTSD is is

126
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
Saying something along those lines I view it blesses them and more is a complete failure of any kind of support structure

127
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
For them to process

128
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
I think there's probably something to that

129
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
So as far as that goes it's a it's a failure of the entire system that

130
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
I'm interested in not him particular

131
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,263
He doesn't seem to be somebody

132
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
Listen to chew these three interviews that he has doesn't seem like he's a bigot or anything like

133
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,991
Eddie page rehab

134
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
So I don't have any like

135
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Vested

136
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,855
A desire to likes

137
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
Knocking down to pay the rent for the third time Ontario

138
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,351
A super soldier expert on Xbox

139
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,751
He just tried silvercraft or whatever

140
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
We're talk about this and be trying walk that line as best we can

141
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,687
Carrie starts at the interview poorly

142
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,271
Because their Tech is working and so she has to call him back

143
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
And try a second time

144
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
So what

145
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
This again so

146
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Everyone

147
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
Camelot

148
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Hi Carrie

149
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Herewith

150
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Xender

151
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Go ahead

152
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Okay

153
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
You know I just

154
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Notice.

155
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
A cutout

156
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
That's what happens

157
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:35,039
There's some Echo there that will go for the first like maybe

158
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,855
20 minutes but it gets resolved

159
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,815
Speaker something I think it's her

160
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:53,215
Because there's no conversation of it but it does fix itself I don't know who's

161
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
And it was

162
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
There was a problem with the recording but you thoroughly that little bit of a knockout

163
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
This dude is a super soldier

164
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,623
Interesting things to consider when we think about that

165
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
The introduction of it's been going on since he was 6

166
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Okay

167
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
I like it

168
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
The past

169
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
And

170
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
See you again

171
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Anthony and

172
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Show again

173
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Haven't seen

00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
My previous enter

00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
You are no other

176
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
I will

177
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Can you carry on

178
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Good to be on the show

179
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Because

180
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Understand

181
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
Super soldier

182
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
Not right now

183
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
Basic free in my life

184
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
I

185
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
The child

186
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
And that was

187
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
What is called operation

188
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
GreenStar

189
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Is the CIA off

190
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
Operation

191
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Children

192
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,791
So they returned the super soldier

193
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:28,191
To the CIA program called operation GreenStar but of course I wouldn't

194
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:36,639
Before I'm there anything

195
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
Government has used for project

196
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
That's the

197
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
Where the PMD Defense Forces use that operation name to do things like in 2019 when they cracked down on immigrants

198
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Suspected of job-hopping

199
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:55,327
The head of that operation Lieutenant Colonel Nelson Rapala Zealand post career that quote

200
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
The operation aim to restore the state's presents provide a community healthcare and evangelize the word

201
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
God

202
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
I like one out of those three ice Motor Service to the

203
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
Earlier in 20

204
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,599
Do you know operation green star

205
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,487
They were believed to have been quotes across the border from Indonesia and used for poaching

206
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,583
No word on if those guns were taken for Evangelical purposes

207
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:34,495
In 2013 a separate operation GreenStar made headlines in India When They confiscated illegal plastic items

208
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,799
They were in violation of their environment

209
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:43,455
Well it's great in North America operation GreenStar was the name given to a closing books Drive

210
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
Help those less fortunate than ourselves

211
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,599
In 1967 at the University of Montreal

212
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,999
A perfect cover for a super-soldier program Dan that's where they drop babies off to

213
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
Adoptive

214
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,935
I can't even really find any references to GreenStar on conspiracy or paranormal sites and what are they

215
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,263
Come up as a site called true vision of peace

216
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,127
And the reference to GreenStar is just in a bio that's attached to an interview they did with Anthony

217
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
Navigate to think of this might all just

218
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
Springport

219
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,807
I'm not entirely sure

220
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,903
So apparently there was a this program

221
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
It was

222
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
The part of a treaty

223
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,863
Date the government did with the Breakaway civilization or something

224
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Explication of that

225
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
Operation green star is

226
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
Is a CIA operation

227
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
That way

228
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
Created to abduct children

229
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
With a certain

230
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Genetic traits

231
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Or

232
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Eugenics

233
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
Bioluminescence

234
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Zacian

235
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
Was

236
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Letting

237
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Demagogue

238
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
When I when I

239
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:17,663
So if I understand this correctly as a government and then there's this Breakaway civilization

240
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,063
Breakaway civilization may as well be called the globalist

241
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
So they're the bad guys in this scenario

242
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
The CIA operation since they were running GreenStar which means that the creation of the secret Superstar

243
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,375
Soldiers with something that was being done for evil ends

244
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,215
This must mean that Anthony is an evil creation

245
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,103
And that all the super soldier has been doing are directed by the bad guys

246
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:53,503
If you really think about that is about the good guys taking control of the secret Superstar

247
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
Soldier program

248
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:01,183
To conclude that he's an instrument of The Darkside

249
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:07,583
He was created in the way people perceived this is but it's not a Frankenstein

250
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,447
Monster was created by explicitly evil doctor Frankenstein

251
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,055
Evil videos dr. Frank

252
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:22,431
Yeah you probably assume that I suppose if we're going to go that far

253
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:28,831
Right so I adjusted that's interesting because he'll talk about some of his missions later on

254
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Hero

255
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
They don't seem to be

256
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,975
Incompatibility with the secret space program

257
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,583
And the CIA Breakaway civilization key

258
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
Do that to me is a little bit difficult

259
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,959
It's not hard for someone to

260
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,359
Across like there's elements within it that are good that's why I was working or something

261
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
It's it's all

262
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:57,503
Whatever that explicitly not loud

263
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
Injection to be very suspect

264
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:06,463
What if you're going to or if you're going to make a treaty wouldn't you doesn't that suggest that everything's on up up above board

265
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
You know you're right.

266
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,071
Yeah but you're not enforceable

267
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:17,471
Eisenhower sign the treaty with the aliens at the Grays could kidnap

268
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,311
People for research and stop it

269
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
There

270
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
So

271
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,527
It's important to recognize as operation GreenStar

272
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
Nations that were done to him

273
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
Okay at the age of 60 since then

274
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,183
He has been some sort of a super soldier

275
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
And

276
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
At 6 years old I was

277
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
You know Devon

278
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Sonic on Military

279
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Terry bases

280
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
And

281
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
You know

282
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Experiments were down on

283
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Government in that

284
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Implants

285
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
You know the one they call the

286
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
Pardon me

287
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
And they

288
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Queen

289
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Turn into a Super C

290
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:06,367
Soldier so he's turned into a super soldier the black do was put into him and so forth

291
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
In Theory been a super soldier

292
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
I just got the black goo

293
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:17,375
He talks about like a some of these missions happening in other dimensions like he's in another body

294
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,215
Or whatever alright

295
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,311
This is explicitly his own body when he was young

296
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Could I support

297
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,895
Because there's two Divergent Paths of these

298
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,199
The super soldier dumb that's going on

299
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,783
That's very hard to make sense of

300
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,183
So are you telling me that they do they remove the implants as the body grows or the implants

301
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
Grow with the body

302
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
I'm sure they grow with the body

303
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:51,167
Set my work on it I would like further

304
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Location of

305
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
Where are these implants

306
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,799
Are around

307
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,639
So every good story like this requires a backstory

308
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,687
Even though you need some sort of a

309
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:08,831
A reason why your lineage is important to be in

310
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,927
And here we get a little hint of that from Center

311
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
As

312
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
A child you know

313
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Grandpa

314
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
What's involved in our

315
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
Ocean system

316
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
And all this

317
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
Baseball bats

318
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
You can talk about

319
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
So if Anthony is saying that his grandfather designed the SR-71 aircraft then he's definitely claiming that is Grant

320
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
Father is Kelly Johnson

321
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
Because that's who did that

322
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,951
Disclaim initially appears to be a good player but upon closer examination actually impossible

323
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,047
The reason it looks good at first is that Johnson was married three times

324
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,351
So you have three possible

325
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:58,239
This offers so many more possibilities for making claims of parentage is opposed to someone who's only married one

326
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,591
But if you read up on Kelly Johnson's life you'll quickly learn that this is no good

327
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,711
Johnson released his Memoirs in 1985 titled more than my share of it all

328
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,783
And in it he discusses the heartache of being twice widowed

329
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
And never having children

330
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
Johnson the designer of the SR-71

331
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,072
And therefore cannot be anyone's grandfather

332
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:29,472
To make these sort of claims credibly he's going to need some really solid evidence Pastor saying it to a woman who believes literally anything

333
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:35,616
So maybe he had a maybe at a lovechild maybe that's government

334
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
Jumped in his

335
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
That's what I'm saying and that's that's why I

336
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
Illegitimate

337
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,136
Child is it whatever

338
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:52,768
Do you need to prove that then cuz otherwise I could just say that I am the illegitimate love child of

339
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
Anybody I want to

340
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,608
Did he actually

341
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
Design

342
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,448
Weave

343
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,848
Well obviously he could have gone through a previous super soldier

344
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Program that we are

345
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,896
Are obviously aware of

346
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
What if

347
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
It's all a

348
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:18,112
Cover-up and Kelly Johnson didn't even design that s*** and it's actually zender's grandfather did it but they

349
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,672
I had to get rid of him because his right you good

350
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
For the super soldier program he has a kid there

351
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
Back in time

352
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,192
Time travel is very heavy in this version of course it is

353
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
I mean sure

354
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,824
You know whatever you could you could come up with any kind of

355
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,944
Sort of Bo sex Machina explanation for how all this fits together

356
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
Sure

357
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,272
That's got to be a

358
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:52,928
So he became a super soldier at 16 formerly before that was

359
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,000
Preparation for it piece of information

360
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,584
They sort of use as evidence that I don't find super

361
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Compelling

362
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
They you know I would

363
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Things like that

364
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Romanian

365
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
And all that stuff

366
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Then

367
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
Be a super soldier 1 hour

368
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
16

369
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Resolve

370
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
When I first start

371
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
Basically my whole child

372
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
Tubi

373
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
A Black Ops

374
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,120
So he claims he had bloody noses

375
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,776
That's some sort of evidence

376
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:46,176
Mistaken him or something for all sorts of reasons

377
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,504
Dry climates picking your nose

378
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,136
Allergies because if there's a ton of reasons people have bloody noses

379
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,160
It is not

380
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,184
Uncommon

381
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,536
So for that to be the case Sookie and so centralized a piece of evidence

382
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,352
He's being taken to be experimented on

383
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
I just I see that and I like that

384
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Not good

385
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:12,288
It doesn't help that doesn't sell me on it I need to know about the graduation ceremony

386
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,176
That's what would get me if you if he gave me a detailed idea of what happened when he was 16 like

387
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
Did he walk up there do they give him a diploma do they put a hat on what happened I want to know

388
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,624
Debate

389
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,160
They stuck it out of

390
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:32,512
I'm not sure is involved disclosure

391
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:37,376
That's what you supposed to be doing right now which is on carries show

392
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Supposed to like

393
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
Get a lot of this information out

394
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
I've been involved

395
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
Working a lot of ice

396
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
Basically

397
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Involved with

398
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Disclosure

399
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
And then bring it out

400
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
Pretty good band

401
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760

00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
FaceTime

403
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Obviously seeing that

404
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,624
You know people are going to want ants

405
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
What's going on

406
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
And I do have

407
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464

Survive that

409
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
And

410
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
I've been

411
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888

412
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424

A lot of missions

414
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Lately

My doing

419
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
Black Ops

420
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
But I'm also

421
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
Involved

422
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
You know like heads

423
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Give update

424
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
And all these things

425
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
Center going on

426
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,136
What is going on right now

427
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Ball is getting

428
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
And

429
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
That's why I work

430
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,888
So for me a little bit

431
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,008
Every time somebody says that

432
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
What's going on right now

433
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:52,128
Cabal is getting taken down

434
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,968
1 assuming that they are totally up or what

435
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,624
There's no other way to say that the cabal is going to take these live

436
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,720
Suck but having meetings with Trump

437
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,536
He said that the cabal is getting taken down right now

438
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
Whoever qanon says is back

439
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:21,056
Alright alright lately

440
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,456
Who's getting taken obviously through this nightclub UE says one

441
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,480
Okay

442
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
Do you have any

443
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
In terms of

444
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
You know about

445
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
What you know about

446
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,488
So rather

447
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Generalities

448
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:46,144
He look you and Carrie are on the same page kicking ass at this interview

449
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Yes p

450
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
I've heard there are

451
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
Going to be a rash

452
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Jose urbina

453
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
However

454
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
We don't really see

455
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
Do you have me

456
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,224
Interested

457
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
I do I do

458
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Because I'm involved in

459
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
In this

460
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
Involved

461
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
You know

462
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Making

463
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,192
People sign

464
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Pelosi

465
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
I've been involved

466
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
Meetings

467
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Where

468
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
I've been involved

469
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
And the Tribune

470
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
I've actually

471
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Been there

472
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
And seeing it going on

473
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Ivibe.

474
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
The courtroom

475
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
Man I knew that

476
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,928
And this is all going on behind the

477
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:48,096
So he has something at being in these tribunals

478
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:55,520
Yeah

479
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,176
And it's basically that what he's describing is dreams he's had

480
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:09,856
Has come to his mind while he's meditating these are describing as real memories and

481
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,696
Experiences and Carries allowing him

482
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
To just

483
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:20,608
Save all of these dreams are real situation where was a competent

484
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,424
Non-abusive interview were talking to this person

485
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,824
You could have a conversation about these really interesting dreams that he's had

486
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
Recovered memory

487
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,456
Kind of language about the CIA

488
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,760
He's he's he's

489
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:44,160
They they wipe his memory or something along those lines in order to keep him from telling even though his job is

490
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Disclosure

491
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,864
I'm confused on on exactly what's going on makes sense but yet

492
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,216
Make him not remember these missions

493
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,264
But your soul remembers

494
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,664
Record themself VIP access like his higher self

495
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,040
To these memories when I dreams they come back or is that kind of thing is definitely in the mix

496
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,088
What do you think you got Nancy Pelosi

497
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:20,256
It's not clear if she's under arrest auto loan now I think it's a confession or something

498
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,304
It'll come back up later but

499
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:28,192
Carrie asked about these memories and mrs. this is sort of like where I'm thinking like

500
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
This is mostly dreams

501
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,520
When you get these

502
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,312
These memories are you getting them

503
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
Because

504
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Initiative

505
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,664
Situation in a

506
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
During the day how to

507
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
Right

508
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,624
Aimm

509
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
I'm so

510
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,400
I do go to sleep

511
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Access

512
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
What they do

513
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
Dream situation

514
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
Amor real

515
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,320
In real life

516
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:22,464
So I mean you can have vivid dreams and there are phenomenon that happened in your dreams where you can have like pretty

517
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
Intricate

518
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:29,888
Elisa Gilbert

519
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,680
Reason to believe that

520
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
You would

521
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,104
I have a dream of making a Pelosi sign something I'd be like I did that

522
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,872
Mystery School

523
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Yeah probably

524
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,456
You can't open your mind to the mystery

525
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,856
That's probably why

526
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:54,464
Like I said I don't want to make fun of Anthony

527
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,816
I do think this is worth discussing for a number of reasons

528
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,864
One of them is because

529
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,008
In this interview you see exactly the same sort of mentality that Alex Jones has

530
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,312
Being presented by this guy

531
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
One of them being

532
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,152
It movies and TV shows are real

533
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
Disclosure movie

534
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
That's out right now

535
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Is a Cold Blood

536
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
And not that

537
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Afternoon

538
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
Vin Diesel

539
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
The whole thing

540
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Soldier is

541
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:27,744
And how they

542
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
Do memory

543
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
Population

544
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
In memory of

545
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
Rachell

546
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,632
To basically

547
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,936
Keep using the super soldier over

548
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
And over and over and over again

549
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
And

550
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
Another

551
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,104
Another

552
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Disclosure

553
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Show is

554
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,200
The dollhouse

555
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:54,112
Do you have these like Sci-Fi movies and TV that are actually telling us the reality

556
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,184
Everything that's going on secretly

557
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,256
Andy has had exactly mentality

558
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
So

559
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,888
He is Alex Jones's believe of what the globalist

560
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
Playing a guitar

561
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,568
I'm coming from Alex Jones it has this air of like I've researched I know all this stuff I know what they're doing

562
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,872
They tell you their plans in the

563
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
In the movie

564
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:23,040
When you hear it coming from this guy who claiming to be a secret super soldier

565
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
It kind of

566
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
Better light

567
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,672
The behavior that Alex Jones man

568
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,792
He's him for Anthony it's far less

569
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,864
Nefarious

570
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
Is also less effective just based on an appeal to Authority kind of situation there because Alex is in control

571
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,616
He's filling the room up with his

572
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,432
So you know he can push that on you and you can

573
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,736
Just kind of accepted into dude

574
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,552
Giving an interview and he's telling me that movies are real

575
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:02,208
Well you're not here in the wrongs to tell me the movies that really does feel that way and the dollhouse

576
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,816
Rough start but ended up going pretty good who's pretty good and I'll Rush.

577
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
Disco

578
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:13,728
Another thing that's really similar to stuff with Alex

579
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,824
Anthony Sanders says that he is in direct communication with

580
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
The president

581
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,384
And

582
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:25,504
He's sort of ideas about what's going on in the world right now are also

583
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
Very very similar

584
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
With Donald Trump

585
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,160
And thanks for

586
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
In guidance

587
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Baton

588
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
He is receiving right now

589
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
And

590
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
I'm also

591
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
I'm also having

592
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
Memory recalls

593
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Mission

594
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
That I'm involved

595
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
On this Earth

596
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,152
Because this is an

597
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Interdimensional

598
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Relaxed

599
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
Star War

600
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
Going on

601
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,672
That's very similar to what Alex believe there's extra-dimensional demons that he's at war with

602
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:09,280
Better behind the globalist in all this shape very very similar

603
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,608
Alex says b

604
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:16,448
Throughout the show I talked to him and he listen

605
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
There's

606
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Very

607
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,032
Very heavy overlap

608
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,568
Between this guy

609
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:27,200
Alex I want to know what they mean I don't mention

610
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:33,856
You just can't see it happening around you right now something

611
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:39,744
There's a world above our world world existing with our world that were incapable

612
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,560
Experiencing

613
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:47,680
Like that's why I'm very frustrated with cuz they all use it like

614
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:54,080
Catch-all and I think they all if they were going to like draw out what it is they mean when they say interdimensional

615
00:34:54,336 --> 00:35:00,480
UT completely different pictures don't do that because if you do then you have to stand by that.

616
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,184
Anthony's Mission largely involves being a spy

617
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Publix

618
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,328
Show

619
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:21,728
It seems like trouble I think he's I think he's been burned

620
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,800
Is Roses by infiltrating evil organization

621
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
Cover God

622
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,664
A little bit

623
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
One of the

624
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
The mission

625
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Recalled

626
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Just

627
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
Because I'm always

628
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
Intuit

629
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Into the dark

630
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
Side

631
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Saying enter

632
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Wichita

633
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,328
People don't know this but

634
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
Which are monarch

635
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
Mobius

636
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
Umbrella

637
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Massive

638
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
And these are all

639
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
Corporations that are in

640
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
And

641
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
One of the

642
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
Mission Zion

643
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
I recalled

644
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Was on

645
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Cuz right now

646
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
Is going on is

647
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
The covid virus

648
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
Ibio

649
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Employed

650
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
You know I'm

651
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
We're calling

652
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
Mission

653
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
Where

654
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
I've I'm involved

655
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Getting

656
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Going on

657
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,384
In these other

658
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Fireplaces

659
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:41,088
Similarities there

660
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
Is the name of the fictional Corporation it was set up to try to kill Godzilla Godzilla franchise

661
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,096
2019 Godzilla king of monsters in the upcoming Godzilla vs. Kong

662
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:56,192
It also factored into the 2017 King Kong movie Skull Island

663
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:02,592
The movie of Corporation is the name of the evil company in the video game The Evil Within which was a survival

664
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,896
Resident Evil Creator Shinji mikami

665
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,480
With the first one released a 2014 and a sequel in 27

666
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:12,832
Umbrella courses evil company in the Resident Evil series

667
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,696
Massive Dynamic was a company founded by Leonard Nimoy

668
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:24,096
Which was kind of looming Specter of evil for the protagonist in the film

669
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:30,496
Ultimate comes from do you know cuz I receive

670
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,944
Anthony is operating as a very similar

671
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,528
There's a fundamental unwillingness to separate reality and fiction

672
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,064
And the lines are really arbiter

673
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,136
Like why not include Viet Industries in there

674
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:53,536
Primatech paper fan

675
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
TV shows

676
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,704
Of all like it was cute too obviously fake fictional companies not real but these are

677
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
Other ones are I don't know who cares

678
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:08,640
I hate it whenever they believe that movies and s*** are real and then they say stuff like biochemical AI

679
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,944
If you believe movies and s*** are real

680
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,784
Has a biochemical AI ever worked out in the end for humans

681
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,368
It always it's always

682
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,184
Why would we make a biochemical AI if they always

683
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,584
Wind up killing I said because the fiction is just predictive programming to make you

684
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
Would never work

685
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:34,752
Fair enough. It's always waiting around is always ways around

686
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,288
So I noticed

687
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:42,688
Whenever I heard Anthony talking about missions that he's been on but honestly sound like

688
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
Some dreams

689
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Basically

690
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
You know when you're at

691
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
A lot of the time

692
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
Found out

693
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
You know your car

694
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
No

695
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Emissions

696
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
Braun

697
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
And I have to

698
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
But but

699
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,400
You know one of the most recent memories was

700
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,960
I was obviously

701
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
And in one of these

702
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Corporations

703
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
Umbrella

704
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
You know they are linked

705
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
DARPA and miss

706
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,896
Reality

707
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
But

708
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
I was involved

709
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
Being involved in the mission there

710
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
And

711
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
I had to

712
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,832
To escape and

713
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
I was out getting shot at

714
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
And I had to

715
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
Getting

716
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,000
And the elevator door closed

717
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
Understand there are all sorts

718
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,584
Through the elevator door

719
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
And

720
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Against the wall

721
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,216
And the elevator door

722
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
And then makeup

723
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
Cut the cord

724
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
The elevator

725
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,336
And then I fell

726
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
Mike Hunter

727
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,128
Stories or something

728
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,408
Because I was in the sky sky

729
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
Android Wear

730
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,248
It basically the elevator

731
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
And I'm I was

732
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
Still alive

733
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Because I was obvious

734
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,624
Body

735
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,672
And I got out of

736
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
Elevator

737
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,488
Agents all around

738
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
People that works

739
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
Now and

740
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
I started

741
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,352
Basically running up

742
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
The size of the wall

743
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
And shooting every

744
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
And then. That's what I asked

745
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
A runners

746
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,336
Doing

747
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:20,736
Let sounds like an action-packed I got a dream

748
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,016
No just

749
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:22,784
Just me

750
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,832
If I'm if I'm one of these

751
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:30,464
Government operation directing spies in the places

752
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
I wouldn't use the guy who's

753
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,072
Describing his own job

754
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:41,472
As my cover gets blown a lot I'm in a recon mission and then I just wind up killing

755
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,288
Everybody haha

756
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:50,688
The smash-and-grab Spy Shop

757
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:57,088
B-2 stealth video game would like that kind of strategy

758
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,136
Attack strategy

759
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:02,976
Yeah it is counter to

760
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:08,608
What the goal is not to kill people

761
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:14,752
Well you want the information and you also don't want the person you're getting the information

762
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,056
Exactly the lever

763
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688
I don't know

764
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
Also that's a

765
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Judgment

766
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
The corporation

767
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:30,880
For sure knows that they're being spied on and all their guys are murdered

768
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Heather just like well

769
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:39,072
Will give you this one bad but keep moving forward plan

770
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,608
They know about

771
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:47,264
Guys back to business as usual my bad my bad

772
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,592
Elevator

773
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
Go to work

774
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:58,527
Isabel newer Super soldiers that apparently we are involved in having created cuz we're the Bad Guys

775
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:03,903
Very complicated I don't pretend to understand but

776
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:10,303
Anyway there is a reason there I'm doing this episode even though like if you just listen to that

777
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,095
Pretty clearly a guy who's

778
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:16,191
Describe a sort of dreams that use interpreting as real

779
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:22,591
And that is something that is addictive of not a perfectly healthy mindset necessarily

780
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:28,991
Which is why I'm trying to dance around this fairly delicately to beat up on this guy I think that you probably

781
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:35,391
Is dealing with something and probably needs to be the target of compassion as opposed to read

782
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:38,975
Ideas are kind of funny but

783
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,791
Only within the context of understanding the

784
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,327
You know he

785
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,863
Did not him or last

786
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,263
No it's like the children of the childcare facility that they're recovered memories

787
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,567
Suggested that the daycare worker

788
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:59,455
Cuz we're satanic satanic satanic pedophiles and

789
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,271
They sent him to jail over forever and it was all made up

790
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
I'm not mad at

791
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,695
The kids they were being manipulated the whole way in a very similar way that Terry is manipulate

792
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:15,583
This guy might actually go back and we'll get into that as we go along

793
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,863
So Carrie wants to

794
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,423
To know about this sort of

795
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,031
Sovereign citizen

796
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,847
In front flags with no gold Fringe on them

797
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
Christ

798
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
Leads to a pretty big revelation

799
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:35,807
That should tell about maybe some of this path started for xender

800
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
You have like

801
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
The last

802
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
What weeks have you known

803
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:41,951
Change

804
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
In

805
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
What's going on because

806
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
That on

807
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
Lately on news

808
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
French's

809
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,775
So are you aware of

810
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,871
Yeah I know there's there's nothing

811
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Going on

812
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
And it's very

813
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Clear that there

814
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
They're trying to

815
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,039
You know in many different ways

816
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Make that clear

817
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
And if

818
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
I've heard

819
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,183
You know the Federal Reserve

820
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Is gone

821
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
You know

822
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,559
Finally got the three Senators out of there

823
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,607
You know they they they switch it over

824
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,423
What I know

825
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
Tubi

826
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,007
Call the nesser on Jessie

827
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
He is happy

828
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Because I've actually

829
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
Memories

830
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,407
I'm being involved

831
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
With a Donald Trump

832
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
In

833
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
The

834
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
The Great

835
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,319
The Hidden City

836
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
And in China

837
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,391
And they're okay

838
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
Nation going on

839
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,719
Celebration

840
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
Obviously

841
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,255
4

842
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,535
Nasir and Jester attack

843
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,631
Which is obviously a whole new change of government

844
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
Happening

845
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,703
We can actually see his half

846
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
With

847
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,775
This martial law

848
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,055
Fildan America

849
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:07,711
So the whole idea about the coronavirus in the covid-19 in a locked out and all this has to do with a hoe

850
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:12,319
New government being rolled out because of neferet and Jesse

851
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:18,719
A good just hasn't heard about this

852
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,375
Their belief system says that gold Fringe around the American flag

853
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,191
Indicates that something is under the control of maritime law

854
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:32,031
And therefore it's all invalid common Sovereign citizen

855
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:39,711
You'll see it whenever their record trying to get out of a fine for driving without a license

856
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:47,647
Tubalcain so I was pretty sure that mess Aurora and Jess Aurora sounded like some kind of an allusion to a Biblical Beast

857
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:54,047
Or something I got that bike pretty interesting and depressing

858
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,071
Jersey stop

859
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,911
Nesseralla is the National Economic Security and Recovery Act

860
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:03,519
Which is something that was proposed by a systems researcher named Frances Barnard

861
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
In the late 80s

862
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:11,455
His basic argument was that debt was holding down the economy and the compounded interest was the greatest factor in the maintenance of that

863
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,759
That that doesn't ethical matter

864
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,879
It was unethical to allow Co-op

865
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,719
I mean it's fundamentally anti-biblical

866
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,279
So there's that NASA red dress run

867
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,583
Pennywise

868
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:33,983
His proposals were never put into law from starting posting a bunch of conspiracy theory

869
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Worries about it

870
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:41,407
Under the screen name actually

871
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,943
Was actually secretly passed

872
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
Every National economics

873
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,903
Security and Reformation

874
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,463
Version of Nazareth

875
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,047
Curtailing the actress supposed to take effect on September 11th

876
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:04,447
2001 911 was somehow done to a verdict or something

877
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Totally

878
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
According to a fantastic article about by Shawn Robinson

879
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,895
Abolishes tax

880
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
Income taxes

881
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:17,247
Forgives mortgages zeros out credit cards and declares

882
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
Peace

883
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:24,415
Except otherwise specified the quotes in the passage passages

884
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:29,535
They all come from Robinson's reporting in advance Tribune fantastic article

885
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,351
The media apparently I'm not allowed to talk about this law

886
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Basketball course

887
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,679
Because there's a gag order in place

888
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,263
That would be punishable by Death

889
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,663
Whatever

890
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:52,063
From the show

891
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:58,463
It's Showtime at the Apollo she gets ripped off of that believes it's an anonymous episode about

892
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:04,863
Are still around so we can get away with talking about it a little bit I saw if need be

893
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,935
Establishment they can't do it

894
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:14,335
Goodwin of Oneness got her start as an anonymous internet

895
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,127
By guy named Clyde Hood

896
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,711
Who did started this thing called the Omega trust in trading Limited

897
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:25,343
You claim to be a high-powered investment Trader and offered people quote units of Omega for $100

898
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
Which would quote

899
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:31,231
Rollover 425 275 days with return

900
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,327
Investors could let it roll again for another 275 days again

901
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,351
50 to 1

902
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,423
After that they could do one more roll but that was it

903
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:46,335
If you do the math hundred dollars into 12.5 million dollars no work involved

904
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,383
How could you not say yesterday

905
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,479
So naturally this is

906
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,527
Just enjoying it

907
00:48:55,807 --> 00:49:01,951
Is dead now but no bituary for him estimated that he ran the scam from 1994 to the year two

908
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,791
I made about 20 million dollars from 90th and Chester

909
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:12,191
Man 2000 to guilty to a bunch of charges in it

910
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:16,543
Anyways that's 240 years in prison

911
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:21,407
Do not give up hope

912
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
Is Omega investment

913
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,759
Even though their payments were never materializing

914
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,855
As the scam was coming to a close and he was veering being arrested

915
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:34,719
The devil Oneness spun Fantastical yards by there was a conspiracy against Omega

916
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,815
And Heather forces including judges who are trying to fight for people to get their money

917
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:42,911
Brooker stories on supposed updates about Hood scam she gained a following

918
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:47,007
Probably mostly of people wanted to know where their 12.5 million dollars was

919
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:52,127
When he was arrested she created a narrative that the whole bus was a farce

920
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,175
And the people needed to keep their spirit I

921
00:49:54,943 --> 00:50:01,087
She posted quotes stay away from the website that has information on this case through!

922
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:06,975
That's a good that's a good way to that's a good place to start if you don't keep information away.

923
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:13,375
Scream don't look at the information I like it will be tracked if you go to that website

924
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:17,471
We avoid any complaints are you going to lose your funding if you do that

925
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:24,127
Review about the Better Business Bureau

926
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:29,759
Investigators had taken claims to be reimbursed

927
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,063
From the money they seize from

928
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,391
Many investors refuse to file refused to even talk

929
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
The government investigators

930
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:42,303
The problem was the internet and the never-ending stream of rumor is led by Dove and others

931
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,863
Omega victims to clam up

932
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,703
Us attorney Steve Sanchez told the News Tribune quote

933
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:52,799
Everybody kept saying I'm told that it's going to pay tomorrow so I'm not talking to

934
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:57,407
We tried to persuade people that the information being put out there was erroneous

935
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
People didn't want to believe it

936
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,319
Good lawyer would even get calls from investors who wouldn't accept that he'd confessed to the fraud

937
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:10,719
Some of these people they just really really believe it acceptable to being victimized

938
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,487
Again

939
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,839
Who's all the load of s*** but it seemed to be some sort of a following

940
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,887
Above one misses work

941
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:23,007
According to her Omega was just one of many of what she called prosperity

942
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,823
Program

943
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:31,711
Apparently these programs were to be put in motion by this nesseralla that she imagined have been passed into law

944
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,735
By Bill Clinton

945
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:39,135
Arabia's by Messer I've been debunked by the guy who came up with the idea in the first place Harvey Barnard

946
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,183
The conspiracies to Sedaka

947
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:45,535
Land has its roots in people for of million

948
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
What Goodwin is done

949
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:53,727
2001's transmuted that human impulse to hold on to hope that their ship is coming

950
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:57,823
Cultish following further south to profit off of

951
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,359
And now it's being attached

952
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,407
Conspiracy theories about

953
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,431
Donald Trump

954
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,223
And that is

955
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
Kush

956
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,295
I got to give it up so she took

957
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,831
Working on this scam

958
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
With another guy

959
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,647
I don't think she was working on it with him

960
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:18,047
And that's something that comes up in this article that's really fascinating alright that because of how large this scam got and help her

961
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,327
Attracted

962
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:25,983
BC working theory around it was as it attracted a bunch of other scammers who wanted to drink

963
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,031
The long way

964
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
But shark

965
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:36,479
Looks like a little fish that clean sharks back that's what it's that's what's going on and if you look at is a microcosm of the

966
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:42,879
Trump Administration fraud going on

967
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,671
People who run Konza like

968
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:51,071
I've got to get a taste of this action by conscious or not that is a phenomenon that I think

969
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,119
See whenever you get too big

970
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,167
Well I mean if you see a bunch of people getting

971
00:52:55,423 --> 00:53:01,055
Frauded you're like well obviously these people are right target audience

972
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:05,663
These people are susceptible to being victimized again because

973
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:11,295
They just want to believe right

974
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,087
You feel like an idiot

975
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:19,231
Really stupid Hood in one of his quotes that really likes stuck out to me was

976
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,815
I didn't realize how big of a liar I was

977
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:27,679
Because you made up

978
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,983
This whole thing

979
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:34,847
There was a point you made a choice you know who really got conned

980
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Me

981
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:42,271
I was the real victim here I conned myself that that Chloe is a little bit of that

982
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:45,343
Mentality and then also a little bit of like maybe

983
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,671
Peking self-awareness have access to

984
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:52,255
Wow you was deluded himself into thinking he was doing something else

985
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,559
And that's fascinating to me.

986
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
This is what

987
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:03,007
Anthony believes is going on with the world today is this implementation of this mess around

988
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
What's Jessie

989
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,871
That's just a new one for Global

990
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,151
Is the same thing

991
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:14,015
It's basically the concept in the idea that we're going towards

992
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:20,415
With Trump and all this is it Google resetting of all economy

993
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,695
To be like

994
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:27,327
You know what shaking off of all debt and everything that everyone's going to be living in wonderful perfect prosperity

995
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,887
It's utopianism being funneled

996
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,447
Okay so

997
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,495
He believes that a man

998
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,287
Whose primary well

999
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,847
Comes directly from

1000
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,383
Property ownership

1001
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,711
Bankruptcy

1002
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,527
Is going to suddenly switch tack

1003
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,367
And Institute a utopian society

1004
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:54,719
Eliminates those things I think it's probably because he believes that

1005
00:54:54,975 --> 00:55:01,119
Trump is being Guided by aliens

1006
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:05,983
If he's suddenly got bleeding help very shortly and we saw a big change

1007
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,007
I'm fine with that

1008
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,031
I'm fine with that

1009
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,847
Right now I'm not a big fan of the pleiadian

1010
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,383
Hey babe been here since

1011
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
The jump

1012
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,479
Nah get melee ATMs out of here bro I'm done with it

1013
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,783
So it turns out that

1014
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:23,903
Anthony is a really big fan of qanon

1015
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,719
Very important to study

1016
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,023
Isn't the idea that

1017
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
Is she definitely

1018
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
Maria's

1019
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,727
One of the people that are going to

1020
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,799
They're actually already

1021
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,591
The thing is is like

1022
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,359
You said earlier

1023
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
.

1024
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
What you heard about

1025
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,479
You know we're kind of

1026
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,271
Society

1027
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,551
Kind of behind

1028
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
About what's really going on

1029
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,159
And in those people that are under no

1030
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
I kind of

1031
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,463
In in more knowledge

1032
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
But they have to roll it out as

1033
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,631
What I like

1034
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,911
I want to talk about

1035
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
Qanon

1036
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,215
And who qanon

1037
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
Chewing on his

1038
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,543
Because

1039
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
That's pretty much like

1040
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,639
People understanding WhatsApp

1041
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
Is Adele

1042
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,455
Thank you Anna

1043
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,247
Qanon

1044
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,807
Even saying this is Zach

1045
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:25,855
Insane

1046
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,135
Because they don't know if I

1047
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,695
Mj-12

1048
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,743
Is the organization m.j.

1049
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,303
Is the government m.j.

1050
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,607
Mj-12 was a credit

1051
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,631
To infiltrate

1052
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,167
What people

1053
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,703
No as the Illuminati

1054
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,239
They're actually not the

1055
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
Because the Illuminati

1056
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,567
Are the ones that actually

1057
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,407
The glove go globalization

1058
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,687
And the odd

1059
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,991
The old world

1060
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,295
Order that was being rolled out it's not a new world

1061
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,831
It's actually an old

1062
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
That has been

1063
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,671
Implemented on Humanity

1064
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:07,583
This leads to a really interesting conversation

1065
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:14,495
Is like a really old school conspiracy

1066
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:19,103
Paranormal

1067
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,199
I know they're not all

1068
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,295
Also this

1069
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,087
He's framing

1070
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:34,207
Most conspiracists call the New World Order the old world

1071
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,303
Illuminati isn't really the Illuminati Illuminati

1072
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,423
Globalization

1073
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,495
I understand what you're trying to say

1074
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:50,335
Okay I understand but you can't just

1075
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,383
Call those things those things

1076
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,711
Because everybody

1077
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,503
You're going to confuse you

1078
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:07,487
Words have to mean things if you want to communicate there's a good problem with reverse branding

1079
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,303
So I think a lot of the ideas

1080
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:16,959
Babe does Ender's expressing a lot of these things are probably have gotten into

1081
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,775
Is subconscious is belief system because

1082
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,311
Engaging in Italiano

1083
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:27,711
Q conspiracy theory is another pretty solid clue of what might be leaving him down

1084
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,527
Having these dreams where he is

1085
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:34,367
On reconnaissance missions against the Umbrella Corporation in Michigan

1086
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:37,695
For sure though I did it makes a lot of sense

1087
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:47,679
So Carrie asked him if he's been dealing with the greys the Alienware

1088
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
Scary

1089
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
K & R

1090
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:50,751
Familiar

1091
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Have you been dealing with

1092
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:52,799
The grey

1093
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,663
Not not not recently B

1094
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,687
Because I mean I'm done with the

1095
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,711
Gray's because that

1096
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991
You know

1097
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,271
Very far back

1098
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
Back in my in my

1099
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,575
I'm like why

1100
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,343
Like when I was 6

1101
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
I'm getting up.

1102
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
Definitely dealing

1103
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,671
Retire

1104
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,463
Beans now because even

1105
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,511
Even now I'm remembering memories

1106
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,535
A being involved

1107
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,839
Soldier wear

1108
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
I'm on fire

1109
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,423
They actually

1110
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
Talking meow

1111
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,751
They they actually had the

1112
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,775
The ability day

1113
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
Ramble to wake me up

1114
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,591
Telekinetic

1115
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,383
And just spin me around

1116
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,663
Throw me against the wall

1117
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
So

1118
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,479
I mean NASCAR

1119
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,247
That's that's that's

1120
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,015
That's what I'm

1121
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
Okay

1122
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,855
Nordx or not

1123
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,927
Don't know their there they're not

1124
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
They're not but they are

1125
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
More advanced

1126
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,279
Right

1127
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
Okay

1128
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,191
Into the Nordic

1129
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,215
All right.

1130
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,519
I think that the nordics are good guys

1131
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:02,943
Right after conception

1132
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:07,295
Racist version of

1133
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,319
Alien white people

1134
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:13,695
Yeah these are the champions

1135
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,719
But yeah

1136
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,999
I've never heard

1137
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:20,607
I don't see I don't see

1138
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:24,959
Zubs

1139
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:29,055
I mean there are indications

1140
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:33,151
Space Program super soldier there's creepers

1141
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:39,295
Part of a treaty that they did with the good guys do enable them to kidnap children

1142
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:45,951
He has been fighting aliens are traditionally on Project Camelot are seen as deposited right

1143
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:50,815
It's complicated

1144
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:57,215
I don't think those were humans that he killed after he fell down that elevator

1145
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,751
Retract my credit

1146
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,591
There is a Carrie doesn't

1147
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,151
Bring up that sort of

1148
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:11,551
Stumbling block the nordics

1149
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:17,439
Testing about him just not straight up to

1150
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:23,839
Instead he then says dealing with the gray

1151
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:29,215
What that to be a euphemism for some sort of bathroom activity

1152
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,519
I would like it to not be

1153
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,567
Disagreement

1154
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:39,967
So Carrie asks about some more qanon stuff the idea that JFK jr.

1155
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:44,063
Crash

1156
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:48,671
Standard JFK jr. selphius leads to a bit of confusion

1157
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,231
Is really telling

1158
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,535
You have

1159
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
Inside knowledge

1160
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,351
Is going on with

1161
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,119
With Trump and

1162
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
Qanon

1163
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,359
Yes

1164
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,383
Yes I do

1165
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,407
I can

1166
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,175
Confirm that

1167
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
That is all

1168
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Everything that's

1169
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,247
What's going on

1170
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,015
Trump

1171
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,039
Qanon

1172
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,063
And Robert Half

1173
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,087
Randy Junior

1174
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
Technology

1175
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,159
And everything

1176
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,183
Is the truth

1177
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,719
Because

1178
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
Basically

1179
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
Actually Robert

1180
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,815
He is not John

1181
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
John John

1182
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,423
Julie died in the

1183
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,215
Supposedly

1184
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
Jonathan

1185
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:44,991
But about anyway

1186
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,295
You're you're talking about

1187
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
John F Kennedy

1188
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,599
Junior

1189
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,879
Talking about yes

1190
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,415
Who supposed

1191
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
Julie died in a plane

1192
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,487
They say now that

1193
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,071
He and Caroline

1194
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,095
His wife

1195
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,679
And he is

1196
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
Working with

1197
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
I have

1198
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,615
And I have

1199
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,175
Not if not believe but

1200
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:14,943
But knowing

1201
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,711
That that is true

1202
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,503
So I mean

1203
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:29,791
From straight the problem is they're both sort of involved in the conspiracy

1204
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:36,191
Junior is the one that does supposedly

1205
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:38,239
Fake his death so we could help Trump now

1206
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,543
Famous people shouldn't die in plane crashes

1207
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,615
It's just a terrible idea is troubled

1208
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
Oh God

1209
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,951
That press conference be amazing

1210
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:04,351
Casino here's my now we realize our opening back up the states as a consolation

1211
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,167
Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper

1212
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:14,079
What working with Trump all along

1213
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:20,479
They didn't stop that song from happening now I want American Pie will never be played on the radio if it's too long to

1214
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,503
Begin with

1215
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,551
Subway

1216
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,111
Don McLean

1217
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,903
My career

1218
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,719
I'm sorry what are you saying

1219
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,279
I've completely forgot which

1220
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:36,863
Tenergy junior is so they think

1221
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,399
JFK jr.

1222
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:43,519
Fake his own death some people believe he might even be the one doing the Tuesday okay

1223
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:50,687
Cute might be JFK jr.

1224
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:57,087
Cute communities about whether or not they believe JFK jr. is alive or not

1225
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:00,159
That sounds foundational

1226
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,231
I just I just hear this stuff inside

1227
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:09,631
He was ready to say the RFK Jr

1228
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,191
There's a confusion to the

1229
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,751
No I'm talking about JFK jr.

1230
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:21,151
Not believe that I know that it makes me think that this is a little malleable

1231
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:26,271
Whatever it is you just said presented as conspiracy

1232
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:32,671
This intersects with sort of more reality and again Alex Jones specifics

1233
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:37,023
Is some of this conversation about the actual covid-19 situation

1234
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,215
So-called

1235
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
Right

1236
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,639
What I know

1237
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
Coronavirus

1238
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,711
Is there are definitely making it worse

1239
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,503
Seems like I

1240
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,527
A starset

1241
01:05:59,295 --> 01:05:59,807
Way

1242
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,831
July debates

1243
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,367
Make more case

1244
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,671
Happening than Iraq

1245
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
And then there

1246
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,255
Blaming

1247
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
That aren't

1248
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
Related to the

1249
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,095
Coronavirus

1250
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,143
Virus

1251
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,423
How to make the numbers

1252
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,191
More

1253
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:16,959
You know

1254
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,727
To make the numbers

1255
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,543
Provide more feeder

1256
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:24,639
That's just it you could hear out

1257
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:35,391
You see a lot of overlap here and it's like wow this is the same thing

1258
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,719
It's the same thing it's just Alex pretends that he something

1259
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,791
We've allowed him to get away with it forever

1260
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,143
I mean I guess I kind of know why

1261
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
That means

1262
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,447
Part of it is

1263
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:55,103
You seem fun for awhile

1264
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,687
I don't know

1265
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,295
It's awful

1266
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:09,439
It really is like it's the tragedy that is at the scale of it

1267
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,487
How many people are dying and

1268
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,279
How they're being

1269
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,607
Push toward that death-like f****** Lemmings in a Disney document

1270
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,823
But we have to look at it you can't deny it

1271
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,943
You can't deny it and that's what it seems like everybody in this circle really wants to do

1272
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,967
Yeah they just

1273
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,247
They just can't look at

1274
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,551
Because in a movie it's fine

1275
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,599
You know it's not real

1276
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:43,999
Right real they have to find a different movie two kind of retreat into yeah I mean that's kind of that kind of thing

1277
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,327
Oh yeah

1278
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:54,495
Dial for all movies to be reality you kind of allow for stuff in reality to be a movie

1279
01:07:54,751 --> 01:08:00,383
Burning of fiction and reality

1280
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,663
Until it's

1281
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,943
There's no blurring it

1282
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,783
They simply both exists simultaneously and you just picking

1283
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:13,183
Can choose whichever one you feel like believing at any given point in time

1284
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:18,559
Coronavirus conspiracies that are being overlapped here

1285
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:22,911
It's not surprising resource

1286
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,447
In

1287
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,519
Pushing this

1288
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,567
In the Illuminati

1289
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,127
Is AI a car

1290
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,407
Call Doug

1291
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,991
And it's basically got

1292
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,551
Vaccine

1293
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,319
Is on there

1294
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:41,855
This is all part of the

1295
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,647
Being rolled out

1296
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,439
It's not it's not

1297
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,463
What it seems to

1298
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:56,959
Spoiler alert I have the Illuminati card game up on my wall wondering if you have that particular

1299
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:03,359
But there's also like a ton of other things like Godzilla is one of the cards

1300
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,151
Why was real

1301
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:11,551
Let's get up and look at the Bigfoot that's one

1302
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:16,671
Broccoli

1303
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,743
Just fine I think soldiers are definitely part of the plan

1304
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:27,423
Moonbase.

1305
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:32,799
Monster monster is going on

1306
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,847
See what else we got

1307
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
No

1308
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:41,247
Clone arrangers they arranged clones indiferenta Xanadu

1309
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:45,599
Xanadu Buffalo real that was actually real we all have to wear roller skates

1310
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,391
It's for the rest of the day

1311
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,183
Are magic

1312
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:52,767
Just just are magic I mean that's wind

1313
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,559
Please call their women

1314
01:09:55,071 --> 01:10:01,215
Yeah I mean sure you can say whatever you want about this fun card game and what have you but

1315
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:04,543
You do you got to recognize what else you're implying

1316
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:08,383
Like all of those other things must also be part of the plan

1317
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:15,039
Those things are put in to make the plan look silly to order a real card is

1318
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:20,671
Universal game

1319
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:24,511
The card game that's Steve Jackson Studios put out

1320
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,071
Is somehow a revelation of

1321
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,607
Of the plans

1322
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:34,751
Scandalous Carrie decides to go to commenters

1323
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,847
Text Vanessa Rose Bowl

1324
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,151
Big shout-out to this commentary

1325
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,951
In my whole life

1326
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
I

1327
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
And reality

1328
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,327
Jesser nsra

1329
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,375
St-germain

1330
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,399
And the grand jury

1331
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
Leanne

1332
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:03,935
And all of that

1333
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,471
I've been involved my home

1334
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,239
Entire life

1335
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
Not only

1336
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,287
Restarting it

1337
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,567
Knowing it's true

1338
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,847
And I see it on

1339
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,407
And in my

1340
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,431
In my reality

1341
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,223
It is it is

1342
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,527
Corsair is Missy

1343
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,295
Information

1344
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,111
You know that you're go

1345
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:22,879
Going to go through

1346
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,159
But in the end

1347
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,183
You you will get

1348
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,719
Manuel

1349
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,743
Actually

1350
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,023
Unbearable

1351
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,303
Do not doubt

1352
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,071
What it is.

1353
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,167
And then I do I do

1354
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
I dunno

1355
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
Through my purse

1356
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,471
Spell memories

1357
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,519
And it

1358
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,543
Information gathering

1359
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,567
Bring that that is

1360
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
What is happening

1361
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,615
I remember

1362
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:44,895
Being involved

1363
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
Is Nazareth

1364
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
So that would be

1365
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,295
They would not want

1366
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,415
Sounds like b*******

1367
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:04,095
You're so like that that there's going to be misinformation and stuff is exactly the same thing we do

1368
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:06,143
It's dead when the scheme was falling apart

1369
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:12,799
Don't look at that other information believe website

1370
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,871
Such an intentional scam a spectre as

1371
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:22,271
Clearly

1372
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,807
No it's misinformation

1373
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:27,135
Confirmation bias as a religion

1374
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:33,535
Listen to this a lot of those overlaps of Alex and stuff

1375
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:37,631
Wanted to get more information

1376
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,679
His first interview with Carrie

1377
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:44,031
Because this is somebody who she is now presented as a

1378
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,311
Super soldier

1379
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,615
On her show

1380
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,151
The first time

1381
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,199
If you listen to that episode

1382
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:54,527
You get a ton of indications that there is

1383
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,807
Something that he's dealing

1384
01:12:56,063 --> 01:13:00,415
He talks about healing himself from PTSD head from being in Iraq

1385
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:04,255
Tell Ron Hubbard still seeing a psychiatrist

1386
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:11,423
When you talk to him about stuff and the next time he came another guy was there with the secret space program

1387
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,543
If you are a person like Harry and you were dealing with things responsibly

1388
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,823
Probably a follow-up interview

1389
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,639
You might not even put that one out to begin with

1390
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,199
And it's one of the reasons why I'm trying

1391
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:27,295
To be as careful as I can surrounding Anthony himself

1392
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
Because

1393
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,647
I kind of look at it

1394
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:38,559
I kind of look at him in the same way I would have looked

1395
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,095
Address khashab

1396
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,375
Before she

1397
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:48,031
Realize what she was doing makes sense he still has every potential in his

1398
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,311
2

1399
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,079
You know

1400
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,383
Get to a point where he's living

1401
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,175
More realistically

1402
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,503
And have some more clarity about these things

1403
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:03,135
Vanessa rotten Jessa run-on sentence and all this super soldier stuff that he's falling into

1404
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:06,207
I don't I don't think that he

1405
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,743
Is necessarily

1406
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,791
Running what you do

1407
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:12,863
Describe is a full-scale Khan

1408
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,631
At least

1409
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,959
As far as I can tell there's not wholesale bigotry going on

1410
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:23,359
Start the Hallmarks of someone who's too far I guess he's

1411
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,455
Metaphorically

1412
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:32,575
I don't I don't see the indications of someone who's lost

1413
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:35,647
Just someone who's maybe in a bad

1414
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,439
Place yeah I like

1415
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,231
There a lot of people

1416
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:43,583
That I noticed

1417
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,399
So hard was the way Carrie

1418
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,935
Was manipulating him

1419
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,471
By using those pauses

1420
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:55,359
After he says something like she's not allowing him to continue speaking and you can tell the way he

1421
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,639
Noises the pause mean

1422
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,431
I didn't say what she needed

1423
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:00,991
I didn't say what she wanted and she knows

1424
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:05,599
She's definitely exploding him in in that kind of way as like

1425
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:11,999
Is a scientific in this circumstance

1426
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,839
Because the dead kind of

1427
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,399
A larger awareness that important

1428
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,679
About what she does

1429
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,983
Like what this show is

1430
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:27,615
On sublevel is masquerading as like

1431
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:31,455
It's not necessarily that there's there is

1432
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,503
Enabling

1433
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,831
Making

1434
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:42,719
A business out of other people's unhealthiness just like Alex's show what's

1435
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,535
Far more important than any conversation is

1436
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,863
Making sure the narrative is what she wants it to be

1437
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,727
Got2b a call-in show

1438
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:59,359
You can you can say I've got a whole I talk to everybody and s*** like that

1439
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:04,735
If you're doing this show you're talking to people who are going to support the things that you were

1440
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:08,575
Give you a sounding board to get what you want out of

1441
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:14,975
Dwell in this kind of a space and you're doing interviews like this I think you have a heightened responsive

1442
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,023
I think that you actually have

1443
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,119
A greater standard that you need to live up to then somebody

1444
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,143
Who's doing

1445
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:27,775
Let's just say like a show where you interview people have a new book coming out

1446
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:33,663
Is about some sort of the mainstream talk show I think you have a far greater responsibility

1447
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,943
In terms of

1448
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,223
Being aware

1449
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,271
That the water is you swim in

1450
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,295
Attract

1451
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,575
People who are having

1452
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:45,439
Trouble sometimes a higher likelihood of someone

1453
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:48,511
With an idea closer to what you believe

1454
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,815
Having some sort of

1455
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,863
Ology behind it

1456
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,727
And it is important if you want to deal with things responsibly

1457
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,567
Cater to people

1458
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,103
Look after people

1459
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,687
And what I see and absences in anytime

1460
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:09,503
I've looked at Camelot

1461
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,783
An absolute

1462
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:14,879
Responsibility

1463
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,647
Yeah

1464
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:20,255
Then people expressing pain and exploiting

1465
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,327
And I don't know if Anthony is expressing that much

1466
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,863
Because I don't think

1467
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,679
He doesn't appear to be struggling nearly as much as

1468
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:34,079
Like the people who I wouldn't cover right they had similarities to Alex or whatever

1469
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:40,479
It's not worth it and he's not talking about this

1470
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,783
Feel like it's pain to him his

1471
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:45,343
He's not even have a completely flat affect

1472
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,367
What are you saying

1473
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:51,487
He seems to have like some points for he laughs like he doesn't seem like it's somebody who's

1474
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:58,655
Right Right Alright context clues to be able to like okay this isn't a secret

1475
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,447
Space Program super soldier

1476
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,239
This is somebody who believes

1477
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:05,567
Stuffed is right on qanon

1478
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,615
And has some sort of a whole

1479
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:10,175
This is is satisfying

1480
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:15,039
Yeah and I think that it's irresponsible is your someone like Harry to not

1481
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,063
Be

1482
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,599
Hyper aware of that

1483
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,415
Because you're in a position where you have a show

1484
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,951
That has an audience

1485
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,767
You are in a position where you could

1486
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,327
Take somebody who's going through something

1487
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:31,167
Maybe it's being influenced by some negative things online

1488
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:37,567
Maybe it's a phase for them or something they're trying it out because they need something to hold onto

1489
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:41,919
There's tens of thousands of people who have listened to their story

1490
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,479
And are giving them reinforcements

1491
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:47,039
And now you put them in a situation where

1492
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,319
One path

1493
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,343
Leave towards

1494
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
Getting help

1495
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,415
And being healthy

1496
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:58,559
I am that requires you to reject all the endorphins and the sense of meaning of this

1497
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,375
New conspiracy world has given me

1498
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,423
You have to give up whatever that

1499
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,239
Crutch it's been built here

1500
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,287
Sense of safety

1501
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,359
Yeah it's a sense of life

1502
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:17,759
That's that's the that's the thing that I keep noticing so much of these people is that they

1503
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:20,063
Cannot allow for an utterly

1504
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:20,831
Chaotic

1505
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,623
Nonsensical universe

1506
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,391
Universe

1507
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,671
It's it's crazy

1508
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,719
Somebody has to be in control

1509
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,255
Somebody has to be in power

1510
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,303
Somebody has to be orchestrating stuff

1511
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,583
It can't just be

1512
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,375
Ludacris Psychopaths

1513
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,399
F******

1514
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,983
Floundering around like

1515
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,287
Flounder

1516
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,567
Can't

1517
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,335
Just sad

1518
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:49,503
Yeah so we have a couple Clips here of the original interview because I think there's some Towing things in here they

1519
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,063
They give us a little bit more insight into

1520
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,111
Things that would have been like.

1521
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,159
Pursue this further carry

1522
01:19:56,415 --> 01:20:02,559
But you can't because she's not very good at isn't responsible

1523
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:05,631
What are the things that gives me a strong indication that this is like

1524
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:08,959
Her game is not good

1525
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,751
And I'm also

1526
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,775
Not one that

1527
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:12,799
The documents

1528
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:13,824
Baked

1529
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,360
And therefore

1530
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,896
On

1531
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:17,920
Either

1532
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,456
So I human

1533
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,224
Are the

1534
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,248
Natick Library

1535
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,272
Are the

1536
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,296
Bible

1537
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,576
Archivist

1538
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,368
Well out of our own

1539
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,696
You're so

1540
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,000
This is testimony

1541
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Testimony is it

1542
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,072
Law in fact

1543
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:38,912
So

1544
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,680
Take it for what it

1545
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:46,080
It's worth this is not a court of law

1546
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:50,432
Document

1547
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:54,272
No you can't you can't lie

1548
01:20:55,808 --> 01:21:00,928
You can take a document chili that's the rule strong distrust of documents

1549
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,952
People saying

1550
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,512
Wow

1551
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:09,120
I don't stand on documents because humans are the archival archivist

1552
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:15,520
I'll just talk to Sean David Morton

1553
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:21,920
Documents

1554
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:26,528
Like a really workable system I want to believe

1555
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,296
F*** everybody

1556
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:30,880
So in this first interview that came out about a year ago

1557
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:36,768
Gives a little bit of an indication of how his path down this road I came

1558
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:40,352
To be Maya Maya my mentor is

1559
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,888
His name is name is Rob.

1560
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:44,192
That's just one of one of the mentors

1561
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,520
I'm back basically when I started

1562
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:48,800
Waking up

1563
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,592
Space Program

1564
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,896
Iiii

1565
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,200
Rumpke

1566
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,504
And I actually attended the school

1567
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,808
And and and that was

1568
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,600
What was being taught there was

1569
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,928
And I'm obviously at the beginning I was

1570
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,952
Ready to handle

1571
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,512
Stan of what we

1572
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,536
Top there

1573
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,840
Because

1574
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,888
He always says you know it comes in levels

1575
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,448
And he always says you're not ready

1576
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,520
Handle what I'm going to tell her what a happy

1577
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,312
Because you have to

1578
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,080
You know

1579
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,616
Raise yourself up to the level

1580
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,432
The knowledge of the truth

1581
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:33,088
So Trump has come up with a few times on the show on the map the 40,000 year-old lemuria and warriors.

1582
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,904
Spirit

1583
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:39,744
Who's been described as racist anti-semitic a super 10

1584
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,864
Channel 840 thousand-year-old lovari and spirit actually does have 100 problems

1585
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:50,752
So JZ Knight is made a ton of money on this hustle and for a long time

1586
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:51,776
In fact

1587
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:58,176
She was doing it back when Clyde hoods Omega scam according to the News Tribune article

1588
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:01,760
Attorney Prosecuting the case Steve Sanchez

1589
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:04,832
Realize several victims were linked to JZ Knight

1590
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:10,720
The Ethereal New Age Guru claims to channel the spirit of a 40000 year old Warrior named Brahms.

1591
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,000
Later in the article

1592
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:16,352
That's how I became involved in it was through the school one student said

1593
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:20,192
I was involved practically everybody else I knew at the school was involved in it

1594
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:24,800
There were tons of people involved in this on just a cash basis

1595
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:28,896
People were sending in cash cash with no paperwork no receipt no nothing

1596
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:32,736
People were promised their money was going to come in before the next snowfall

1597
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:39,648
Probably just a coincidence that also took classes at the school

1598
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,672
Cool cool

1599
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,464
What's going on here

1600
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:47,328
This Anthony guy isn't a super soldier he's just a guy who has fallen under the sway of a cult

1601
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:52,960
Yeah and Carries using him to advance around there It Is by presenting the story is genuine and that's really unfortunate

1602
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,264
Because there is a better

1603
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:58,080
Cute future black guy

1604
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:02,688
Do they ever like a like wouldn't fight

1605
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:09,600
Skaneateles

1606
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,416
Not like not like he's just a guy who's trying to hunt

1607
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:17,536
I'm not driving sure

1608
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:23,936
Start a lot of this stuff like it starts to come into focus it starts to make sense this is what

1609
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,752
What's going on

1610
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,800
Pretty involved in chewing on stuff

1611
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:32,896
To like a promotion of the qun allowed to roam free

1612
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,944
Yeah yeah

1613
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,760
Yep wow that's not good

1614
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,576
They shouldn't have

1615
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,624
All of this Bruns

1616
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,648
Perfectly

1617
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:46,976
Sensibly if you start to look at okay

1618
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,024
Started to have these ideas

1619
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,584
He pursued this romp the school

1620
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,912
He went there started to learn about all this stuff

1621
01:24:55,168 --> 01:25:01,312
And as it turns out that school was a hotbed of people who are involved in the Omega Trust eomer

1622
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:07,712
Course he now believes in as being involved in some kind of a magical play

1623
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:18,208
I don't know seem like there's so many of these people are just searching

1624
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,512
Like just going from call to call

1625
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,536
Just like

1626
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:26,144
Please just take away my personal responsibility please I want nothing

1627
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:26,912
To do with it

1628
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,704
Tell me what

1629
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,288
To do remove me from having to think or feel

1630
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:36,384
That's the goal when I listen

1631
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,152
If

1632
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:42,272
Some of these ideas about the secret space program super soldier

1633
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,576
Or started by herself

1634
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:47,136
Yeah because

1635
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:51,744
You definitely listen to her other interviews cool with super soldier

1636
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,536
You know I've been

1637
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,072
A fair number of

1638
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,632
Say

1639
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:00,192
And so I guess it wondering

1640
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,472
If you're familiar with

1641
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,240
Indianapolis

1642
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,032
Interview

1643
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,312
Did you watch any

1644
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:09,920
And at the time did it trigger you and also

1645
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,944
Where you aware

1646
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,480
That I was in my lab beef

1647
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,272
Told you about it I mean I think

1648
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,040
You said you heard

1649
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,320
Staying on the show

1650
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,856
Were you aware of it

1651
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
Before I said it

1652
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,512
Yeah I would definitely where you were my last

1653
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,072
Watch money

1654
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:30,912
I knew that

1655
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:34,496
All the other super soldiers that you interviewed

1656
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,032
Aaron

1657
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,640
Max spiers

1658
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,504
At work work

1659
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
Earring there

1660
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,064
Did

1661
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,600
You know support mining

1662
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,392
Help me smile

1663
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,488
The others

1664
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,560
You know the interview

1665
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:05,216
So it was pretty old interviews early on in Camelot throughout and

1666
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,520
I can't help but think that maybe

1667
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,592
What is an expression of

1668
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:17,760
I got into this form of oral tradition the storytelling medium that you were engaged in with these people

1669
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:25,184
All the time I started having dreams and then I realized that the only reason that it could

1670
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,232
Possibly Vibe with me this much

1671
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:30,560
And why I could dream about it all the time it's because

1672
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,864
I myself must be one of those super

1673
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,912
A soldier it's a possibility

1674
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,728
Also if if there's only one answer to the question

1675
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,544
Did you know I was in my lab before or

1676
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,336
There's only one answer that question

1677
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,616
If you answer that wrong

1678
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:44,384
Get out of the game

1679
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,736
Jordan do you think that you could beat up a super soldier

1680
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:53,344
I mean I'm not really Nordic you know I'm more Irish

1681
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,744
So you think

1682
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,768
Not a super soldier

1683
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:04,096
What is the point of having a super soldier if I could defeat

1684
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,888
Well I don't know if you could

1685
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,704
I should tell you that from 2011

1686
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:10,240
2018

1687
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,056
Xander was an MMA fight

1688
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,592
Okay how did he do

1689
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:15,616
His record

1690
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:18,176
Was six

1691
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,200
6 + 12

1692
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:26,112
Backtracks with only 133

1693
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:32,512
His last fight was a 8-second knockout that he lost

1694
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,536
Stuff like that

1695
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:38,912
If you were super soldier you're not going to lose 12

1696
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:41,216
Unless all MMA fighters are Super Soul

1697
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:47,872
That is possible from 2018 to 2020

1698
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,896
And flight was

1699
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:52,224
February 14th 2020 you started boxing

1700
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:57,088
Okay amaru became a boxer and his current record is

1701
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:57,856
1 + 7

1702
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,160
Okay that's not great that's not great

1703
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:03,488
His second most recent fight was on December 5th

1704
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,048
2019

1705
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,584
Buy a debuting

1706
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,864
Boxer

1707
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,656
Okay

1708
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:16,544
First boxing match in 2018 in January 2018

1709
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:22,944
Since then all seven I've been losses three times knocked out

1710
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:29,600
Good that's really bad but should be knocked out once

1711
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,624
I mean for your brain

1712
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,928
It's tits sub

1713
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:38,816
In the martial arts in the in the pugilism

1714
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,096
Someone who was

1715
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:46,752
I prepared for their entire life to be a super soldier and at the black put up them and all of that

1716
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:47,776
You would assume

1717
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,312
Might be unbeatable

1718
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:52,896
And it seems to me very difficult to square that with

1719
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:58,272
Losing records in boxing and MMA going back to 2011

1720
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:04,160
I mean I guess if part of his super soldier thing though is that he's in an inter-dimensional body too it's not always

1721
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:10,560
That's why I always that's why it's really difficult right stuff when it's in a different body in a different truck

1722
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:18,496
Problem is his real body was kidnapped at 6

1723
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:24,896
Dental implant out of it it's difficult for me to square

1724
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:29,760
Kind of makes the story hard to believe that

1725
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,320
I mean more like just theirs

1726
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:35,904
But there's permanent brain damage that comes with being knocked out that many times

1727
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,512
Like that some serious tough assumption to make

1728
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,912
You know

1729
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,704
Maybe to be considered I don't

1730
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,984
I don't I don't know why.

1731
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:57,664
Certainly if you were boxing and be like 80s doing that you do pro wrestling back when they did a

1732
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,224
Protective

1733
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,016
Then yes I would be far more

1734
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,576
Concerned but since they started fighting in 2011

1735
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:07,904
Hey baby I don't know we've evolved along ways

1736
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,440
And fairly recent

1737
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:12,512
Understanding

1738
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,840
Because in a little bit better but

1739
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,632
Yeah I don't I don't I don't know

1740
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,168
I don't

1741
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:22,752
Decently well

1742
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,544
Outside of times and there's like

1743
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:31,200
He clearly doesn't know which Kennedy is being disgusting I don't think there's any kind of cognition problem that's just

1744
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:35,552
He doesn't know the story

1745
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:41,952
Communicating and telling a story that has a beginning middle and end

1746
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,744
Any indications of diminished

1747
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:50,400
Function

1748
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:56,032
Never ask him about the other people that I haven't listened to so I don't know if it comes up in those

1749
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:02,688
Seems like a different you know that how are you draining all the time for MMA and also being a super soldier that strength

1750
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,712
Transferring from

1751
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,992
Dimensions dimension

1752
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,528
It's not important

1753
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:11,904
It's not a Borden probably that's a good answer

1754
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:17,024
Wava wave

1755
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:23,424
But I don't recall it coming up and Carries interviews I didn't watch the second one I only watch the first and the third

1756
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:26,496
I didn't I just enough time

1757
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:33,152
Clips from the original interview which is very confusing for me

1758
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:39,552
Anthony talks about a raid that he went on

1759
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,112
The alignments of the

1760
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,696
People who are supposedly his superiors

1761
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,536
How to recall where I was

1762
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:50,816
In a blackout

1763
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,864
You know here and everything

1764
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,400
Oswegatchie Squad

1765
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,520
We're out

1766
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,800
I'm doing a race

1767
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,080
And then

1768
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,128
The next day

1769
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,152
You

1770
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,248
It was actually a real

1771
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:10,528
Stronghold

1772
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,832
And I just kind of hours like

1773
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,600
Okay.

1774
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,416
Memory

1775
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,720
Miranda sings. About this

1776
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,488
Radon

1777
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,768
Courtney Armstrong

1778
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,560
I definitely believe that I

1779
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:29,472
So that's a dream

1780
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:33,056
I like that I like that mess that checks out for me

1781
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,616
So the secret space program super soldiers

1782
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,968
Running raids against Clinton

1783
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,528
I don't know I can't keep track of this

1784
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:48,416
I think I think alliances and in such changes

1785
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,976
In in their world everybody's eating people for Chuck

1786
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:55,840
Who knows mesirow require strange bedfellows

1787
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:03,008
This next clip makes me think that Anthony is probably a decent hearted person

1788
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:03,776
Actually you

1789
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,568
22in expand

1790
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,592
Believes

1791
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,872
The things that you saying

1792
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:10,944
Because otherwise I don't know why you would make this up

1793
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:13,504
You also

1794
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,784
Involved

1795
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,576
If I wasn't

1796
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,392
Life revolve

1797
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,672
Germany

1798
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:23,488
Be involved

1799
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,048
Nazi

1800
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:26,816
Situation

1801
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,864
Yeah yes

1802
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,424
Yes but from my understanding I was

1803
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,960
Traded as a Nazi

1804
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,752
Because I've had many memories

1805
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,544
Being with Nazis

1806
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,200
Indominus

1807
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,248
Gathering

1808
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,528
And all that

1809
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,600
But I might I do I do

1810
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:50,880
I definitely have

1811
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,464
You know I I believe that

1812
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:03,168
He carries response is exactly what someone's response would be

1813
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,704
Make that up

1814
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:11,104
Probably because even if you are presenting it is I was infiltrating them to get information

1815
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,688
CU road to walk it still open

1816
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:21,856
Are you sure I really feel like that should have been a very obvious question to answer as well

1817
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,136
Are you a Nazi

1818
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:26,720
Well it's not the way to go Highway

1819
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:33,120
Okay I think I was going to know I've spent a lot of time with Nazis

1820
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:36,704
You can even tell a recognition in the way that you talking of like

1821
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:43,104
This is bad probably have

1822
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,640
He's definitely in better with some nothing

1823
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:51,040
And it makes total sense when you consider the soda that he conceives of his being the Spy

1824
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:56,928
Cast The Umbrella Corporation thing is there then the Nazis

1825
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,744
So obviously if I was doing Secret work

1826
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,144
I would have been doing that if there was anything to infiltrate it would have been Hitler

1827
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:10,752
If you weren't such a bad spy maybe we could have taken down the Nazis a lot earlier

1828
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:13,824
He probably blew his cover and this is that was

1829
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:19,712
That was the whole Valkyrie thing we got Tom Cruise involved now this whole thing is terrible I'm telling you

1830
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:23,296
That must be better spies that must be what happened

1831
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:26,368
Yeah I don't I don't know but you mean

1832
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:34,048
A non-malicious

1833
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,584
So good

1834
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,168
I had to been involved in trying to take them down

1835
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:45,568
Which is a pure hardness on level you would never bring that up if you were

1836
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,848
Just trying to come up with

1837
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:53,248
I feel like it you just leave that off the resume

1838
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:59,648
Cutting there too if you're like in my dreams in my past life I would I would remember being around a lot of Nazis

1839
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:01,952
So I'm assuming that I was a spy

1840
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:09,376
Good that leaves a lot of open to interpretation

1841
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,240
That's almost done

1842
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:18,080
A Reconciliation you always like in my past life I was a Nazi

1843
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,360
I know they're bad now

1844
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,896
So I'm going to hope

1845
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:24,480
Set my past-life knew they were bad as well

1846
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:31,136
Last year from the original one

1847
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:38,560
Watching The X-Files

1848
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:43,424
Everything in it is true and it responds to this is pretty

1849
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,496
Diamond Naturals

1850
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:47,776
So much the best

1851
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,408
X-Files

1852
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,976
Mexico

1853
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,608
All about Logan

1854
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,384
It's all in there it's on the Xbox

1855
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:34,112
Are not communicating

1856
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:37,952
I want sword arms out a wolf guy

1857
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:42,048
My favorite X-Files

1858
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:49,472
That's a good vial of X-ray to me that someone who was career is in this space

1859
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:54,336
The X-Files are and fix their the X-Men

1860
01:38:54,592 --> 01:39:00,736
It also doesn't know what the X-Men are

1861
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,528
Do is David Wolverine

1862
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:08,928
Don't even know Weapon X

1863
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:12,768
So f****** funny

1864
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:16,864
X-File is Logan

1865
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:24,800
Delightful

1866
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:30,944
Wake me up by one of those episode is it was difficult

1867
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,248
Trying to figure out exactly

1868
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:39,648
You know how you'd look at this I think there's enough stuff that makes it interesting

1869
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:41,696
Carrie is the bad person

1870
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:45,792
Yeah you can look at with

1871
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,584
Compassion

1872
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,632
To an extent

1873
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:56,288
I'm not nut tree

1874
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:58,336
Somebody was falling into something

1875
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,384
Baby is way deeper

1876
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,664
Waters then

1877
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,432
Baby

1878
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,968
It appeared at first

1879
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:09,088
Getting involved with Robinhood and the JZ Knight nonsense and the qanon

1880
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,880
Now being

1881
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:14,464
Assertive enabled by a high-profile internet

1882
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,768
Yeah it's very

1883
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,048
It's very difficult

1884
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,352
And I don't I don't

1885
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,888
I don't know I ate

1886
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,936
Stop it stop

1887
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:28,288
To figure out exactly where the line is of how much empathy people deserve

1888
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:34,944
Because he's still putting out like messages that are destructive Coronavirus

1889
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:38,272
Nihilism

1890
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:43,648
You know Paving the way for Trump's authoritarian move

1891
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,440
You know denial about that

1892
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:49,280
And that's still really bad that I feel needs to be countered with

1893
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:54,400
A full-throated rejection and development by

1894
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,704
Yo I think someone like this

1895
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,728
You can take

1896
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,008
Contacts

1897
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:03,104
Excludes to see exactly how this came to be right

1898
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:08,736
It's hard not to feel bad for the guy

1899
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,528
Who is Dad or Mom

1900
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:13,600
Watch too much Fox News and became

1901
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:16,928
Something that's almost unrecognizable

1902
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,952
BS the thingy

1903
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:18,720
Is bad

1904
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,512
Kind of

1905
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,304
Have a lot of empathy for the path

1906
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:28,960
Right maybe didn't know you were going. My family is great example

1907
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,264
Full of people who've been manipulated by

1908
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,288
All of this

1909
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,568
Right-wing nonsense but

1910
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,408
You know they want to believe that s*** too so it's like

1911
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:44,064
Pamela is way more fun

1912
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:48,160
Fraudsters

1913
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,440
It's like

1914
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:53,024
Now we have a clear Villa

1915
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,560
And

1916
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,584
He's bad

1917
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:04,800
I'm glad cuz I don't want to give the impression they project

1918
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:06,080
Plot is

1919
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:12,480
Relatively benign in in that kind of senses when you know like this this show is destructive

1920
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:19,136
Along the same lines as info I mean not more so cuz obviously Alex is audiences

1921
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:21,440
Cupboard

1922
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:24,768
On her show are maybe more Insidious because

1923
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:27,840
To certain minded people there's so much more attractive

1924
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,608
Yeah

1925
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:31,424
Like the the Escape ISM MB the

1926
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,704
Tension look like

1927
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,752
I have super powers

1928
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:41,152
All this kind of stuff it's very much like I have swords for arms

1929
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:45,248
Seductive attractive and then the real world

1930
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:47,552
Implications of it are things like

1931
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:53,696
Coronavirus denialism Trump boosterism qanon beliefs

1932
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:57,280
Two things where the road leads

1933
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:02,400
And it's not that much different than Alex

1934
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,448
Most

1935
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:10,592
Infuriating thing to know that these people are clinging to these conspiracy theories and

1936
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:15,200
The idea that Trump is not an amoral monster

1937
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:17,504
As a way of feeling safe

1938
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:21,600
And in control of things are at least somebody being in control of things

1939
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,880
And yet that very

1940
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:25,184
Feeling of safety is what's killing you

1941
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,720
You know like that's

1942
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:29,280
That's this I feel safe because I think

1943
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,328
Trump is not an amoral monster

1944
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,608
And because he is

1945
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,400
You are not safe

1946
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:35,936
Legacy

1947
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:38,752
Yep you're the vector by which

1948
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:39,520
Your lack

1949
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,056
Safety becomes Usher

1950
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:43,104
That's the modern crisis

1951
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:43,872
Yeah

1952
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,408
Yeah

1953
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,456
So anyway

1954
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:50,272
Need to take a little break from Alex and imports

1955
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:53,856
Project Camelot

1956
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,416
What is uplifting

1957
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:01,536
Maybe a mark Richards

1958
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:07,680
Interesting on sublevel aspire

1959
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:10,496
That's my next tattoo

1960
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:16,896
Jordans

1961
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:29,440
Israeli review donate and if you would like please find a local charity in your area and donate to them

1962
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:35,840
Absolutely

1963
