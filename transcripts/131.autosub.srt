1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,168
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:17,664
Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

3
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,200
Is there a hook

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,760
There is I know a lot about our job

5
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:28,160
What seems like forever

6
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
You can find

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,256
All I know is that alright

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,864
Monument to looking up

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
Whether or not a guy said

10
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
Right there's a lot of that

11
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,032
The Show by just doing a little bit of a house clean

12
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,616
Because

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,408
I I think I did

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,200
Do a good enough job

15
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
Thursday on Thursday night you were all up in my business and I got something wrong

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:02,464
Well

17
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
First of all malphus might have been a worse dude than we gave him credit for

18
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Whoeasy

19
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,960
Other than the other thing was in the first

20
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,032
The first episode the beginning the first thing we stopped for it

21
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
That h.g. Wells quote

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
I misread my notes

23
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
About the quote

24
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
There was accurate

25
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
But also the specific

26
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
Part of the quote that

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
He takes out

28
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,112
He doesn't even put an ellipsis into note that he was you know

29
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
The quotas using AP Style

30
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:37,024
The quote that he says is like many people will resist the new world order a Dye resist

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,328
Nothing at all in the middle of those

32
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
Two sentences there's a list of like

33
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,216
Millionaires and Maharaja

34
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
The specific people he's talking about in that quote I forgot to point this out

35
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:56,992
Where to find them and solve the New World Order problems about the people who will resist

36
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,832
The New World Order of taking care of people will be these millionaire

37
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Angelica

38
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,952
I just wanted to clear that up because I'm very self-conscious

39
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,976
And all that

40
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
I just didn't make the point strongly enough it was even worse than this house

41
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
You can check out on our ography Wichita

Friday

47
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
Poconos

48
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,960
Before we give a shout out to a couple of new donors what's going on out there

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
Thank you so much for joining up with the show

51
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:00,224
The next was actually very special

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,552
Special shout-out to someone who is

53
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
Bumped up their donation but at the same time has also become the moderator of our new group

54
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:16,352
On Facebook is the encouragement for us actually creating that group you sent me a message and said

55
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,192
People can post stuff and

56
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
Joke around and

57
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
And all that stuff do we have

58
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
Groupon Facebook

59
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
It's called go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

60
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:38,624
Find it and if you request to be remember we will let you in the group there's a lot of fun stuff going on

61
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
You remember

62
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,488
Pics of those eight words in order to buy the group

63
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
People clowning around it so it's a great time

64
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,448
Stupid

65
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
Inspiring and encouraging us to open it up it's really cool it's so fun looking at

66
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
And myself jumping in and clowning with

67
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
Absolute real nice

68
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Inspiring that

69
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
And bumping up donation

70
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,856
Keegan you're officially a technocrat

71
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,536
Someone sodomites Italy a bucket of poop

72
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
Jesus Christ

73
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
So thank you very much Keegan

74
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,479
Think about it you might have already been a technocrat

75
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
God bless you

76
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
You're the best

77
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,903
So it took a long time

78
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
To do that endgame cover

79
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,999
There's a ton of research

80
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
Very weird

81
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
But his bibliography suck

82
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
There were loose ends there were

83
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:00,287
His research at the dry what the f*** is

84
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
She talking about there's a guy with a cowboy hat

85
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Oh God.

86
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,735
Cowboy hat cowboy hat

87
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,063
His cowboy hat was of course made by a globalist undercutting his

88
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,927
Entire argument either figure out why wasn't also wearing a bolo tie these requests

89
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
He's dead so I had to have a seance

90
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
Define doubtful took a lot of time

91
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
So I took weeks of research

92
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
And then we recorded

93
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Turn for us

94
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
Taken by the way we are turn of the century spiritualists apparently

95
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:39,199
I'm The Reincarnation of David Wilcock

96
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:44,319
David David Wilcox claims to be The Reincarnation of

97
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
Who is that guy is called the sleeping

98
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
Sweeping mist

99
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
What was his f****** name

100
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
Edgar Cayce

101
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,279
Claims to be The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce

102
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:03,007
About reincarnation on Project Camelot

103
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Point of the future

104
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,359
You know we recorded that there was a hot 9 hours

105
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
And then the editing of its posting

106
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,247
They're putting together our bibliography that took up most of last week

107
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
We haven't had an episode

108
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,831
Unfortunately or fortunately

109
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Matley it's debatable

110
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,463
In that time a lot of stuff that hits

111
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Home for Alex

112
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
Has happened we had these

113
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
Did the shooting in Parkland

114
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
Which

115
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
I think that you and I have discussed we have no in

116
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,263
I'm talking about at least at this point out of respect

117
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Those affected

118
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
And rage

119
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
There's that the argument

120
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
That are made a really stupid

121
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
Exact same arguments that have been made

122
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,063
Over and over and over again every time there's a tragedy

123
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,927
So if you want to know about it go listen to us talk about Alex

124
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
Pretty much pretty much the same f****** thing

125
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,607
And there was that that town hall meeting with CNN

126
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
About that

127
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
Too much

128
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
Smarticle started

129
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
It's come out about how he was

130
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,591
In trouble with YouTube standards

131
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Yes

132
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
So it was a big

133
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
He's got two strikes

134
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,039
Straight to laughter

135
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,879
I was talking on the group go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

136
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,975
Some folks my position on it is quite frankly

137
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
These sorts of articles are really just

138
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Reinforcing

139
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
Victim status

140
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
His narrative

141
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
Think it does nobody any help

142
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,495
Do I to tell this order bulshit

143
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,895
Think about how many f****** strikes he has whenever he's okay

144
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,503
Exactly

145
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
Single f****** articles

146
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,879
And here's why is a monster and here's why

147
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
Alex Jones

148
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
Noted ridiculous

149
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,791
It is quite frankly like I think it's stupid

150
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
I think the strikes there was room

151
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
Two are non-specific

152
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,447
How much baseball has

153
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
Influencer

154
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
Exactly

155
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
Baseball's not arbitrary

156
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
You can make it two strikes strikes

157
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
Technicalities in baseball

158
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
But not in YouTube

159
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
If you guys are going to play that game and that's what you want to do

160
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Hit me up

161
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
I can find you some more strikes

162
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,607
I know if you think I know a few places where he vaguely threatened

163
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:43,007
Chris Cuomo's children

164
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
If you want we can get some stuff

165
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
But that's not a reject

166
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Sincerely think that

167
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Kind of nauru

168
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
Anybody who's pushing for likes

169
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Some sort of a

170
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
On the merits

171
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Content

172
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
I think is barking up a really bad

173
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Tree

174
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
An approach to take

175
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Because

176
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Up to a certain

177
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Point he is

178
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Protected under

179
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Piano priest

180
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Guidelines

181
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
Write better there

182
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Specifically 2 /

183
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Protect

184
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
Speech but it's

185
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
Disgusting

186
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Doleful

187
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
You play a losing

188
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Game when you're like

189
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,271
Yrz-a the more reasonable thing to do is

190
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
The crime

191
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:34,975
Certainly deal with those usually

192
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
To allow

193
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,815
His listeners to see him within the proper con

194
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Things like

195
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,399
Show people his bibliography for m

196
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Thing that I think

197
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Could a road

198
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
Public confidence

199
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
Warriors

200
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,103
But again we talked about this he would just say

201
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,687
Of course I don't have anything in a bibliography all my sources are secret

202
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
You know like

203
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
I have top

204
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,599
I'm getting off on a terrible

205
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Absolutely

206
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
It's been a big week

207
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,487
Did you know there's a secret and Carter page

208
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
You can find on the dark web

209
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
You know what's weird

210
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
It has all of

211
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Encarta

212
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:20,031
Encapsulate on Tor Browser

213
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
I want I think we did a really terrible job of

214
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
A couple things

215
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Thinking about a little more

216
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,087
We didn't know like I think that it Bears mention

217
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,647
Alex made that that came out in like

218
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
2006

219
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
2007

220
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,023
Mention George Soros in that documentary once

221
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
That's true you know there's also

222
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Things like that that are like

223
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:50,239
Call George Soros wasn't involved in building the trans-texas pipeline or whatever

224
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Do you use involved in everything

225
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
According to Ali

226
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:59,199
I think it's interesting that his narrative hadn't developed to that point yet

227
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,015
You're doing a great job globalizing

228
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
This Texas

229
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
This thing out

230
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
That way Alex can talk

231
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,231
The trilateral commission

232
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
The timezone

233
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
He's Alex Jones big Boogeyman

234
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Anyway

235
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,287
Alright we're coming back

236
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
We got it. Check in

237
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
With the present

238
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
I was like

239
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
Dewey

240
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,223
I think we do out of like a decent completeness

241
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
That's true that's why I was looking around

242
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
I was like

243
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
That's weird

244
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
Milo yiannopoulos was on

245
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
Every day last week

246
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,815
I saw that are really trying to forge an alliance

247
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,119
Really why I believe so

248
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
Milo is reached

249
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,471
A premature point in his career Rhino 11

250
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
When that happens

251
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,103
Generally people go to Infowars so

252
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
He's going to Infowars and he's really

253
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,223
He's be the potent tool for Alex right now

254
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
But I think he'll I would say his wealth

255
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Pretty quick

256
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
As he's done

257
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Literally everywhere else

258
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,159
I don't mean this in any homophobic sense

259
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
But I think that Alex is audience

260
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
Assume

261
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
So much of what drives

262
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
Is Infowars at

263
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Misplaced

264
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
Version of masculinity

265
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
Yeah and that's why they like this

266
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
Testosterone coffin

267
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
Owen Shroyer shooting hoops

268
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,015
In a commercial for Vitamin B or whatever

269
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
You know there's there's a there's a weird

270
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
Testosterone-driven masculinity

271
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
That is at the

272
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
Score of Infowars homosexual

273
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
Most likely turn off his

274
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
Very masculine base

275
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Awful awful

276
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
I think it's only a matter of time

277
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
Before they

278
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
The charm wears off

279
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
For them

280
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
Alex is trying to give him instead make them feel

281
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Enlighten

282
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,111
You can't call us racist or homophobic we listen to a gay man

283
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
It's possible but I think that I think

284
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
I think the alternative is

285
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
Who's more likely

286
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
Play Just based on what I like

287
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,911
Johnny like these guys all of the Olympics they've been listening to Johnny where they're crying at figure skating all the time that's something

288
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,775
That we know about infowarrior I don't know I'm just guessing

289
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
But

290
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Who knows

291
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
I don't know I don't know it's it's

292
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
But so far it's been a really good press

293
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
Gambit for the two of them

294
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Everyone

295
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,343
Why have you so

296
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,671
Right

297
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
Infowars change

298
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,535
They'll write up a boring

299
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,607
Milo is saying bulshit on him

300
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
A monstrosity is never come

301
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Heart

302
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
Do you think about the bottleneck

303
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Alex Jones

304
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,199
Infowars related material at generally come from

305
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
You know right wing watch

306
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Or

307
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,135
Clips from right wing watch

308
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
And the reason is

309
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
F****** takes forever to go through all the

310
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
This b*******

311
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
Rightwingwatch does it for you

312
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,375
Video of XYZ thing

313
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
I think is interesting

314
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Alex Jones

315
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,471
The show Media Matters

316
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
I'm not saying anything bad about Media Matters or any of these shows

317
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,199
Jose they pick up the thing that rightwingwatch put out because of

318
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
For them already

319
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
Where is we cover

320
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
Paris

321
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
No I don't want to do that

322
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
I want to be a part of any of those Institution

323
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,231
Like I thought about that I could apply for a job at Media Matters

324
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
Probably get one

325
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,095
Like based on the work that I've done already a lot of those things I've written

326
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,703
A demonstrated track record of being on that side

327
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,823
Hypothetically I don't know what there is more to that side that I don't know

328
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
But I would assume

329
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:16,223
The competences I've displayed probably would get me at least an entry-level jobs

330
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
And I've no interest

331
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
So

332
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:28,255
My point is everyone just covers

333
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
This piano clip

334
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Milo being

335
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,447
Yeah it's because it's the thing that someone's already pre-packaged

336
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,263
Push it out I just wish the people

337
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
Like you were saying look at the bigger picture

338
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Anyway

339
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
I checked in

340
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
On Friday

341
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
I wanted to see

342
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
What was half a

343
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
So I watched a bit of it

344
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
I have a couple Clips I want to play for you

345
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
In his first one Alex

346
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
And he explains how he feels

347
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
About this perceived

348
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
What's going on

349
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,511
With YouTube

350
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
France is a Wall Street Journal article

351
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
30 flashes up on

352
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
And it doesn't

353
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,359
To your apartment

354
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Mansion

355
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
All your stuff

356
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Add

357
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,647
Whoever was in your house

358
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:52,479
Goldentot can a russian agent

359
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Bulimic

360
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
I am allowed to

361
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:05,279
Translation of a narcissistic

362
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
75 IQ

363
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
Brother

364
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:25,503
Authoritarian

365
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,367
Can you celebrate

366
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,255
Picking on you constantly

367
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,447
All these other idiots

368
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
Boron

369
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,175
Rush Limbaugh $300,000 to show off

370
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
First Amendment

371
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,575
I wonder which of those considerations was more important

372
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:07,231
I wonder if he was more like also the first

373
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
Tire sale on app

374
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,351
300 Grand and he gave me services in response

375
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:19,775
Normal transaction that we all make all the time was I making a good deal

376
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
But also

377
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,735
The First Amendment

378
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,599
Maybe put also the First Amendment

379

That's right

384
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,823
Rush Limbaugh

385
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847

00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:00,223
They could shut him down they're going to shut us down people hang together

387
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,119
Monetized on YouTube

We're going to shut everybody down

389
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:27,615
YouTube is private company right moron

Yeah

393
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:43,487
Amateur comedy of it is like Milo being on now

394
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
Because he f******

395
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Wouldn't touch

396
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Milo

397
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,631
Right after all the s*** went down

398
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:54,239
You've got out

399
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,871
$300,000 Milo

400
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,199

00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,391
Workout anniversary stop giving the money

403
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,951
Maybe because I

404
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,767
1st of August 1st Amendment

405
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,583
Sodus Point

406
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
I mean

407
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
It's all like

408
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
Hello Alex.

409
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,239
The deals with this fake idea that he's being censored you just

410
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
Get mad at

411
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
His normal enemies YouTube

412
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,407
Well I've got this Wall Street Journal article

413
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,943
No

414
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
The First Amendment covers

415
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
What the government can do

416
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,903
A private company can still just do whatever you have to agree to their terms and condition

417
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
Clearly say

418
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,535
You know we can f*** you over if we want right right now

419
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
Every company

420
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
Movie theater

421
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
Every ticket was

422
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Was printed weekend

423
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,799
Refuse service to anyone for any reason

424
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,103
It's the same thing with most black

425
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Do that

426
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Most

427
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
Right now

428
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,551
Yeah we'll see how the Supreme Court rules before we

429
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,111
Go there and then you know every almost there

430
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Murray State has at-will employee

431
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,464
For any reason or no reason

432
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
It's just what businesses do to an extent mad about that is like well you have a lot more.

433
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:31,264
Journal article here in front of me that has YouTube 6 a.m.

434
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
Conspiracies propaganda

435
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
3D account, property

436
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
And I was really little bit here

437
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
YouTube kids planning

438
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,760
Give users more context for videos promoting conspiracy

439
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,296
Theories are state-sponsored

440
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,600
Stafford buying internet Giants

441
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
Clean up its platform

442
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
Make criticism over its role in spreading listen

443
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Information

444
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,768
YouTube said starting Friday would label all videos come

445
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,072
Did identify this Sunday broadcast

446
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
The category that would include even the United States

447
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,448
Public Broadcasting Service or PBS

448
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
The step is significant in part because

449
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
Has been a major conduit for our

450
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,104
State News organization that us intelligence

451
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
Officials called

452
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
The Kremlin principal

453
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Spell propaganda

454
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:16,832
So I looked through this entire article it doesn't say anything about censoring a Infowars

455
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
Only one referee

456
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Prince to Alex Jones

457
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
At all in it

458
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
That's oblique

459
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
It's the

460
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,656
YouTube first pooped its search results for breaking news in October after his criticized for surf

461
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
Conspiracy theories about a mass shooting

462
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,264
I killed 59 people during concert in Las Vegas

463
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,800
The change appearance

464
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,360
The search results for some key news events that have attracted

465
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
2 conspiracy

466
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Three days after the Las Vegas shooting

467
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,504
The results for a search on YouTube

468
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,320
About the attacks with a video titled quote

469
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,416
Las Vegas shooting was a false flag attack shooter on the fourth floor

470
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,464
But on Thursday night the results were all made

471
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
Stream news source

472
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,352
The policy hasn't always worked though on Wednesday after a train carrying some Republican lawmakers

473
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,888
Is chloride with a truck

474
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,472
Searches for grp crash on YouTube returned at the first result

475
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
A livestream from Alex Jones

476
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
The founder of conspiracy

477
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
Recite Infowars

478
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,104
As the third

479
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,176
The third video title train crash attempt

480
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Assassination

481
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,248
GOP Congress members?

482
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
YouTube said its algorithm

483
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,832
Recognize the search

484
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Quickly enough

485
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
As a news related to Gary

486
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
So

487
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
It's talking about

488
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,792
I mean Alex Jones is reference their butt

489
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
Part of it

490
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Yeah

491
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Yeah

492
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,008
Dangerous territory whenever you say like

493
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
Just cuz you're saying

494
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
Stupid s*** we're going to block you

495
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Floor jack

496
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:48,224
About how the kids are crisis actors

497
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,808
Difference in saying stupid s***

498
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
And I don't take the piss

499
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,648
This is tantamount to

500
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
Again

501
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
The large part of the coast

502
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
Private company

503
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,840
I don't consider this

504
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Some sort of racket

505
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Steering sensor

506
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,448
No that's a good question

507
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Platforms

508
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
Republic

509
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,128
Like would be a good idea if YouTube has publicly owned

510
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
I kind of think I'm not sure

511
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:21,760
Right I haven't even sat around and thought about it enough to have a informed

512
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:27,392
Either I just thought of it right now let's get into it and I think it would probably create

513
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
New and interesting problem

514
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,488
I don't know

515
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,072
Cuz it's it's kind of like a Publix

516
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
No everybody puts

517
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
But they don't have to

518
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,288
Like the reader at the reason electricity and telephone

519
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
Some s*** like that weird

520
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
Deems Public Utilities

521
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Because

522
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Without

523
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,064
Monopoly over them

524
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,416
That's different than a hey if you don't use YouTube

525
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,208
You can't put your review of black

526
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
A up

527
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
That's not the same

528
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,072
Yes

529
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:12,192
Are you sure it's very different how can you survive if somebody can't get ahold of you

530
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,264
Just like what the long distance phone call

531
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,336
Just emailing you they're very different

532
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
Not letting us put

533
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
Stop it wouldn't make it so we can

534
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,784
Operation

535
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,112
And my response though be there's so many ways you can host

536
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,720
Video online and if you have a website where you can embed those videos

537
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
You have a good reputation and

538
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
People start to like what you're doing

539
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,864
Shouldn't matter if YouTube is on board with you.

540
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
I mean you're just kind of being

541
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
Petty

542
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,472
I mean

543
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
That's another

544
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
And always because that's the second click

545
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
You know what I'm saying

546
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
Like if you're on YouTube looking

547
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
Confer Alex Jones videos

548
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,248
That's very different than if you're on YouTube and you

549
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
Steve and Alex

550
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
You know I'm saying yeah

551
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,392
In terms of problem of theirs

552
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
Suggestion

553
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
Just like that

554
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,768
Which much has been written about especially over at BuzzFeed

555
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
Missing articles you can

556
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Read about

557
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,840
The algorithm

558
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Used to

559
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
Suggest videos on

560
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:18,496
People end up with people going down really f***** up road

561
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
That leaves

562
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Toolots

563
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Misinformation

564
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Beyond the right

565
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
To be on the conservative side

566
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
They just got rid of

567
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
They can just do that right

568
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
But they wouldn't

569
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
Scores

570
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
It would reduce their traffic

571
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
Traffic

572
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Racing stuff

573
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Alex Jones in the next clip

574
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,584
I was going to scream but CNN and it's

575
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,144
It was a picture on his rug

576
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,752
This this borders on funny

577
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
But it's it's still not

578
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,920
There's something weird about every major CNN host I don't know where they grow these people

579
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:07,136
I just realized our demons Milos Bellaire

580
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:21,216
Photos

581
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:32,992
Screen is a picture of him at an adult swim party it's just clearly like a Getty Images

582
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
Anyway

583
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,064
No no no no no no

584
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,184
We got to go on the ride

585
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,840
Looks like it

586
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,264
Still not named hit the Quan

587
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:01,920
Uncle you really impressive and what happening right now

588
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,576
Photos

589
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:13,440
One thing that you should watch

590
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
And this is the true comedy of this

591
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,024
Steve pieczenik is on the phone

592
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
Bear on the phone

593
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:25,216
He'll show up at the end of this clip

594
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,336
It's just funny to know that he's silently there this whole time

595
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,872
I don't look at it

596
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,624
It sounds like Alex is tickling

597
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,232
Sexual harass

598
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
Cooper

599
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,728
Sorry there

600
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,224
Psychiatrist or as a psychiatrist

601
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
He's asking for 10:00

602
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:56,096
He's not relevan

603
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:04,032
Choir

604
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,088
But at the same time to Alex still always charm

605
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,160
To tickle yeah big but unfortunately it turns bad

606
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
Steve pieczenik says

607
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
Sandy Hook

608
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
Parkland

609
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,592
And when should looking at is the nonsense of the

610
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
Vestiges of the

611
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,432
Depressed trying to be relevant

612
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,416
How long does it go

613
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Let's go on

614
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
It just like where this place

615
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,048
He went on the run on Owen Shroyer

616
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,096
Flower Angel Parkway

617
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
And all this s***

618
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
It's it's unacceptable answer

619
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
This is level of s*** I don't want to deal with

620
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
There was a

621
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
Take me away

622
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,872
Take me away to a better place

623
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,784
What's this I hear

624
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:25,184
What's this I hear in the distance

625
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,984
I got the trees

626
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,384
Play the song are you just playing this by yourself

627
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,584
Sometimes when you're really frustrated about a right-wing propaganda

628
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,984
When you're frustrated about a right-wing propaganda

629
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,384
Would you put on a time travel

630
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,784
Mellow out a little bit

631
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:29,184
Like flashback song

632
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,792
Alright we find ourselves now time-traveled back 2006

633
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
2 points

634
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
Real quick

635
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
First off

636
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
Let me make a point real quick you're a bit killer

637
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,032
Let's try to do a b**** you f****** walked all over it

638
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
Look better about time

639
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
I'm sorry

640
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,272
I will do it on the next time travel

641
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Alright

642
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
Why is it

643
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
But these guys are always

644
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:04,000
Liberals are such but they're all triggered all this

645
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,072
And the way they describe everybody's appearance is like

646
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
It makes me shudder in

647
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,448
Is Brian stelter

648
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,008
To make you curl up into a ball like a little

649
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,664
A little baby that's interesting but since I am in 2006 right now

650
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,712
I have no idea

651
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,600
So he was certainly not on CNN

652
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,904
There's a method to my madness

653
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,464
Yeah we're now in 2006

654
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Don't make me

655
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,936
LOL baby so we're now back in 2000

656
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:48,544
Thanks for very specific reason the 2006 for whatever reason

657
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,824
David Lynch

658
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
Infowars

659
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,432
Very nice let's do this

660
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,248
Let's do this

661
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
Smooth

662
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,976
Wouldn't have gone back to Brian stelter

663
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,280
2006

664
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,328
David Lynch

665
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
Would putting out

666
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
Inland Empire

667
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
I don't

668
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
I never will understand

669
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Anybody

670
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
The exception invitation

671
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
From Alex to come on because

672
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,176
You kind of have to know that there's a reason

673
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,248
Like if you're going on and you're not one of The Wack Pack

674
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
Chaddock

675
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
Matt Bracken

676
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,088
These type of guys

677
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
Gerald Celente

678
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,440
Look if you're not one of these guys

679
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:41,280
And he's calling you like if you're David Rothschild come on

680
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,328
You got to know there's an agenda

681
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
And David Lynch.

682
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,144
I don't think he realizes that there's a

683
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,168
Legenda 2y hour

684
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
Alex wants to have him on

685
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,496
And you could never know what this address

686
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,824
Now it's surprising people who come on

687
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,128
And have their own agenda the Takeover

688
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Like

689
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,432
Christopher Walken

690
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,320
Salon

691
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,136
It's interesting that you bring that up cuz generally

692
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
Whenever Alex does something like

693
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
Like this

694
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,232
You end up with

695
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,768
The world's worst

696
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,792
Interview

697
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,632
He's a terrible because you have Alex who has his agenda

698
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,168
M4m

699
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
Who has their agenda

700
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,496
And they're working across purposes

701
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,312
They can never get quite on the same page

702
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,592
Quite frankly

703
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,872
Adapters right

704
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,408
Because there

705
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:34,784
We're clearly told beforehand you can come on to promote your XYZ thing

706
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,184
Yes that's what those interviews except some questions and what have you but

707
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:48,608
David Rothschild even said as much I'm here to talk about my book and Let Live Earth concert

708
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,448
Sins that are like hey what are you and then your next question is

709
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,104
So you got a new movie coming out right all goes here's the introduction analysis

710
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
I think he is with Lynch

711
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,328
The Elephant Man

712
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,656
The TV show

713
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,408
Great mover

714
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,992
Barnes & Noble

715
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
North Ogden

716
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Right now

717
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
Talk to you Alex

718
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,288
What the f***

719
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,128
He's lifting credits he likes

720
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
I even like

721
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
Right I mean it does seem like

722
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,952
Where do Taco holder

723
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:26,656
Alex has some theories about Lost Highway wants to run at

724
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,496
Now before we get to that Alex really want

725
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,288
To know what Inland Empire is about

726
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:36,896
David Lynch

727
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
When in 20

728
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,760
I don't understand

729
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,344
Who was Bob

730
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:52,256
Alex really wants to know right off the bat

731
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,048
What Inland Empire is about

732
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
David Lynch

733
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
Surprised by this

734
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,680
Isn't thrilled with that sort of question

735
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,496
Peconic buttheads a tiny bit

736
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,528
Well I say about it is it's a story of a woman in trouble

737
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
Pretty complex

738
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,256
Well you know Alex I love

739
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
Stories

740
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Chicken early

741
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,352
Stories

742
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
Alright one level

743
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
Concrete

744
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,264
That hold abstract

745
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,568
And abstraction

746
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
Things that Cinema can

747
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
AR

748
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
You know we experience in life

749
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
Cinema can

750
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
Play them so it's Anna

751
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,344
Experience B Ford

752
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,928
Cinema 10

753
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
Stupid questions

754
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,792
And I sitting

755
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
It's a beautiful language

756
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
Film

757
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
And

758
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
Speak American

759
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Say Inland Empire

760
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,704
Kohl's

761
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Some of this

762
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,504
What Alex is saying there is

763
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,344
My audience is stupid

764
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
How to do a thing

765
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Alright that'll break

766
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
There's a lot of

767
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,536
Music

768
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,304
Abstract

769
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,352
My heart that I need to ask

770
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,632
Express at the same time

771
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,680
I have to deal with reality and I think

772
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
Text the two together

773
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
But seriously

774
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
What the f***

775
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:43,616
Is the movie about a little depression drifted to Ventura

776
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,296
Jaybird music

777
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
Inland Empire

778
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,136
Bless your heart man it's

779
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
Story of a woman in trouble

780
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
And I'm

781
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
And Annette

782
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
You know

783
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,816
So he's not going to get that plot synopsis

784
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,960
I think I think it might go up there we see the first indication of

785
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,264
Do men not seeing eye-to-eye on what

786
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Conversation

787
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
Because

788
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,616
A decent interviewer would have heard that

789
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,456
Lymphocyte answer and maybe ask the question about film

790
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,040
Do you know where would have like a follow-up on that that sort of thing

791
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
And Alex is like

792
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,392
Tell me the plot

793
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,792
A book report

794
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,632
Your guest has already indicated I'm not interested

795
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,656
Telling

796
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
The plot of the

797
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
You know there's

798
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,752
There's a guy in Silicon

799
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
Your your next question is like

800
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,592
You're just going for another lap

801
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
Around the same thing

802
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
To go into a movie not know

803
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,272
Too much cuz nothing you enter a world

804
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,320
In front of Bebop

805
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,904
Nothing to say at this point to Alex

806
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,232
Pictures of theory about Lost Highway

807
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,048
I'm intrigued

808
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
You called out

809
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,784
Any comments on from the director of

810
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
Call Paulding

811
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
You know I've been

812
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,928
Back on unlocked Highway

813
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,536
I wrote the screenplay with Barry Gifford

814
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
Screenplay together

815
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,144
We've never really talked

816
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
About this

817
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
It was

818
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,568
At a time when the o.j. Simpson trial is going on

819
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
And you know

820
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,199
Similar things with the character Fred Madison

821
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,807
Human being can do a thing

822
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,879
So horrible

823
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,671
And keep on living in

824
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,463
Smiling and as O'Jays

825
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
Golf

826
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
So

827
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,583
There is a thing that we've discovered a

828
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
Psychogenic

829
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,655
Fugue for the mine

830
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
Self to

831
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,727
Hi the horror of

832
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:22,079
Something done

833
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:32,063
What you thought

834
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,343
Yeah and Alex

835
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,135
Heard psychogenic

836
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
Yuga

837
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,975
And I got the word wrong asking

838
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,255
Very weird

839
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
Embark song

840
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,607
Well it's in OU

841
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,399
You can I won't say anymore but

842
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
The thing is this

843
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,983
More often than not

844
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
In the long run

845
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
Nothing stays hidden

846
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
So

847
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
There you go

848
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,183
Cuz I'm trying to control myself be honorable

849
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:14,303
Good for you out it

850
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,215
That's that's bad

851
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,263
I'm having a psychogenic

852
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,823
Because I want to be honorable

853
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
What is the psychogenic

854
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:37,087
I am struggling right there when he's laughing and all that it's the two parts of him that's like

855
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,391
I want I love this guy

856
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,671
Cuz I think he is a fan

857
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,999
I think it feels like he is David Lynch fan

858
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,559
But at the same time there's something he wants

859
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
To ask him

860
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,887
That he can't directly ask him

861
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,447
That's inside Alex

862
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,727
There's something that like

863
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
He's hoping he can just

864
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:00,895
Pivot Point that'll get him to

865
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
The topic

866
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:05,759
Vicky wants the interview to be about and so far it's kind of about creativity

867
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
Probably a metaphor

868
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,695
At this point Alex retreat

869
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,767
I was like all right you came on to talk about your book

870
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,303
Ask about you

871
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Okay

872
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,703
Catching the big fish

873
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
Meditate

874
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
Consciousness

875
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Creativity

876
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,847
And it's

877
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
Facebook

878
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
You know of

879
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,431

Meditation

883
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
And

884

A works with

885
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
Sketching ideas

886
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
Because I

887
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,255
You know ideas are like fish

888
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,815
And we can we can catch the side

889
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Ideas

890
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Cleaner of conch

891
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,959
We can pitch ideas

892
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:57,983
Deeper in

893
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,311
Creativity

894
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Bowling

895
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,383
By learning

Human being

900
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,319
And it feeds the creativity

901
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,879
And it feeds the joy of doing things

902
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
Wisdom

903
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,087
Confirm Mark Frost

904
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,391
I don't even I don't really

905
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,671
You know I'm

906
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
No

907
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
Okay

908
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,583
You never mind

909
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
Some sort of pagan

910
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:04,799
I don't know cuz it's a non-sequitur to him talking about his book which

911
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,127
Is just pimping Transcendental Meditation

912
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
Bad news about Trump

913
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,015
Colt

914
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,295
Yeah

915
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
It's a giant

916
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,159
Giants

917
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:26,559
Wasn't the guy who popularized by his jokes

918
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Before

919
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
Rape charge

920
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:33,471
I don't know about that I don't know a whole lot about his personal history

921
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,287
I don't think it's

922
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,847
Well I mean I'm sure it's terrible but I don't think it's relevant

923
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,383
To like the David Lynch

924
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,663
Appearance here

925
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,967
Nor the the nature of

926
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
Transcendental Meditation

927
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,575
I would have you

928
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,367
It being on par with Scientology

929
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,903
Without the horror stories

930
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
The public house

931
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
Stories

932
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,999
Without the history of blackmail and private investor

933
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
It sound

934
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,327
It's it's

935
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
Some really crazy stuff

936
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,887
Why once you once

937
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,655
You start to look into it

938
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
I think it's

939
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
But pretty

940
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,471
Generally

941
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Evil thing

942
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
That is

943
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,103
Blackmailed Mark Frost

944
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,687
Putting owls

945
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,015
I don't know I don't know I don't want to jump in half-cocked on the

946
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,087
Quite frankly

947
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
Can I

948
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,951
From all the research that I've done

949
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
Intuit

950
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
Intuit

951
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,303
I think what they do is they take something

952
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,839
Very positive

953
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,863
That is meditation

954
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,655
And they've made

955
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,447
I very dangerous

956
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,471
It's called around

957
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
So you

958
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,775
The positive benefits

959
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
You are

960
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
You achieve through meditation

961
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,383
Bye

962
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,919
Buy gradual

963
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
Indoctrination

964
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,991
Can you associate them with this

965
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
Group

966
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
I am

967
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
I don't know

968
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:55,135
I've read I read a bunch of stuff about

969
00:47:55,391 --> 00:48:01,535
About the practices they have and it's good

970
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,583
Traditional

971
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,607
Meditation

972
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:11,007
And start going into like a autobiography of a yogi and floating and

973
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,847
So fly

974
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,639
I'll just go ahead and jump into the

975
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:23,039
ATM stuff might as well we've already broached the subject

976
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,343
What David Lynch

977
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,367
She is going to

978
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,927
Didn't do a little bit here on this episode

979
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,975
Does who who sells

980
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
Do you know people like

981
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
Jim Carrey

982
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,535
Google list

983
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,559
Celebrity practice

984
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
The Amazon

985
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
The mile-long

986
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,447
It's really good for you

987
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
But

988
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,543
They claim and their the hook

989
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,335
Is that it's a relaxation Bass

990
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,871
I like you

991
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,175
You know that's how you open the door

992
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,223
But

993
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,759
You have to you have to get in

994
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
You have to pay for class

995
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,623
I generally speaking they're about $1,000

996
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,903
Or more

997
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,743
Unless you get them through your school

998
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,815
Cuz a lot of schools have meditation program

999
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,095
Moms that are done through

1000
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
Transcendental Meditation

1001
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,679
I did not know that they do those the students don't really have

1002
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,215
To pay for those but of course not

1003
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:19,359
Going to subsidize Transcendental Meditation.

1004
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:23,455
I don't know I don't know

1005
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
I haven't done enough Research into that too

1006
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:31,135
Like say where the schools are that are doing it but I'm a little uncomfortable with it because of its Brandon

1007
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,159
Worry just

1008
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,207
Can kidsmeditation I be totally into

1009
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
A+

1010
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,327
And I am School Transcendental Meditation

1011
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
You pay for these classes

1012
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,167
URI undergo a ritual

1013
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
Call Sachi

1014
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:48,031
I called the Puja I don't like Rachel's at the end

1015
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,055
A mantra

1016
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:55,711
That's supposed to be your personal Mantra and met in the idea of it is sort of that if you tell anyone what your Mantra is

1017
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
Then it stops working

1018
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,295
Which is a way that they

1019
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,135
That way they can just give out the same mantra.

1020
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,975
Because of the nature of this

1021
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,255
Puja ceremony

1022
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:13,375
They're trying to present this idea that they're creating a personalized mantra

1023
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,679
It's leaks then

1024
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,447
Documents

1025
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,751
The show that how they choose the mantras

1026
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,823
That's the only thing that's based on

1027
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,151
And so they get around that

1028
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,431
Now

1029
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,223
Disappointing like

1030
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:28,991
Even a good

1031
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,295
Comment along those lines

1032
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,319
I can do some cold reading

1033
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:37,183
Is a little bit of intuitive like seeing if you're falling for this

1034
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:41,279
You need to push harder or if you're going along

1035
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:44,095
People who have been

1036
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
Charles Manson

1037
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
Charles Manson

1038
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,471
Well here's the interesting thing I wanted

1039
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,519
Demontra thing

1040
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,287
Is

1041
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
Arbitrary

1042
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,383
Words what is your mom

1043
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:00,479
Well t.i. I actually fooled around with this a little bit in the past

1044
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,527
Speak to

1045
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,063
Affect

1046
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
Let's say

1047
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,951
Video of years ago from a guy who used to be a

1048
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,743
Teacher of Transcendental Meditation

1049
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,815
The group speaking out again

1050
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,143
Practices of

1051
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,935
How it is essentially

1052
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,239
Like the Puja ritual that you go in

1053
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
It's basically induct

1054
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,335
It's putting you in a trance like

1055
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,127
Giving you this mantra

1056
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,663
And then there's a bunch of follow-up

1057
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,223
S*** you have these like procession

1058
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,247
You have to go to today

1059
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,343
If you're doing it right with the reflex

1060
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,463
Hammer of that transfer

1061
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,231
Teaching YouTube

1062
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
Get into the trance

1063
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:44,767
State yourself

1064
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,583
The Mantra that they give you is super unimportant

1065
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,887
It's just the act of repeating this thing

1066
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,935
And so the guy was explaining

1067
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:56,287
Yeah the guy was explains all you have to do is basically choose a slightly long thing

1068
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,639
Really have a necessary meaning

1069
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,943
To much of a meaning

1070
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,247
Your brain will like about the meaning

1071
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,319
And so I came up with something and I tried it and like

1072
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,135
If you if you do put in like a good

1073
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,671
20 minutes half hour

1074
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,207
Couple times doing that

1075
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,999
Like I did reach some

1076
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,047
I'm sort of a state that I would describe as all

1077
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,607
Like it was a

1078
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
My body felt

1079
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:26,239
Entirely different my brain felt like I was going to different plates it was incredibly powerful

1080
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,775
Like I felt it felt great

1081
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:34,175
Especially devoid of the teachings of

1082
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:38,271
Outside of their grasp or whatever I think that the method of

1083
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,551
Induct inducing a

1084
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,575
Transcend yourself

1085
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,367
Susie's pretty effect

1086
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
Kit from from my

1087
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,439
Admittedly Limited

1088
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,463
Exploration

1089
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:52,863
But now if you were doing that answer on with the Zen Buddhism in the pasture

1090
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,911
With Zen Buddhism

1091
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,727
You just kind of get there and you shut the fuk up

1092
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,519
Bright

1093
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
I meant

1094
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,847
There's a hundred schools of meditation

1095
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
Another better than

1096
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,431
Any other they're all just different routes to quiet

1097
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,455
Or whatever

1098
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,271
State that I got in

1099
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,551
I imagine

1100
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
Achieving that state

1101
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,135
In the presence of people who are trained

1102
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,415
To induce that

1103
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
State

1104
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,975
I think it would be

1105
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,767
Incredibly vulnerable thing

1106
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,351
Scares the s*** out of me the idea that this

1107
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,655
Millions of dollar organization

1108
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,495
The charges people tons of money and has a bunch of celebrity pimping it

1109
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,799
Is sort of based around that

1110
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,383
Like the reports that I've read of the ceremony

1111
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Is are like

1112
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,431
They're manipulative

1113
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,455
F***

1114
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,015
Lake DDS Central tees

1115
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,599
The essential pieces of it are basically undergoing

1116
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
Like ritualize thing

1117
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,183
Is where the instructor tells you to do things

1118
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,487
Which is tacitly you submitting

1119
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,047
Then you get put in a trance state

1120
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,071
You're taught this

1121
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,095
Mantra

1122
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,143
And then you're able to read

1123
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,167
France

1124
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
Yourself

1125
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:04,799
And I don't think I don't think it any worse than giving you the Holy Ghost

1126
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,687
I don't think that you said something about it that I own

1127
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,991
Not for my church

1128
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,271
Of course not

1129
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:17,855
Either of us if you have those those like really

1130
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,903
Wildly Evangelical Church

1131
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
Is with me you like

1132
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
Touching

1133
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:26,303
Pan beat up like that a lot of those do also

1134
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,679
Do you know Susie like chanting and the jumping around with your trying to do is make you lose your breath a little bit

1135
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,471
There are those

1136
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,519
What are the

1137
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:41,663
I but II we're not talkin about them today because they aren't the guest on Infowars

1138
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,503
The issue that you come to is that like the

1139
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
You get into it

1140
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,295
The more the turtle

1141
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,319
It's revealed to you

1142
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,367
The idea that it's relaxation

1143
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,415
Clearing your head and creativity

1144
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,719
Sort of Fades away in the later stages

1145
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
If you keep going

1146
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,535
You end up learning all kinds

1147
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,303
Good things about life

1148
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,607
Spiritual Purity moral perfection

1149
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,631
Getting in touch with

1150
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,935
With the cosmic consciousness

1151
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,727
Eventually their weekend

1152
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
Retreats that explain like

1153
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Communing with

1154
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,567
God consciousness

1155
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,383
Oh that's great personalized you can get in touch with

1156
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
She's really f***** up

1157
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,431
Considering they're charging

1158
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,455
Tons of money for all the

1159
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,759
I don't I don't like anything.

1160
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,783
Eventually

1161
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,391
Level right if you just

1162
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:26,463
If you just give us more money you're going to get to reach the next level

1163
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,999
Speaking of which

1164
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:33,375
You can become a policy wonk

1165
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,679
So I think I think

1166
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,471
You can use the technique

1167
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,007
Transcendental

1168
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
Meditation teaches

1169
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,311
2 as a conduit

1170
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
Too good meditation

1171
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,127
I sincerely think that's okay

1172
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,967
Of

1173
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,735
Church

1174
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,343
I think you can do that but

1175
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,367
I have

1176
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,903
I have some very serious misgivings

1177
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,183
About

1178
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,975
Transcendental Meditation

1179
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
As an organ

1180
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
Innovation

1181
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,047
And then further I think

1182
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
That

1183
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,607
Careful

1184
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,911
With this sort of method

1185
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,959
Inducing a transfer meditation

1186
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,239
Because

1187
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,775
There is a slight

1188
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,799
Dissociation

1189
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
Comes along with

1190
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:14,847
And again I can

1191
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
Can speak to that

1192
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
In terms of the

1193
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,455
The experience that I had when I was using the

1194
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,247
There was a semi

1195
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
Detachment from my body

1196
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
Detachment from my brain

1197
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,647
Have to get off this

1198
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,231
It wasn't that full but I do worry like

1199
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,279
There are tons and tons of stories of people who have had

1200
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
Psychotic break

1201
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,607
Because

1202
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,911
Of the implicit Association

1203
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
They can reinforce

1204
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,727
Dangerous ideas that

1205
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,287
You may have about like things not being real

1206
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
The stories you can find about

1207
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,687
That's not good

1208
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:54,271
Did have to go to rehab or Hospital

1209
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,599
Not know you could do that

1210
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,927
Dissociation and trance stuff which can exacerbate underlying can

1211
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,767
It's not something that should be undertaken

1212
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:05,791
Lightly

1213
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,071
And I don't

1214
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,351
I don't know that

1215
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
From what I can find

1216
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
I don't think

1217
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,679
The Transcendental Meditation

1218
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,215
Organization is

1219
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,239
Careful

1220
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:15,775
With with

1221
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,543
Power of the

1222
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,335
Did not realize

1223
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:21,663
Yeah

1224
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,711
Take to see if you're healthy enough for

1225
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,527
Active sex life

1226
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,343
I think this meditation last longer than 4 hours

1227
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,927
Pretty long at Stanford

1228
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:37,279
I think they're like if you're just doing like mindfulness meditation or something like that

1229
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,047
Real Bass

1230
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,327
Your earring

1231
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,863
In the clear

1232
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,191
Other other techniques

1233
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:46,751
Rite Aid

1234
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,055
Can be I can be a little little much

1235
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,943
I think I think it would be the same thing with

1236
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,479
Do you know if you look at

1237
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,271
Almost any cultures

1238
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
Yoga practice

1239
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,599
You know I think you do end up with

1240
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,391
You know what the whirling dervishes

1241
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,671
Hey dude

1242
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
Dissociate

1243
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,207
To a certain extent

1244
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:06,975
Advice

1245
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,255
Write a lot of culture

1246
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,279
Truth have

1247
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,815
The idea of the

1248
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,839
Communion with God

1249
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,911
Implicit within it is dissociation from yourself

1250
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,703
And that's not always

1251
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
I don't know

1252
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
Can a fine line here

1253
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,847
The real bottom of it

1254
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,431
Ultimately consciousness

1255
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:37,183
Everybody realizes implicitly at the very like base level

1256
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,231
Being aware sucks

1257
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:42,815
Like don't you wish you were unaware don't you wish you weren't

1258
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,607
I think I think

1259
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:47,679
Just a bundle of instincts and hurt your love

1260
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,751
You using a Tango where is the wrong word I think

1261
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:54,079
I think it's more are you tired of being yourself

1262
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,103
41 a little break

1263
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
From

1264
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,639
Normal

1265
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,919
Whatever

1266
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
Anyway

1267
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,967
I just think

1268
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,247
It's interesting

1269
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
Play coffin

1270
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,343
Alex Jones

1271
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,903
Mtume I think David Lynch

1272
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,183
Is a little bit more of a villa

1273
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,743
Because he has

1274
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,279
The David Lynch Foundation

1275
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,815
Transcendental Meditation

1276
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,655
Have you selling a flex because they casted Kyle McLaughlin

1277
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,471
But to assume that should never have

1278
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,263
It look

1279
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:29,919
I don't I want to get into casting decision

1280
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,455
Either

1281
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,479
I love

1282
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:37,343
Fan

1283
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,391
He's on here to pimp this book

1284
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,719
Can the big fish and that's just a book that

1285
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,999
Extolling the virtues

1286
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,279
Transcendental Meditation

1287
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,559
Automatically

1288
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:48,095
Ebooks

1289
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,423
Transcendental Meditation don't tell you the techniques

1290
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
Or anything like that

1291
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:59,359
To go to the classes right that's part of it

1292
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,151
Thousand dollars

1293
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
The people who are the

1294
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,735
The teachers have to sign an oath

1295
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,271
Includes the following Passage

1296
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:11,135
I acknowledge the prior to receiving the training I had no prior knowledge of such a system of teaching

1297
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:14,207
That there is no other available Source where the knowledge

1298
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,487
Such teaching may be obtained

1299
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,815
That such training is secret unique

1300
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,119
I'm a link in the chain of organization

1301
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,399
Seems that you have founded

1302
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:25,215
Purity of the teaching and movement

1303
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:28,799
You have laid down the wise rule that should I ever cease to teach at

1304
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
I'm feeling the blank

1305
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,335
Organization

1306
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:34,687
Or any other organization founded by you for the purpose of teaching Transcendental Meditation

1307
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,783
I may be restrained by appropriate process from using the secret teaching

1308
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,855
Transcendental Meditation imparted to me

1309
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,135
It's probably the law

1310
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:46,975
I mean the way I read that is that an implied gag order

1311
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,999
Copyright

1312
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,535
Occidental

1313
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,327
Meditation techniques

1314
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,119
I think that's what that

1315
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:01,567
Essentially a contract we're like I won't respect this a secret at unique

1316
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,383
And if I ever leave I wouldn't tell these secrets

1317
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:10,783
Conditions

1318
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,343
Think it's like a differently worded non-disclosure agreement

1319
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,647
A lot of

1320
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,415
People

1321
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,439
Maybe

1322
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
I've held to it

1323
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,047
2018 plenty of people who come out

1324
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,095
Explained exactly what is going on

1325
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,935
But David Lynch's book The catching a big fish is not going to be like here's the techniques

1326
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,495
You can use at the end

1327
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:34,591
Out the Workshop near you or whatever

1328
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,407
And so is his appearance

1329
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,431
Infowars

1330
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,199
But

1331
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,063
But

1332
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,087
We know

1333
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,111
Have

1334
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,903
Established

1335
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,183
Do you want to talk about

1336
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,999
He wants to talk about his book that is selling fan

1337
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,023
Transcendental Meditation

1338
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,071
Alex still has a different goal

1339
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,863
We haven't established yet

1340
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
After he is

1341
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
Been butting his

1342
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:03,263
His head up against the wall with the stupid question that have nothing to do with David Lynch just said

1343
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,311
I don't think

1344
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,359
Appointment next clip but

1345
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,687
Evil is a strain

1346
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Think about

1347
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,527
There's plenty of it

1348
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,063
Especially just on the

1349
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,343
Surface of our world

1350
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,135
And and

1351
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,951
You know what's in a ball with

1352
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,975
Negativity

1353
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:28,095
And negativity is like a

1354
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,423
Negativity

1355
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,751
Who sings float Nana's

1356
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,031
And we got it a big

1357
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,127
And if you want to blow that

1358
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,407
Negativity away

1359
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,687
All you have to

1360
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,479
Is wearing

1361
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,271
Died within

1362
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,111
Everyone

1363
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
U-GRO that light up

1364
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,231
And a side effect of that is negativity

1365
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,815
D2 enlightenment

1366
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:01,119
The full potential of the human being is there

1367
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
And the keto

1368
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,679
Peace On Earth Is there

1369
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:08,287
Very very beautiful

1370
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,823
Ryder

1371
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,183
Any of your latest films are works

1372
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:29,279
Is there any archetype

1373
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,863
World War II

1374
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
No

1375
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,031
Direct

1376
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,311
No

1377
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:46,431
Throat again no again Lynch's going off on this

1378
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,199
Like

1379
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:49,503
You know

1380
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,271
Can see the ocean

1381
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
Three stars

1382
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
You specifically like

1383
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,415
Advocating the Bennett

1384
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:01,535
Transcendental Meditation World TV

1385
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:06,911
No big deal if you don't Transcendental Meditation all I'm saying is that you're the reason Wars happen

1386
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,103
Instead goes to the

1387
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,687
It seems like he was really close to being like

1388
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,223
Stop talking about this whole motion

1389
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,807
Well so at this point Alex is like

1390
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,599
Come out with it and ask you a question

1391
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:29,439
Like dipping his

1392
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,719
Towing

1393
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:37,375
Movies filmed

1394
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,167
Let's mix it up on the erect

1395
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,471
Clip

1396
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,055
David Lynch Noah's what Alex wants to ask

1397
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,591
Alex

1398
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
Keeps being like

1399
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,151
I want you to bring this up

1400
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,967
I don't want to be an a****** you bring this up

1401
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:55,551
But sooner or later I'm going to be an a****** David a where

1402
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:56,831
No

1403
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,391
You know what they say that

1404
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,719
Reflects our world

1405
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,047
And I think that ideas come out of

1406
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,583
You know her

1407
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,119
Are feeling the world in

1408
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:17,823
The ideas themselves that I get our separate

1409
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,591
Message

1410
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,151
Me to you know do anything at this time

1411
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,175
Ideas that you get

1412
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,711
You fall in love with them

1413
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,503
You see the way Cinema

1414
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,295
Translate those ideas

1415
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,343
David Lynch's explained

1416
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,111
Creativity

1417
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,135
Right

1418
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:34,463
The creative process really good job so far

1419
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
And then you're rolling

1420
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,071
And a whole thing comes out

1421
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:42,399
And only later as more and more of it comes out.

1422
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,447
Simard UCF

1423
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,471
You know like that

1424
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,751
You don't set out to

1425
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,287
Calamansi

1426
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,319
You commented

1427
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,391
Hellboy

1428
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,023
Just commented on the film loose change

1429
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,815
Yeah you wanna.

1430
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:15,423
Do you want on Dutch television in the interviewer asked him about that

1431
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,471
Glue strain

1432
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,495
I don't know

1433
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,055
It's very weird but

1434
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,895
He's sitting there anyways like I have a lot of questions about 9/11

1435
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:31,295
He talks about 9/11

1436
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
Well

1437
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,367
Not really Alex's

1438
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,159
David Lynch's just confused

1439
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,231
So on

1440
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,255
In the

1441
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,791
Where is New York

1442
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,583
Say anything in the clip I watched

1443
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,887
You didn't say anything negative about

1444
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,911
Lustre

1445
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,447
She doesn't say anything

1446
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,495
Let's to say like they're right

1447
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,799
About their conclusion

1448
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,103
These sorts of questions

1449
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,639
Make you look

1450
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,407
At what you see

1451
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:02,783
You think you experienced in a different way and I have questions that I don't I don't understand

1452
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,319
Like the Pentagon

1453
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,343
The hole in the building

1454
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,159
Is too small for a plane I don't understand what happened

1455
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,207
These questions haven't been answered

1456
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,535
And then the host is like I

1457
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,095
What about the ideas that the

1458
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,423
He's like those sorts of ideas are too big

1459
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,191
For people to think

1460
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,007
Like your brain can't handle those sorts of ideas

1461
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,031
The ram

1462
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,079
He's implying that the

1463
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,615
Kyle McLaughlin

1464
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,383
Antebellum

1465
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,967
So

1466
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,735
Alex wants

1467
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,759
They can get the horse

1468
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,295
I want to talk 911

1469
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,319
Dubrow

1470
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,855
That's all he wanted to get to

1471
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,391
You know what now that I go back

1472
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,159
Can think about it

1473
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
Did

1474
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,695
I don't think

1475
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,791
I don't think Alex gave him the Mulholland Drive credit

1476
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,983
Alex doesn't like Mulholland Drive

1477
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,287
Fire walk with me

1478
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,895
This leads to the two of them talking about

1479
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,599
Deal

1480
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,183
Why why

1481
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:19,071
You know I knew they were going to bring it up

1482
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,351
And

1483
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,167
What I said

1484
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,007
Yeah we're we're all you know like

1485
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,055
Detectives human beings are

1486
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,335
Detective

1487
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,127
Like-for-like

1488
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:38,783
Even for context clues I can't figure out if he was saying the light detector was or we are

1489
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,599
Similar to detective I have no idea

1490
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,903
It's within character to say either

1491
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,463
Immediately after Transit

1492
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,487
Meditation

1493
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,791
We were like

1494
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,351
Do he's going to talk about light and darkness

1495
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,631
Add about how like

1496
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,423
The answer to Darkness

1497
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,447
Is adding more light

1498
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,775
Sorry I do think you might be saying we're like Detectives

1499
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,055
I have no idea

1500
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,847
Look at our world

1501
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,151
And we keep looking at it

1502
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,455
Can we get these

1503
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,223
Feeling

1504
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,527
There's more going on than

1505
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
CI

1506
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,111
And you know this is a

1507
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:17,183
It's a world of Clues the world of

1508
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,743
Mystery but the mystery can get you know

1509
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,279
Can get salt

1510
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,303
And

1511
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,607
You can

1512
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,143
Find these answers

1513

A lot of these things

1515
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,215
Within

1516
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:32,543
As far as 9/11 goes

1517
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,823
What bears

1518
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,591
You know

1519
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,895
There's things that

1520
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
Esau

1521
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,223
The Conjuring

1522
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
Question

1523
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,783
And wondering

1524
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
And some

1525
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,343
He doesn't seem

1526
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,367
Quite right

1527
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,903
So it makes us

1528
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,671
Wonder

1529
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,975
We need

1530
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,279
We need

1531
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
That's all

1532
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,191
Before 911

1533
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,103
Was just trying to brag that he predicted 9/11

1534
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,783
Infowars 2000

1535
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
Before you

1536
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,487
Call Dad

1537
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,167
America

1538
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:45,759
Hell

1539
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,623
Exposing

1540
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,791
You have concerning my love

1541
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,327
I have the same

1542
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,607
They were brought up in all this

1543
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
You mentioned

1544
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,167
And I just don't have the

1545
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:09,823
911

1546
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,847
Turism

1547
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,407
Is there like there's a lot of really weird stuff

1548
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,199
But the explanations given

1549
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,991
I meant I think this is what he saying

1550
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,039
Because in the end

1551
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,111
And it any of these 9/11 documentaries that you're going to watch

1552
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
My reason quotes

1553
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,671
What you're going

1554
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,439
To find

1555
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,463
If you're going to find

1556
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,487
Answers

1557
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:32,607
You know what I mean they provide an answer and if you if you are David Lynch

1558
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
And you have

1559
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,143
Leesville

1560
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,447
And you're coming away from it saying like

1561
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:39,775
I got I got questions about a lot of this stuff

1562
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:44,127
And you don't have answers that means you're rejecting the answers that are given in documentary

1563
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,431
Implied

1564
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:52,831
Did you like this is unsatisfactory as an explanation but I'm still an option

1565
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,879
Right

1566
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:59,231
You know what I think especially as we are people who do a

1567
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,511
Podcast about it

1568
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,535
Propagandistic

1569
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,071
Theorist

1570
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:08,191
I think there is a pressure to have an answer and I appreciate David Lynch coming down here being like

1571
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,727
Panthers

1572
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,103
I have no idea

1573
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,663
I have no idea

1574
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
By weird things

1575
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,759
Questions answers

1576
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,343
Can ask me that question

1577
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,487
Ship documentary.

1578
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:34,559
That's a good one

1579
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,351
Check out their bibliography

1580
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,191
I don't know actually cuz it wasn't so just ask

1581
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,751
G Blake

1582
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,519
Produced it

1583
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,311
So they might actually

1584
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,335
Have an article

1585
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,639
Anyway

1586
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,663
Lynch's Inc

1587
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,199
Questions not answers

1588
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,479
Leads into this

1589
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,759
Which I think is

1590
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,295
Fanciful bulshit

1591
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,095
Unless there were a controlled demolition

1592
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,375
I understand Alex

1593
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
Do you know

1594
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,191
Are there spirits

1595
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,239
This question

1596
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,799
The rising from each of the events that day

1597
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,359
I don't have the

1598
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,919
I just have the

1599
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,455
The you know

1600
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,551
Instinct means I'm hungry I want

1601
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:33,183
Is 4011

1602
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,863
When you learn to dive with him

1603
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,143
Which is so

1604
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,167
Beautiful image

1605
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:43,935
Experience

1606
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,703
Human

1607
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,983
Human neck

1608
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,543
Experience the new understand 9/11

1609
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,079
Impact the ocean of

1610
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
Knowing that

1611
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,383
Your vibrant

1612
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943
Intuition growth

1613
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
Intuition is like

1614
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,759
It's an ocean of solute

1615
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,087
You get this is going

1616
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,927
You know it

1617
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
You know

1618
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,463
Call Art

1619
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,999
Processes and

1620
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,279
Call creative process

1621
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,559
Nothing we do is

1622
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,327
Man

1623
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,863
Doesn't you know start with

1624
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,143
It starts

1625
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:14,911
Idea

1626
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,703
Catching those ideas

1627
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,239
Being away

1628
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,775
I'm going away.

1629
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,567
Translate.

1630
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,407
And make it feel correct based on the eye

1631
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
Idea

1632
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,735
It just goes like

1633
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,503
Fat

1634
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:33,087
At this point I think what he's essentially pushing is

1635
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,903
911 is solvable

1636
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:36,927
Through transcendental

1637
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,559
Ninety-nine percent sure that

1638
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,607
What he's telling out

1639
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:50,239
That's a weird thing for him to say

1640
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,775
Considering he doesn't have any answers

1641
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:58,175
All the time

1642
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,319
Complete enlighten me

1643
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:07,647
Understand where the 9/11 questions are

1644
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,439
That's where the answers are

1645
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:15,839
You have to be calling

1646
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,863
About 9/11

1647
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,935
There's a hundred bucks a month

1648
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,335
You can't wait to hear the audio drop for that way

1649
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,103
I'll tell you that right

1650
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,151
I think there is a p

1651
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,943
Piece of this Theory self-contradictory

1652
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,967
You just brought up

1653
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,527
Which is that idea that like answers are within

1654
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:38,623
I am one of the world's most leading transcendental meditators

1655
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,415
And I'm telling you I don't have an

1656
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:43,231
Which leads me to believe just using

1657
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:46,303
Haven BB then see

1658
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,863
I even sort of argument you don't

1659
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,911
Dancers aren't with it

1660
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:55,263
But I'm going to take away

1661
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,079
23 Pages released

1662
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,359
Intuition going when we

1663
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,127
See things

1664
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
Powerball

1665
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,415
Handle

1666
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,975
WhatsApp contact

1667
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,375
At what will what did you just say in the beginning

1668
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,031
F****** talking about

1669
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,055
That brain of ours

1670
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,615
He say we only use five or 10% of it

1671
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:35,199
Nobody says that

1672
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,735
Show you that when you

1673
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,575
Oriental deepest level of life

1674
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,111
Full brain

1675
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,135
He is engaged

1676
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,951
And it's the only Xperia

1677
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,511
Brings the whole

1678
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,279
Brain

1679
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:53,631
Into you know quotes

1680
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,679
Brainstorming

1681
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,239
Thinking you know.

1682
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:01,567
Do it

1683
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,103
So Alex

1684
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,919
Super brainstorming is what he's talking about

1685
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,479
But because David Lynch hasn't used

1686
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
Specific languages

1687
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,551
It's really going to set off the buzzers

1688
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:16,671
He's allowing like what he said very like

1689
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,463
Transcending

1690
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:23,071
Allows you to use all of your brain

1691
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,351
These RTM talkin

1692
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,631
Scarlett Johansson

1693
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:28,191
Great Neck trying to indoctrinate Alex's audio

1694
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,263
He's trying to use this appearance

1695
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,079
From Christ

1696
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,359
Oh boy

1697
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,711
That's why David Lynch one on info

1698
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,503
That's not off brand

1699
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:46,367
Kind of does that in almost every interview

1700
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,671
I'm not going for the Transcendental Meditation

1701
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,463
No I bet

1702
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,511
Seducing

1703
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,791
Everyone

1704
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:04,287
That's not what I'm talking about the other side of this bridge

1705
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,335
I think you understood a word I've said this in

1706
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,431
They come back

1707
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,967
From break and then at this point

1708
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,247
It just sort of turns into

1709
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,271
Sales pitch

1710
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,551

Fusion more 21

1714
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,567
You know Alex it's it's

1715
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,103
Something we just don't

1716
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,895
Hear so much about in the western

1717
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,199
So much misunderstanding about meditation

1718
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
There's so many

1719
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,247
Kinds of meditation

1720
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,551
But there truly is

1721
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,575
A Within

1722
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,647
And if you think about it so many steps

1723
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,695
Since we've heard have the word with him

1724
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,255
Within within within the fence

1725
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,559
Wizard of Oz

1726
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,119
The Kingdom of Heaven which lies within

1727
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,399
And all else

1728
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,423
Will be added unto

1729
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,079
Experiencing that deep

1730
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,855
Problems on the surface

1731
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,191
Know thyself

1732
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,471
Strfkr

1733
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:42,847
And once things get better

1734
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:44,895
Shirley

1735
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,039
He has his gold

1736
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,855
Christopher Walken interview to rehab in it

1737
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,903
And for him to just randomly be like

1738
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,927
We cooked

1739
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,719
I love this salad

1740
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:00,511
9/11 was an inside job

1741
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,815
And these tomatoes that he made

1742
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,839
F****** incredible

1743
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,399
Put pepper on them

1744
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
He really got

1745
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:11,519
Some butter in their kind of baked it a little bit 9/11 was an inside job

1746
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,824
I made the chicken with also had steak

1747
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,664
Because we're hey we're very rich I think walk-ins crazy like a

1748
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,968
Enough to not do that

1749
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:26,368
Akira probably I imagined to be in the middle of talking about that salad they were making

1750
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:31,488
Say something crazy and walk away just knowing that I'm not here

1751
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,632
Continental

1752
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,776
Crazy

1753
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:47,360
Well I don't want to talk to him about that

1754
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:50,176
But David Lynch I could take his credit

1755
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:53,760
He knows that like I'm not going to talk 911 with you I'm going

1756
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,576
How to use your questions in your repeated badgering

1757
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:59,648
Chamoy

1758
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:04,768
As a way to like hey 9/11 just one of the problems on this Physical Realm surface

1759
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:07,072
When in reality all religions

1760
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:13,472
Have been talking about the within that only we can really give you access to worship

1761
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,032
Exactly

1762
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,616
So here's the last clip of it takes us out of the interview and again

1763
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
Strathmore

1764
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,920
It's Lynch

1765
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,688
Shillingford

1766
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:41,376
Call Vicky Quest Power Switch

1767
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:46,240
Because you know all I ever ask me questions

1768
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
You know

1769
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,080
It is when you see that

1770
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,128
Make you wonder about

1771
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:56,224
Theme

1772
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:08,512
Pictures of the building question

1773
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:17,216
I like those pronunciation

1774

Steel

1775
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,080
There's so much

1776
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,104
Mini problem

1777
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,128
In our world

1778
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,664
So much

1779
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
Negativity

1780
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,992
Don't worry about the dark

1781
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,784
Turn on the light

1782
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Darkness

1783
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,344
Automatically goes

1784
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:42,560
Help do that for yourself

1785
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:53,824
Activity one of the selling points on Transcendental Meditation

1786
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,592
Website

1787
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,384
In terms of like there

1788
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,688

1789
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:01,760
Like that is a dramatically decreased into

1790
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,528
Dental terrorism

1791
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:05,344
Sure

1792
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,160
Even part of the eyes

1793
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:14,560
It's hard to sell on their website it's like

1794
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:20,192
Transcendental Meditation it's hard give you a mantra and that Mantra will be

1795
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:27,360
Studies about Transcendental Meditation is really difficult to tell how much of it

1796
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,640
Should be trusted

1797
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,432
I am quite frankly I don't have the key

1798
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,224
Kind of time to go pour over all the

1799
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,552
Details for just one episode 339

1800
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,672
Cuz a lot of it a lot of the research has been done by proponents

1801
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,696
Transcendental Meditation

1802
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:47,584
It looks like their methodology is good but it's really tough to say they may have a dog

1803
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,352
In the fighter.

1804
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:52,448
Right I mean like statistical studies generally are not accepted and left.

1805
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,472
Through independent

1806
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:59,872
I don't know I don't know enough

1807
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:00,896
To say

1808
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,456
A pun

1809
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:05,248
On studies about

1810
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,272
Transcendental Meditation

1811
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:10,112
But if it is just going through being made about like relaxation

1812
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,160
Increase happiness

1813
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,208
Get that with all sorts of meditation

1814
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,744
It stopped

1815
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,024
It's tough to take the

1816
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,328
The practice and the organization

1817
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,864
And deal with them separate

1818
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,168
Related to practice does have been

1819
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,448
But the organization

1820
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,728
Is a manipulative

1821
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,496
Squirrely

1822
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,080
Call religion

1823
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:31,872
That's fair enough

1824
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,944
And then we remembered really doing

1825
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,712
Something

1826
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,296
Bring bring that light of unity

1827

All diversity

Is appreciated in the light

1829

Of unity

1830
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,464
It will be so beautiful so easy

1831

1854
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,888

Parting shot with

1858
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,968
I'm trying one more time

1859
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:14,784
Hey Google

1860
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:19,904
This is a classic Alex Jones interview with someone he admires

1861
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,928
Their work

1862
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,696
And that like

1863
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,976
If you can't be a dick to them

1864
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,768
Strfkr

1865
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,304
The other person has a goal

1866
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,912
It's a terrible interview conversation

1867
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:34,752
Course at least trying to engage with the things Alex says

1868
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:37,568
And weave them into what he wants to talk about where's Alex

1869
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,592
Just keep talking.

1870
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:39,872
Now

1871
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,640
I think it's

1872
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,176
Disgraceful that Alex Jones

1873
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,456
Even if

1874
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:46,272
If I put myself in the head of someone who believes

1875
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:47,808
This world

1876
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:50,112
I think it's disgraceful that he had David Lynch on

1877
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,648
Because David Lynch

1878
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,416
Is a big

1879
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
Big

01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,488

1881
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
Movement

1882
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,024
Right now

1883
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,840
Who is Alex Jones's big anime

1884
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
Global

1885
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,168
Liberal

1886
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,728
The globalist work

1887
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:06,496
Towards

1888
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:12,128
You know what this point I really don't know like everything was big fear

1889
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,920

About believing in

Strong force out of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,504
Country

1921
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:57,344
From a 2001 article in the independent

1922
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,112
Quote

1923
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:04,512
Disciples of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi the Beatles

60 water found a Sovereign Nation in South America

1925
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:12,448
They've offered the government of Suriname 1.3 billion dollars over 3 years

1926
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:14,496
At least 35 Hundred Acres

1927
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:17,824

01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,872
Northeast of the capital.

1929
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,152
Paramaribo

1930
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,432
The proposed

1931
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:25,504
Global country of world peace wood minted

1932
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,272
Currency

1933
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,808
Maintain the central bank

1934
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,344
And have its own legal

1935
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,464
Enough money to spend 1.2 billion dollars

1936
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:40,352
Set alarm money

1937
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,984
Of the celebrities who are apart of the organization 8

1938
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,776
So many more than psychology

1939
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:52,384
Liking people just don't talk about it because it's not as scary and they don't have all that gay black male

1940
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:55,712
But you don't have don't have like

1941
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:58,528
Like Tom Cruise John Travolta are

1942
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,808
Massive star

1943
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:03,648
He's a big star but he's probably one of the most

1944
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,184
Famous vocal proponent

1945
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:08,512
Nearly on the level of Tom Cruise

1946
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,584
And that kind of helped Scientology they got a bigger guy

1947
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:14,144
But so they can trying to start their own country

1948
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:19,776
The country in Costa Rica

1949
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,080
And I quote

1950
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,616
You can't lease

1951
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,712
You get leased land and then say your country

1952
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,368
In in mid June of this year this is

1953
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,392
2002

1954
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:39,488
Some Costa Ricans were contacted by delegates of the religious organization

1955
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:41,280
Global country of world

1956
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:45,120
From then on the indigenous sector of the Central American

1957
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:46,400
Country was immersed

1958
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,424
In confrontation

1959
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,216
The even on almost reached

1960
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,240
Communal divisions in

1961
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,008
Physical fight

1962
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,360
It happened that the global country is an organization born in India but with a Dutch

1963
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,640
Legalization

1964
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,200
Supposedly you know they don't believe in

1965
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,736
And now supposedly

1966
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:04,320
Its main objective is to reach a single world country Without Borders

1967
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,600
With a single currency

1968
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,624
A single thought in

1969
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,648
In a single ruler

1970
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:10,976
King Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

1971
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,560
I want no

1972
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,608
I would like Global country World Peace

1973
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,144
You guys have a good old time

1974
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,424
I don't like having a king

1975
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:20,960
Even came

1976
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,240
Costa Rica to a point

1977
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:27,616
The king's Minister the dentist appointment Costa Rica on the margin

1978
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,408
And ignoring the Costa Rican state

1979
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,176
Aiden

1980
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,968
Has owned the currency ROM

1981
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,504
Equivalent

1982
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:36,576
Quizlet according to them to $10 on the unit

1983
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:43,232
The indigenous leader leader Lisandro Mendez under the charge of Kik

1984
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,280
Of Rica shanty rostra

1985
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,816
As Costa Rica was baptized

1986
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,608
As in Costa Rica he was baptized

1987
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,656
Received from the central

1988
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:54,496
Bank of Netherland the sum of 4 million dollars

1989
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:57,056
He begins to administer this new state

1990
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,616
Name his ministers and

1991
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:02,176
Receive a salary of $1,000

1992
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,480
This situation

1993
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,760
I think there's some translation

1994
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,064
The Situation's filled the page

1995
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,344
Imagine me

1996
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,392
Try the patience or whatever

1997
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,416
Exhausted the page

1998
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,952
Of the other indigenous

1999
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,744
Miss people's in area and their

2000
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:19,840
Send it was a disrespectful indigenous ancestral customs

2001
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
Ignorance of the country's reality

2002
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,424
The community's almost

2003
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,192
Confronted each other

2004
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,984
Summit favor and others again

2005
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:31,104
The cause was knowing that the global country was trying to acquire 7,000 hectares

2006
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,664
The plant organic bananas

2007
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:37,760
In addition to 7,000 hectares to establish the capital of the global country

2008
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,344
All of this in indigenous territory

2009
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:44,672
Finally they've learned something from the white

2010
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,952
From colonialism

2011
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:49,792
Thanks guys you took the right thing for

2012
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:50,816
Finally

2013
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,096
Costa Rican president

2014
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:56,960
The members of the sect to leave the country in the shortest time possible

2015
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,240
Integrity of the company

2016
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:00,032
Hey guys

2017
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:04,640
You can't have your own country go away so let's just look at these

2018
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,408
Little Things

2019
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,968
But I've brought up here at the end of this episode

2020
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,248
This

2021
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,296
Global country for World

2022
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:17,952
Which is a part of the transcendental organization

2023
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:24,352
Crazy guy you know what I want to say that there's a possibility that there's something Lost in Translation there to like

2024
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:27,424
The single ruler being King Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

2025
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:33,824
That might be translated correctly as possible but it might also be a thing where I like that single thought ruler

2026
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:38,432
Ideological ruler good but

2027
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,200
Right

2028
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:39,968
He was also

2029
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,992
Dead by 2000

2030
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,272
I'm to be there as it may

2031
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:45,600
Like what you have here is a a rank history

2032
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:48,160
Here in Costa Rica and Suriname

2033
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,720
Of them trying to buy land

2034
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:53,536
Impugn the territorial sovereignty of these countries

2035
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:58,912
Do you like

2036
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,936
Would be super again

2037
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:05,056
You have their larger goal this would just be the beginning of

2038
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:07,872
To create a one world government with one world

2039
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,224
You're being

2040
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,040
You want to create a nation Without Borders

2041
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:18,368
Narrow nationalism that divides

2042
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,136
Humanity

2043
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:22,976
You have things that are principally against with Alex Jones stands for

2044
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:29,376
When you talk about Lynch got to listen to talk about the global

2045
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:32,192
Alex Jones throws darts at all the f******

2046
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:35,264
Time as we discussed in the end game coverage

2047
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,056
Like you look at a hoss

2048
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:39,360
The leader of the council

2049
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,640
Council on Foreign Relations

2050
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:44,480
In his essay that he wrote about globalization and sovereignty

2051
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:47,296
He discusses the need to retain Sabra

2052
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,344
But to have the definition

2053
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,880
Being adjusted

2054
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,648
To reflect

2055
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,440
The fact that we live in a global world

2056
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:55,488
Right things that happen in other countries affect

2057
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,256
What happened

2058
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:58,048
To you and your sovereign country

2059
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:58,816
And

2060
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,864
Non-national organization

2061
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,400
Are affecting everybody

2062
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,960
That currently we have economies with outboard

2063
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,728
There is

2064
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,496
Nothing

2065
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,288
The stuff

2066
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:12,128
I've read from Alex Jones Boogeyman globalist

2067
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,920
Weather actually saying

2068
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,456
We want a One World Government

2069
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,272
Vade

2070
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,344
Yeah but

2071
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,648
