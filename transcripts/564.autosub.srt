1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge b b

3
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Flashlight.com

4
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,072
Sit around to drink novelty beverages to words without their sweet and talk a little bit about Alex

5
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,472
Oh indeed we are Dan had a little thing we were going to just

6
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,056
Old habits die hard

7
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
I don't know

8
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
What's your B

9
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
I mentioned this to you I decided I was going to give

10
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
Ohio another

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,232
And then I just go to Lost

12
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
Pinterest

13
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,304
And not make it very far into it

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,400
You were telling me that there's this at the New Ireland.

15
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,936
And so I decided I'll go

16
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
Give this a shot

17
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,496
You buried the lede

18
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
Holyshit

19
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
I went to Ireland almost immediately instead of horse you now can ride a giant cataract

20
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,112
The white bright spot is now I'm riding around

21
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
Discover it on your own cuz I knew you're going to go

22
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
It's the best

23
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,304
Horse

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,704
And I could be happy

25
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
Now the game is back in my good graces

26
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
And I'll probably finish it because I have

27
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
Cap-friendly

28
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,480
Striped throw as many pets at you in the

29
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
That is nice

30
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Yeah

31
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,672
My bright spot via as you made no

32
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
Or probably don't the French Open is going on right now

33
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,400
Good chance that Rafa and Djokovic are meeting for there roughly

34
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
Play 600 time

35
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,008
Djokovic head by one win

36
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,408
Closer the Kevin Owens

37
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:02,784
Destined destined to fight forever ever and ever and ever they're the two best that ever lived

38
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
Along with forever

39
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
And that's just going to be great tomorrow

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,464
Today or whatever you're listening to us

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
I imagine

42
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
Rob is going to wind up winning cuz Djokovic has looked a little bit shaky.

43
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
Is when the French Open 13ty

44
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,312
Feel like the French Open is happening like a week or two ago

45
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,640
Just keep happening

46
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:34,272
Is every every year so I feel like there's some tennis thing that I just always assumed as a

47
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
The French Open The Tabernacle

48
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
3130

49
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
Team French Open

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
True

51
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
So Jordan today we have an episode

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
From the past

53
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:53,728
Things are better Jordan shoes

54
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
In the present day

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
And

56
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
What are the things that was like alright I definitely don't have to

57
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
What about the past was that

58
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,712
I kept seeing people posting that picture of Alex at Astor

59
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Strip club

60
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,528
And I just lost my patience

61
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
With a depressive

62
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,880
I don't understand how being like

63
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
A viral tweet on Twitter

64
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
Like I don't I don't

65
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:20,095
Who cares instant reaction a lot of people were telling me about it and I was like that's

66
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Okay

67
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
He's a monster

68
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,519
Good for him he can go to a strip club

69
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,943
It doesn't it doesn't really it doesn't really make anything he doesn't make any

70
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
Larger Point other than like

71
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
I think there's something weird about going to a strip

72
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
I mean I suppose

73
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
You could

74
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,207
Probably try and make the argument that it's hypocritical for him to be

75
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
God blast it all day every day you met me at a strip club to talk your way around that

76
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,399
I'm a man

77
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
How are you could say

78
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,359
I went there cuz I had a business meeting and the people I was with one of those you don't understand what it's like to be in the higher echelons of business

79
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
The run-around business I'm totally

80
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
Yeah there's there's a hundred ways you could

81
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015
To get around the quote-unquote hypocrisies of it

82
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,343
I don't I don't know I didn't look into it too much but it looks like he was in a bathroom

83
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,671
Look I hate I do

84
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
I hate Alex Jones

85
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,815
I will say that if someone was taking a picture of him the bathroom I think I was a violation

86
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Of someone's right

87
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,167
Pics of privacy.

88
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
I don't I don't think

89
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,775
It's cool to take pictures of people in a bathroom

90
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,431
I don't know I imagine maybe he has a rebuttal to that but I don't want to

91
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,551
Talk about it I just don't care

92
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,647
2/20 blackjack

93
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,975
Damn it that's the wrong one again

94
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,047
This is. That I've been looking forward

95
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,607
The covering because as we know the debate

96
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
Application begin

97
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
Yes around this time

98
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,751
He's been screaming about how they're going to let the Bass party run every

99
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Everything

100
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
After taking over

101
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
Bushes in the globalist plan for

102
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
They're going

103
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
To be in charge of Iraq

104
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
Cuz they're basically CIA exactly

105
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,807
See how that would be affected

106
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Goodbye

107
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,439
You know how Alex is rhetoric

108
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,047
This is an over the weekend

109
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,887
What's goes to Kansas City to do that local radio station

110
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,751
We have a couple of dangling thread either going to come together in this episode

111
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
And I'm excited to get to it first

112
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
Let's say hello to some new walks

113
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,431

I like that one too

117
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
I would go to a CPA

118
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,399
I would go to that if it was a cold war theme Blazer Tag Place

119
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703

120
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,055

Pennsylvania

APA is a bunny charity like a rescue animal charity

Trying to expand and you can go to their website and donate if you want to help

128
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
Hell yeah

129
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:45,151
I was very close to trying to adopt one account

130
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455

131
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807

I'm a policy wonk

141
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455

Money off that heroin

Usually large

145
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,047
Thank you very much

146
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,447
Especially Tammy for donating to our show just to make sure everybody knows that I might have a stand-up

147
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,287
Video on YouTube

148
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,639
We're going to get into this here but first

149
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Steer is Nautica

150
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:03,231
Is a good thing

151
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:08,095
Holyshit I nailed it I did some of the things

152
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,983
Bethany felt like really Alex Jones

153
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
I do I do appreciate that

154
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
You got to love yourself

155
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
You know

156
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
So we start here on the 15th

157
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,343
It is a Thursday and

158
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
Is still covering the bombing

159
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
In Riyadh

160
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Didn't happen

161
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
I recently interviewed

162
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
You recall it was a residential complex

163
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,607
Compounds kind of area where a lot of westerners were known to live

164
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,959
In the intervening time since then some more information has come out about the

165
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Particular West

166
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,055
Turner's that we're living in these compounds that appear to be the target

167
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,383
Write that into this is what the Direction the Story is going to

168
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:58,783
Local Company

169
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
Where I said

170
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
Group is going to be involved

171
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
Well guess what

172
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,311
Guess who owned the company

173
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
Are wild

174
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,463
So the company in question that were apparently the targets of this 2003 bombing in Riyadh was the vanilla Corporation

175
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
It's a construction business that was founded in 1931

176
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,351
Has a deep history of international contracts

177
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Are you at Center

178
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
Princeton Street Vietnam War Vino was Tas

179
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,495
Asked with maintaining power plant

180
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Over there overseas

181
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:59,199
They're actually pretty well-known for this because in 1967 approximately 2,000 Korean workers at a vanilla plant in

182
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
Cameron Cameron Bay

183
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
Or dissatisfied enough with their conditions

184
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
They rioted

185
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,927
From Shelby standard the book the rise and fall of an American Army us ground forces in Vietnam 19th

186
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
65 to 1973

187
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
The primary cause appears to have been dissatisfaction with

188
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
The food served

189
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
Particularly the shortage of rice

190
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,703
The Koreans refuse to eat their Saturday meal on November 18th

191
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
Then went to the vanilla mess hall

192
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
Where they turned over tables and attacked several American

193
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
Before Steve Marriott

194
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,175
Can project manager to eat some of their food to show them how bad it was

195
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,271
Vanilla Corporation civilian took out his gun and shot three Korean

196
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
He was that Mama been severely injured

197
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
A Korean shot another American

198
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
4 days

199
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,511
I like you say company that does

200
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,559
Stuff for American government

201
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
Since 1931

202
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,775
Not since 1931 do they were founded in 1931

203
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:01,663
Government contracts in what are probably War zones or a lot of the time yes

204
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,735
Yeah a government contract began during the

205
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,063
The Chinese Civil War when they were hired to ship supplies meaning

206
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Weapons

207
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Duchesne Kai-shek

208
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,767
No weapons to Shanghai shek

209
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
I'm sweating again tomorrow

210
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Point there

211
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
What's really most notable about this company however is that in 1975 they landed a very lucrative contract to train.

212
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
Saudi Arabian National Guard

213
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,687
This is almost certain

214
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,015
This is almost certainly why they're building was a target for that attack

215
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
In Riyadh not some obscure connection

216
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Can people Alex

217
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
Insisting on connecting ever 12

218
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Back in 2000

219
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Impact their headquarter

220
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
In Saudi Arabia been baumbach in 1995

221
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Something

222
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Attic people

223
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
No to do yeah I mean your

224
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
So

225
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
This happen

226
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,775
I think that the people who would be trying to attack

227
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
The Saudi Arabian government

228
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Maybe some

229
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Rebel types or

230
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Terrorist

231
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Wouldn't know enough

232
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
To be like well

233
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
Let's not just

234
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,111
The tactic of helping with materials.

235
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,487
Here's the connection between Vino and Carlisle

236
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,863
A 1992 vento Corporation was Bob ibdm International Incorporated

237
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
Which in turn is owned by the Carlyle

238
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:32,031
However in 1997 BBM was purchased by TRW Incorporated

239
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,103
Which represented the end of their association with

240
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
The Carlyle Group

241
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
According to an article in the washer

242
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
The poster 1997 about the

243
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,575
The deal Carlyle had agreed to sell its entire stake and shares in the company to TRW in the acquisition

244
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,903
So there isn't even some minority ownership remaining to Alex

245
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
Pretend

246
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
Then in 2002

247
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
TRW was bought by Northrop Grumman

248
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
So the time Alex is recording this episode

249
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
And he wants to talk about this company in the context of the military-industrial complex is this would be the angle to take that we

250
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,567
Seems really simple to which is why you can't do it

251
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:11,967
By pointing fingers at the Carlyle Group Alex is making this piece of information fishes pre-written narratives about Bush but he's depriving the

252
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
The audience of access to any real contact

253
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
For the subject that he's cover

254
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,391
At the point Alex's on are here the Carlyle Group was six years removed

255
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
From selling videos parent company

256
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
And even if they were owners of vanilla's parent company

257
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Still at work

258
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Prove

259
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Yeah man

260
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
I mean

261
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
To a certain extent

262
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
I think

263
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
Once once you're talking

264
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
Talking about a company that been bought like

265
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
Three times in 6 years

266
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,735
I don't even know if any of these people have any idea what it is they're buying or selling at that highest level you know what I'm saying

267
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:51,135
What do you mean George W bush knows what's going on or anything like that he's got people who are just

268
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:56,255
We will do all that stuff is bumbling around like a fool I don't know

269
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
They don't know what they're doing if they're buying those kinds of companies and then selling them a year later for what I understand

270
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
For reading some of these articles

271
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,751
It was a period of time where there was rampant

272
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,567
Consolidation and murdering going on in terms of these

273
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Is international conch

274
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,895
Contractor rights

275
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:18,015
Let you know that's that's kind of explains a little bit of easy moving around right right

276
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
I don't know if

277
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
It just doesn't it's not compelling

278
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,879
Because you see the name Carlyle Group in the

279
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
Past of this company

280
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
I just

281
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
I don't know it's

282
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
It soft

283
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
Northrop Grumman is probably a

284
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,119
An easier name to just pull and be like problem

285
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,423
Doesn't come up at all

286
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
At all

287
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
The name Northrop Grumman doesn't come up at all in Alex's conversation steak indoors or come and see me

288
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
Can do it then anybody can do it Alex owns part of Northrop Grumman so it's all a conspiracy that he's trying to get people.

289
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,111
If anybody has founded

290
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,463
They're also apparently this operation is also apparently a

291
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,999
A front for the CIA

292
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,311
And the venelles one-time owners.

293
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,639
Crib

294
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
Articles

295
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Right now

296
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,487
One of the things that I've learned to be very careful about when dealing with speculative information

297
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
Claims that people are groups are fronts

298
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,399
Does an accusation that's really difficult to work with because generally speaking at the claimants

299
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
Constantly without proof

300
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:44,799
People who make the claim often seem to think that the burden of proof is on you to show that some group isn't

301
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
The front

302
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
Which is a trap

303
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,663
If you read any John Birch Society text or book

304
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
From the anti-communist

305
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
Crusaders that Alex loves

306
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,575
One of the first things you'll notice is that every single thing is asserted to be a Communist front

307
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
And none of it is ever so

308
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Substantiated

309
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,695
Gary Allan's book Communist Revolution in the streets

310
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:06,047
Accuses literally every civil rights organization every student activism group

311
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
And most bookstores are being communist

312
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
I'm not in the sense that like

313
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,959
Some communist my gravitate to these things like

314
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
You claiming with these exist exist

315
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Explicitly

316
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
Crops oh yeah the Communist Party

317
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
Barnes & Noble

318
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
If you

319
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,039
My point is that one of the rhetorical tricks that I have the least interest in

320
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,855
It is like an unsupported allegation that so

321
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Someone is a fraud

322
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
I was nonsense

323
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
So the question I just wrote down is like

324
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,607
After all these years what does Alex think the cia's portfolio actually looks like like if there was a

325
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,167
All of their fronts

326
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Jesus

327
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:49,823
So in the case of an article in the London Times about how they were formerly owned by the Carlyle Group

328
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,871
The Carlyle Group had a history of contract

329
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Thing with intelligence

330
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
Who's the headline that I was stalking

331
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
The thing

332
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,063
I would never come to you and say that vanilla

333
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,207
Absolutely hasn't done some work with groups like the CIA that's almost certainly

334
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,791
Considering their long-standing contract the train to Saudi National Guard

335
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
Allegations have been made

336
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,655
From a 2003 article in the LA Times

337
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Quote

338
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,031
In a memoir former CIA operative Wilbert crane Evelyn describe using his title is

339
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
Female vice president

340
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
As a cover

341
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
While working

342
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,151
Africa and the Middle East in the early nineteen

343
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,295
It's definitely conceivable to imagine that a * people who work for the CIA if used fake employment at

344
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Vanilla as cover

345
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,903
But that alone doesn't demonstrate the entire company itself is a

346
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
The front operation

347
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
I'm going out of my way to provide explanations for a while

348
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,303
Could be right and I still don't think his argument stanza

349
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
Up to scrutiny

350
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
No I mean

351
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
Here's here's what I get

352
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
From all of the Evan

353
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
Something Shady could be going on here

354
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
Here's what I give him Alex

355
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:01,759
F****** globulus inside exactly it's like I'm Batman I'm not saying nothing is going on

356
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
But I'm not saying nothing not going on

357
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,207
Initially after the bombing it was suspected that the attacks were on a housing area known to be used by westerners living in Riyadh

358
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
As more details came out of

359
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,559
Kenmoreclear this is likely target attack aimed at

360
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
What may

361
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,399
Makes a lot of sense

362
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:23,007
From the standpoint of people who might attack the Saudi government like we were talking about like the assistant

363
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,799
In training do you National Guard

364
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Saudi Arabia

365
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
Do you mind

366
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,967
My profile Target

367
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Combatant

368
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
Target

369
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
The CIA could outright a run vinyl or they could just be a company that had close ties to the government and allowed CIA

370
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,999
Do use our businesses named as part of the cover

371
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,583
Either way I'm not sure really matters because the thing they're doing sucks

372
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,679
There's a much larger problem here with the

373
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:58,079
Entire state of private armies in war contractors

374
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,615
What's the jingle around Keys liquor

375
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,151
CIA in Carlyle Group

376
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,991
Because distracting is easier than wrestling with difficult information and looking at

377
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
Looking at the reality

378
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
That's that's what he's doing

379
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
And it's yeah

380
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
The wild

381
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,231
Is it again to a certain extent it's hard not to look back in the context of like

382
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
When he has Trump

383
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,583
He's fine with so much of this s***

384
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,679
You know he likes Blackwater now he loves all this stuff so

385
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
You know

386
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,007
Maybe part isn't real differences a hero

387
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,079
Part of the reason may be that he is he's doing all of these

388
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,639
Is jangling Keys kinds of things is because he wants

389
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,199
The fundamental problems to stay the same

390
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
He just wants to be in

391
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
Control of those fundamental problems

392
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,367
And how we react to that we know he wants to have a private Army

393
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
So why would he complain about

394
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
People who have private Army

395
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
Unless it's within the context

396
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,559
Pics of jangling keys over here certainly

397
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
You know libertarianism is not

398
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
Averse

399
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
Oh no no

400
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,263
Most Libertarian thinkers Seafood

401
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
Yeah

402
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,127
Alex receives about this

403
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
Today in Saudi

404
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Turns out

405
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,256
So you sing the 50 of the 70 employees advento we're gone on a training Mission but what he's doing is he's trying to create

406
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
False impression

407
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,072
In the listeners had

408
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:29,728
Whenever there's an attack you'll always here claims at some select group was warned not to be there or been removed from the area beforehand be

409
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
Because claims like this

410
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
Simply really strong indications of foreknowledge

411
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
Probably

412
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
I don't want you to think

413
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:41,760
50 of the seven employees there weren't at work that day which is suspicious but that's

414
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:48,416
The buildings that were bombed were a residential compound where 70 American employees live

415
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:52,768
I'm not sure where I was getting the 50 number from but nine employees died

416
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
15 raspa2

417
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,120
Is not counting many who are merely treated for minor injuries

418
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,448
Also people who worked at vigneaux weren't at home

419
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,264
They almost by definition will be on a training Mission since

420
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
The reason they're in Saudi Arabia is a

421
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Training mission

422
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
The words Alex's saying actually mean nothing

423
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,456
But they're meant to create a denser air of Suspicion around the bombing

424
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
Which is unearned

425
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
By the information that he's acting

426
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Representing

427
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
It does seem like he's

428
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,856
Even presenting at the exact opposite

429
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
Weigh-in this far as

430
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
They were just at work

431
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,816
You know he's like they're on a training Mission meeting they're not at work but in this circumstance

432
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
It's there at work

433
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
They're not at home

434
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,680
You yeah he's mending it to be like

435
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,728
They were told they were short

436
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
They were sent

437
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
2

438
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
UAE

439
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
Right right right now he's trying to sell it like if the Pentagon exploded tomorrow but all the top generals Escape

440
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
Miraculously the day before you're like

441
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Full episode

442
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
He literally does a couple times like

443
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
The janitor's world

444
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
No but I don't know about this

445
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,376
Sophos topic

446
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,216
And he reads a bit of an op-ed by Joseph Farah

447
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
The guy runs WorldNetDaily sure

448
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,360
And that is great one of the things that I think is really fascinating about this

449
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:16,224
Is that Alex doesn't seem to like WorldNetDaily in 2003

450
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
Hi Mom just soak

451
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
Use he don't consider them a light

452
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,648
This is going to start with him reading from

453
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
Expounding a little bit

454
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
What is feelings

455
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,048
Call people

456
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,144
Most people agree you have

457
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
What

458
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
Republic

459
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,176
Uno

460
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:27,904
So weird

461
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah Alex loves WorldNetDaily now

462
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Overlarge

463
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
Stretches his group seems to think that they're neocon

464
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,120
Yeah at this

465
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,472
Yeah yeah but Joseph Farrow Road

466
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,056
An indication that they're coming around or something

467
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm less interested in that bed that I am and Alex

468
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,688
Discussion about the

469
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Specifics

470
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,784
About his belief that the right left Paradigm is is an illusion

471
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,904
I'm a big fan of how he confuses economic systems government system

472
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
I need number of differ

473
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:07,840
Listening to mostly more current episodes of Alex's show from the past five or six years

474
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,144
That idea had something to do with political parties

475
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:16,544
Even at the end of the clip he's making reference to the left and the right having something to do with giving you the illusion of having a choice

476
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,616
You look he's talking about voting and political parties

477
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Yeah

478
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,480
Please 2003 episodes the concept is sort of taking a different shape

479
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,064
Little bit more about what he actually means back then

480
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
And I have to say that

481
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,160
I think it's actually way stupider than I thought it was

482
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
Seems like a political philosophy the

483
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
It's TaylorMade

484
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,024
To be defined by opposition

485
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
Which goes a long way toward helping

486
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
Make sense about the shows

487
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
Nonsensical

488
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
In the Trump era end

489
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Now

490
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,728
What Alex is discussing the illusion of the left-right paradigm

491
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,056
I believe you have to just completely get ideas of liberal or conservative

492
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,080
Out of your head

493
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,896
I think Alex is operating on a completely different Acts

494
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
This government is bad

495
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,296
It's a pretty childish thing to express as your fundamental political beliefs

496
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
Especially if you don't have the

497
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
The courage to just come out and be a full-on Anarchy

498
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,440
If you're against big government than I'd like to remind you that

499
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
Small government

500
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
Is f****** huge

501
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,280
Compared to November

502
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,816
Leaving that aside

503
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:16,704
I want to discuss for a second why are Alex's conception of this being the only relevant access in politics is woefully dumb

504
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
But not the way to

505
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Look at the world

506
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:24,128
The sole Factor Alex considers in terms of ideology is whether or not something is a system that includes government

507
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
Control of the

508
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,944
Command and control

509
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Aspect

510
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,064
On the one side of the spectrum he puts communism socialism and fascism is systems with

511
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Hi government

512
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,112
Control

513
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
Is an idealized version of a constitutional republic

514
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
Like which I guess it's supposed to have minimal government

515
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Termite Control

516
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
Outside

517
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,072
If that's the only factor that matters

518
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
Then there should be no difference

519
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,912
Stalex between anarcho-capitalism

520
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
And libertarian

521
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,288
Both advocate for the elimination of the centralized state which would result

522
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,080
The system with even less governmental

523
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,104
Control over the public

524
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Can exist in a republic

525
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,456
Both are conceived around people existing in a stateless world

526
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,504
Characterized by voluntarily construct

527
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,624
But obviously these two ideologies have a stark difference

528
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,696
Probably the biggest is their stance on private

529
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Property

530
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,304
Anarcho-capitalist believe the right to private property is essentially the Bedrock of

531
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,376
Society whereas libertarian socialist to interview

532
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
Accumulation of

533
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
Into the same oppression one might face from the

534
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,544
What state does being carried out by a private Corporation

535
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:29,664
It's very obvious if you look at these two systems that Alex isn't really being honest about his political

536
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Princess

537
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
If there's two schools of thought which

538
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,784
Both issues centralized governmental control

539
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,600
There are still political preferences that Alex has

540
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
The door on the left right

541
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
Spectrum

542
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,208
Private property is a matter of the left rights

543
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,512
Well it's true that most center-left

544
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,072
Concentra right people tend to agree to private property ownership

545
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,888
Chip is good that's not true when you go to the other end

546
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
Spectrum

547
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
Further left ideologies tends to favor

548
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,032
Communal ownership of private property or democratize workplaces

549
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,176
Conversely further right ideologies tend to believe that private property rights are inalienable human rights

550
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,504
No problem with exploitative workplaces because employment

551
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
Is a voluntary relation

552
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:13,952
Alex presents himself as being above left-right Paradigm because he wants you to think that he's talking about democrat-republican two party system

553
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Stuff that exist in the United

554
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
It states

555
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,120
He wants you to think that because most people are disenfranchised with that two-party system and its

556
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,656
Easy thing to find agreement

557
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
Most people would be like

558
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
You know these aren't

559
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,800
Fully they don't fully encapsulated by

560
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
By ideology

561
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,384
Yeah if you look at it as like a lime

562
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
Between the two parties

563
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,712
Yes that is an illusion

564
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,016
That's what he wants you to think

565
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
But that's not what he's talkin

566
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,624
It's important to recognize that and and know that

567
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
You recognize that he's a liar

568
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,000
When he says he's about the left-right Paradigm what he's actually saying is that he hates

569
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
It's government

570
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,584
But he lacks the political depth to coherently advocate

571
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
Anarchy that he would prefer

572
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
And so just pretend

573
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
That Daddy answers

574
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Republic

575
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:02,592
Yeah I mean I would also add into that level of

576
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,920
You know the type of person who wants

577
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
Capitalism

578
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
But you know

579
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,296
They're not going to be the people ground underneath the boot of cap

580
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,344
Capitalism

581
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
Listen

582
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Beto

583
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Saturday

584
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,000
PayPal shouldn't have all this money I mean I should have all of the

585
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Obvious

586
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,328
People shouldn't have all this

587
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
Are you know so

588
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,192
Again you want to preserve so much of the system that gives you

589
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
You power over everybody

590
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
Instead of being like

591
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,128
I don't want any government wowowo then people might

592
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
Steal my expensive

593
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:43,552
Could fix that kind of feel like if you created his kind of left-right paradigm

594
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
World within there

595
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
There'd still be f****** cops

596
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
To protect his ship

597
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,928
So he doesn't have to

598
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,488
Like

599
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,304
What kind of a narco bulshit easy pedal

600
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
Cell

601
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
F*** off

602
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,680
Yeah I mean it would I would need from him is okay so if

603
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,472
The question is commanding

604
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
Control nonsense

605
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
Sound like what what

606
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
Vermont the government

607
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,896
Controls the population right

608
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
You can judge pop

609
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
That's it

610
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
If that's the case

611
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,552
Then you need to explain to me why a constitutional republic has more

612
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,112
Preferable than an anarchist

613
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,976
Because that would be the complete elimination of this thing that you think is right

614
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,328
You have to argue I guess if you're Alex that

615
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
A certain amount is a horse

616
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
And then

617
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,448
Okay why is it well because I like

618
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
I liked

619
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,544
Kontrolfreek

620
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,640
Numa Mikey this isn't even get into it like

621
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,456
Differentiation between personal and private property

622
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,504
And how many left ideology

623
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,528
Do you still believe in person

624
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,088
No property and the right does try to

625
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,392
To muddle those things a little bit it's easy

626
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,256
Yeah even getting into the differentiation

627
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,536
Between political

628
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,096
More economic models

629
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
And how Alex

630
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
Playing fast and loose

631
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,960
Between all of them you can have a fascist communist safe

632
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
Government and an economic model there

633
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
It's not a

634
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
Fascist

635
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
That's not how it works

636
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,176
Yeah and

637
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,760
I just think when you hear stuff like this it really it really

638
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,088
What does it helps me understand a little bit more about these

639
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Assertive

640
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,672
Elements of Alex's costume

641
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,952
That he wears

642
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
To try and trick people into thing

643
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
Thanking Jesus you sent

644
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,840
Being above left-right Paradigm looks sensible

645
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Because

646
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,144
You know you could say

647
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,168
You know

648
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:40,288
Republicans and Democrats are all the same there Bolton to corporate interests you are special interest groups

649
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
Sonia not like

650
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
You say that

651
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,128
I think you can get a lot of people to be like

652
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Yeah you know what

653
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
Make some sense

654
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
That's not what I was talking about

655
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,808
No it's it's just a little bit of Disguise

656
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,392
Yeah I mean you can call yourself above the left-right paradigm

657
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,928
Fairly easily because

658
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,512
A winning strategy for both Republicans and Democrats

659
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Is d'usse

660
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
Listen

661
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,864
The Republicans and the Democrats f****** suck

662
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,192
Electricity to be one of those Republicans or debit

663
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,776
Winning strategies

664
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
Yeah

665
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
It does it helps

666
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
It helps

667
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,456
Pathetic world

668
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,528
Yes

669
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:34,048
If your goal is to Enlighten an audience or help them better understand the world around them in the political conversations at their hearing

670
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
Exactly the opposite

671
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
What you should do

672
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
Communism and Fascism do definitely meme sound

673
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,264
They are just words that describe Imperial strongman differ

674
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
Colored hats

675
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,848
And convincing audiences that that's the case

676
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:50,176
Wixom entirely unprepared to deal with challenging political issues

677
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,784
Also if you take Alex's word than the Hallmarks of the sort of government that he hates Andy

678
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Does not want to exist

679
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,392
Is one that's run by a strong man or Thug which is an Empire

680
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
I know apocracy means nothing

681
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,976
Standards Donald Trump

682
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,536
Precisely the candidate 2003 Alex Jones

683
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Strongly opposed

684
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:13,728
In 2015 Alex no-trump was connected to the Mob and presented an image of a strongman as a facade he put on this

685
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,264
Is M8 here's a fake

686
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Yeah

687
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,336
Drop made signals

688
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,944
To being open to Empire and Alex even defended Trump's desire to buy Greenland and claims

689
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,528
Space in the name of the United States when you want space

690
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,600
Truck Sales Alex's imaginary test

691
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,672
It's allegedly above the left-right paradigm

692
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Alex still supports him

693
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,512
He actually passes Alex's real

694
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Miss test

695
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Is heavily

696
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,352
Dependent on the left-right paradigm

697
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,656
That's important to keep in mind

698
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,192
Important to remember that

699
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
That's really what motivates

700
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,288
It's such a bummer that

701
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
Like these Concepts like

702
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,432
Communism and fascism in all of that stuff

703
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,480
Things that really do take a

704
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
Book

705
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,600
Or multiple books or many many books to understand clearly

706
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,392
Let alone try and implement

707
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
And

708
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,720
Then you've got people who are just like

709
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Communism is this

710
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
It'll short sentence

711
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
That's going to muddy the water

712
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
Nobody wants

713
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
To read many many books

714
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,728
I think you have you have that same problem

715
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
On the Riverside

716
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032
Automotive

717
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,592
Certain ideologies or systems

718
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
Doing it over lease

719
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,944
Simplistically I think into two similar issues of

720
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,736
Watering down meaning

721
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
Confusing

722
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
Sitting here pretending I understand

723
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,184
Intricate

724
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,280
Absolutely it becomes you know

725
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,560
Why did you why did

726
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
Mark's right dust capital is so big he should have written a one-page ad in the New York Times and we all

727
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
Still would have gotten it right

728
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:55,872
That sounds simple theory is capitalism I got two words for you

729
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,688
And I'm done

730
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,808
Sansa goes on to another headline that I guess it's big news

731
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,160
Batman

732
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,464
Don't care anymore

733
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
This is a sad headline

734
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,888
I'm not sure there is any place being part of the news Roundup of a national radio show

735
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
I don't know

736
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
Sprinkle person hurt in accident

737
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,264
On shows like Alex's

738
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
You'll hear coverage like this alot

739
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,128
Because it serves a couple of important emotional purposes for the audio

740
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:34,272
The first is that a straw man is created of the heartless people who just exercise while the person next to them was dead

741
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,880
The Listener gets to imagine how horrible these people are Infield morally Superior

742
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,416
These imaginary people

743
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,744
The second is to demoralize the audience about the state of the world

744
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
Call the neuro their believe in their fellow person

745
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,096
The goal is to present a situation where the audio

746
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,912
Here's this headline and they imagine that these people in the gym

747
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,936
Continue to workout

748
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
Fully aware that this person was dead

749
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
Because that's shity of that

750
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,848
If they didn't know the person was dead and thought possibly he was

751
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,616
Just resting

752
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,176
You can't really think this is a story that highlights

753
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:08,576
The moral degradation of the broader culture it's really more just a situation where people mind their own business at the gym as a tragic

754
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,648
Coincidence bothering stranger

755
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
It's sad and unfortunate but it's not like

756
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,304
This is not a new story that like illustrates

757
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,864
How bad people are

758
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,448
It's like he's trying to admit he's trying to do a sequel to Boondock

759
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Saints

760
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:30,336
But it's about people at the gym or just like minded their own business I've been to the gym

761
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,360
Many time

762
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
People could have

763
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,992
There are people who I've seen laying like

764
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,648
Your favorite word supine never going to let me live that

765
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,952
Go to playing there and obviously

766
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,256
You know if you want to go poke

767
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,048
But also

768
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
Every time I have been around

769
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
They eventually get up

770
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
Cuz they've just been tired cuz they're working out

771
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:02,592
Imagine how many years someone does that if if you're listening to Alex Jones

772
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
The 2003

773
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
Right and you're like

774
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:10,272
Taking this one story to Heart you've missed everything else he's ever said but you got this one story

775
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,320
How many years are you poking people at

776
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
The gym before maybe you find a

777
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
Did that guy

778
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:21,280
You know you're just poking people out you're not

779
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,704
Alex has Craig Roberts back on

780
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,104
2003 Alex Jones of the story where people wants everybody died and I just not going to let it happen

781
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,664
The only way to be a good person with the Pope everybody

782
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
So Alex has Craig Roberts

783
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Tobacco

784
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
Who is this

785
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Conspiracy theorist

786
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
Type

787
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,720
Partially because he's going to be at in Kansas City with Alec

788
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
Venice Beach

789
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,328
You know there's a war going on in the world

790
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:00,448
Sure if this is obviously just a distraction am the financial collapse Court happening

791
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
Tomorrow

792
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
Gold

793
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
And then we hit a

794
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Common theme

795
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,856
Rocket League

796
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
Blowing up

797
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Everyday

798
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
Putin and the apartment building

799
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
Every

800
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,680
Single

801
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
That in the stretch

802
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
Everyday

803
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,056
I have I've been keeping track not a

804
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:42,944
Single episode has gone by that it hasn't come up multiple times

805
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,528
Cornerstone of his sort of report

806
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
You can just

807
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Whatever you want

808
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
You certainly can

809
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,440
Lesson of America if you're a psycho you can do whatever

810
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Ever the f*** you want

811
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,792
Alex

812
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,608
I'm kind of short and I don't really care

813
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
But what is interests

814
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,216
Is it Alex's and has an interview

815
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
With his water filter

816
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:12,128
No no

817
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
That's basically the

818
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,256
Destroy all the way through the car

819
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,560
We're going to get hit blah blah blah

820
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:33,888
Pick up the phone

821
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,104
Only product

822
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,432
That is Without Shame

823
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
The definition of Shameless

824
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,576
Scare people

825
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:58,976
They want to scare you with all these terrorist attacks let me tell you something people the economies collapsing so you need water

826
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,304
Filters I'm not trying to scare you with terror attack

827
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,144
You know I think we've talked about this a little bit in the past

828
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
A really long time

829
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:12,032
I think there is a way to do what Alex is doing in a responsible way

830
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,616
There are dangers in

831
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
I am

832
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
You know let's say if you have

833
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,016
It would be good to have a little bit of food

834
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
Storage in case of a natural disaster or something

835
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,672
When I was growing up there was a worry about tornadoes in Missouri

836
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,256
My parents had some canned food and water in the basement

837
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:36,096
Just as a like we never ended up needing it but just in case it's there

838
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,936
I always have an extra big bag of cat food on hand

839
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Because

840
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,312
I have a cat and I don't want to run into a situation where something could happen and I'm not able

841
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,104
To take care of this thanks

842
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,152
I think that there is like a

843
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
It's not this

844
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,248
I'm playing on people's fears

845
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,320
Yeah there's a there's a version of this that is like

846
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,904
Looking at life responsibly and trying to be like well

847
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,184
You may need this

848
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
Right

849
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,768
It's not a terrible idea just in case

850
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
The other side of it is this

851
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,400
You're stupid if you don't

852
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:14,240
Get the water filters cuz of every terrorist attack in the economy going to collapse

853
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
Yeah it is

854
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,312
It is unfortunate that that's

855
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,104
Likes that combination of

856
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
When

857
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,688
Commerce and capital Mets

858
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:29,088
Psychology and turned it into advertising in there like we can get more stuff if we emotionally manipulate people than if we provide

859
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,880
Irrational argument self

860
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,672
We're going to emotionally my life

00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,792

Scientist but how great is filters are

865
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:45,216
Alex tries to set this up

Absolutely

880
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,903
Watson and Crick

881
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,999
Jonas Salk approves of my water filters now we have a special running

882
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
Naturally

883
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,071
How's the weather Gaston

884
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
Something that he's been promoting

885
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Ring all day

886
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,655
He's so excited

887
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,215
He is a Canadian journalist named Barry's wicker

888
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
Guyot and

889
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,799
He does not like 911

890
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,103
Pics 9/11 was an inside job and have you

891
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,687
Has like the biggest deal

892
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,783
Like a huge Canadian Journal is one of the most important in the world

893
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,855
And berries introduction

894
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
Proceedings

895
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,927
Placements are real pleasure Alex

896
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,559
For the first time

897
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
Called aftermath kiddo

898
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Question

899
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,191
Answered questions from 9/11

900
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
Francisco

901
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,199
For people to wake up

902
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,063
Tavares Wickers an interesting fellow

903
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,879
Everything I can tell he was a pretty standard and accomplished

904
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
Canadian Journal

905
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,999
He'd worked for mainstream outlets and then 9/11 happened in every

906
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,023
Things seems to evolve

907
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,839
Liquor decided

908
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:52,447
Except I don't think that's workers Gone full hard right

909
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,239
Or the Dennis Miller was ever funny

910
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,543
I don't know if this occurs when I get there

911
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:00,383
He decided that the mainstream media story about the attack wasn't real but

912
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,943
He did have a bit of a different angle on it than Alex

913
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:09,855
According to what he told reporter Terry glavin in a 2006 interview the end goal of the attack carried out by the White House

914
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,391
Worcester creative war against us

915
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
Okay

916
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
That was The Conspirator

917
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:18,047
In 2004 he would go on to make his own 911 film titled the Greek

918
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,119
Conspiracy the 9/11 News special you never saw

919
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:27,007
It's just as good and just as bad as every other 911documentary and has a title that Bears all the Hallmarks

920
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,799
The early days of Internet clickbait

921
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,359
4 people really got good

922
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,919
It turned into an art form into itself

923
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:38,527
Over the years he's continued to be a 9-11 truther and generally the sort of person you can count on to college

924
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
Just about anything or false

925
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,927
I got a recent interview he did with the Global Research NewsHour where he was

926
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,279
Discussing how the storming of the Capitol on January 6th with a bullet

927
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,839
I kind of expected to hear him doing some Alex stick

928
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
If you could

929
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,471
Do you think that the event was a false flag inspired or directed by Trump

930
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,751
Which honestly makes no sense

931
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,519
No I love it

932
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,639
The term false flag comes from the idea of a ship attacking someone while flying a different countries flags of that country

933
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,663
It's Brian

934
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:09,759
If Trump at a bunch of people storm in the capital of wearing Trump hats that's another false flag

935
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
It's just a straight-up correct

936
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,623
It does seem like that unless you are in

937
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
Implying that

938
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,671
Because it's so

939
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:20,511
So he's saying the Trump was also in on the setup

940
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,535
Of his owns

941
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:27,935
Supporters yeah but he does look a little Volkswagen order to discredit his own I don't ideology

942
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:35,103
Write could Trump be in on a false-flag if that's what I'm saying

943
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
Make sense

944
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:42,527
It's tough for me to say but listening is that interviewed kind of feels like zwicker is like an Alex Jones but with opposite politics

945
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:49,183
He's making wildly unfounded assertions and claims it don't make sense but he's also staunchly opposed to Trump and recognizes that like

946
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,999
Systemic racism exists cure

947
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
So

948
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:58,143
Yeah real moment that was possible in 2003

949
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
Probably not much later than that

950
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,263
They felt like they were in agreement as far as 9/11

951
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,335
Conspiracies were concerned but they actually didn't agree on anything

952
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,431
Because they're dreadfully far apart on the left-right paradigm

953
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:16,063
Paradigm is fairly important in reality

954
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,415
If you judge everything based on something position in terms of the right

955
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
Left Spectrum sure

956
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:27,583
Maybe that's a little bit reductive it's out there multiple axies upon which the judge

957
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,399
Pretending that that one doesn't exist is a

958
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,703
Rio's limitation

959
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
Barry

960
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Oh boy

961
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,311
Banff

962
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
Barry says something in this interview

963
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
That if it were present day

964
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
Alex would lose his

965
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,199
Okay I'm on here at

966
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,807
Bertrand Russell

967
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,903
And he's Ten Commandments

968
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,951
First commandment is never

969
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
Yourself

970
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,023
And I think that is the first

971
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:11,871
So that's a huge tell for me that Alex doesn't believe his own bulshit

972
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:18,271
According to Infowars lower Bertrand Russell's writing outright admits that the globalist planted drugs

973
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,063
Kill off most of the population

974
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,111
Russell is one of the old school global

975
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,207
According to Alex was instrumental in coming up with and publicizing their evil plans

976
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:31,583
I can understand wanting to have a polite interview and I do think their times just to agree to disagree about

977
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
Thanks

978
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,119
Princeton

979
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:38,239
Did Barry thought that the 9/11 planes were remote-controlled and Alex out they were piloted by the hijackers

980
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:42,591
They could go ahead and agree to disagree without having a gigantic problem sitting on the table

981
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,407
We have a disagreement but not a fundamental contradiction

982
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,943
Not a deal-breaker

983
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,783
Barry isn't just saying that he kind of likes Bertrand Russell

984
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,087
Russell is his hero

985
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:59,999
Are you guys work for major papers and he taught college courses so it stands to reason that if he says that Bertrand Russell is his hero

986
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,327
He's probably read as much or more of his writing than Alex

987
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,655
This is why to me this cannot be an agree to disagree mom

988
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
In order for Alex

989
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:11,519
To maintain all the narratives he has in play he has to be agreeing to dis

990
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,543
Agree about his gas

991
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,615
Sakura worshipping a guy who's who he has red

992
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
Discussing the plans

993
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,199
Insta kill off most of the human population

994
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,991
There's no other reasonable conclusion

995
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,039
Do with the information provided

996
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,343
Other than that berries an enthusiastic

997
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,367
Globalist

998
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
Conspiracies

999
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,159
You love them

1000
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,951
Yeah Alex should want to fight him

1001
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,767
It does seem like Alex is like okay okay

1002
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,351
I get it we agree that 9/11 was an inside job

1003
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,399
So I'm going to

1004
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,703
To gloss over the fact that your hero

1005
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
Is

1006
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,007
The architect of

1007
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,287
Killing everybody

1008
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,103
So we can really get to the bottom of this 911

1009
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:51,199
Lego you might be missing the forest for the

1010
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,479
Fallen trees if you weigh

1011
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:59,647
Alex knows that there's nothing he can do and he can't really fight him on this cuz he knows the berries red Bertrand Russell open

1012
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,975
Probably way more conversant on the subject that Alex is embarrassed

1013
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:08,607
The issue is s*** about Russell's made up

1014
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,911
But he also knows that he can't just let us stay tonight like

1015
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
That's stand

1016
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:18,079
Unless you end up with this Middle Ground as spineless agreeing to disagree about one of the top thinkers of the gigantic demonic

1017
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
Conspiracy

1018
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,151
But Alex has made his entire career

1019
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
It's

1020
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,479
Yeah yeah cuz

1021
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:30,111
If you're saying that you're above the left-right Paradigm you should be more unhappy with

1022
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:36,511
Plan instead of a like on the left there's Lovelace on the right what are you going to do

1023
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,607
Loosen up Stuck In The Middle With very late

1024
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,911
I think of it I think

1025
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
Obviously this is major surgery

1026
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:50,079
Spitballing and coming up with that what I think is the most likely explanation

1027
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:54,943
I went to The Branding at this point is so dependent on him being able to pretend

1028
00:49:55,455 --> 00:50:00,063
This left-right Paradigm thing is an illusion. So for him to have someone who's ostensibly 911

1029
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
Conspiracy theorist

1030
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,391
Stew's on the left right left

1031
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,415
Quality

1032
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Texture

1033
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,743
I don't think he wants to fight with that guy

1034
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,535
I think it's really important

1035
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,863
For them to have some kind of an appearance of an alliance right

1036
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:17,727
Especially with the way that Alex has been building them up as a reporter in like

1037
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:21,311
Super important person in in Canada

1038
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,335
And so I think

1039
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
I think that's

1040
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,383
Takes precedence over

1041
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,991
This guy's hero is one of your main villain skaff

1042
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
12

1043
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,343
I think the berry isn't aware of

1044
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,415
He can't think that he hasn't read

1045
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
The same things that I

1046
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,719
Well I mean

1047
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,767
Because Alex is

1048
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
Taking advantage of

1049
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,887
The enemy of my enemy is not my friend

1050
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:51,519
And and you can prove that because Alex is taking advantage of people thinking that the enemy of my enemy is my friend

1051
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
Fairly simple

1052
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
Open and shut

1053
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,919
Elspeth Berry

1054
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,711
This guy really really

1055
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,247
You creep me out this guy so creepy

1056
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,855
Bill in Alaska

1057
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,463
I just had to call in I got

1058
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,303
I got an enemy that hasn't been mentioned

1059
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
And no

1060
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,447
People want to know why this is why

1061
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
This

1062
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,519
In the mirror

1063
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,567
Jim Jones

1064
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
Case in point

1065
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
I don't believe he was a

1066
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
As people that phone

1067
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
K

1068
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:42,719
Wow wow you're going to need to sell me a lot more on that one

1069
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,047
Not a lot more

1070
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
Salesmanship on that take

1071
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,375
I will tell you delivery a

1072
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,655
Confident both

1073
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,471
Creepy as hell

1074
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,031
I don't like avakin

1075
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:02,431
Bit player from Bonanza from Alaska telling me that Jim Jones was a good leader

1076
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:08,063
Suicide cult don't hate the player hate the game

1077
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,367
Here's the problem

1078
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:16,255
People followed Jim Jones actually wasn't their fault

1079
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,535
Their fault

1080
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,559
Okay

1081
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,631
Alright

1082
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
Alaska

1083
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,935
Cowboys

1084
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
Tell you about this

1085
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,263
The rest of the clothes are kind of

1086
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,543
Blastoise

1087
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
Kind of

1088
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,591
Abhorrent

1089
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,383
Sure

1090
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,407
The interview takes

1091
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
A turn

1092
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
Hard

1093
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
South

1094
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:41,343
When Barry starts talking about his new DVD that has been developed

1095
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,391
We're having incredible

1096
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,463
Looks like it looks like we're moving toward

1097
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,487
500

1098
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,471
Population of u.s.a.

1099
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,919
On your own and you write for newspapers in you

1100
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,831
Papa John's

1101
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,367
Awful

1102
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,927
Like Alex straight-up laughing

1103
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,791
Yeah that was not a I'm laughing with you

1104
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:28,191
Uncontrollable

1105
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
What's to like

1106
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:33,055
Oh no

1107
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,431
And there's also the problem of like alright even the rule of 10

1108
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,455
Piezo 5000

1109
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,735
Still not

1110
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:45,343
For what Alex has the illusion that Alex

1111
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,879
Has created about this guy

1112
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:52,255
Throughout the report

1113
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:56,095
Journalist in Canada and he can get the 500

1114
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,935
Well upwards of 499 people to really get these

1115
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,471
UCF

1116
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
The Hertz the facade

1117
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,359
You can tell there is a total change

1118
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,127
And Alex

1119
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,407
After this

1120
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,967
Specific number has been given good like

1121
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,527
I can't I know now you're nothing to

1122
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:20,159
Pretend that he is like Rush Limbaugh

1123
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,231
If he's only moving those many units like my audience

1124
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
Just think there's just

1125
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,535
I can't deny that now

1126
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
Yeah

1127
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
You know it is what it is

1128
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,983
And it doesn't it doesn't go much longer but Alex does

1129
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,775
Finish up this episode

1130
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,055
Fairly standard

1131
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,719
Alex brings up the boot

1132
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,743
Bombings in

1133
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,535
At least

1134
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,607
Four times in this episode like it's really excessive

1135
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,399
And then he says this about the Russian

1136
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:08,799
I find this fascinating because in the present-day when he's trying to defend food and Alex will say that Russia isn't a globalist

1137
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,847
Country is a system of crony capitalism

1138
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,871
The positive thing now

1139
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,431
Or at least it's not as bad as global

1140
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,991
Bernie capitalism isn't a negative Commander

1141
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,551
Control system in the present-day to Alex

1142
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,367
I could speculate about what the reason for this change is

1143
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,135
But honestly

1144
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:23,903
Just be guessing

1145
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,183
It's a glaring

1146
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,743
It's pretty weird

1147
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,071
To the 16th

1148
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
Is

1149
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,607
It's Friday

1150
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,887
Analysis on route

1151
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:37,727
Kansas City is going to speak at the local radio station

1152
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,775
And he's not in studio

1153
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,311
What's that a six-hour drive

1154
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,591
From Austin

1155
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
I have no idea

1156
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,223
Probably

1157
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,039
9 hours I don't know if he's actually

1158
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
Driving cuz I

1159
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,599
Think he said you flew back

1160
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:54,879
I don't know I don't

1161
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:02,047
The point is he take Friday off

1162
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,327
Sunday

1163
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095
A show at this point

1164
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,887
Do comes back on Monday

1165
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,167
And

1166
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,703
Here we go

1167
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,495
Completely different sup

1168
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
There now Maine

1169
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:24,063
Control trigger

1170
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,839
Control

1171
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,911
Is there

1172
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
Now

1173
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,799
Wonder how

1174
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
4 years ago

1175
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
And I will be

1176
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,159
Little bit later

1177
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,767
Okay

1178
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:05,791
Quincy

1179
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,327
But the doubt it

1180
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,863
This is this is not

1181
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,423
I got to tell you

1182
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:18,079
What the first hour of the show is basically just Alex saying over and over again that the new treasury secretary has been bad

1183
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,103
Mouthing the dollar

1184
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,639
Annette and this is leading

1185
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,431
Do it collapsing in

1186
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,735
Relation to the euro fine

1187
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,271
This is the only thing that likes

1188
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,295
Seed actually even in

1189
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,343
In it within about the

1190
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,111
The first hour

1191
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,903
It is a

1192
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,183
Desert wow

1193
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,463
Wow

1194
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,999
90 equals 8/2 what

1195
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
It's

1196
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,327
It's so great whenever people are like

1197
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,375
Do this split Matrix is

1198
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,959
Control and then your leg okay well 20 years ago

1199
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:50,591
The Manchurian Candidate was telling us that the mind control is happening and then twenty years before that

1200
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,615
I just

1201
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,175
I just don't care what you think about movies

1202
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,199
I just don't care

1203
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,783
I would say the probably The Matrix

1204
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,599
Has some ideas their explored maybe not as

1205
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,159
Eloquently as they could have been

1206
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,695
Confuses some people were

1207
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,487
Further it has a aesthetic

1208
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,767
That

1209
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,047
A lot of people adopt

1210
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:12,095
And maybe you could

1211
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,911
Trace those things to some of these shooters

1212
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,727
I don't know I also think I overthink

1213
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
But generally speaking

1214
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,799
When you have somebody

1215
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,567
I can't

1216
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,895
A couple stories that Alex brings up and its people who

1217
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,687
Shot somebody and then

1218
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,455
Said they're trying

1219
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
Believe Matrix

1220
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,015
Sure

1221
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:30,783
You are

1222
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,831
I'm not positive

1223
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,391
Necessarily how these cases shook out

1224
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,695
And how much of that was just a defense

1225
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,231
Right

1226
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,767
Right you know what I'm saying

1227
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:45,119
Seems like something that could have been a popular defense

1228
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:48,191
What am I going to be either plead guilty

1229
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,727
Cuz everybody saw me do it

1230
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,263
Or I'm going to shoot my shot

1231
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:57,919
You know you do your shot sometimes you don't make a you miss 100% of the shots you don't take them

1232
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,927
I was excited at least

1233
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,231
To hear about Alex's thoughts about the Matrix

1234
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
Sure

1235
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,279
He doesn't get into one

1236
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,327
Ether reel

1237
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,887
It's a real desert I was walking around

1238
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:24,543
Reloaded hadn't even come out yet

1239
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,567
How much does say like

1240
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,847
I'm going to DeRango's in Baker

1241
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:31,455
Tonight is out in theaters

1242
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:36,063
Actually I was going back through it cuz I was looking over the plots of those movies I

1243
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,367
I'm not sure I saw the

1244
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
The third one

1245
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,415
This plot seems

1246
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:47,071
Borod look you could watch it again and you'd be like this. I don't think this is and then you would forget it

1247
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,887
Tomorrow I definitely saw the second one cuz I remember the Arctic

1248
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,703
Yeah

1249
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,239
Vocabulary

1250
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,543
Instead of writing

1251
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:01,663
Sure I saw the third one because I know if I saw the first two I would want to finish it

1252
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,991
Call the third one I do not remember and then you move on

1253
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,551
I was reading the puddle

1254
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:13,951
How do I say okay let me see if I can receive the final fight scene

1255
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,511
YouTube video or something like that but I

1256
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,815
Remember that

1257
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
How much do you remember from

1258
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,119
The plot that you read

1259
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,423
I'm going to see if I can't pop the Dome

1260
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
The 3rd

1261
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,471
Matrix

1262
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,263
It's all right I remembered Broad

1263
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Strokes

1264
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:32,383
Okay so you can give it a try

1265
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,783
Neo just passed out cuz I'm the second one he turns out he can use electric power out in the real world

1266
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:45,183
Up and he's actually in The Matrix he's not plugged in the Sick Bay or whatever

1267
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:50,047
So then eventually wakes up and blah blah blah baby did The Matrix come out

1268
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,095
He and what's her face

1269
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:57,215
Staples go on Trinity they both go on a suicide mission into the evil place right

1270
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:00,543
They fly up over in the sky and I like in the meantime

1271
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,335
At the Zion

1272
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:06,687
The final attack is going on

1273
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:13,087
Spell ababababa on for a while but I understand so far so good

1274
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:19,487
They got these weird Mech suits and then there's some heroic action cuz it's a war and I'll be moving you got to do that

1275
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
Then Neo and Trinity they make it through Neo and the way I are both like

1276
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,959
Hey man this agent Smith dude is f****** out of control

1277
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,495
Right that says though

1278
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,775
AI plug

1279
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:38,175
Neo into the AI and they're like you better solve this f****** problem

1280
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:41,247
Signs of being absorbed by

1281
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,783
Orange

1282
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
Smith Smith

1283
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,599
After a massive

1284
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,367
Useless

1285
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,647
Pointless fight

1286
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:53,791
And then the AI is like blowing them all up and they start over and everybody finally breaks the cycle and everything

1287
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
School for awhile

1288
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,631
I think that's me

1289
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,167
Basically at

1290
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:04,031
I'm out of breath

1291
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,823
At all

1292
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,871
Neo negotiating with the robot

1293
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,943
About

1294
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:17,343
Face comes out and it's all like dude and the robots mad do I don't cover that I don't remember that at all

1295
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,671
Is weird the robot a I did a lot of roaring

1296
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:26,815
Which seems like a weird thing for the AI to be into but is the a I would know what would intimidate a human

1297
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,839
Yeah buddy

1298
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,631
It seems like hey I don't know

1299
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,191
He doesn't have eyes anymore so why would you

1300
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,471
He conceived

1301
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:44,991
Excited for the 4th what that's all I

1302
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,807
I may have to go watch the third one

1303
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,831
And see if I

1304
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,623
Seems like

1305
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,671
I can't believe that was the

1306
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,695
Always bad

1307
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,487
I don't know real bad

1308
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,279
It sounded bags on paper

1309
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,303
Buchheit's

1310
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,863
Execution execution

1311
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,679
I do wonder if the

1312
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,447
I don't think

1313
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,263
I mean I'll defend slightly Reloaded

1314
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,823
Like I said that to not as bad

1315
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,103
Maybe some people have said

1316
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,407
I mean there is some fun things the Twins were cool

1317
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,175
Sure

1318
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,247
They turned invisible for a while and then they showed up that's fun

1319
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:24,927
I got to watch that third one

1320
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
The Matrix

1321
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,487
What Revelations

1322
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,303
See if I actually saw it but I was

1323
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
Younger

1324
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,887
Anyway Alex doesn't get into talking

1325
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
Much but he does

1326
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:39,775
I have some other news fresh from the

1327
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,055
Bureau desk

1328
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,847
It's in his imagination

1329
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,055
What is reporting that basically that yeah yeah

1330
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,615
Saddam got an amnesty deal

1331
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,383
Yeah

1332
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:24,063
I don't know who negotiated that one I think they left a few people out of bed to go she Asians if he got an amnesty

1333
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,879
CDL with himself

1334
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,183
I think that might have been the case app

1335
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:32,511
Another familiar theme

1336
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
Vladimir

1337
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,007
Rebuild a blown up

1338
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,591
Why would

1339
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
No

1340
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:56,575
Time in Moscow

1341
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,751
Paramilitary forces

1342
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,687
Alex talks about these

1343
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,479
Ideas areas where Putin

1344
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,063
Is not talking about this

1345
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,647
That guy's bad talking about things that are

1346
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
Create event

1347
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,975
He knows to be true

1348
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,303
Mount for him to change his position on this

1349
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,095
He needs to show his work

1350
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,631
He needs to explain

1351
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,935
Why is that no longer trip

1352
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,727
Right were you wrong here

1353
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,031
Or did these events

1354
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,079
Give a new explanation for all of this

1355
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,383
He doesn't ever do that either service switch

1356
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,175
And it's and it's not

1357
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,943
Tumi

1358
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,479
To go back and listen to this

1359
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,015
And see just how consist

1360
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,807
Simply it is just like a

1361
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,575
F****** puta

1362
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,623
These false wagon around

1363
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:05,183
Yeah you know it would be ironic

1364
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
If

1365
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,791
What seems to be one of those like the main pillars of his

1366
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,863
Everything is a false flag thing because these are

1367
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,143
Documented events

1368
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:14,911
Swear you're like

1369
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,263
So his

1370
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,823
Main evidence that you can follow up on

1371
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,615
Is now

1372
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,919
Not at all mentioned

1373
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,967
And wiped away despite the fact

1374
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,295
Then he still claims that everything is a false flag

1375
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,319
Just not that

1376
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:35,391
It's strange it would be ironic if you weren't aware that he

1377
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,951
He's just a psycho that none of this matters

1378
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:41,791
And he's going to use whatever he feels like using however he feels like you

1379
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,583
Yeah so it's it's

1380
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,863
Completely within his care

1381
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:51,007
And this also seems a bit more like what you would expect from somebody who's like this anti-communist

1382
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,031
Best Crusader type

1383
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:52,799
If you're not like

1384
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,615
Russia and China are evil at supposed to like

1385
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,943
China's

1386
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,735
I don't know it's

1387
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
It's

1388
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,783
I want to learn more about

1389
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,575
I like how they keep those women from

1390
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,599
I'm talking in churches

1391
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,903
Feel good I want to learn more about

1392
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,439
But I don't really know

1393
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,719
Much more

1394
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,047
Then Alex will not stop talking about Putin

1395
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,583
Blowing up the apartment building

1396
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,143
In 2003

1397
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,423
A lot more

1398
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,519
Detail to it but I'm keeping my eyes open and I'll let you know if I

1399
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,311
Comes up

1400
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:31,455
Has he already been on Artesia bunchers this is like in a very short period of time he will go on RT of

1401
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:36,063
I'm not sure when he started appearing on that I know he

1402
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,111
I would imagine

1403
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
After

1404
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,231
Hair like that let's see what Alex has to say

1405
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,511
I guess not

1406
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:48,607
So Alex is another guest at this point he's it's Dennis Cuddy

1407
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,143
He's another

1408
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,727
Conspiracy New World Order guy I love his kids music

1409
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,495
Basically

1410
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,263
Kid Cudi

1411
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,311
I like a

1412
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,847
His wife doctor Cuddy

1413
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,407
From house and beat

1414
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,455
Now you're playing the game

1415
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,783
He's on for like the rest of the show and it's just

1416
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,807
Rambling about

1417
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,343
Basic ass New World Order

1418
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,623
Conspiracy talking points

1419
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,695
It's a lot of the same stuff we covered in the endgame documentary

1420
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,975
Aboard the hell out of me

1421
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,303
That's said it's a far cry from the content that Alex producer

1422
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,071
These days

1423
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,631
This is at very least a show that

1424
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,423
Striving to be about an alleged

1425
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,191
Conspiracy

1426
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,495
It goes off track pretty regularly

1427
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,519
It provides horrible info

1428
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,823
Formation ignore stories in favor of headlines

1429
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,359
But huge chunks of time

1430
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
Are devoted

1431
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,687
Unsourced accusation

1432
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,247
About like a Bilderberg Group and Bohemian Grove

1433
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,527
So when I go

1434
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,807
Talk too much about this interview

1435
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
But there is one

1436
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,367
Very important moment

1437
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,231
They use facilitators to through various delft

1438
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
My techniques

1439
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,943
We need a business

1440
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:12,063
I must lead the people am I not their service

1441
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,087
Here's what you

1442
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,135
You say you want

1443
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,767
Alex rovira

1444
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,655
I've not heard them 2003 please can

1445
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:31,519
Has clearly eating their butt

1446
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,359
Most of all the content

1447
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,895
Yeah that he's

1448
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:43,551
It's okay it's kind of funny that I already brought up advertising in Psychology and then 20 minutes later he's like

1449
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,855
And also

1450
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:50,463
The businessman Levi look away from

1451
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,559
Navigate to be horrified

1452
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,375
So the caller calls Indian Cudi

1453
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,143
You take calls

1454
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:03,007
And when I was listening to

1455
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,055
Cutty is old

1456
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,847
It's cool like with his new world order

1457
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,383
He has

1458
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,175
The all the Talking Point

1459
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:10,943
Points that you expect

1460
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,991
Hiiraan old-time New World Order

1461
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,015
Receive

1462
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,319
Shows or

1463
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:18,111
I bet he knows Bill Cooper

1464
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,927
As I was looking through the hour of the time archives and he's

1465
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,999
Spit on a respected 96 Amazon

1466
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,791
How are the time like that checks out

1467
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,815
Wow

1468
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,607
He does her day job

1469
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
I think he writes book

1470
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,423
Probably goes on speaking

1471
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Things

1472
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
I don't know

1473
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:37,311
How do I get caller calls in

1474
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,895
Has reported that Saddam Hussein

1475
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,943
And this caller

1476
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:43,967
Says that

1477
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,247
One of our old friends

1478
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,295
Joel skousen

1479
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,831
Is reporting on something

1480
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,855
A little bit different

1481
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,951
Reported by Joel skousen

1482
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,543
Yes

1483
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:19,551
Blue the first reference of someone bring up skousen

1484
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,343
Which is interesting

1485
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,367
It's taken

1486
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:24,671
Can okra 19 days into the month of

1487
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,463
Let me know where we beginning

1488
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,487
2000

1489
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:32,351
Such a familiar face in other. The time and the first reference to him

1490
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,887
And

1491
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,423
He thinks that saddam's in the United

1492
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,727
Midstates Russia

1493
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,055
They're both wrong

1494
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,079
These guys

1495
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:48,479
These guys and also that ending of just leaving it open for that now there could also be a double cross you never know

1496
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:54,623
No they could anything could be true right now the evidence of which I have none I is all pointing towards this place

1497
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,927
But I just made up so there we go

1498
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,975
Do you have Cuddy

1499
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,535
Who's been on in the month of

1500
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,071
May 2003 already

1501
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,375
And you also had Colonel Craig Roberts

1502
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,423
Who was on who's been on before

1503
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,471
She have some familiar faces

1504
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,751
Starting to like

1505
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,847
Appear to be there sure are faces that we know

1506
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
Rack you know there's

1507
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:21,503
I haven't seen any mention of Steve pieczenik I haven't heard anything about Girl Scout

1508
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:26,879
Paul Craig Roberts you know couple of other folks who were like

1509
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,159
Webster Tarpley

1510
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:28,927
Sure these

1511
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,719
Jerome corsi

1512
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,487
These folks

1513
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:34,559
Arnot figures in Alex's world

1514
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:38,143
At this point or at least have not made themselves known

1515
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,423
There's another person

1516
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:42,239
Who also has not made himself known yet

1517
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,519
I found it very

1518
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,311
Confusing but this is the first mention

1519
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,335
I seen of him

1520
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,711
But I was wondering if either one of you

1521
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,855
No

1522
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,159
What

1523
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:13,215
So I run a very curious that Alex takes this tone on this color brings up Bob Chapman

1524
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:18,591
Haven't heard the episodes cover another. Time Bob Chapman is one of Alex's most regular gas

1525
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,895
First track of years leading up to his death in two

1526
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,663
Adam-12

1527
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:27,807
He's an alleged precious metals expert who Alex used as a scene partner when doing extended commercials for Midas resources

1528
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,111
The gold sales company that syndicated Alex

1529
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:34,975
Also Bob claims to have been invited to a screening of a film of Ronald Reagan getting

1530
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:35,999
True

1531
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,559
For years Bob was on Alta show every Friday

1532
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,887
Outside of people who host the fourth hour it's tough for me to think of

1533
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:46,495
Give anyone else who had what amounts to basically a standing engagement on Alex's schedule

1534
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,799
Do your Alex and he doesn't know what's up with him

1535
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,079
He doesn't want

1536
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,639
Talk about it in 2003 is really weird

1537
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,735
Things get even weirder when you consult issues of his newsletter

1538
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,271
The international forecast

1539
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,807
From back in 2003

1540
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:03,903
They're not all available online but there are two that I could find from 2,000

1541
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Free

1542
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:06,975
2003

1543
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:11,327
Even back then Bob clearly had a working relationship with Midas resource

1544
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,375
Special offer

1545
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,679
You may also order it and sooner

1546
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,471
Prince to the book The Beast from Jekyll Island

1547
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,543
By calling - resources Incorporated

1548
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:24,127
Midas resources will give you a silver dollar from the early 1900's

1549
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,407
$12 value

1550
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,455
For purchasing the book at its normal price

1551
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,247
Of 1995

1552
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:33,087
It seems clear to me that this business relationship with Midas is intact

1553
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,927
At this point even prior yeah who this episode they were listening

1554
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,999
So whatever weird energy Alex is giving off its

1555
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,279
Seems like it's probably person

1556
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,839
I ran over Bob's newsletters

1557
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,679
To see if I can find any reasons that Alex might not want to associate with him at this point

1558
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,471
I'm not sure if I see anything

1559
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:53,823
In one of his January issues he predicts an imminent Return of the gold standard in the United

1560
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,871
States because of the war in the middle

1561
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,151
What a surprise

1562
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,943
That he would want or predict

1563
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,015
That the war is going to put pressure on economy

1564
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
Fairly standard

1565
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,087
Kind of stuff you know

1566
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,367
Cialix

1567
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,135
Disagree with that

1568
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,671
He does say quote

1569
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:15,071
Do Muslims believe they can destroy capitalism by force and gold to the Forefront and we agree that this could and probably will

1570
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:15,839
Be successful

1571
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:22,495
Which is a little weird but it does not seem like it's outside of Alex's wheelhouse didn't seem like you'd burn a bridge over that what a wild thing

1572
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:26,079
Thing to think / even Wilder to say

1573
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,615
Some of the next issues that I could

1574
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:31,967
Could find were from July 2003 and honestly just kind of sounds like a transcript

1575
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
Do something Alex

1576
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,527
Might say it's his life

1577
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,551
Quotes

1578
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:39,647
All we can say is buy gold and silver coins and shares as fast as possible

1579
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,487
The ship is sinking and there's no sense in drowning with the rest of the idiots

1580
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:48,351
Incidentally exercise your constitutional rights and legally armed yourself in your families to the

1581
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:54,239
This isn't going to be nice

1582
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:59,871
The only thing I can find in there that I can see how it's being pissed off about is that Bob advises readers to buy gold

1583
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,895
Inselverbot

1584
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,175
If they have to invest

1585
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,967
Austin currency that they are going to hide

1586
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:07,295
They should favor the Euro or Swiss franc to the US dollar

1587
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:13,439
I could be Alex thinking this was bad-mouthing the dollar like the treasury secretary

1588
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
I don't know but

1589
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:16,255
That's the only thing that stuck out to me as like

1590
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,559
Alex would not like that

1591
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:21,887
You should always favor the dollar if you're going to favor currency

1592
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,911
Yeah

1593
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:26,495
Could you like what happened to Bob

1594
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,543
What they're suggesting is like

1595
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,359
Bob went off the rails somewhere and

1596
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,943
Saying that the dollar isn't the single greatest thing in the world

1597
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:35,711
Probably

1598
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:42,879
Currencies are evil

1599
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:49,023
Reserve currency status of the dollar

1600
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,815
Nothing had happened there was some

1601
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:51,839
Problem

1602
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,655
I can't get any sense of like what that's in

1603
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,215
Yeah

1604
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,263
Because Bob can't get out of pocket

1605
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,567
You know like Bob is expendable

1606
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,871
Maybe now

1607
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,639
Hi Mary.

1608
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,687
Video of a pagan

1609
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,015
Incidentally Bob Chapman's in his letter is definitely

1610
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,575
Play without a doubt written by Bob Chapman

1611
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:17,951
Here's a lot of these folks who have these newsletters that are like

1612
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,511
Bob cannot reclaim

1613
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,047
He calls people who don't

1614
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,631
Take his financial advice eighty-eights and he's basically just f****** with his readers

1615
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:32,287
Don't forget as interest rates go back up to say 7 or 8% you will lose money on the value of

1616
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,847
Unless you buy a par and hold to maturity

1617
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,407
Most of you may be dead by then

1618
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:43,807
We don't have all the answers but this is the way we see it we've been making these kinds of decisions for 43 years so we guess this qualifies us

1619
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,831
The Voice our opinion

1620
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,367
Power Rangers stuff

1621
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:50,207
Considering this is like it's supposed to be Financial advice newsletter out of

1622
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,535
You're all going to die

1623
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,327
Ariat

1624
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,631
Yeah whatever it's life-or-death

1625
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:04,031
Barry some Swiss Francs at get a gun is this good financially

1626
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:09,151
Yeah I have no idea what happened to the two of them but it's an open question that I'm excited to learn more about as we

1627
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:15,551
We see him later on yeah I know and see him in 2009 Atlanta you know. Definitely

1628
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,111
So I know that there is some sort of it coming back together

1629
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:25,279
I'm going to guarantee that that no point do they discuss what their differences were

1630
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:28,607
If I'll be able to learn more like another caller calls in

1631
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,631
Specifics or something

1632
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:30,911
How do I keep my eye open

1633
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
Turn on this one

1634
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:34,239
So what are the other things that I'm tracking

1635
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,007
Very closely

1636
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:39,615
Understand is whether or not Alex Jones believes he's fighting the literal devil

1637
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,383
In 2003

1638
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:44,991
We know what the present day he believes that the devil is the head of the globalist conspiracy everybody's

1639
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,039
Speaking to him

1640
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:50,367
Extra-dimensional Eeyore being possessed by demons true

1641
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,671
I'm not entirely sure if that is

1642
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,487
The case in 2003 so every time there's some kind of an in

1643
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,511
Indication of something

1644
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,303
I like to bring it to the Forefront

1645
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,375
And I don't know if it says anything about Alex

1646
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:08,799
Cody definitely believes in literal biblical prophecy

1647
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,079
Google regulations as

1648
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,359
Has the United

1649
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,663
And when Rudolph Giuliani

1650
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,199
Stated on cpanel

1651
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,735
Capital of the world

1652
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:20,575
New York City with a capital of the world and quote he was

1653
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
Correct

1654
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,623
And that is found at

1655
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,903
City of Pharr

1656
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,183
Chapter 111

1657
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,535
Caldwell

1658
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
You know revelation

1659
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,703
18 +

1660
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,495
Airport City

1661
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:39,775
New York

1662
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,359
The World Trade Center

1663
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,151
Because when you get

1664
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,687
2

1665
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,991
Candlewood

1666
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,271
Endomorph

1667
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,831
Symbolic of the Statue of

1668
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,391
Okay

1669
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,415
Open baby coming up

1670
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,951
Thank you very much

1671
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,839
Alex doesn't necessarily

1672
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,655
Jump in with him in the lips

1673
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
Decode

1674
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,471
Endtime relation

1675
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:13,567
But he's also like that's amazing information that

1676
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,872
He's he's encouraging of it in

1677
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,896
The guest book

1678
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,688
He's not engaging in it himself

1679
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,224
I find that interest

1680
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,528
It does seem like he's

1681
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,600
I mean it from what we've seen he's allowed

1682
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:32,000
Other people you platform in a hell of a lot of things he's always been

1683
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,280
To jump in on his own

1684
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,352
And and really give people a full-throated

1685
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,632
Hell yeah revelation

1686
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:41,728
The 18 is how we're going to get through this you know he does he does seem to be walked

1687
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,752
Nightline a little bit

1688
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,288
I'm so cut

1689
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
He takes off

1690
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,616
After a very long interview

1691
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,896
And Alex

1692
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,864
So you haven't seen the movie yet

1693
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,632
Oh my God

1694
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,960
What is Hindu / Buddhism up or whatever

1695
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:13,984
But also

1696
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,264
Maybe

1697
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,800
Designed to make people

1698
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:22,432
Nautical

1699
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:25,760
Farm

1700
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:28,576
A series of murders

1701
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,144
Mine

1702
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,592
We know they have the technology

1703
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,048
Tonight

1704
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,840
I don't like to speculate

1705
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,144
All I'm doing is

1706
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,520
I pull out my white glove

1707
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,592
That would be like me saying

1708
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,920
I don't like to check into things Alexei

1709
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:31,040
I seem to do it a lot, I'm honestly a very quiet person

1710
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Can people live Rekha

1711
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,880
He denies that for a long time I don't like to do that I don't like

1712
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,648
To be loud

1713
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,440
So I missed 19th

1714
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:43,840
Is May 19th episode we one last clip and this is literally the only mention of the bath party

1715
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,144
I bet I heard at all

1716
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,704
And I should say that we are now past

1717
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,520
The point where the policy of the pacification has been

1718
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,056
Openly announced

1719
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:58,176
In other people who are coming out and speaking about getting rid of

1720
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,736
All party members within within government

1721
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,576
And in such an today

1722
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
Online

1723
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,024
Well done

1724
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,656
Walk outside

1725
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,680
That train is coming

1726
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,984
Hit me excuse me step aside

1727
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,520
Don't

1728
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,568
Yeah

1729
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,336
She's a

1730
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,384
Isn't going to work

1731
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,152
Prolong

1732
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,944
I guess it's fine

1733
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,992
Now it on the 19th

1734
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:33,760
Yeah forever

1735
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,064
Framing like a day by Z sometime

1736
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,904
Yeah this is not going to be the way that

1737
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,952
This is this is this is

1738
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,768
Isn't going to pass the smell test for very long

1739
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:53,472
Thousands of people are removed from their posts

1740
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,008
They're still in there

1741
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,080
I think we're going to get more

1742
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,872
In-depth into this stuff

1743
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,432
In the coming days of

1744
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,200
2003

1745
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,736
I think

1746
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,296
Alex is going to have to try and wiggle a bit

1747
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,600
And I'm interested to see how that plays out

1748
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,880
There was actually like

1749
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,160
You know a couple of

1750
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:17,280
Really compelling threads that I'm starting to see in 2003 that I really want to learn more about

1751
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,584
What is the anti-putin stuff Shore

1752
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,376
2 is the DeMatha vacation

1753
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:23,168
3 is

1754
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,216
Alex and Bob Chapman

1755
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,752
Find me a new condition

1756
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,032
Expand that out to like

1757
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:32,896
Side characters

1758
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:37,248
Well it's like you're playing a sequel to a video game or a prequel

1759
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,576
I like the main characters the same but maybe they're in a different

1760
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,600
Place

1761
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:44,416
Different NPC character

1762
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:50,816
I wondering where the old friends are and where do these new people

1763
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:57,216
I enjoyed I'm enjoying this a bit more

1764
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:04,896
Continuous enjoying learning and discovering new things like you always have and now that you're

1765
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,432
In the present Where We Are

1766
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:11,808
Rarely learning anyting and often discovering the same things

1767
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,576
Daily

1768
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:17,952
This is new and exciting there's at least interesting context it

1769
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,256
Ethics of disgust where is present day

1770
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,024
Episodes

1771
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,304
I do end up going

1772
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,328
Could just be like

1773
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,888
He didn't read this

1774
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,704
Do we get to the 20th

1775
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,752
Justin Alex I was hoping he'd seen the Mayfair

1776
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:34,592
Because you know I love a movie review

1777
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,408
He did not go see The Matrix

1778
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,176
Yeah probably

1779
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,456
So

1780
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,736
But you can talk about it later

1781
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Control

1782
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,280
Lank

1783
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,584
Idiot

1784
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,912
Correcting the record

1785
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:04,032
Connecticut people slander me in

1786
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,360
How silly

1787
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,176
Silly for someone to think that the Matrix has

1788
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
Crime like

1789
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
I would never

1790
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,992
They control mine

1791
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,040
Does Amaya

1792
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
Cheese's

1793
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,112
Now the trigger makes

1794
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,648
Please

1795
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,928
I'm telling you

1796
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,720
Stay out of my business

1797
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,512
Gaston

1798
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:27,072
I'm sure this is a wild guess

1799
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,120
For Alex to have on for a number of reasons

1800
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:32,192
This could never have happened in any other. Of time

1801
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,216
And it does

1802
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:36,800
Doesn't go super well but this guy named Noah shachtman

1803
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:39,360
Who has an article in wired that it

1804
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:42,176
Just come out about a DARPA program

1805
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:44,480
Talk about it a little bit more

1806
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,016
Alex distorts

1807
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,552
Some of the ideas around sir

1808
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,320
Surveillance

1809
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:50,624
And such in order to introduce Noah

1810
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,208
Corruption

1811
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,608
Going in the grocery store

1812
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,600
Noah on

1813
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:25,440
The weather

1814
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,704
I'm going to guess that you if you were

1815
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,520
Find Noah shachtman and today and asked what do you think

1816
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,568
Thinks about haven't been a Gaston Oz Show

1817
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,848
You might not get an answer

1818
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:47,200
In 2003

1819
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,736
But now

1820
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,760
In 2021

1821
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:52,576
He's currently the editor-in-chief of The Daily Beast

1822
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,880
Been out with that Alex screams about quite often

1823
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,928
A very cruel coverage of the stupid things

1824
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
He says I'm.

1825
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
Wow

1826
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,000
That is

1827
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:02,048
A career path

1828
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,840
That is a career path

1829
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:09,216
He's on the show because he wrote an article and wired about early possible plans from DARPA to create a project

1830
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,240
Called LifeLock

1831
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:14,080
Compile all available data on individuals to be able to tell the

1832
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,104
The story of their life

1833
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,152
It was outrageously fun

1834
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,432
F***** up as an idea in a

1835
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,992
It did not end up coming to pass for a number of reasons

1836
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:27,904
What was probably public backlash but another was probably the unfeasibly of creating a system that would be able to do this in any

1837
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,184
The meaning for usable

1838
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:32,512
Yeah now the NSA just grabs our metadata

1839
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,536
Duh

1840
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,816
This is beyond

1841
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:38,656
Conception of what this life

1842
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:43,776
The primary sourcing on the program was a solicitation from DARPA for people to make proposals on

1843
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,592
How to create this program that they had the name for

1844
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,920
In an idea what they wanted to do but not much else

1845
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:53,504
This is to say that there wasn't a program they were testing they were request

1846
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,528
People to put in bids

1847
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,064
Create a program to do some

1848
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,600
Pretty overly ambitious

1849
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,880
Overly f*****-up thing

1850
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,696
America the Pentagon deserves your money

1851
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,512
As I understand it from Woodway Noah.

1852
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:08,096
Describes at the way they were hoping to start some of this research

1853
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,888
What the heck researchers

1854
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:10,912
Themselves

1855
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:11,936
How to do like mock

1856
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:12,704
Trips

1857
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,472
Places

1858
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:16,288
This program

1859
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:20,128
Good logger there like physical movements scatter transactions

1860
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:22,432
Things and stuff like that

1861
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:26,784
They did it did it did not work out

1862
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,856
Wow I can understand that is

1863
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,904
I can understand how someone

1864
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,928
Might look

1865
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,696
Like

1866
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,488
I'll be really helpful in

1867
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:36,768
Criminal investigation

1868
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:43,168
And I don't get to do it probably wouldn't

1869
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,472
Has a lot of other ramifications that I don't think

1870
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,240
That would be

1871
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:52,640
The problem on the Seesaw I would say that if you're looking at that program is a positive UA

1872
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,712
Wearing rose-tinted glasses at the at the very

1873
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:02,880
What is one of the

1874
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,696
I suspected he accepted this booking because it

1875
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:09,024
In 2003 no one really knew how not serious Alex is

1876
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:14,144
And how else will taking me opportunity to use Noah's credibility to advance nonsense exaggeration

1877
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,424
Of his underlying

1878
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,192
Reporting

1879
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,240
And that's all that's going on here

1880
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,032
And I was polite

1881
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,824
I will say that

1882
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,872
Trying to read pillow

1883
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,024
Digital

1884
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:08,672
That's more polite than I would have been when he's like you know there's already RFID in the money I've been like

1885
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,440
Play f*** you

1886
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,976
And they're going to do

1887
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,816
If you don't put it in the bank

1888
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,608
Call but how would that work

1889
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:23,008
Waterpik hundred-dollar bill that I have to take a zero off of it

1890
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:29,664
It's like $97 cuz I've had a

1891
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,944
How does this work

1892
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,224
How does this work

1893
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:36,064
You're just renting money by the hour

1894
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:43,488
Is it is it possible that would the system would be is that if

1895
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:46,304
Too many people have too many hundred dollar bills out

1896
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,400
Then all hundred dollar bills will be devalued

1897
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:54,496
Play shitted like if there's too much of something it's like 88-82 goes

1898
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,520
And then

1899
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:59,104
Dilutes the don't over the RFID chips

1900
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,664
To be necessary for that would be extraneous

1901
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,712
Anyway he's very polite

1902
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:08,064
And the Alex starts talking about the finger scanning at the grocery

1903
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,344
Tree store

1904
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,368
To do

1905
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:13,696
It's like oh it's the extension of self checkout Lanes

1906
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:18,048
And of course as I was always does when you talk about this like

1907
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,840
Not really a problem

1908
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:20,608
But

1909
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,632
It seems like he

1910
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:25,472
He's not happy about it now man to a little bit of a disagreement

1911
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:42,880
That would be a low level 10

1912
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,008
I do see it

1913
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,576
That might pull out all the Restylane

1914
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:32,800
Cheese's

1915
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,848
So funny

1916
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,176
That's so funny he's coming here to talk about

1917
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:44,576
The plan that DARPA has to try and log every aspect of a human life

1918
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:47,136
Play about to every human on the planet

1919
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,928
And Alex comes back with

1920
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,976
I'm going to have to back my own groceries man

1921
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:53,280
I'm not positive actually even

1922
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,816
From reading that

1923
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,120
I bet

1924
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,912
Wired article

1925
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,752
That's lit station forbid

1926
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,032
I'm not even

1927
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:06,848
Positive necessarily that the plan was ever to make it

1928
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,384
For every wash

1929
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:11,200
Cleveland

1930
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,224
Opossum

1931
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:15,040
I think it I think it was

1932
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:15,808
Something big

1933
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,088
Could be abused

1934
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,392
Exist

1935
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,928
Absolutely

1936
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,696
Yeah

1937
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:24,512
The article V Noah

1938
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,560
Noah shachtman wrote wired is

1939
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,352
I just got Shania of this

1940
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,912
A discussion of the moral implications

1941
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,496
The people even within the

1942
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,288
So technological community

1943
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:37,824
Worried

1944
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:44,480
Natural article

1945
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:47,552
Talk about it this is what

1946
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,600
Imma have to beg my own groceries

1947
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,672
Diamond serious person

1948
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:56,768
Bottom right on the groceries I got to go and then it's going to unlock them

1949
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,352
And that's how you have to get groceries now and I have to put my own bags

1950
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:03,680
Another thing that is a concern of both serious people and Alex

1951
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,448
Maxis drone

1952
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
And

1953
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,008
Another is also

1954
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,032
Relevant

1955
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:11,104
Conversations around that don't involve Infowars stuff

1956
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,664
And Noah brings up drone

1957
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,456
Are the Browns going to bring my groceries to

1958
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,992
Did that

1959
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,272
That's not that's not the context

1960
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,808
That of this okay

1961
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,344
This is how the interview went

1962
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,184
Beautiful girls

1963
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:46,944
The chain

1964
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:47,712
Noah

1965
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:59,232
I just want more I want more of that on my regular news

1966
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:01,024
I want more of like

1967
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,096
At the end of a very serious interview with a f******

1968
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:06,656
General or some b******* then

1969
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,936
Halo real quick

1970
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:11,520
Play Live recently I've got a pretty good movie.

1971
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,056
I think it I think

1972
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,080
It's a lot of fun

1973
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,640
And I wish Alex has one harder and been like

1974
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,664
Did you know there's a major

1975
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,456
Pictures of Mind Control trigger

1976
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:25,344
What do for it once you open a can of soda I want you to get to Matrix my control

1977
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:29,696
Mother Gaston after this

1978
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:32,000
Has a talk show host

1979
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,536
Out of Rhode Island

1980
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,584
I believe Alex has been welcomed on his show

1981
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:38,912
So now the river is repaid

1982
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:42,752
Keep referring to this station Wala

1983
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:47,616
As I think it's like a 50 megawatt blowtorch

1984
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:52,480
Somebody gave him that and he went crazy

1985
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,808
The credibility is up

1986
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:00,928
Matbuot

1987
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:09,632
Yes

1988
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,912
The years

1989
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:22,176
When I was in college

1990
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:27,040
Generations later or decades later I mean

1991
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,600
College

1992
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,904
Exactly what you just said

1993
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,440
Apologize

1994
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:35,232
You with a nut

1995
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,256
I was

1996
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,792
I didn't believe

1997
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:38,816
Because I didn't want

1998
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,840
Want to believe whatever

1999
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,888
We think you said was going to happen

2000
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,960
Did in fact have until you're right Alex

2001
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,776
Conservative talk show hosts

2002
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:51,616
Stein Rhode Island Oyster how wide is indication was but

2003
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:55,456
He just seems like a kind of like a John Birch Society dude sounds like

2004
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:57,760
I don't know I don't I don't find

2005
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,528
Damn all that

2006
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:01,856
However what is interesting is that mentality that there

2007
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:02,624
Expressing

2008
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,160
Kind of like a mantra

2009
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,184
A propaganda stink

2010
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:05,952
Conspiracy theory

2011
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,280
I heard Alex say exactly the same sort

2012
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,560
Nothing in the present

2013
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,352
I've heard him say it five years

2014
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:14,400
He says this all the time

2015
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:18,496
Dislike our credibility is through the roof cuz everything we've said his come true

2016
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:21,312
The reason this rhetoric is used is because

2017
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:23,872
It's not about credibility or track records are predict

2018
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:27,200
None of these concepts are even real in the game that's being played on

2019
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:27,968
Funny shows

2020
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:32,064
The goal is to tap into the audience's feelings and provide them with psychological comfort

2021
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,112
They all have memory of someone think

2022
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:36,160
Taking that they were crazy for their conspiracy beliefs

2023
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:38,976
And it makes people feel better to have their supposed

2024
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,768
Expert hero give voice to those

2025
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,048
Viewing

2026
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,096
Importantly to put them in the past

2027
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:48,192
You're right to believe me all along we're on the other side of it now

2028
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,240
Story about Rick's Ranch

2029
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,520
From college apologizing

2030
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,288
For doubting him

2031
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,312
That didn't happen

2032
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:58,688
That story's constructed to give the audience hope that if they hold strong to their Fringe as nonsense

2033
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,016
Eventually they to while everyone in their lives apologizing

2034
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:04,064
A big too afraid to accept the truth

2035
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:07,136
You see this really consistently in these sorts of communities like

2036
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:08,160
With rampant

2037
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:08,928
Qanon

2038
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,464
Yeah I conversation

2039
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,744
That you see you like

2040
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:16,096
Fantasizing about the day that everyone will admit that they were right

2041
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,376
Yeah

2042
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,192
Weird

2043
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:23,008
Miami can't possibly be like the like

2044
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:27,616
Everyone thought we were wrong but we're keeping right and so our credibility is through the roof

2045
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:29,408
It can't be right in 2000

2046
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,432
3 + 20

2047
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,200
2020

2048
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:31,968
Like I can't

2049
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:33,248
Be bright at Bow Tie

2050
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,088
It also can't be right in those intervening years when I've heard

2051
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:37,856
Right

2052
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:44,512
Do people just constantly forget about her credible you are I mean it seems like he's creating a like sine wave of cred

2053
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:50,912
Credibility that just goes up and down depending on the the year or the day or whatever you know like

2054
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:56,544
Today our credibility throw the rope and then tomorrow I credibility is way way down you know like what are you talk

2055
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:03,712
Terrifying

2056
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:06,016
Yeah Rick

2057
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,296
I was wondering about now

2058
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:08,576
I am.

2059
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,624
You know he's very much in line with Alex

2060
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,928
His beliefs are simpatico

2061
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:13,952
I was wondering

2062
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:17,024
Hey does this dude think he's fighting demons

2063
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,680
Well I have to go back to a bib

2064
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,264
People but I have to

2065
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,544
Say it because I'm not a

2066
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,104
Unlike yourself I tell it like it is

2067
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,920
We're dealing with.

2068
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,456
Horses

2069
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:39,040
Evil in this world today

2070
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,600
Thunder

2071
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:44,672
Again

2072
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,440
Hours

2073
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,744
Qualities of evil

2074
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:53,376
Now I want to say Alex doesn't not respond to that comment at all

2075
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:56,448
Platforming somebody who has like

2076
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,240
Assertive Fundamentalist

2077
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,776
Believe

2078
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,312
The Christian belief in

2079
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,128
The war that they're fighting that is

2080
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,712
Presumably political in nature it or actually again

2081
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,504
Principalities of evil

2082
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,528
Demons

2083
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,832
A Furrow my brow at you.

2084
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,112
Why

2085
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,392
Because I want Alex

2086
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:18,208
The f****** way in and I'm sick of this teasing Bowl

2087
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:21,536
I know I'm I'm a little nap I'm a little bit frustrated with the tooth

2088
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,072
But again it's another interesting

2089
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,096
Thread that exist

2090
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,632
In this. Of time

2091
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:26,400
We now

2092
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:31,520
Have the ability to learn more about in unravel and I find that really

2093
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:32,544
Compelling

2094
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,312
So weird

2095
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,592
So weird

2096
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,616
When y

2097
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,384
Why was it

2098
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,664
Not acceptable then

2099
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,224
I mean I guess it must have been a strategy

2100
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:45,600
For him then and maybe at the conclusion you could jump to and I'm rightly sure if it's

2101
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,952
Going on like it has to be

2102
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:51,744
Something is going on but

2103
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,840
Frustrates me because it sounds like I'm making a conspiracy theory

2104
01:41:56,096 --> 01:42:01,216
About something going on but that's why we need to learn more and gather more information and evidence

2105
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:02,240
Course

2106
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:05,824
Stuff that some of these other folks are saying

2107
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,128
Isn't too far from what Alex

2108
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:11,200
Says in the current Alex Galvez more and talk more

2109
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,480
Grossly in

2110
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:14,016
And and graphically about stuff

2111
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:18,112
But it's not too far off in terms of the we're fighting demons

2112
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:18,880
Snow

2113
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:21,696
But Alex stays away from it himself for the most

2114
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:22,976
Right

2115
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:25,536
Which that's why it seems like a strategic

2116
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,304
Decision

2117
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:28,864
I guess you still booking these people that yeah

2118
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:32,448
He knows who Rick Adams is he probably knows

2119
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,984
This element of his

2120
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:34,752
Is belief

2121
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,544
He's comfortable with him expressing it

2122
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,568
He's just not

2123
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,360
Talkin to wake he would

2124
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,384
In the present day

2125
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:42,944
Cute crayon are in the present

2126
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,736
No and I mean with this

2127
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:49,344
You know with those types of people you've always got a time to Bible reference

2128
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,880
So it's not like he's been

2129
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:53,696
Talking to this dude outside off air for

2130
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:57,024
Open a weeks and they just have never had the Bible,

2131
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,816
Like these people have

2132
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:00,864
Okay if you are talkin to me

2133
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:04,192
Within a 30-minute stretch you're going to hear about the

2134
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:08,544
They're real good chance and it doesn't matter what

2135
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
We're talking about

2136
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,592
Sports

2137
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,616
It's going to be the Bible

2138
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:12,384
It doesn't matter

2139
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,152
Uno

2140
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,200
So we have a couple of clips left from the

2141
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:17,248
And the text

2142
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,040
Him and I

2143
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:19,808
Rick

2144
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,832
And

2145
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:23,904
I guess this is the other thing to that was really wild

2146
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,184
Like

2147
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,976
Cutty is on for almost 2 hours

2148
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:28,000
Hours

2149
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,304
Rick is on

2150
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,328
Look for a really long time

2151
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,352
And

2152
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,144
I thought

2153
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,192
This is long

2154
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,728
For an Alex.

2155
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,520
Yeah

2156
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:42,592
Just like right on the same page in terms of those

2157
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:43,872
New World Order Bass

2158
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,408
6 a conspiracy

2159
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:49,504
He cannot just have them co-host with you while you take phone calls.

2160
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,272
88

2161
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:54,368
Another thing that feels more like well this is what this radio shows

2162
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:57,184
Is trying to be

2163
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:58,976
Also

2164
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:02,304
I did not get into whether or not demons or what we're fighting with Shaq

2165
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,192
That would be that would be a twist

2166
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:10,496
That would be a nice little twist for us

2167
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,776
So like in the maitre

2168
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,336
Negotiate with a robot

2169
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,432
I would stick to this call

2170
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
Is this

2171
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:21,248
Is

2172
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,016
Awesome

2173
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,832
I don't even know how to set it up

2174
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,624
Okay this is awesome

2175
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,720
What happened with your deal when

2176
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,768
Do your license and they asked you to

2177
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,496
Team Masters of

2178
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,520
Terror

2179
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,800
Last week we picked that up

2180
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,872
Use it at her church in

2181
01:44:59,136 --> 01:44:59,904
No

2182
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:03,488
Gottman

2183
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,768
They will not give

2184
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:10,656
Bright

2185
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,336
So f****** funny

2186
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:22,944
This is one of Alex's biggest early publicity stunts and you could argue that it's

2187
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,736
The closing segment be like

2188
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,504
The big p

2189
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,576
Peace in his documentary America destroyed by Design

2190
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,624
Alex brings in a bunch

2191
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,160
The cameras when he goes to the Austin

2192
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,952
Dmv2go get a new driver

2193
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:34,976
Where's license snowing

2194
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,512
The process requires a finger

2195
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,048
He brings along a

2196
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:40,608
8 forms of identification and it's 50 shouldn't have

2197
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,888
Provide fingerprint to it

2198
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,936
The people at the DMV say you do

2199
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:47,776
I don't start yelling about how Bill Clinton wants his blood in urine neck

2200
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:50,592
Stan asking if the DMV workers are going to stick a needle in

2201
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,664
It's a petulant display and it's a real sign of the sort of

2202
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,224
Publicity stunts that would come to characterize his career move

2203
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:56,992
Forward

2204
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:59,040
It's so hilarious

2205
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:03,392
That at the end of the story he just went back without the cameras and gave the fingerprint

2206
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,672
To get his driver's license

2207
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:06,976
I know he has a driver's license

2208
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:09,280
She got a DUI few months back

2209
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:12,096
Driving without a license.

2210
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:12,864
So

2211
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:15,424
Infuriating exactly like Alex

2212
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,448
It's it's so it's

2213
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,728
Is Alex to a T

2214
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:22,336
I need a new I need a new ID so I guess I'll go get I'll give you my thumb Pride

2215
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:28,224
I will go and I will take this sand and yell while there's cameras running and get attention and

2216
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,528
An Insight people into a frenzy about these

2217
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,552
Supposed political

2218
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,344
I believe something's like I am

2219
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,136
Standing up for all the people

2220
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,416
Yuno anime

2221
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,720
I need a drive

2222
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:46,144
Dayan this hell two days later I'm real sorry about that that's my bad

2223
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,216
He's like yeah you can't get around it but like

2224
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:50,240
I don't know

2225
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:55,872
The radio I can't do people going to do

2226
01:46:56,128 --> 01:47:02,272
Hire a lawyer to do it for me while I work no I have to do all of my own lawsuit what am I supposed to do

2227
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:07,136
The hard work of having a printer

2228
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:13,536
Pretend to have a principled stand do you have time to have principles, I don't care what

2229
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:15,072
What you don't have a job fine

2230
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:17,376
I'll have principles outside

2231
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,168
Crazy

2232
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,472
Alex

2233
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,520
A call from an H-E-B manager

2234
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,824
It is this has to do

2235
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,848
With more of his

2236
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:27,872
Thought ideas

2237
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,176
About waivers and what-have-you Asher

2238
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,456
This manager is bringing up

2239
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,480
That

2240
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,760
Her place of work

2241
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:38,112
They are now talking about bringing in a scanner like a fingerprint

2242
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:38,880
Scanner

2243
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:39,904
For the time clock

2244
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:41,696
Different

2245
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:48,096
Then the idea of a checkout lane that's connected to your credit card this is the beginning of

2246
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:48,864
Bring it

2247
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,912
Anyway the manager wants

2248
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:52,704
To ask Alex about ways that she

2249
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,728
She can fight back

2250
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,752
And not

2251
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:56,544
Use this system

2252
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,592
And Alex's advice

2253
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,872
He's so Alex

2254
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,664
That it's almost laughable

2255
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,712
Here's my thing

2256
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:05,504
I need to know what is my

2257
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,808
Give them my fingerprint

2258
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
You're not going to be

2259
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:28,288
Okay and is there a

2260
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,824
Any place you can recommend

2261
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,872
On the web or

2262
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:34,432
Certain spot in the library that I should look

2263
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:35,456
Research

2264
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,760
Stopping what my rifle are at

2265
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:39,296
But I can use as a dependent

2266
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,696
I can't think about your home

2267
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,568
I really do Billy I got

2268
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:09,760
He's not

2269
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:12,320
I forgot he has plenty of you take more calls

2270
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:14,624
Yeah there's no advice

2271
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,648
There is nothing

2272
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:19,488
There is no specific references he can give her to help her better

2273
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:20,768
Navigate list

2274
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:23,328
Struggle that he wants her to engage in

2275
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,400
And to his advice is essentially

2276
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:28,704
Make up a religious exemption

2277
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,752
Use use religion as a prop

2278
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,288
Yep

2279
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:34,592
Yeah there's no part there's no part of like

2280
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,872
Here is what

2281
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:40,224
That is violated all this religious belief here is the reason

2282
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:43,040
Like dietary restrictions

2283
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,064
You know

2284
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:44,832
Make sense

2285
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,112
Religious exemption

2286
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,928
In various settings

2287
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:50,464
Whatever you want

2288
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:52,000
That

2289
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:52,768
Make sense

2290
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,816
And there are other things

2291
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,864
Opposition to war

2292
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:58,400
Being conscientious objector

2293
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,936
Absolutely makes total sense

2294
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:04,544
This I don't know I mean I guess what he would do say mark of the beast

2295
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,592
Easter something like that

2296
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,920
I guess that would be the direction that it would go

2297
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:11,200
I don't know if

2298
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:13,248
I don't know if that relieved

2299
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,528
Wood standoff

2300
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,552
Describe Nick's

2301
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,576
Amen

2302
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:17,600
It's

2303
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:18,368
Tumi

2304
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,696
Indicative of how Alex engages with a lock

2305
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:29,120
It's use it to your advantage elderly the things you don't want to do

2306
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:31,168
The things yet absolutely

2307
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,216
No I will not

2308
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:39,616
Tell you where to look into this I mean how could you possibly expect somebody to win a

2309
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:41,408
You religious exemption lawsuit

2310
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:43,456
If there's a clip of you saying

2311
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:46,784
Make up a religious exemption for this

2312
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,576
I just want to be totally cleared that's

2313
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:49,600
My language

2314
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,880
Did I do or make it up

2315
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:52,416
He's not saying make it up

2316
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,208
That's how it is

2317
01:50:54,464 --> 01:51:00,608
He is saying make it up you know he's saying find something in your religion that you 99% of the time either

2318
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:02,912
Don't think about or don't actually believe

2319
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:03,936
Ubrite

2320
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:10,336
To convince somebody that it's the most important thing to you now suddenly despite again never having

2321
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,384
Thought about it in your entire life

2322
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:18,016
Have these arguments very loudly on camera and then go back and eat

2323
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,552
Sorry about that my bad

2324
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:21,856
What how is he

2325
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:23,392
Man it takes so much

2326
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:25,184
It must be so exhausting

2327
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,720
Convince yourself that Alex

2328
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:27,744
Susanna giant useless

2329
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:28,512
Piece of s***

2330
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:31,328
Like you just heard that clip wouldn't you be like

2331
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:32,608
Oh

2332
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:33,632
Well then you're

2333
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:36,192
Your entire life is meant

2334
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:37,472
To be fighting at

2335
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,008
The tip of the spear

2336
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,568
And you are giving me advice that is nothing

2337
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:44,128
You are the person who has more knowledge

2338
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:47,456
And more resources than we do

2339
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:50,784
Individual info Warriors out there in the field

2340
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,320
And you had a perfect

2341
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:55,392
Situation where you had a lot of people supporting you they had your back

2342
01:51:55,904 --> 01:52:00,256
You could have been the one to do this lawsuit totally in order to make sure that all of us

2343
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:01,536
Good guitar waivers

2344
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,560
And not have to give

2345
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:04,352
Fingerprints to get a DMV

2346
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:07,424
We got our licenses on the radio

2347
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:08,448
So

2348
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:15,872
Guess I guess it's going to have to be the H-E-B manager with very little money no note IR

2349
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:19,200
No cult of personality around back

2350
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:21,248
Responsibility

2351
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:24,064
It's a little bit do you know

2352
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,600
I mean it's not new but it is

2353
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:26,880
Is just a gross

2354
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,416
Denial of

2355
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:31,232
The self-appointed role

2356
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:34,304
This is a Grassroots movement where is

2357
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,096
Exploit the Grassroots

2358
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,120
Okay

2359
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:39,168
You can water the grass

2360
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:42,240
Or you can suck all of the life out of it

2361
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:45,312
For every single Cent that you can steal

2362
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,080
Yep

2363
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:48,128

01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:52,480
Nikes

2365
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,528
We come to the end of this

2366
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,832
I really feel

2367
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,624
Like there are threads

2368
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,160

2369
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:00,928

Is coming up that I really really want to know

2372
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,096
Where are these things go

2373
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:13,728
So I hope to have you say I'm not going to lose track of the present-day or ignored

2374
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:15,008
Entirely but this is

2375
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:15,776
This is

2376
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:16,544

2377
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:19,616

2378
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:21,920
Just so uncanny you know like

I recognize this guy and yet everytime I hear and talk

2380
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:26,272
Who the f*** is this guy

2381
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:29,088
You know like it's so close to Alex but it's

2382
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:30,624
Even weirder

2383
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,440
Yeah we're even taking for granted like almost

2384
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,976
How

2385
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:37,536
Nutty it is

2386
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,096
The position on Putin

2387
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:42,400
Night and day

2388
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:43,424
Agates

2389
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:45,216
Outrage

2390
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:48,288
I can't believe how jaded we are that that

2391
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:52,384
Completely is like almost pass a to a certain you know like

2394
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,736
