1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge fight

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
Jordan Jordan

6
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
What's up

7
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,704
My bright spot today Jordan

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,824
Is something that actually happened a little bit back but it's

9
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Been reflecting on its

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,456
Appropriate for the 500th episode don't do it here

11
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,760
Suede is smooth in that little 500 Drive

12
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,320
Yeah for sure

13
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
Futsal betamerica

14
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,696
So I recently was

15
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:39,328
Did by listener Sarah back to give a little bit of a Q&A session discussion with

16
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:44,704
The college course

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,056
Such a rewarding interesting experience to be you know

18
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,616
Ask to talk to these college

19
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,176
It's about issues like researching

20
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
Topix

21
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
And

22
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,088
It was it was amazing

23
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,488
These kids were great all those scary I'm scared I'm scared of college kids

24
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,536
They look so young they are adults

25
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,096
It's technically that scares the s*** out of me

26
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,680
That is a problem and then also like I remember back when I was in college

27
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,520
I would just be disapproving by Nature sort of like the default look

28
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,080
On your way

29
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,664
I'm used to being a stand-up and and I want to

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,736
Elicit a response or positive

31
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
To imagine like

32
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Leaving myself

33
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,672
Can College look at my face

34
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,512
Convey a message

35
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,608
Invoice from doing stand-up and teaching you know like they were teachers or how they were stand-ups in

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
It never occurred to me that you would have

37
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
Have to stand up in front of all the

38
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
The same types

39
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
The people

40
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
But they don't

41
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
Make a response at all

42
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,872
It's terrifying because of their

43
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,944
They're a crowd but they're not a crash

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,552
I can't do crowd work I'm not going to do a little 5 minutes up top every time

45
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:09,440
Thank you so much to sarabeth and those it was just a great experience

46
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
First really first

47
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,304
I think

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,656
I think I can put that in my title

49
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,264
Oh my bright spot Dan normally would be that assassin

50
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,824
Creed Valhalla is coming out

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,224
Not yet it's not here with me being able to do a preemptive one with Pikmin

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
But I won't be using that

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Because Dan

54
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,296
My audiobook

55
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,648
Is finished and it is up on the website for everybody to download at

56
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,440
Their Ledger

57
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,768
School is really fun to do thank you very much for helping

58
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,608
Sing me producer made of tiny cameo

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,264
If you rated there are some Easter eggs and some weird things that are there on purpose I promise you to confuse you and kind of

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,640
Disorienting for a little lost.

61
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
That's where they can find it

62
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,736
I'm excited that it's how people can enjoy

63
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,832
The fruits of your labor with by which I mean screaming

64
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,904
Can my apartment

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
Go straight from listening 24 hours of us talk

66
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,559
Get rid of the best part of this haha

67
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,959
The great idea to listen to my audiobook get rid of me and replace it with you doing voices

68
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
Is despite what you say

69
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
I'm very happy

70
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,455
We got an interesting thing to do

71
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,271
A little bit

72
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:43,391
Election-time Infowars I've been hearing about

73
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,695
Might be a little bit different

74
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
Then what people could have

75
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Expected

76
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
Last week Jordan we talked about how

77
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,167
Be too difficult to do an episode about the election to be released on that when

78
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,263
Wednesday and I remain true when it came time to record Friday's episode

79
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
At that point there was just

80
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Too much uncertainty

81
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
I felt very difficult to discuss the whole thing with our kind of

82
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
Having any feelings of closure about the election itself

83
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:13,343
On Sunday as we record Monday show more of a sense of finality

84
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
All the networks have called the race for Biden and it looks

85
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,999
Looks like guy the basis for any kind of legal challenge Trump's campaign to make

86
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Lb week

87
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
And it'll probably go nowhere

88
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,631
Everybody celebrating the Biden winnows

89
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,215
Huge raise a glass to the on-the-ground organizers and vote already

90
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
Extreme activist

91
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
In those Battleground States

92
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,823
The kitties of leave gone the other way

93
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,919
It's still mind-blowing anywhere near that close but

94
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,735
Country probably owes a deep debt of gratitude to a

95
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Kana people

96
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
Whose names you'll likely never know

97
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:49,183
So now I'm more of a sense of what's going on I feel like I'm standing on more solid

98
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,999
It's time to get to Alex's election coverage what happened

99
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Or maybe not

100
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:59,935
As I reflected over the weekend I had a bit of

101
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
Yeah that was what's up with you like a baby.

102
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,007
Qdel

103
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,055
I had a bit of a realization Jordan

104
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,895
A large part of motivation for me doing this podcast with my revulsion

105
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
And seeing Alex and his crew laughing

106
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,783
At the diverse crowds of Hillary supporters crying on Election night 2016

107
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,111
Mocking would what was for many of them a very real and just

108
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
Define existential fear

109
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
So now the tables are turned a little bit

110
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,279
And we have an opportunity to laugh at his behavior on the like

111
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Tonight went things

112
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
Didn't go his way

113
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
Do we mock his

114
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,167
Appears comfortable in the knowledge that they're probably fake

115
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,007
And even if they are real the things he is afraid of aren't real

116
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,335
Is it just as bad for me to do a show where I relish

117
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,871
In his election night mode

118
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
Obviously the answer to that is no

119
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
It wouldn't be just

120
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,831
Is bad for me to do that would be totally cool

121
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
I'd love it

122
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
But also I'm not going to do that but for slightly different

123
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,767
What Alex Jones did on Election night literally doesn't matter

124
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:03,167
We can block his freaking out and yelling the same bulshit he yells everyday we can discuss his very dubious claim

125
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,567
You decided not to go on rugans Livestream Winona cord we can talk about his obvious intention

126
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
Incite violence but here's the thing

127
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
The most disrespectful

128
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
Roofing I think

129
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,759
You can do is it arms of Alex's election night coverage

130
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
Easter treated how deserves to be treated

131
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
And that's to say who gives a

132
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Oh yeah

133
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
You a******

134
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
The lashing out the tears that yelling about demons

135
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
It's all meaningless

136
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,351
Some pills might have gotten sold but if I'm going for schadenfreude I'm not going halfway

137
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
And saying we'll talk about your election coverage sometime but it's

138
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,543
Totally not important now that's way harsher than playing clips of Alex yelling nonsense

139
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
And then say haha your guy lost

140
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Yeah that's true

141
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
So we're good talk about the election coverage

142
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Another time

143
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,271
Maybe a year from now who knows I don't know

144
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,855
It's not out of respect for Alex and his crew in this difficult time

145
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Out of it deeper disrespect

146
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
I'd like it so

147
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,791
F*** all of you Infowars

148
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Twist that you have right here

149
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,655
The reality is that Alex is now entering Uncharted Territory

150
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:12,031
His audience has been led to believe that any non Trump win would be the result of large-scale election

151
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Thereby make

152
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
Any Biden presidency illegitimate

153
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Further use

154
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
Extensively characterized

155
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
His opponents

156
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,271
From high-level politicians do street-level activistas pedophiles

157
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
In the employ of the literal Christian devil

158
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
Over and over again he said that Trump getting elected was the equivalent of the biblical story of God given the reprieve

159
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
Nineveh

160
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,399
And that story Jonah isn't listed by God to warn the people of Nineveh to repent of their evil ways

161
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
But he decides to go so

162
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Somewhere else

163
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,775
He ends up getting swallowed by whale then realizes I got a job to do

164
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,335
It's a ghost gets out of the whale

165
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,151
I am then he convinces everyone there to repent

166
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
Thereby saving the city from God's judgment

167
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
According to the wake Alex characterizes

168
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
Is Trump's role as being reminiscent of this story

169
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:02,207
Combined with the people of the United States not deciding to repent by getting on board with Trump

170
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
Who's my pretty leads to a different conclusion

171
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Jonah story

172
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,839
We're all going to get eaten by a bigger whale

173
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,655
This is kind of more like Sodom and Gomorrah

174
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
Anyways it Alex

175
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Characterizing

176
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:19,359
If you take Alex seriously Alex's. His audience that his enemies are literal demons dead-set on the killing of the entire planet

177
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,431
Appease Lucifer and turn into robots or whatever

178
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,271
And that Trump was the US's only chance to repent and be saved

179
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
Now that that has been passed

180
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,159
It seems like it's time to become a full-on wrath-of-god doomsday preacher

181
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,719
That's one possible Avenue Alex could be going down

182
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
I honestly have no idea what Alex

183
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,375
David will be but I'm interested to see how much of the stuff you retains and how much you just pretend

184
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
I never said that s***

185
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
His audiences captured

186
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
So he could just start walking another Direction

187
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
As long as he talks

188
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
Fast enough and Jingles lose Keys around

189
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
Still retain some percentage of the auto

190
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
Some new Route 10

191
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:57,247
Colonel will tell Alex about some new piece of Intel that'll make everything make sense

192
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,319
Are there still good guys fighting off the devil inside the government

193
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Or something

194
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,391
We'll see what he ends up doing but I've learned

195
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,695
Not just to assume that the boat is going to sink

196
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
Because it looks like boy that boat

197
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
Alex still has a few cards

198
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
The boat should

199
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,143
Have enough holes in it

200
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
And his box

201
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,751
Should have no air holes in it and that should be enough to

202
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
To take him down

203
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
But it doesn't seem to be

204
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Asher

205
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:26,687
So I'm going to leave desperate an intensely boring electoral Alex to his game

206
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,599
He can try to whip up excitement about his attempt to Brandon Trump's lame-duck session is the 79 days of hell but I do

207
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
I don't think that's going to catch on

208
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,231
I wouldn't be surprised if Alex even loses interest in it before January comes around

209
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
But where does that leave us

210
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
What are we going to cover here for today's up

211
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
Episode 500

212
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,679
Well I found that the show works best when I follow my heart and my aunt

213
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
And there's only one thing that I want to talk about today

214
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
And that's how it

215
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
Infowars has been reeling

216
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
At the beginning

217
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Are they 79 days of hell

218
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,967
We can talk about Alex going to Maricopa County on Thursday and using

219
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,807
An adult-sized bullhorn to yell about how they needed to stop counting ballots but

220
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
Honestly it just seems like a waste of time

221
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,719
The reason Arizona's been calls for Biden and honestly that wasn't much more than a sad and

222
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,535
An entirely predictable publicity stunt on Alex's party

223
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
No that would be a waste of time

224
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
What I want to discuss is something far more

225
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,215
Which is what happens to a propaganda Outlet

226
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,519
It's run by a tyrannical Central Authority

227
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
When they were anointed god-king is losing an election and their tyrannical Central Authority runs off to Arizona to do a poop

228
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Bestop

229
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
How does the leaderless

230
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,623
And almost certainly confused underling who works there how did they keep the operation going how did they respond

231
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,023
How long has he been gone well he's back now but in the. He left on Thursday after his show

232
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,351
I think he got back on like Saturday for 2 days

233
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:54,751
He just wasn't there might have been back on Friday I'm not entirely sure work at covering Thursday evening

234
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:01,151
Okay into Friday morning

235
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
Watch a bunch of incompetent people scramble around and fantastic

236
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,855
On Thursday

237
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
I present to you George

238
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
Episode 5

239
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,255
For why Infowars doesn't work without Alex

240
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,071
Before we get down to business on that

241
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Give a shout out to

242
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
To folks who was made

243
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
These past five hundred episode 40 nights

244
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703

It's just all the vowels

252
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,487
Taking out a demo house to prayer

00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,279
Has a bone to pick with someone named Peter from Denver

261
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
Ruler of the walks

262
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,471
Attention

263
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,799
And Denmark Feud

264
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,455
Are you saying there's literally prevalent that there may be trouble ahead

265
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,551
We have a contender title of

266
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
Blank of Denmark

267
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
Peter from Denmark

268
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
Benda from Denmark

269
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
From Dad

270
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
From Denmark

271
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Thank you so much

272
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
Heroin

273
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,431
Is freakishly large

274
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,247
Dying

275
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,855
Yes thank you very much dying that's from Denmark to stay out of this conflict

276
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,719
And see who comes out on top of that I was always on their side

277
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,375
Who sent us a wonderful care package

278
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
I thought that we'd done the whole technocrat Shadow but I believe we might have forgotten or maybe I'm not entirely sure what happened

279
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
We've already done it in the

280
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,663
The pass maybe that's awful if we did mess up or Miss

281
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Current temperature

282
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Strong

283
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
By declaring the becks

284
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
You're not a technic

285
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
No no no no

286
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Your Raptor prints

287
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,135
And an order of that I've made a special drop

288
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,439
There was a request that we use the old techno

289
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,999
Minecraft drop because it included the daddy shark

290
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,327
They'll be better if I just made a new one

291
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,399
Which also included the daddy shark 1

292
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
The daddy shark 1 hour

293
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
So thank you so much packs also thank you we got a special pack of episode

Mama shark eddp

304
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Inside

305
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
The freeways were met before

306
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
Hate myself

307
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
I feel like a complete failure

308
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,423
Thank you very much Mac

309
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
Wonderful new job

310
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,823
Play It Again

311
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
Now let's jump into this episode

312
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,455
Cuz we are deep into the

313
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
We're going to start here on November 5th

314
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
We are past the election

315
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
Alex is reeling

316
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,671
You know think of the account is still going on bro

317
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Call indication

318
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
I'm sorry that you know things are not looking at

319
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
That great for Trump

320
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,631
But they all involve Pennsylvania

321
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
And then some other things also

322
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Is it

323
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
Conservatives are

324
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:53,503
Talkin Rebrand coyote and the roadrunner

325
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,135
Who painted The Way Forward on the wall and Alex is the one who crashes headfirst into reality

326
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,231
It's out where he's at

327
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
I want to give you the big announcement here

328
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,167
If Joe Biden gets in there never getting rid of the lock

329
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
It's a lot bigger than just kicking Trump out in

330
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
They want a bank rob

331
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Dodge

332
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
And then have us have an app

333
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,623
Believe our front door and step one foot outside of our house

334
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Admitted

335
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
Global strike on playing

336
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,487
So I guess that's now the angle is

337
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,583
If Biden gets in then the lockdown is never going to end

338
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:45,471
Covid-2 you're forever with something that one might even be hard for his followers

339
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
To buy

340
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
Really you're going to say that

341
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,615
Joe Biden is just going to say everyone stay inside

342
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919
Also what do you want us to do now the elections over

343
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:00,319
The lockdown already happened and nobody listen to it anyways

344
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:05,695
What are what are we going to Viking going to change about that he's going to have even the Lesser

345
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Evil

346
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,863
Probably less willing to use a lot of the forest Trump

347
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
It has been I mean except for against left

348
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
Well but look man

349
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,263
There is there was an election and it was

350
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Trot

351
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
With a fraud

352
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Yeah there's a lot of it

353
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
I don't remember the

354
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
Maybe you didn't hear about this

355
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Okay

356
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
Videos of

357
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,039
Individuals in Michigan arriving with those ballots

358
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
At 4 a.m. illegally and going into the building

359
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
With ballot

360
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Boxes

361
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
The Demerol for Biden

362
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
The arrogance level is

363
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
So

364
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Atrocious

365
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
I don't even know

366
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,167
So is he in flag

367
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
Good China

368
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
Send people from

369
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
Michigan

370
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,383
With Mark Ballas for Biden ostensibly

371
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
Also coming from China

372
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:04,831
The Box itself is the only thing that you probably see in videos

373
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,671
Turn on the bus

374
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
There were a bunch of

375
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
These videos that were going around they were like

376
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,631
Drastic misrepresentation television

377
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,983
Pruitt was unloading gear pallets going in

378
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,567
And there was a video that went around that was actually from like

379
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
Years ago in Russia

380
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
People are just saying

381
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,551
Was that from one of these states

382
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
The idea that there was a suspicious

383
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
Possibly Chinese person

384
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,695
That's real

385
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
That's just

386
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
I just real sad on like a

387
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
Conspiracy level of just like

388
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
Man

389
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:55,007
Is it could have mailed them to San Francisco and had a white person Drive their why would you why would you fly

390
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
Directly from China to David

391
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,895
They land on top of the ballot-counting building

392
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:06,783
They're going to helicopter from like just of a real world perspective

393
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
You listen to it you can

394
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
Can kind of hear

395
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
What his

396
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,463
Like where he's coming from the story that he's telling

397
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
Alex

398
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
I would say

399
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
Lowe's

400
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
2 line

401
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,447
The Nightline is what I like to call the

402
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:29,567
Saying hey let's do some authentic violence Y close to that line

403
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,127
They are involved in a revolution

404
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Fully

405
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Conquering

406
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
The United

407
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
States

408
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
And killing

409
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Republic

410
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
And they're hammering the last

411
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
Nails in

412
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
To the damn coffin to bury us

413
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
Alive as slaves of their sister

414
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,023
I'm not a macho guy I don't say things just to say I'm

415
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
But I'll tell you this

416
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
I'm not going to watch any offensive line

417
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
At this point

418
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
Because I've not

419
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
Think about

420
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
The right course it has

421
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
But I do this

422
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,783
If we let them steal this election and we let them put a Chinese Communist agents fully compromised with all the proof

423
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
That control the nuclear codes

424
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
All about

425
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,720
Are the destruction of our country and a Handover

426
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,024
Authoritarian Nation the world's ever seen

427
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
Communist China

428
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
And I will not be in accomplish

429
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
This type

430
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
I'm take over

431
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
So if I understand correctly what he saying first I have to take issue with the idea that you said I haven't

432
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Time to think about

433
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,920
Yeah.

434
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:44,320
I would suggest that you've been thinking about this almost non-stop 495

435
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:49,184
Pretty much the only thing you've been talk of it any thought to when you

436
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
Start being violet

437
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,816
Wow the course of history blah blah blah

438
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
The course of history

439
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,912
Not if you understand what he's saying he's saying

440
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Is

441
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
Controlled by China

442
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,800
So if we buy we aiming Alex on the paper

443
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:10,432
If we allow Joe Biden to take office with a nuclear codes and what have you

444
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Uark

445
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
Complicit in aiding and abetting

446
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,552
The Chinese Communist takeover

447
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
I mean

448
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,672
That would be getting into office will be the condition

449
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
And then for offenses viola

450
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:28,096
Descendants all of this is simply

451
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
I am not

452
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Counseling

453
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
Actual violence

454
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Until

455
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
They're swearing him and I guess

456
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
But once they swear him in

457
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,616
Well yeah we got to blow it up because they're the most Authority

458
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
Thor if you could do something that you could

459
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,712
Conceivably like argue is going to

460
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,784
Stop him from being sworn in

461
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,904
Gradle MetLife limousine in front of the gate

462
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,928
To the White House

463
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,232
If you can't get anybody guess what

464
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
Never becomes president

465
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
Doing well

466
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Yeah

467
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
Is just it it's bland

468
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
I would describe

469
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
This show

470
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
As Flash

471
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,336
There's there's very little going on that even Pete

472
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
Peaks my interest you at all

473
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
The hits

474
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
It just kind of like him saying the same thing

475
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
I got a hitting his base

476
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,808
Bieber criminals in a broker

477
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,136
The shadow out of America

478
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
And they want

479
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
Atomizer family and domestic

480
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,304
So we can never rise again and never resist

481
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,352
The nightmare future they've got

482
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
All of us

483
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
The chains are going on right now

484
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
You're being Des

485
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Enfranchise all of us

486
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Bolinao

487
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
So that Ward is not becoming

488
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
We are now entering the

489
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
Season of War

490
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,528
Our country is at War for its very life

491
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
You are under attack

492
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
You are being conquered

493
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
You are being taken over

494
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
We were in the midst of a chai combat

495
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,256
Cover of the country and we're losing right now

496
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
I just can't

497
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,632
Feel anything. Anymore

498
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,984
Personalized like I was thinking about it whenever we heard the first clip of him talking

499
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,056
King and then I realize that right now the only thing I'm

500
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
I'm interested in

501
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
Really is

502
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,408
Is he going to take the plunge

503
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,552
You know what is he going to do what is he going to do are you going to take the leap or you're going to back off and if you back off

504
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:29,952
F*** you forever and if you take the leap alright now let's see what's happening

505
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,256
Do you change your whole brand to God

506
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,352
Like you are becoming televangelists Alex drawer whatever

507
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,888
That seems to be the way to make

508
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,472
Way better body than what he's doing and it seems like a place where he could

509
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,544
Play a lot more games about like

510
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,664
Stay depression an actual Church

511
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
Right

512
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,064
Becoming Scientology and then like just

513
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Made it his

514
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Entire life

515
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
Information to be a non-profit

516
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,744
For the government not to text him

517
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
See that working

518
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,840
Yeah that might be the next best thing

519
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:12,192
I agree I agree with you it's like I'm not I'm not really interested in

520
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
Yelling about

521
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
The Chinese

522
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
I

523
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
Really

524
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
You know

525
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,896
Maybe it's just a momentary thing but I'm a little bit bored

526
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
By the

527
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Do you like

528
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
Waffle around

529
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
Offensive violence

530
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,600
We know what you're doing if yeah really

531
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:36,512
I'm not interested in his going to Phoenix into a bullhorn

532
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
I'm not that interested in it

533
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
I'm a little bit of

534
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,608
Was too big

535
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,400
For me to be bad interested

536
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,936
I agree I think he got two notes

537
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:50,336
Yeah

538
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
I mean

539
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,296
It's just as the most interesting is like what are you going

540
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,344
You have a problem

541
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,392
And I want to see how you fix it

542
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,952
Or at least I want to see how you deal with it cuz I

543
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,744
I don't think you're going to fix

544
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,792
That's a probably a good note

545
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,816
Correction

546
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,120
What are the things he's doing right now

547
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Is

548
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
See him do a lot

549
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
At times when

550
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
I think people could probably

551
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Predict

552
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
That there's going to be

553
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,592
A possibility for some viola

554
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,640
I think any

555
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
Thinking person

556
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
McKinney's

557
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
Specific predict

558
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
Anything but

559
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
But I do think that as we

560
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,856
We great closer to the inauguration

561
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
We do see

562
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
Probably an increase

563
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,976
Danger of

564
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,000
Some kind of

565
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,280
Right-wing violence

566
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,376
I don't know that it's going to happen and it very well may not but I think

567
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
The odds

568
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,936
I'm kind of a thing

569
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
Happening

570
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Baby

571
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
It's impossible

572
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
Yeah

573
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,872
I think Alex recognizes that until he goes out of his way to

574
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
Two very consistently

575
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,968
I talked about how false flags are cops

576
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
I promise you I'm not giving up

577
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Ever

578
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
Because I know

579
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,136
The more I bend over

580
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
The worst up yet

581
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
I will not

582
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
And be part of this

583
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,096
What up man I blow something up and say I did it I never do that

584
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
Okay

585
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
School

586
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:24,800
We see this all the time and it's of the times that I think that Alex is most keenly aware the people in his

587
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,616
Communities my bus company

588
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,968
This is a good strategy for him to preemptively characterize anything

589
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,344
Them false flagging in order to make us look fat

590
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,904
He doesn't he he goes on this tip quite a bit

591
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,720
And the enemy's next phase will be due

592
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
49ers

593
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Or evil

594
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,840
And they will stay Terror attacks and blame it on us

595
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Credit

596
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,472
We need to be ahead of that understand that

597
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,520
And their other forms of civil disobedience

598
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
Something in the threat

599
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Continuum

600
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,592
Projection

601
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
Movies that point but it is alright

602
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
It is

603
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,432
Beauty

604
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
The resistance

605
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,272
Means necessary

606
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,672
And we are now at War for our very existence America is on the edge of death

607
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:19,072
So if you understand that what you saying is that the enemy is going to fall

608
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:24,448
Flag ya themselves in order to make Alex and his friends look bad and they got to be careful about that but also

609
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
I should tell you that there's something called the threat

610
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,568
Continuum projection and then also we have the right to

611
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,872
Terror attack

612
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,920
Yeah I'm confused as to

613
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:39,296
How old is you can play a game like this where it's like a we would never do those terror terror attacks its

614
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:44,160
False flag can but whatever if it does happen Bill and then the people are going to be like

615
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:50,560
Good job we do Terror attacks we loved Arabic with everybody

616
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,120
Alright is all of the

617
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,168
Bogalusa a f****** false flag

618
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:01,312
I think that might be true or something

619
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,872
Was that

620
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
Was Larry Nichols is

621
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,712
Act last act to false flag us with

622
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
The proud boys

623
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,040
Uno

624
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:16,928
Strategy might have I was going through like making that new drop

625
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,000
As I was going through like these old folders of episodes

626
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,608
I like whatever I do that I end up finding something that I completely forgotten about

627
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:29,984
Like did you remember that a year ago Alex was saying that the queen had joined the Patriots side

628
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
Do you remember that

629
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Remember that

630
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:42,272
Picture of a completely forgotten there was like a two-day stretch where Alex thought that the queen had

631
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,952
I think that's going to be something but if we ever do look back on these four years

632
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54,048
Like whatever it'll be funny again and in 50 will look like

633
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,144
At one point in time Alex said literally everyone he

634
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,936
You hated before was a patriot

635
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,776
I'm also that he hates them later it's in everyone

636
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,848
Is everyone a queen has with her dictator switch

637
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,408
Pope is evil but the public

638
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
A good today

639
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,992
But someone would never speak ill of

640
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,320
Steven or 500 years from now is it brother

641
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:22,464
I don't know who this dude it's okay brother-in-law

642
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
Okay

643
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
We have

644
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:33,472
Forget cats we have Alex's wife's tennis partner informing us about antifa tax course and Alex's brother in

645
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
Coming in

646
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
Prison big scoops

647
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568
And then my own

648
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
Brother-in-law

649
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,480
Do I have never seen get mad in the many years I've done

650
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
Pause up shaking

651
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
Yesterday

652
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
I just

653
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,440
Got $50 you know down there Congress

654
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,256

00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,120
Well I'm in the post office

656
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,192
Do that

657
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,872
Shaking with anger

658
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
Send me a voicemail

659
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
He did

660
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
They're f******

661
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,600
Give me a goddamn break

662
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,416
Forgetful

663
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:30,816
Committed voter fraud has like I follow the law

664
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:35,424
I would never as a far-right person I would never videotape a crime

665
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,824
My brother-in-law knows about all the time I have proof that can make it look nice

666
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,128
No

667
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,272
I can't pull up my phone don't you think there's any event really happened there's a moment in his head where he's like

668
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,696
Well here is his testimony recording audio

669
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
The post office

670
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
The drop offs

671
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Packages with some products

672
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
And

673
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
Sky they're real sky

674
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,656
Any other grocery

675
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Re-bag

676
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,704
Filled up with about

677
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:09,984
50 balance

678
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
And he was thinking

679
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Themself in phone

680
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
Right there on the counter

681
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
And

682
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
I can only see the

683
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
The ballot

684
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
That he had in front of them on the counter

685
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
In the one on top of the

686
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
The back

687
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
But they have the same signatures

688
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,600
Same information on them

689
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
And he was just

690
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Taking pictures

691
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
Doing one last check

692
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
Marking something

693
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
And then put them

694
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
Stream the back.

695
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
Ring for the baby one

696
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
On the counter

697
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864
And no one did anything

698
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
And I think about doing some

699
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
Think about was

700
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
You know

701
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
Me getting some kind of federal charge for

702
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,544
You're interfering with the election

703
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
This guy

704
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
Naked palettes

705
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
That is what you would be doing

706
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Late

707
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,480
Cuz I don't think this was a good

708
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,808
I mean if you have a lot of these people doing that

709
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
It's going to add up

710
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,624
And the only reason you would do it

711
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
To try to overturn

712
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
What

713
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,488
State has

714
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Decided in Tech

715
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Texas red

716
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
So one can only assume

717
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
That these boat

718
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
All 50 of them

719
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Going to jail

720
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
This this

721
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Sky

722
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Chose

723
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:24,992
I mean he's the brother-in-law's he's not related by blood now that they're being close to the Jones family

724
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
It just makes you

725
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,576
Good at figuring things out

726
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,368
Good at investigating

727
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
There's like something in the in their in their family and their extended family that makes them not jump to conclusions about stuff

728
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,792
Nothing really just

729
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
Get to the bottom of it

730
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:43,936
I admire that if you need somebody to help you fill out your ballot does that person also need to

731
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,776
To sign the ballot they do yeah it could have been like a proxy

732
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
Siri or something

733
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
I've just gone to a nursing

734
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,128
That is a possibility

735
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,176
Or I mean if he's saying that this is like

736
00:33:54,432 --> 00:34:00,576
After election day they might not have been balanced open anything I don't trust this guy

737
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,136
I have no idea what

738
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:08,256
Did or didn't see I don't even know if he's out with his brother-in-law quick question did he mail in his ballot

739
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,280
I doubt it

740
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,352
Does he know what a mail-in ballot would look like

741
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144
No idea

742
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,728
I don't trust any of those and I love the part at the end there is like

743
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
The only reason you do this

744
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,056
Is to try and change things

745
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:25,152
And Texas went red so therefore already potoo

746
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:30,016
All these votes that I have just decided AR-15 I didn't count them I have no f****** idea

747
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
They must all be

748
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,832
Dumb dumb

749
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:44,608
Texas is already got right I suppose they hadn't called the other states with this time okay

750
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,192
They're being sent from Texas

751
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
The other state

752
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:57,152
NFL are you guys got you guys got to work on that if that's the case I mean it's 50 votes

753
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
What kind of

754
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,944
I don't know

755
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
I think it's a stupid

756
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,296
Texas by a million

757
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
There's only one solution

758
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Fair enough

759
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
IQ

760
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:17,632
Think of anything everyone in the United States agrees is the worst idea that anyone could ever do

761
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,936
Let's do it again

762
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,520
The most stressful time it doesn't matter what

763
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,800
Siri robot

764
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
Don't do it again

765
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,688
Anything but that okay fine bye

766
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:36,320
Let's not do another election how about we know the five is one

767
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
The comeback

768
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,952
I'm going to say this right now

769
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,304
Whatever happens with Trump he's done the right thing fighting this but he didn't fight the central

770
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,632
We're in the bed we're in now

771
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,656
We're going to have to sleep in it

772
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
But if we get

773
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:56,288
Globalist takeover at the end of the country as we know it

774
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,568
And that it's illegal

775
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
Stealing the election

776
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
What's happened

777
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
And if we

778
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,088
Proof

779
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
We're going to nullify

780
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
100

781
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,464
Percent

782
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,256
Not have a fake investigation

783
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,560
Because we've got him red

784
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
Episode

785
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
Supercuts

786
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,960
Institutional

787
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,008
Where can I buy the legend of

788
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,592
McConnell do it without a trial

789
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:36,992
You know you if you're caught red-handed you still go to trial

790
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:43,392
If you get caught killing somebody they just hang you right then and there that simple

791
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
Call Dan alleged

792
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:49,536
Killer unless you're far-right murder in which case

793
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
You didn't actually do it was a false flag

794
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
I guess

795
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,424
Alex wants to know this this isn't going to work

796
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
I don't I don't think

797
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,032
Strange was this is like

798
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
Oh

799
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
Like I said flat

800
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,896
Feels like nothing

801
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,480
And then Alex as a guest on this guest

802
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
I don't know what the fuc

803
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Fuckyous dude

804
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,832
So this person is named Amanda Milius

805
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,928
Haha she is the daughter of John Milius

806
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,768
He's the director of Conan the Barbarian Apocalypse Now and of course

807
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Red Dawn

808
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,656
Alex's favorite documentary Red Dawn

809
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
I'll maybe producer

810
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:34,336
Okay I was going to tell you because there's a pretty famous guy who directed apocalypse

811
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,880
Directed any of those invited them over wrote them or something

812
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,184
Call Mick

813
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,256
Whatever

814
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,816
She's become a trump propaganda

815
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,632
Sure that you just released a film called

816
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,912
The plot against the president

817
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,192
And so

818
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
She is in

819
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,288
Interesting things to talk about

820
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:10,688
I love the smell of a huge part of why I left Hollywood I was listening to Infowars all the time

821
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,272
And I left and I went in a volunteering 2016 in Nevada

822
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,576
Which by the way Nevada is is it huge

823
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,392
Battleground for us right now Nevada's where everything's happening

824
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:25,792
And and I ended up leaving Hollywood completely joining the Trump Administration working at the state department

825
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
How's your family

826
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:31,680
Therefore they're pretty happy

827
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:40,128
Not to be a dick but Amanda Milius is not somebody who you would say walked away from a vibrant career in Hollywood

828
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,504
If you check out her IMDb page has two primary credits as a director one being this new Trump film

829
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,832
Show me other 18 2015 short called the Lotus Gun

830
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:53,696
Her only credit as a performer are as herself in a documentary about her dad

831
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,976
And appearances on Tucker

832
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,280
Carlson & Sebastian Gorka show

833
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:01,120
Most likely promoting Trump and her new propaganda film

834
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:06,752
It's all good to do this interview and be like hey look at this famous movie person's daughter who likes

835
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,848
It's entirely another thing to pretend that you would like an A or B or even

836
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
C-list

837
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,432
A person and then walked away from it to get on board with Trump

838
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:20,832
That's insulting to her and his listeners movie person of course his daughter

839
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Tendons of his

840
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,904
Success has also become a massive sea

841
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,464
Success in the film industry what was that know of

842
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,304
Yeah and you were there she said she worked in the state department yeah

843
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,608
She apparently was involved in Trump's state

844
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:39,008
There is a feeling of her being here almost in a beneficial

845
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,872
Trump propaganda film that you just released

846
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,664
Wow she had

847
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
To get the state department

848
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,504
Is just a just a bizarre

849
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,784
Is it appropriate

850
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
Think someone with

851
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,136
Less than my resume should work

852
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
The state department

853
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
And I don't think I should work at

854
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:02,560
State Department

855
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,632
I'm going to get even worse cuz we introduced another weirdo head

856
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
Alright

857
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:10,752
I love Ali Alexander he's been on fire long time

858
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,824
You talk about how you just suddenly brought us together

859
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,616
Nnn reached out

860
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,064
Got a bunch of people together and now this is a super viral moment

861
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
So Allie Alexander is

862
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,720
This Zealot weirdo it's been coming on Alex's show a bit

863
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,024
Now he's involved in something called

864
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
Bastille

865
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,608
Which is the other doing the airliner update

866
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,912
It's maybe the catchphrase of a lot of these

867
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,752
Totally not AstroTurf 100%

868
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,032
Grass router

869
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,616
I don't care whatever I'm more interested in the fact

870
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,408
I only remember this because

871
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,688
We just talked about it

872
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,344
Stop the steel was the name of the things that Rodger Stone was involved in 2016

873
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
Jesus Christ

874
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
Rodger Stone

875
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,232
You got sued about how man

876
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,376
2016 is the year all their evil tricks worked in 2020 is the year they almost works

877
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,704
But everybody found them far more disappointing and sad

878
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,008
Social super weird

879
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,848
It's the same name is the same name

880
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,432
For your protest movement seems very strange to me

881
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,480
It makes me wonder if Rogers somehow involved

882
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,016
But I have no idea

883
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
He is nowhere to

884
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:32,160
Still have the email address

885
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,976
@yahoo probably

886
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,512
So Ali wants

887
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
Alex wants

888
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,840
The new election

889
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,400
Only in the states the Trump lost

890
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,960
Well because there's a recall

891
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
You know

892
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,592
Unfortunately even winning Nevada wouldn't put us over

893
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
That puts us at 26

894
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
55 or 2

895
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Q66

896
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,455
We have to win

897
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,551
Pennsylvanian what Kine o it's not popular Republican party doesn't want me to say this

898
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,135
We need a Revo in Wisconsin and we need a revota Michigan

899
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,023
We are going to get a recount in in Wisconsin but here's what I'm afraid of Alex

900
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,327
I think the Democrats have baited us

901
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
Into a rig

902
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,119
Recount

903
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
God

904
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Recap rap

905
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,727
Sky's classical

906
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
Guys

907
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
You just lost

908
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,567
We didn't

909
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,871
Paint you into a Rico

910
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:29,247
Trap no one wants a recount it's a classic recap track

911
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,647
It's not even if it's a setup

912
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,207
Every election since Hoover

913
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,023
This is what he thinks

914
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,351
The Democrats big prestiges at the end of the film they like

915
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:50,751
And we wanted you to do the recount the whole time we won the state and we want you to force a recall

916
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,823
Capsule weekend also with

917
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
More

918
00:42:54,847 --> 00:43:00,991
So we can win more this time I can't imagine why the Republican Party

919
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,039
So he believes

920
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,855
Sally believes that trumps just got to seize power

921
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:10,207
But we certainly need to use the full weight of the federal government

922
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,559
And and and what we got to do is we the people have to say you have a mandate to do that

923
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,351
President Trump.

924
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,911
Any candidate in American history

925
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
The idea

926
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
Just visualize this go to your child and ask him

927
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,055
Do you think that Joe Biden would be the

928
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,615
Top vote-getter in American history

929
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,919
No nobody believes that

930
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,247
And so we know that it's rigged they just had a plus one system

931
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:38,879
Where did every Republican. They came in they found a dead person they found a covid ballot

932
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,183
Somebody did a mail-in ballot and then voted in

933
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,975
An election day 2

934
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:49,119
They rigged the election there's nobody who's going to believe that buying is most popular politician in American history

935
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,959
Do for me

936
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:57,055
So excuse me if we win by

937
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,639
66%

938
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,687
This is dumb

939
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,479
I would say

940
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
Don't ask your child

941
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:10,623
This question is a lot of surprises

942
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,439
Yeah yeah sometimes you'll be surprised

943
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,279
Act like a six-year-old with no prior actual experience

944
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:22,911
And really no understanding of the American system at all whether or not biting would be the most popular candidate

945
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,215
See that no one would think

946
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,775
In a bubble Biden would get the most votes

947
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,055
Has anybody ever

948
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:35,455
But I think if you look at the context that makes a little more sense if you consider

949
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,247
Haha a lot of that is

950
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,527
Is voting against

951
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
Trump

952
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,319
It makes sense

953
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,879
Yeah yeah yeah but he's like yeah

954
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Because Yuki

955
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,535
Get a magic child couldn't imagine that someone likes by and more

956
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,351
That's not good thinking about a bill

957
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,375
That's real Bash

958
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
Sucks

959
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:57,983
Any leaves and Amanda and Alex

960
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
Start talkin about life

961
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,567
Drudge man

962
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,383
Grudges grudges gone

963
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,175
He doesn't like us anymore

964
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,479
What happened

965
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,575
I didn't you tell me you know I might everybody thinks he was kidnapped and there's somebody else

966
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:16,159
Someplace because this is very bizarre his behavior this year it's very weird

967
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,231
It's not helpful is what it is but whatever his

968
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,535
Game as I'm not super into it but

969
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,095
But anyway

970
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,143
What he blackmailed was he kidnapped

971
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
They're willing to do anything

972
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,727
I think

973
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,079
He was at the White House somebody to listen to him he's awesome Trails got really pissed

974
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
They were standing up against censorship

975
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,663
And

976
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,783
CNN

977
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
At least it

978
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,599
Seems like

979
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
Elise stefanik

980
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583

I'm not trying to be a wash right I don't care

982
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,423
I don't know

983
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
CNN

984
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
And it's

985
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:10,175
Flavor it's their signature matches very very well

986
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,247
Finlayson MN

987
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,551
When we go back to the steaks

988
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
Words like

989
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
He said nothing

990
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,927
Drudgereport is leasing

991
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,743
Georgia's leasing The Drudge Report to CNN

992
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791

Dogman

994
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:33,983
Contract to because you can't really run off to some extent is it

995
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Hardin

996
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,311
Is everybody good

997
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,591
To share or is it like the

998
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:43,199
The Super Bowl thing where you can only buy a okay

999
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,527
If this does mean something that imagine

1000
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,367
Did the hero of your media sphere the guy who has

1001
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
Directed

1002
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
The course of

1003
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,487
Conservative talk radio for the last like 20 years

1004
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:01,887
The guy who can make or break people

1005
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,983
Therefore brought us Breitbart

1006
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,007
The guy who's like

1007
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,567
Responsible for so many s*******

1008
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,359
Also someone who's site

1009
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,383
You can lease

1010
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,735
People that something that I think they would

1011
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:23,647
But that would be like I'mma come with her he's a grifter prior

1012
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,719
Prior

1013
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
You working for

1014
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:35,423
Murdock can't afford his prices anymore now it's just seeing it is that the implication

1015
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:41,055
It's actually kind of touchdown what probably could be a reasonable explanation

1016
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,335
And that is

1017
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,639
The Drudge got LED in a little bit

1018
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,199
Saw the disorder is although quote-unquote

1019
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:52,575
Betrayal recognized the Trump wasn't taking the issues of like online censorship seriously

1020
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,391
He would be super interested in giving

1021
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
His brand

1022
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,695
In his entire mark

1023
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,791
Space you would think I'm so he followed his principle which is

1024
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,119
Can support this anymore or whatever

1025
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,655
How to get rid of 2:30

1026
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
I act gay

1027
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,239
Conservative media

1028
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
So I am

1029
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,311
If they do that

1030
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:18,943
Cuz I'm now a single-issue voters and your guy

1031
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,271
Kill my best bigstackd Lee

1032
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,951
Recognize the game that he understands actually what's going on but you got to play some fun things

1033
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,559
Family Style by CNN kidnapped or blackmailed whatever

1037
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,679
Another question

1038
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
Not only what's up

1039
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
With my drug

1040
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,519
What's up with Trump

1041
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,799
Where's he been

1042
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,615
Let me ask you this question cuz you are an Insider

1043
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
Patriot lemon

1044
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,919
I was flipping out

1045
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
The dancing lights

1046
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295

1048
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Fireside chat

1049
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,671
Shelly-Ann

No Gateway pain and I think she'll the best job overall Dallas and pores on video the best butt

1051
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,303
I don't care I'm going to win

1052
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,095
He should be up there showing it

1053
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,375
But then he's been

1054
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
Dead Silence

1055
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
And then

1056
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,703
Part of the crew

1057
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,495
They all separately

1058
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
Cuz I respect

1059
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,871
Where is he

1060
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,687
Ataxia

1061
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:26,015
And he's going to see what we do

1062
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
That is

1063
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,135
A great leader

1064
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,487
Our fearless leader he is

1065
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
Decided to allow us

1066
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,815
To choose what he will do

1067
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,119
Based upon our

1068
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,655
Disorganized action

1069
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,215
I've kicked it away.

1070
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,495
So if

1071
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,519
It goes bad

1072
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
It's kind of our fault

1073
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,591
Ball in Ark

1074
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,871
Just didn't

1075
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
The building

1076
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
Update

1077
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,295
What you do whatever you got to do

1078
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
What a leader

1079
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,623
You know what

1080
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
I'm almost

1081
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,439
I'm almost like

1082
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,279
Goddamnit America can't even get a good dick day

1083
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:15,679
Good dictator like we're just shity people we're just shooting people got two other places know how to get a

1084
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,727
Dictator you don't like it

1085
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,519
30 dictators

1086
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,055
They know what they're doing

1087
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,847
It's a little

1088
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
Strange

1089
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,551
The position that Alex has put in his like he's he's he's presented this guy is like strong

1090
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
Compass

1091
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,599
A good leader

1092
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,159
It in a position where you're like

1093
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:37,951
Everything is

1094
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
Is pretty

1095
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,743
Uncertain

1096
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,767
Things are tense

1097
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
There's election

1098
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,327
I'm counting going on

1099
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,959
He's not assuming a leadership position all that's right

1100
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,239
Though the thing he's supposed

1101
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:56,895
Yeah you can do that without asserting power or claiming you won the election you can still be visible

1102
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,431
Xavier

1103
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,015
This is going along the processes move and we support the vote counter Zelda

1104
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,551
There is a way to do that

1105
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,087
And still like give the appearance

1106
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,367
It's someone's here

1107
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,671
Charge app

1108
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,975
Instead do Alex even recognizes

1109
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:15,839
I don't f****** know I don't know if I've seen Trump's intellect yeah and no one knows what to do

1110
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:21,215
And if you look at all of the people on the bed like this is maybe another thing that we got lucky with

1111
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,239
Because Trump such an

1112
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,031
In actually shity leader

1113
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,567
Everybody went ape shitt

1114
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,359
In their own little pockets like

1115
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,919
Throughout all of election night and as the votes of

1116
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,943
Come in and they they

1117
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,967
Declared it for Biden

1118
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,015
You see more of those little pockets of everybody

1119
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
Frantically

1120
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,063
Disgusting with all their friends

1121
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:40,927
But there's no unified yeah we're going to do this it's everybody's separate like

1122
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,951
I don't know what to do

1123
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,743
You hasn't said anything

1124
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:50,143
I don't know what to do I don't know what to do I don't know

1125
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,423
Lead us to our next clue

1126
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,471
Because there's a phenomenon that Amanda

1127
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,031
Discusses that I think is really interesting powervac

1128
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
Got to Arizona

1129
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,871
In like what

1130
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:06,527
What couple hours like he was like I'm there I'm going and he gathered all those people and did I mean that's what's happening right now is

1131
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,575
Is everybody's putting aside any kind of

1132
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:12,415
You know critiques of the administration or whatever is happening in there just

1133
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,487
They're just jumping in because this moment is everything

1134
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:20,095
She repeats that a number of times about like people like Mike crnkovich inject

1135
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,423
Osoba can all these people these influencers

1136
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,727
Farallon

1137
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:30,591
Presumably on the same page cuz you haven't like Ali Alexander on another one

1138
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,639
Do they all put aside their differences

1139
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
Any luck we got

1140
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,943
How to do something right

1141
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
Had no s*** they are

1142
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,247
Their game is over

1143
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,575
Recognize

1144
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,879
The door is closing

1145
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,671
On the scams they've been running

1146
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:49,023
Is like Trump he's going to destroy my business

1147
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
Assertive itches like

1148
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:53,119
I think we should probably start a war because they're f****** up my business

1149
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,751
We're just whatever like we are going to very quickly

1150
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,287
Not have much rather

1151
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,431
As the opposition right there is already

1152
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,527
I guess I could just be an MRA guy again

1153
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:16,927
Do my pickup artist thing again maybe just get your real estate license

1154
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,951
Giselle

1155
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
Yeah

1156
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:28,191
That's when I was kind of interesting I don't experience it because I don't know what any of these damn dogs are up to

1157
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
To privately play

1158
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,239
It is it is

1159
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,263
Hear her say like

1160
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
All everyone putting their

1161
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,895
Their heads together and figure out how to survive

1162
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
The swamp

1163
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,479
Congealed how do we how do we escape this

1164
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,063
Let's claim Laura Loomer actually won

1165
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
That is very good

1166
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,415
Stupid

1167
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,999
Because all man the here's the great thing about later on

1168
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,535
And here's my here's my guess

1169
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,583
We're going to see a very close parallel

1170
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:59,167
Between what happens at Infowars whatever Alex is

1171
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,727
God and what happens in the far-right when it

1172
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,775
Hallandale be some

1173
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,335
Some fractioning you know something

1174
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:10,175
I think there'll be some splintering off but you'll see you'll see kind of

1175
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:13,247
I think what's going to happen to everybody is basically what's happened to

1176
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,527
People who've been kicked off Twitter

1177
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,903
Sort of spiraled a little bit even if you had

1178
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,927
A platform

1179
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,487
This is worse than worse

1180
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
Yeah

1181
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,047
And I think

1182
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,583
Did you know you're really see the difference

1183
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,863
30 people who have

1184
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
Something

1185
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
And are safe

1186
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,935
Yeah.

1187
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,007
That people like Jack pasovic and Mike cernovich are not

1188
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,567
Secure I don't think they're stable

1189
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
A media position

1190
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,895
People like Ben Shapiro

1191
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,663
Or Alex

1192
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
They are

1193
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,991
There is like Alex Hudson

1194
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:50,111
Issues to iron out and figure out what you're going to do

1195
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:56,511
And a gigantic media operation

1196
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,559
A bunch of his audience

1197
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,839
But you'll figure out something

1198
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,399
Ben Shapiro's probably going to be embarrassed

1199
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,167
For a little bit

1200
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,447
But he'll be fine

1201
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,519
He'll be fine we'll figure out something to do

1202
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,871
Check pasovic is going to keep working it like what these

1203
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,431
Fringe oan type Outlets

1204
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,247
Just know where there's no path forward there

1205
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,295
Speaking of people who are going to be fun

1206
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,855
Because they just have a big enough brand

1207
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,647
James O'Keefe comes on

1208
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,183
You think James will keep is going to be fine

1209
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,767
Has enough of brand

1210
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,327
And name recognition inside of like the larger

1211
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,095
Conservative

1212
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:35,423
So you're sure that he could sort of abandoned a lot of these like

1213
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:40,287
Things that are tailored to the Trump base and he could be fine I think

1214
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:45,663
He's if you're associated with Andrew Breitbart personally I don't think you're ever going

1215
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,735
Going to be away for you to keep

1216
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,015
Failing upwards yeah

1217
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,551
And he's on with a

1218
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,087
Arable phone connection

1219
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:59,487
He's just talking about voter fraud it's really hard to listen to because the voter online is awful

1220
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,023
Yeah there's also very sad

1221
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,559
It honestly comes off last

1222
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
About Alexa

1223
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,375
He's trying to prove some kind of claim

1224
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,935
It seems more like he has this narrative that he wants

1225
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
To sell to people

1226
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:13,311
He's trying to recruit other people to play the role of whistleblowers for him

1227
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,103
Like to use them as props

1228
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:22,527
Multi-level marketing

1229
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,855
What we need today

1230
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
Muller

1231
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,647
People

1232
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,671
Kohl's

1233
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
People Whirlpool washers

1234
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,231
Handlebars

1235
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,511
Tupelo The Wiz

1236
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,791
Reason Army opposed

1237
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,071
Florida cannabis

1238
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,863
Now is the time

1239
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,887
Today tonight

1240
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:43,519
I don't wait our destiny our future are are very Birthright been stolen

1241
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,055
Unless people

1242
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:51,455
Takamaki beard guest star in my next video the way he gets all of his quote whistleblowers

1243
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,247
I found it very uninteresting

1244
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,319
So Alex has now decided at this point in the show

1245
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,855
I got to go somewhere

1246
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,951
Cernovich went to Arizona and people seem to enjoy that

1247
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,999
There's people yelling

1248
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,535
In States

1249
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,095
This is still wet concrete

1250
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:10,143
Yeah he could still do something

1251
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,935
Are still some attention

1252
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:14,239
Arizona seems like it's getting

1253
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,799
Closer so that might be one where we actually might

1254
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:22,687
Maricopa County Ohio who I also love so much

1255
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,015
Has Alex decides he's got to go somewhere but he does

1256
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
Doesn't know where

1257
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:33,695
Go to

1258
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:38,047
Fitback what's going on

1259
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,839
Arizona

1260
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,655
Where should I go to Georgia

1261
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,447
Should I go to Michigan

1262
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263
God almighty

1263
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:51,359
You're try to fly direct from MOS eisley's Arizona

1264
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:54,175
Analog clock

1265
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:59,807
Do you have to take a couple of stops riches

1266
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:06,207
You know we all know that he eventually ends up going to Arizona videos really

1267
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
Difficult time

1268
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,767
I'm figuring out where to go

1269
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,583
The Show Goes On to like earlier

1270
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,143
He was kind of just like puzzling over why Trump is

1271
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:18,239
Not appearing right anywhere and he's kind of like guys just letting the people act

1272
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,775
That was earlier

1273
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,335
Every show goes on he starts to get a little bit

1274
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,639
Mad about the fact that Trump is hiding

1275
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,455
It begins Democrat lawmakers call on Twitter

1276
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,503
Remove US president from the plateau

1277
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,879
What's your 100 times more lateral

1278
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,183
Where is the president

1279
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:40,511
We haven't seen him unless I'm wrong crew your watch

1280
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,047
As much as I do more

1281
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,631
Two eyeballs to eyeball

1282
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
12

1283
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,983
Panera

1284
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,775
Has Trump been saying

1285
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,335
It's 3:30 in the morning on Wednesday

1286
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,639
Just asking

1287
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,479
36 hours ago as anybody seen the president

1288
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,783
Did the Cookie Monster eating

1289
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,087
Cookie

1290
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,671
Where is the president

1291
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,951
Where is the present

1292
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,999
Defend the president

1293
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,071
I love the president in the great job

1294
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,351
But I mean

1295
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,399
We're in the middle of

1296
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,191
Alamo Warriors

1297
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,751
And we ain't seen Colonel Travis today now

1298
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
Huh

1299
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:30,175
Just like the real Colonel Travis off drunk somewhere I mean like

1300
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:33,503
I don't know I don't take fault with that thought

1301
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,831
Devoid of anything else you saying it's like yeah you should be

1302
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,623
You should be frustrated

1303
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,439
Guy really guiding

1304
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,463
The folks

1305
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,511
Is that is that why it is

1306
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:50,911
What have all of those predictions of like trumpism is never going to leave us rrall countered by the fact that we

1307
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,959
And expect them to eventually be like

1308
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,751
Hey Trump sucks

1309
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,127
I think so you finally betrays them at the end

1310
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
They're finally like all s*** we got caught

1311
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:07,807
No I think a lot of the underlying things are we have to be more worried

1312
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,855
And someone who isn't

1313
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,903
As much of a very

1314
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,439
Clear con man

1315
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,511
Carrying out some of those political thing

1316
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,583
The flaws in our system that Trump is

1317
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,119
Is exploited the recognizing

1318
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,143
But there is no reason

1319
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,935
To not act like a dick hole

1320
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:27,263
And there are no reason to follow Norm

1321
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,543
Apparently because

1322
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
Because

1323
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,591
Some people do

1324
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,919
Unwritten rules are just drifting

1325
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,479
People generally been

1326
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:40,063
Beholding to a lot of those things and I think Trump is really

1327
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:45,183
I exposed that there's no reason there's no consequence

1328
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:49,535
Baseball if you do a backflip too egregious

1329
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:53,631
Hit in the back with him

1330
01:00:53,887 --> 01:01:00,031
We get to hit Trump in the back with a fastball

1331
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:04,127
Over conman it somebody's a lot more capable and has the same sort of

1332
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:08,479
Policies that appeal to people will recognize the ways in which they can

1333
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:12,319
Break Unwritten rules and really worried about

1334
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,855
And I think

1335
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,391
Set those people will again fall for

1336
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,415
For that

1337
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
So Alex

1338
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,535
I need to go somewhere

1339
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:22,815
I haven't

1340
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,607
Team Trump on TV in a long time

1341
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,191
A motherfuking take a nap

1342
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,007
Maybe I'm going to get a jet airplane fly Mia

1343
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
DC

1344
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
That's where I need to be

1345
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,735
That I'm trying to like

1346
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
I can't

1347
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,855
I have to go to my sleepy

1348
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,623
Place

1349
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
A joke

1350
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,183
Name of that

1351
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,767
I literally I'll go take a 30-minute nap

1352
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
Answer to something

1353
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,375
I go to bed and I'll have a dream of what to do I got to

1354
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,655
Dial in my subconscious

1355
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
And I

1356
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,847
Have the engine turn off

1357
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,175
With in my mind what do I do and I'll wake up with the answer

1358
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
Is it d.c.

1359
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
Is it George

1360
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,295
Is it

1361
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,831
Arizona

1362
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,623
Is it Detroit

1363
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,255
Go to hell

1364
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,071
But I mean I just can't sit with us

1365
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,631
And do nothing

1366
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
I got to take a shower

1367
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,031
Oh my God

1368
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,807
Country Club

1369
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:51,391
I got to do something I just there's so much history going on at got to do something

1370
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
I will take a nap

1371
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,487
Dream by delish

1372
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
The reason

1373
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,047
Teresa

1374
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:04,703
I do recognize that even with Trump not being in power

1375
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,263
I'm still entirely fascinated by Alec

1376
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,055
And the reason is

1377
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,615
It's a compelling psychodrama

1378
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
It is

1379
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:19,039
Where in the where in the next season where he's just confused for the next year I think he'll be confused for a bit

1380
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,087
But I think he'll land quicker than

1381
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
Maybe he's

1382
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,879
You should just go to Tibet

1383
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:27,231
That's where people find themselves at know when takeover

1384
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:33,887
Just become a f****** Buddhist out there just do it calm down relax live your life a little better blue be interested

1385
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,703
But there's a 30% chance that he won't need to do

1386
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,471
Okay

1387
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,495
I give

1388
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,287
Trump 30% chance

1389
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,055
Pull this out

1390
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,079
The broad

1391
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:46,687
But now it's nobody came for those babies getting chopped

1392
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,711
69

1393
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,343
Kidnapped by the left

1394
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,623
Porter Ranch

1395
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,951
Good too long and God sick of us

1396
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
Woohoo

1397
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:08,703
You got to get a better got bad so I guess we've been judging will get a burn

1398
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:13,823
Is really really returning on a hairpin these 30%

1399
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,919
Trump somehow proves that the amount of fraud election fraud

1400
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,735
That will stay.

1401
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,015
Good God

1402
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:22,783
What are we

1403
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,111
Patriots are being cold from the internet

1404
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,159
And Alex

1405
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,487
Has a familiar thing happened to him as he's trying

1406
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,327
They're going through everybody that's been identified

1407
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,119
As a patriot for this coup

1408
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,167
And they're blocking and freezing or Banning or

1409
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,959
This is a takeover

1410
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,239
When the lights go out

1411
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,799
That's when the troops

1412
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,591
Come down

1413
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:48,895
This is

1414
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,759
At least you're full-grown adults shot a baby in the womb got chopped

1415
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,319
We deserve what's about to happen

1416
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,367
Get close to Jesus and wake up

1417
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,927
Get your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye

1418
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,095
Go ahead and play that

1419
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
Wonder Rob do gave us

1420
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,959
Predict

1421
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,031
All of a sudden happening that was when I talked about

1422
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,311
We have that

1423
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:25,247
We're going to have a Moment of clarity

1424
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,319
About 2 hours ago

1425
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
That's wonderful

1426
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
Just tell him that

1427
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,647
No problem

1428
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,439
And

1429
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,767
Federal meetings about it

1430
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,887
But

1431
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
Phones

1432
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,519
Computers have a

1433
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,335
Habituated

1434
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,639
Amazing

1435
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,455
They produce so much information

1436
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,735
Better they don't face

1437
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,759
Two-Face

1438
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,527
That decision

1439
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,319
It never happened so that's okay

1440
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,623
Show

1441
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,647
We're going

1442
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,671
Tear that on air

1443
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
So

1444
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,959
Did you just tell me that is employees don't read emails

1445
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:21,823
Maybe they don't do the same for me

1446
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,615
They ignore me if I'm not yelling

1447
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,967
I can't get tone and email

1448
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,039
I tried all caps it doesn't work

1449
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,831
I mean

1450
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,159
I just thought I'd put that in there cuz I mean

1451
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
That is what the

1452
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,463
This is all about

1453
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,511
I know that I've heard this feedback from the audio

1454
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,071
If Biden wins

1455
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,631
Alex's Tech problems will go away

1456
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:51,519
He'll recognize that he's got to get his s*** together and they'll really clean up

1457
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,823
And take care of business

1458
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:58,943
No another storyline to follow a Alex into bet I'm going to call it that this

1459
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,503
Sure

1460
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,783
I'll go down with that

1461
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:07,135
The show on November 5th

1462
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,695
It off to Matt Bragg

1463
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,279
Noted weirdo Matt Bracken

1464
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
Fourth our host

1465
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,631
And nothing else at bracket

1466
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,447
Alex needs to go somewhere

1467
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,263
Need to get some guidance about where to go

1468
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,799
So you ask Matt Bracken

1469
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
Where am I going

1470
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,871
I'm planning to get on airplane antenna

1471
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,687
Peter Gunn

1472
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
Arizona

1473
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,759
We're going to Georgia

1474
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,087
Play the clip

1475
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,111
Where do you think

1476
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,415
People need to be the most on the ground is it

1477
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,183
Detroit

1478
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,975
Is it is it

1479
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,999
Arizona is

1480
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,559
Georgia

1481
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Detroit

1482
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,399
The multi-front War I would probably

1483
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
Google say Philadelphia

1484
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,447
Because if

1485
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:56,031
If it's if it doesn't happen in Pennsylvania

1486
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,079
It doesn't matter the other ones are peripheral

1487
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,895
All of the pathway

1488
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,175
Toys for Trump require

1489
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,527
Good point Matt I'm going to Arizona Donuts

1490
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,927
That's creepy.

1491
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:20,607
All right but that's a that's a very good point but I have friends in Arizona and Philly will be

1492
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:27,007
Beat the s*** out of me

1493
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,567
People dancing and they want to hurt me

1494
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:33,663
Greedy

1495
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
Alex

1496
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,759
Ghost take a nap I guess

1497
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:42,367
And then the spirits come to have a download to go to Arizona okay

1498
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,927
Like that

1499
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,487
Owen Shroyer comes in to host the War Room

1500
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,279
And

1501
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,559
Has a big guest

1502
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,095
On the show

1503
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,143
I get the sense that by this point

1504
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:54,911
Alex Isley

1505
01:08:55,423 --> 01:09:00,031
I think he's already en route to Arizona because there is a sense of like

1506
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,311
Which cadalack

1507
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,615
Accident on this

1508
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,175
She's either taking that nap or he's on

1509
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,967
Arizona

1510
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
Biggest

1511
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:14,879
But dr. Steve pieczenik as we're in the middle of this selections over we're now in the stealing process of the election

1512
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:19,999
What are you seeing what's going through your mind as you're witnessing this gigantic hoax

1513
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:27,167
Happening now in the reason I couldn't come on the Alex

1514
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
Jones

1515
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:30,239
Show last night was

1516
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:34,335
I was not given the permission that I needed to in order to say what I'm about to

1517
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,359
So now

1518
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,407
Do not work for the federal government

1519
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:44,575
Make it clear I don't work for the government

1520
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:52,767
Inside a bottle

1521
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,815
Just a little bit so you can hear the doctor

1522
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,863
Yeah you didn't have permission to

1523
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
To say something

1524
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,191
I didn't get the go-ahead

1525
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,215
From Melania

1526
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:05,055
And now we will be taking over everything I am

1527
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,615
Concert to Melania

1528
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,663
Can I be honest with you

1529
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,479
I think that he knew that the shoot wouldn't fly without

1530
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,295
I absolutely think how you think of that

1531
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,575
Permission mean

1532
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:22,975
That's exactly what I thought because here's what he's got two because I couldn't say this on Alex's show you would let me

1533
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,023
Recently got permission guy that got you

1534
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,095
Yes he's really a sting operation

1535
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,655
Countrywood everybody else said

1536
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,679
Trump

1537
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,983
Knew this was happening Eric

1538
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,519
Give me this was happening and

1539
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,543
OneRepublic

1540
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,127
I could not say any

1541
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,943
What happened was

1542
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:43,967
Weimar

1543
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,991
Watermark

1544
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,271
Andre ballad

1545
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,063
Call the QFC

1546
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:48,831
Ask

1547
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599
Block

1548
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,135
Chain encryption

1549
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,439
Another words we know pretty well

1550
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:56,255
Wherever it is where it went

1551
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,535
And who has

1552
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,815
So this is not a

1553
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,375
On the contrary

1554
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,191
We were verse the entire game

1555
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,239
Along the lines

1556
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,263
Sun Tzu

1557
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,543
The Art of War

1558
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,335
And Trump was brilliant and

1559
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:16,991
Is Steve claiming that the election was actually a sting operation

1560
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,783
Voter fraud

1561
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,807
Where is

1562
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:23,647
The Department of Homeland Security has water marks all of these

1563
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:28,511
Not explain what you mean by that

1564
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,535
They can be traced

1565
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:34,399
They know literally where every single ballot is at any point okay

1566
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,423
Is Watermark they can

1567
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,823
Can tell which ones are fake so there's a bunch of

1568
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:46,175
The real bad reasons why

1569
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,455
This is really

1570
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
Particularly bad

1571
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
What is

1572
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,063
This is a narrative that

1573
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,087
Is so provable

1574
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:57,439
If you have this information

1575
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,743
If Trump really does have this

1576
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,559
First of all he needs to bring it out

1577
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:07,935
This the only thing he needs to do don't want him to be president moral obligation

1578
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:13,567
To tell the nation this is exactly what you would do like the day after they called everybody be like okay

1579
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,895
Now we're going to reveal that this is all the sting operation

1580
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:22,015
This backfires because no one cares and they all think I already lost the election

1581
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:29,951
You have this hard evidence that's true hard evidence

1582
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,999
Deer season non-falsifiable

1583
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,279
They have to be like

1584
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:36,095
They get about kuzin counter kouzan

1585
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,911
Movies in the earthquake shadowy things

1586
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,679
This

1587
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:42,751
He's too concrete it's absolute

1588
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,543
I have a I have another problem

1589
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,335
Just one

1590
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,639
Alright so he is saying we

1591
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,175
I assume he can't

1592
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,711
Mean he's not included

1593
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,527
Set always talks like that he says that I have

1594
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,063
I have 17,000

1595
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:01,183
Send troops in Germany the first person about everything

1596
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,999
We have work Bluewater Barclays ballad

1597
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,815
But they don't work for the federal government

1598
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:11,423
Do you work for the watermarking all these ballot he's a narcissist

1599
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:17,823
And I visited qanon thing to this we're going around again.

1600
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,871
Why is Steve into this

1601
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,919
One I think it's cuz he's insecure

1602
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,455
Sure

1603
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:26,015
I was researching like Watermark ballots

1604
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:29,343
What are the places that it comes up the most as like a very

1605
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,903
Like, like I normally used thing

1606
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,719
Hazen Condo Association elections in

1607
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Florida

1608
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,279
Now Steve

1609
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,303
Florida

1610
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:53,151
Discussed on a number of websites your condo association elections

1611
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
Keep them secure

1612
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,711
Spencer Lake

1613
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,503
I think maybe he has some experience

1614
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:02,367
The idea from that that's very fun and maybe he's projecting that onto the world

1615
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,391
Anyway this

1616
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,415
Is silly

1617
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,207
Yeah it's not good and it gets worse

1618
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,279
Expected

1619
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
All the rest

1620
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,071
Is part of the

1621
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,887
Sting operation with running

1622
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,167
And let me tell you that

1623
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,447
48 hours

1624
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:19,007
Not only did we put markers on those

1625
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
But I can

1626
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,311
Say now

1627
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,383
With the condition of people in the intelligence

1628
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,919
Community in elsewhere

1629
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,711
That we have sent out

1630
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,783
Thousands and thousands of National Guards

1631
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:31,807

1632
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:33,855
Download

1633
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,903
Taxes Arizona

1634
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,183
Alabama

1635
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,487
So now you have to

1636
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,535
Considering rethink what is

1637
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,815
Is really about

1638
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,095
This is about the cons

1639
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,911
Institution clearly

1640
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,191

1642
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,615
And all

States running their own elections

1644
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,759
Agreed is watermarking of the ballot

1645
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,575
Yeah okay whatever

1646
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:08,415
Depleted

1647
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,951
Anyway

1648
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:16,351
Respond if you're Owen

1649
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:22,751
Tara wearing a Hawaiian shirt

1650
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:27,871
The goddamn Alliance

1651
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,151
Why not

1652
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,431
Here's how I would respond

1653
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,271
Steve you've just broken certainly perhaps the biggest news

1654
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,599
Since the election here on Earth

1655
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,903
Have to play this out logically in my head

1656
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
Okay

1657
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
Basically

1658
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:47,839
I keep if I kiss you on the lips right now if it wasn't digitally

1659
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,607
Haha

1660
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,887
So he's thrilled

1661
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,703
Corsi is wants to make this even better

1662
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,239
Of course

1663
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Come on

1664
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,055
People will be arrested as a pet

1665
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
Tonight

1666
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,359
Tomorrow

1667
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,639
And it will go on for

1668
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
Quite a while

1669
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,431
And this was

1670
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,223
Set total sting operation

1671
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:04,991
That I can say

1672
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,271
Okay well

1673
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:13,951
Red wedding will play itself out every night for years to come.

1674
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:18,559
Blood in the streets until only Melania is left

1675
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:23,167
Melania almost had to take the throne

1676
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:31,359
Yeah alright okay just getting a little busy getting a little more to than

1677
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,639
Usually

1678
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,687
Like he's usually either like

1679
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,479
Cranky

1680
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,759
Racist

1681
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,319
Anti-semitic homophobic

1682
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:43,647
Usually have something going on or like wants to consult Alex

1683
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,463
When did you have

1684
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,743
Themed appearance

1685
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
Strange

1686
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,607
But I also think that he knows

1687
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,399
On some level whether it

1688
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,959
It's like rationally and consciously or just sort of

1689
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:03,615
Best not to try that Alex wouldn't put up with this problem I don't know

1690
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,407
This election was stolen

1691
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,431
That's the business

1692
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,967
That's where the money is

1693
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:08,991
You

1694
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,295
This is something that's going to be

1695
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:17,183
Completely disproven or it'll be like never proven that why wasn't it

1696
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,511
You could be a big problem for us we can't make money off his

1697
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,375
It's in your trying to build a pay-per-view match with no one wants to see this is a day long

1698
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:31,775
Story day long story at best and that's only on the War Room distraction for the junior varsity

1699
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,871
Yeah

1700
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,943
Steve talks a little bit more about this and I still don't

1701
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,735
Really understand what

1702
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,063
What he's describing really

1703
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,903
I would love for him to actually say what all this technology is but

1704
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,927
He doesn't do that right

1705
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,975
So how is this

1706
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,767
Watermark on the ballot

1707
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,583
What is the significance of a tattoo

1708
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:59,679
Is it going to stop from fake ballots being counted or or how is that going to be used

1709
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,263
Where we use it in any way that we need to use it in terms of

1710
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,799
Counting knowing which ones

1711
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,359
We're not it's a very

1712
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
Cicada

1713
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,663
So if you just

1714
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,199
Start on the way these are

1715
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,479
Cyber communication

1716
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,343
Locations that we have the code for we know exactly what we

1717
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,111
Was thrown away

1718
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,647
We know exactly what was played

1719
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,671
We know exact

1720
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,695
Actually who has it

1721
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,975
We know exactly where

1722
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,511
I can't do any

1723
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
Any further than that

1724
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,375
Wow this is huge news

1725
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:32,447
Steve pieczenik is breaking on our show right now

1726
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,727
Someone call it news

1727
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,287
I mean

1728
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:43,199
Yeah I'm going to go without it I don't I don't think I'm going to buy that one if I were having fun today

1729
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,575
That Steve's dressed for the occasion

1730
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:54,463
He showed up in his uniform for what this is just b******* the f****** phone

1731
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:57,791
If you know where every ballad is right

1732
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:03,679
Right now from The Fast and Furious movie

1733
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,983
If they're fake widen

1734
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,775
Can't you tell the people at the

1735
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,567
Broward County place

1736
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,871
Places that they were fake everywhere had people watching

1737
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,663
Cuz you're not a Showman

1738
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:14,687
You got

1739
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:18,271
You don't understand the need for the reveal

1740
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:24,671
This is all my fault I didn't realize that we have to have the procedure why do trick if there is no

1741
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:28,255
You got to do this

1742
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:31,071
I texted that part of its total

1743
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:34,399
11:30 just stole money and then left

1744
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:42,591
Explain a little bit more about what this Takkies describing is how is light so powerful

1745
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,127
And then also

1746
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,175
What it is a big problem

1747
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,711
When nothing comes up

1748
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,503
Yeah that's a real problem

1749
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,783
Can I take Alex's in

1750
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:52,319
Instincts even if he's desperate

1751
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,623
To come up with a way to spend the election

1752
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:59,487
He would know better than to take this on he's going to have

1753
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,767
Deal with tomorrow

1754
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,559
And the day after in the day

1755
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:08,191
Someone who might have been Chinese who showed up at 4 in the morning

1756
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,495
Try and disprove me

1757
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,287
Care enough to disprove

1758
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:16,896
But if you start saying some s*** like I know where every ballot is now we weren't rough

1759
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,200
Now I got to deal with

1760
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:19,968
S***

1761
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,760
Like somebody saying stuff like

1762
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,296
Why didn't you just use a barcode

1763
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,856
I want to get the little boy

1764
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:30,464
Hi Mom this is Steve inside

1765
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:35,584
And he perhaps just broke the biggest news story of the day

1766
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,680
He did it in a floral button-up shirt with a smile on his face from his kitchen

1767
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:43,776
So I'll Fox News and then in mainstream news and all you with your

1768
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:46,848
Billions of dollars in your big pharmaceutical contracts

1769
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:50,176
I'll keep it PG rated you can go fug yourself

1770
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,200
Okay

1771
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,480
Gofugyourself

1772
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,272
And enjoy it as well

1773
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,368
Now I want to hone in on what documented broke again folks

1774
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,672
Deacon reiterate this in his own words

1775
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,744
The whole election theft was a setup

1776
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:14,240
Triad that's my favorite thing

1777
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
That is

1778
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:15,776
That

1779
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,800
What is

1780
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,080
Is just the best

1781
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,128
That is my

1782
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,944
Like what I like to laugh at

1783
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:25,760
Taunting the mainstream fake news

1784
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
Fire

1785
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,112
Defiant in the face of all reality

1786
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,648
Listening to the doctors

1787
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:36,000
Steve pieczenik Wallace masturbating looking at photos of Melania

1788
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,280
Oh my God

1789
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
Steve

1790
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,144
He's a weirdo

1791
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:47,776
Agree I agree he comes in with this guy

1792
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:51,360
Choi he still go to say some things during the interview that are big

1793
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,152
3 problems

1794
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,688
And what are the what are the Cubs in

1795
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,712
The sex club

1796
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,504
Alex has been very

1797
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,272
Very clear

1798
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,600
That the Democrats are run by the Chinese

1799
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:08,000
Intermediary between the devil of the Democrats

1800
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,024
Job

1801
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,816
Steve says

1802
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,400
Who is running this Democrat Party right now I mean

1803
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,472
Who is running who is the Brain Trust is obviously not biting

1804
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:21,056
I don't think it's Obama is it the Chinese or the Chinese setting them up

1805
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,152
Chinese on a parley with all due respect

1806
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,456
Chinese communism

1807
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,480
Chinese

1808
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,880
The real issue we all know about Lau here in corruption

1809
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,160
Democratic

1810
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:36,928
Party and it's

1811
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:37,696
Machinery

1812
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:40,768
Involved

1813
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:47,168
At all familiar with Chinese communism she and I hang out with

1814
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,960
He's part of my condo

1815
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:54,080
Before I leave I like to contradict entire world

1816
01:22:55,872 --> 01:23:00,992
That's why I live here there's no such thing as God

1817
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,600
The Chinese Communists are not important

1818
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:06,880
They're not a big deal

1819
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,696
Operation

1820
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,720
I got to go

1821
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:13,024
You know who you got to worry about

1822
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,048
Uruguay

1823
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:16,608
They're big in the stealing election

1824
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,632
Gay

1825
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
Is throwing

1826
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,424
Haymaker

1827
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,448
Love it

1828
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,008
Little bit about Obama

1829
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,544
This is kind of funny

1830
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,128
But I heard Obama two days ago against a

1831
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,432
In this democracy we have the right

1832
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Morano

1833
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:34,528
Obama is a CIA operative

1834
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,576
Sing

1835
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,624
Everything

1836
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,904
Obama is

1837
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,208
He knew already

1838
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:45,024
Intelligence files 2

1839
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,352
I can't say that but okay

1840
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,400
Man

1841
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,424
So funny

1842
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,216
Yeah he knows it

1843
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:59,616
All of this seems so much more fun and less serious when I don't have like four years of

1844
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,664
Murder to look forward to

1845
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:07,040
Yeah I mean there's four years of you know still trouble a lot of trouble but not like

1846
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:12,672
Every minutes it's more it's more a situation of I think we're still in a little bit of like

1847
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:17,536
Exhaling there is a big accident

1848
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:23,936
You might be overselling like the feelings of relief

1849
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:28,544
And I think it's a really tough thing because you don't discount the fact

1850
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,568
Getting Trump

1851
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,592
Out-of-office

1852
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,360
Send him losing his

1853
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,896
Very crucial

1854
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,200
Yeah wow at the same time

1855
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,736
Don't lose sight of the fact that

1856
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,760
Even though

1857
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,320
Biden gets it it doesn't mean anything

1858
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,344
Yeah it's fix

1859
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,112
By itself

1860
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,672
They're still exactly the same amount of work then

1861
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,440
Needs to be done

1862
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,464
Same issues

1863
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,232
Exist

1864
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,512
Hyatt I've tweeted out

1865
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,304
Oh f***

1866
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,328
Famous present

1867
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,608
And then

1868
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
Oh f***

1869
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,656
Fighting is

1870
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:58,240
People were like don't run this for me I'm like that all you can hold these

1871
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:01,824
These two thoughts simultaneously these are not dissonant

1872
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,848
These are nuance

1873
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,408
Yeah it could be it could be

1874
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,200
The Matrix challenge

1875
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,272
And now we just have to figure out

1876
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,040
Done

1877
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,576
Steve

1878
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,112
We know from his time

1879
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:17,952
With Alex over the years is a normal methodology

1880
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,720
Who is Allah

1881
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,744
Text is too flattered

1882
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:23,584
And we see this exact same behavior being applied to Owen

1883
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,376
Please

1884
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,656
You know cell

1885
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,680
Deprecation

1886
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,704
It's not impressive

1887
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,776
To talk a lot

1888
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:35,360
And it takes a lot of cojones and it takes a lot of

1889
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,384
Sense of self

1890
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,152
Warriors and the

1891
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,224
Would you and Alex have

1892
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,248
And you got a great

1893
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,528
Stafford area

1894
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,552
And Scott and all of them

1895
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,112
You were select

1896
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,392
I do not only

1897
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
I selected you

1898
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,208
You guys but I personally selected

1899
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:51,488
You and those who I

1900
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,096
Work with ordeal Wilson friendly with Naomi

1901
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,120
Understood that it would

1902
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,400
For your

1903
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,960
To me sounds like

1904
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,496
Alex wouldn't buy this year

1905
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,264
I was like

1906
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,544
Who could I go on

1907
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,384
Real deluge

1908
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
Regional here this is gone pass

1909
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688
That's like fun

1910
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,480
Conspiracy theories to him being like

1911
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,016
I control the universe

1912
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,064
Well and like I have this

1913
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,856
Big breaking news in

1914
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:22,208
You're no you're so wonderful oh and that I chose you to break the story

1915
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,048
It's nonsensical.

1916
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,072
It really

1917
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,376
I know Elsa

1918
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,912
Go now it is absolute

1919
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,704
You are as good as I could do

1920
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,520
Yeah bro I'm going to butter you up really hard

1921
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,592
Yeah

1922
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,640
Alex we need to get Alex in on this

1923
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,920
Cuz this is big

1924
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,712
Like for them and you are

1925
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,736
So-so

1926
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,880
Holdover Alex Jones as soon as he heard Steve pieczenik break the huge news about the Trump staying

1927
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,928
Alex Jones hopped in his race car

1928
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:56,000
He's probably going about 160 mph right now

1929
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:00,096
You probably on the phone with engineer's trying to rig up like a car helicopter

1930
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,144
Get here faster and avoid traffic

1931
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,936
Alex does not show up

1932
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:07,264
Jesse Lee Peterson

1933
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,056
After Steve

1934
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,872
I don't know I don't I think I feel like Alex

1935
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,896
Would be like

1936
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:15,200
Shut it down

1937
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,480
Shut it down

1938
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,528
But only

1939
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:23,392
I want has that feel of like a literal Apprentice situation where it's like

1940
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,208
The master is out of the room

1941
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:30,816
And I found something that I think is really exciting and it takes the world one and this one's mine

1942
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:35,936
I discovered this was going to take it to the master and he's going to be so proud of me and then they

1943
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,960
No this is f****** see

1944
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:43,360
Disney movie

1945
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:49,760
Fantasia accidentally made the mop Stan surrounded

1946
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:53,344
Making a mess

1947
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,392
Exactly right

1948
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
Still alive

1949
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:00,512
This is what I want plugged into my voice of course

1950
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:06,400
We're back in the Infowars war room

1951
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:12,544
The fake news media today with dr. Steve pieczenik

1952
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:18,944
Giving us the inside scoop of President Trump sting operation that is ongoing right now the traps have been

1953
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,736
Sprung sprung

1954
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,832
There's a

1955
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,880
Completely

1956
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,928
Two different feet

1957
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:32,000
Right there's the feeling of being proud of yourself

1958
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,048
And then having that Pride punctured

1959
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,096
By someone else and realized

1960
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:36,864
Sing of fail

1961
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,472
And then there's the feeling of hoping someone else will be proud of you

1962
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,008
And when that

1963
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:43,776
Punctured

1964
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:44,544
That's devastating

1965
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,104
I'm looking forward to hearing that from LA

1966
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,640
I want to hear that devastation

1967
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,944
He thinks somebody's going to be so proud of her

1968
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,992
Yeah yeah

1969
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,528
Got it

1970
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,296
Just

1971
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,624
It is a complex

1972
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,672
Feeling that is like

1973
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,464
I've done it

1974
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:08,864
I have figured out how to save the world or something

1975
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,400
We're going to make a lot of money Oculus

1976
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,192
Picture show something else

1977
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,984
I've saved Infowars

1978
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,288
And you can see it in the moment like

1979
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,848
No

1980
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:22,176
Hilarious

1981
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:25,504
This is a screw and I would never laugh at conservative tears

1982
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,272
Conservative

1983
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:31,136
Hubris is the funniest thing in the world and that's really what I was feeling

1984
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,928
When it was like what's the reverse

1985
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,976
Yeah that I can feel good about

1986
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:40,096
Of election night 2016 Alex laughing at people Cryer's it's this

1987
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,936
It is always be like we're taking down the

1988
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,216
Your

1989
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:48,800
George

1990
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:52,128
Unable or incapable of seeing through Steve

1991
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,664
Botanics bulshit

1992
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,016
Transparently stupid b*******

1993
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,808
Bugatti

1994
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:03,136
Qci dozark

1995
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,256
We're past the emperor has no clothes be a walk

1996
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,280
Walking down the street without

1997
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,816
What's skin ever

1998
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,840
Owen is like

1999
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:15,680
A baby love that guy

2000
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,472
Sorry one last clip here Steve

2001
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:20,800
It's just the buttering up

2002
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
Yeah

2003
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:23,104
I was given the privilege

2004
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:27,456
Yes but I don't know who else knows it I don't know

2005
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,736
What else will happen

2006
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,784
The truth

2007
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
Your show was

2008
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,600
You have the good

2009
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:34,624
Are the benefits

2010
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,160
And I hope

2011
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,256
And of a problem

2012
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,816
I

2013
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,584
Wish you

2014
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,144
Godspeed

2015
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,936
Yep

2016
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,752
High hopes

2017
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:52,288
This wind up with a lot of arrest

2018
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:57,408
Like I said interview Jesse Lee Peterson

2019
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,200
Then everyone went to sleep

2020
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,272
How we wake up

2021
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:05,600
And David Knight show from November 6th

2022
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,136
He realizes

2023
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:12,000
Owen got these brooms and mops dancing all over the place I got to clean up

2024
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,792
No I know there's a

2025
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,816
A theory that's come out

2026
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:16,864
Penguin have watermark

2027
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,680
And this is all just a big

2028
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:20,704
Sing

2029
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,472
And we should

2030
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,496
The plant

2031
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:27,360
I'm telling you right now

2032
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,128
Total

2033
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,920
Gaslighting

2034
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,712
Pharmacy Aiea

2035
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,504
Still working today

2036
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:37,344
And we'll talk about that coming up that is

2037
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,880
Is absolute nonsense

2038
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:45,024
The kids off the show forever so David Knight comes in and he's like

2039
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:52,704
I first heard that this has gone down the David Knight was pushing

2040
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,240
Back on this.

2041
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,544
Fires his f******

2042
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,312
Fire

2043
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:01,664
Thought about it a little bit more and recognize like what are the Dynamics here

2044
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,200
I think David Knight

2045
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:03,968
Fine

2046
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,528
And I think I'll just pretend I went didn't do that

2047
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,320
I think Owen made

2048
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:13,184
A bad move but it's like that's an Infowars mistake

2049
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:13,952
Christmas Day

2050
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:15,744
I forgive you friend

2051
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,304
How you learn it's an Infowars mistake

2052
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,632
What world event

2053
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:22,400
You know like

2054
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:27,264
Nine times out of ten baby it doesn't work that tenth time maybe we make $1000000

2055
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,568
So we'll let you do that

2056
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,592
It's embarrassing

2057
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,640
Pretend you didn't do it

2058
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:33,664
Move Along

2059
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:37,760
Put Stephen time out we won't have him on for a little bit

2060
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:41,856
You give me gone for a little bit

2061
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:44,672
When I listen to this David first of all I was like wow

2062
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,464
He is as boring as I remember

2063
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,232
But then

2064
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:50,304
I doubt he's doing what Daddy needs

2065
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,352
He's doing the work of

2066
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:55,168
Cleaning up this because the narrative needs to be that the

2067
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,288
Operation

2068
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,824
Beautiful Park

2069
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,104
Real quick

2070
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,176
Call boy

2071
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:08,480
Looks like

2072
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,016
You're f****** charge

2073
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:14,880
Steven got to be on the outs he's got to have like at least a talkin to or something

2074
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:18,464
Yeah yeah that what that must have been a phone call as liked

2075
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,256
You can't be swinging that hard

2076
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,864
So they would make that before it gets out of business on on Steve's nonsense

2077
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,888
Kia

2078
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,680
40 play couple clips

2079
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:30,240
The tones of these things are so f***

2080
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,008
Indifferent

2081
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,800
Twitter permanently banned

2082
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,568
Cbennett

2083
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,872
Because he called for

2084
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,432
Bailey

2085
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,712
Mark of the beast

2086
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,528
He called for the beheading

2087
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,296
Dr. fauci

2088
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,088
An FBI director

2089
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,112
Christopher Wray

2090
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,672
Well here's what he actually had to say

2091
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,048
Go back to the old times

2092
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,072
Put that their heads on

2093
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,096
Pikes right

2094
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,680
Corners of the White House as a warning to Federal.

2095
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,472
Medicine

2096
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,264
What's known as a metaphor

2097
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,544
I believe I always get back

2098
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,336
Computers assembly

2099
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,152
Cuz it needs to work like

2100
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,176
I think that is

2101
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:13,248
Wow what is

2102
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,808
Exactly I'm like this is

2103
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:22,208
Is for grandparents or something for people who need a little bit of a

2104
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:29,376
And the rationalizations of of people say I'm f***** up things

2105
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,008
Also

2106
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:36,800
I will say the David Knight

2107
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,080
Likes to make jokes

2108
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:46,528
All right Nancy Pelosi has announced a big expansion of

2109
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,064
Covid testing for lawmaker

2110
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:49,856
Testing

2111
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,928
I knew it wasn't to be polygraph

2112
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:00,352
Wow that was actually almost Charming

2113
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:04,448
I was almost a little child by that what that was that was

2114
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
GoPro

2115
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:17,504
Structure of a

2116
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,880
Like maybe something that's off color or a pensive

2117
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:29,280
Thanksgiving any like that was great you didn't say anything about black lives matter are having a great time didn't bring up how much you love

2118
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:32,352
Song of the South this time David

2119
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:37,472
I thought that was so bizarre like

2120
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,496
I was looking at

2121
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:40,032
Infowars

2122
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:43,360
You just made a joke and laughed at it

2123
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,408
And that lasted not seem fake

2124
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:49,504
And did not use any old timey slurs in the process area Bazaar

2125
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:52,064
Took awhile and a lot of boring

2126
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,344
S*** to get through

2127
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,368
We get to

2128
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,648
David Tucker

2129
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,928
Can about Steve pieczenik

2130
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:58,976
But

2131
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:01,280
You'll notice that the way he's talking about it

2132
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,560
He's very careful

2133
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:09,216
To talk about it as a story that he posted on reason.com as opposed to an interview

2134
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,520
You his coworker had done

2135
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,824
Find me delivery

2136
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,152
Likeliest path appears to be there or he needs to hang onto

2137
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,688
Pennsylvania and Georgia

2138
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,992
Overtake Biden

2139
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,296
And either Nevada or Arizona

2140
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,344
So that's where we are at the MoMA

2141
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,648
But of course you know that this was all

2142
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,184
Rigged

2143
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,208
We know that it was all

2144
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,024
Which is why

2145
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,304
I just about

2146
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,376
Fell out of my chair when I saw this headline from reason Maga

2147
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,704
Not when you were watching the War Room the day before

2148
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:42,752
I wouldn't

2149
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,056
So one thing I think is really interesting

2150
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,336
Is the David Knight

2151
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,616
His approach on hat

2152
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,896
Is very much alike

2153
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,944
This makes no sense

2154
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,528
Well I appreciate it

2155
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:57,344
Tell me if this was a sting

2156
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,160
It doesn't even make any sense it's another one of these deals like the lap

2157
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,184
Top 100

2158
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:03,488
Very last minute

2159
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:05,024
Put that thing out thinking is going to be at

2160
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,792
Surprise

2161
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,584
And everybody just said well

2162
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,376
It's not credible but media is going to

2163
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,400
Put out the

2164
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,424
Narrative is not

2165
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,704
Credible

2166
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,496
Photographic evidence

2167
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:21,920
Beginning of all the documentation that you wanted the world and they're not going to believe it because the mainstream media social media are going to censor you and they're going to put

2168
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:22,688
About their narrative

2169
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,504
I don't see that's going to do anything other than

2170
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,528
Create

2171
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,576
Forest fire

2172
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:29,856
Soju

2173
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:32,160
Did but the point he's trying to make

2174
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:35,744
Pikachu with one little tweak I make one little

2175
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:36,768
But

2176
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:41,376
Like it doesn't make sense cuz no one would believe this anyway so there is that make sense

2177
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:48,032
Yeah he's version of it is known to believe because the media would put out their own version I don't really I don't agree with that

2178
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:50,336
I would say that ever want to be like go f*** yourself

2179
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:53,408
Probably that story came out

2180
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,176
People would just

2181
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,456
Yeah and I believe it

2182
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,992
Wait so he's saying that

2183
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,528
Is true but they don't

2184
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,064
They would that the media wouldn't

2185
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:06,464
Believe it anyways he's saying that they wouldn't do it because no one would believe it even if they did it okay

2186
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:13,120
He saying that they would have seen that happening

2187
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:16,704
Ahead of time

2188
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,800
F***** by no one believing it. So they wouldn't have gone down that road again

2189
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:25,152
Sure I guess however you get there so you get there I don't know

2190
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:28,224
It doesn't make sense

2191
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,272
Your reason why it doesn't make sense

2192
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:32,576
You work at Infowars whatever

2193
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:34,880
Now it just last clip

2194
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:37,440
You don't talk about it that much

2195
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:40,768
What Steve does say something that I think is great

2196
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,584
Yes

2197
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:46,912
So David says this thing that's like

2198
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:47,936
I think it's great

2199
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,216
But also it's a

2200
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,008
The classic Infowars thing

2201
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:51,776
Where

2202
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:52,800
You're right

2203
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,336
But you're wrong

2204
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,872
You're right

2205
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,920
But you are still the paradox

2206
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,456
But I didn't jump it

2207
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,224
Pizzagate

2208
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:01,760
Idlewild pechenik

2209
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:05,856
Come on the show because last time he came on their show with right after the shooting in Vegas

2210
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,904
He came on the show

2211
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,184
The salvalai

2212
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,720
That nobody died in Vegas

2213
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,768
Because you trying to trap me

2214
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,352
This guy is a CIA shill

2215
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,400
And he comes on to

2216
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,168
Grappa's

2217
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,960
That's one of the ways that they disc

2218
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,728
Credit you

2219
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,544
I'm not have anything to do with that

2220
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:25,568
We'll be right back

2221
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
Baxley weather

2222
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,360
So

2223
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,408
David

2224
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:35,808
Steve is a f****** liar any fux with Infowars

2225
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,600
To be able to get away with it then

2226
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:44,000
Because it's a lot of chaos has great time I do believe that is correct I remember that episode where is

2227
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:49,376
He was on the David Knight and he was talking about the Las Vegas shooting being fake

2228
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,656
David nights reaction

2229
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,424
Into that was

2230
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:57,824
I agree with you that Sandy Hook was fake

2231
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,944
Somewhere somewhere

2232
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,480
But

2233
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,528
I do agree with him

2234
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:09,344
Don't have Steve on breathing

2235
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,952
He's not a CIA Shelton he's a board man

2236
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:16,000
In a condo in Florida you got it

2237
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:19,328
I don't understand how one out of

2238
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,376
3 Infowars house

2239
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,400
Closest just like

2240
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:28,288
This guy's a CIA she'll who's trying to destroy our entire business and the other two are like

2241
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,056
Acoma

2242
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:35,456
Not only is he

2243
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,576
If he's a CIA shell

2244
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,112
He's tricked me

2245
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,136
Oh

2246
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,696
Here's here's where this

2247
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:47,488
Becomes a little bit last like

2248
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,768
Ava severe problem

2249
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,560
Cuz I do seem like a problem

2250
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,840
We're like David Knight

2251
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:57,728
Tavion are being like Steve pieczenik is a CIA shows trying to trap me with these bulshit story

2252
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:04,128
And that's how they get you going all the way back to Las Vegas

2253
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:07,456
You been on Alex's your since then saying a bunch of nonsense

2254
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,504
By that token

2255
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,296
David would have to think that

2256
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:14,368
He's trying to trap Alex it would only somehow that's fine

2257
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,720
Do still work at the same place where is that is going on

2258
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,608
Trap David David Knight is the white whale

2259
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:26,656
Even trying to get fries

2260
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:34,336
I don't think that's the case anybody is particularly focused on David Knight

2261
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,640
But here's the thing

2262
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,688
Alex has done this to

2263
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,504
Like what after the Las Vegas shooting

2264
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:48,160
Alex did turn on Steve for a little while I think Steve is still working for the sea

2265
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:50,720
CIA

2266
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:53,024
And then they made their peace after a couple Bond

2267
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:55,072
Steve being on timeout

2268
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,864
So that probably wouldn't happen again

2269
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,632
Most likely

2270
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,656
Although

2271
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,704
Free funny

2272
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,728
Very funny

2273
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
It's B

2274
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:03,776
Really funny

2275
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,872
I think that the image of Owen being like

2276
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:11,968
F*** you mainstream media destroying you

2277
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:18,368
That's the image of an Infowars 2020 election that I want to hold on to

2278
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,904
I want that to be

2279
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,976
Took the spiritual energy that we're coming with

2280
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,512
As opposed to

2281
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:30,400
No laughing at all you lost I don't want to laugh at you for losing and I want I want to be

2282
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:33,472
Glad that your candidate lost cuz I hate to policy

2283
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:38,848
But I want to laugh at you for taunting the mainstream media because you got tricked by Steve pieczenik

2284
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:39,616
So good

2285
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:40,640
So good

2286
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:44,736
You said you will get tricks to give you think

2287
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,528
You're so smart

2288
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:49,856
And you think that Steve gave you a scoop

2289
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:53,440
If you got it it's not a school

2290
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:04,448
Back I work for the CIA killed everybody if you haven't

2291
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:11,616
What he got that party telling you that he chose yourself

2292
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:16,480
Even smiled at me I'm throwing a fastball that okay

2293
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,272
Yeah if you want

2294
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,040
To talk to you

2295
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:20,576
He wants to use you

2296
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,112
Right

2297
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,512
If Steve was coming with big

2298
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:29,280
Stuff

2299
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:31,072
This close to the election

2300
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:34,144
This important a time. For

2301
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,168
I guess

2302
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,192
Overthrowing the government

2303
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:38,240
Alex isn't giving it

2304
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:44,896
I mean it's not relative audience size is huge difference

2305
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,688
Yeah okay

2306
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:47,968
I'm Steve

2307
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,760
I got this big in

2308
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
Information

2309
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:53,856
That the election was actually secretly a sting operation

2310
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,136
I can't get permission

2311
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:57,184
Talk about it an hour early

2312
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:08,192
I'm sorry they had it on a clock that at 9 p.m.

2313
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:14,592
Eastern time should I could have done it at 3

2314
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,872
I think that you're like

2315
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:16,896
Relevant

2316
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,176
Children good work

2317
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:18,944
Sure

2318
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:24,832
Every now and again you got to go yell at Congress and he walked out or something like that you got to get to get high

2319
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,624
And I guess if

2320
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:29,952
No it's believe in Steve is what does it for you sometimes it

2321
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,512
It's going to do everybody needs a little juice from here

2322
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,328
From time to take yourself back up Owen

2323
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,352
Get back on track

2324
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,656
Don't

2325
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:41,472
This is so embarrassing you should quit

2326
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,520
You should quit you said

2327
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,080
Fudge You mainstream media

2328
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:49,920
Because Steve pieczenik told you that the entire election

2329
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:53,760
Was a sting operation was an elaborate ruse Hellboy

2330
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:57,088
Oh yeah so this is episode 500 Jordan

2331
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,368
Then

2332
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,184
Quite a few

2333
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:01,952
That's weird

2334
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:02,720
Haha

2335
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,512
This is how we celebrate

2336
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:07,584
Celebrate

2337
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:13,472
Infowars war room

2338
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:19,616
The fake news media today with dr. Steve pieczenik

2339
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:25,760
I want to talk more about that clip I love it for so many reasons

2340
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:32,160
First of all you've got that sort of new metal base going behind it which is great

2341
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,440
That's a 6-string bass

2342
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:35,232
Devastating

2343
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,000
The fake

2344
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:37,024
News media

2345
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:39,072
Big news media

2346
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:43,424
Is what's being devastated with Steve

2347
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,984
Does Owen work for the CIA

2348
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:53,408
My eyes are really wide broken some serious news to your dad you know where the CIA is based

2349
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,968
St.Louis

2350
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:59,808
Alright I don't think it is because we're from
