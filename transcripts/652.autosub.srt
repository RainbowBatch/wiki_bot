Air Jordan

00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by now it's like I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
We are the bad guy

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
Alex Jones

7
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,584
We are

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,376
Question

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
Far and Away without a doubt is a little package that we got from

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
I don't know

11
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480

Monopoly rules

Are we going to play it yet excited beyond all reason to play it

15
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520
Just instead of the properties there are people who have like Leo zagami you have multiple

16
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,848
All versions of Alex

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,504
There's a incorporation of Project Camelot stuff into it

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,088
Don't think I'm doing a good job of describing it to cuz I'm just super

19
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,488
It is a well-done system of jokes

20
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
Kind of incredible

21
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,376
You know maybe 442 assholes like us with the with comedy brains

22
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
We can be sitting on people that is very funny

23
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,336
Really good I have not obviously

24
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
Like a chance to our why would I just sit and read over all of the car surprised

Play have a great day

26
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
Sense of humor

27
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Clever and witty

28
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Thank you so much

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000

00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
A bright spot in a date spoiler alert the Restless episode 8 going to be bright

31
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
Thank you for bringing that into our lives

32
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
My partner

33
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,944
She's making these shirts she's an art teacher she's good to make a church bread maker

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,296
And she's making these t-shirts for other teachers in the school

35
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
Because I don't know if you know this teachers are treated well

36
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:12,256
Sure there's a quote from this one person they were all getting together all the teachers talking about how Terrible Things Are

37
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,816
And this one teacher was was like

38
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,448
Man this thing came into my room it was not a mouse it was a whole rat

39
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
Bright

40
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:26,848
And so she made a tshirt out of this right nice drawing it's classroom it's a whole rat

41
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
People have started getting them

42
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
And she made one for me and

43
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
It's very very good

44
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
This is going to be the next piece of me I hope so

45
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
If your CPS teacher look around for it's a whole rat you'll find it's a whole rat is going to go up there without

46
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,584
Alex's new shirt with the president's daughter

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,984
We don't have time to get into this but I encourage anyone the picture of it Alex

48
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
New shirt that he selling what has

49
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,080
Faces of presidents in a bit obsessed with it

50
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:04,480
For the better part of the week I'm so confused by it in there for awhile

51
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
Problems within 2 seconds and I'm still digging it's very confusing I don't have time to get into it

52
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
But it'll be on archway

53
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,303
Children recently time to get into it today is that yeah there's there's major world events of foot

54
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
And

55
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:24,703
Quite frankly I had planned to do an episode of the end of this week of

56
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,031
Tracking Alex's Behavior over the course of the week

57
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
And then I work Thursday and last night Russia and Putin invaded Ukraine

58
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
And I have to redo every

59
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
Yeah that'll change things

60
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,183
It's so what we're going to be doing is we're going to have a focus on today's episode 24th

61
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,487
February 2022

62
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,095
And then we're also going to have a little bit of a Prelude little bit of a

63
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Would it would it be

64
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
Preview prologue

65
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,799
It's a weird looking at February 21st

66
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,455

67
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,783

00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183

76
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,583
Walk up in the mix

77
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,655
Globalistatv babies

78
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
I'm a policy wonk

79
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
I have

80
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
Risen above

81
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Miami

82
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,175
A little breaking for me

83
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
And then we're going

84
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
To come back

85
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,575
And I'm going to start the show over

86
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
F*** you

87
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
F*** you

88
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

89
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,583
F*** you and your new world order

90
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
And f*** the horse you rode in on

91
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
And all your s***

92
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
Maybe today

93
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby

94
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
5 years

95
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Walk out of here tomorrow

96
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
And you never see me again

97
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
Really what I want to do

98
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
I never want to come back

99
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
Apologized

100
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
To the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

101
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,391
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

102
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Better tomorrow

103
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,839
He has not been better this week that's not this price not a good week

104
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
Forever World particularly for the people in Ukraine

105
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,311
Our thoughts are with them Force

106
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
And

107
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Ayodhya

108
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Very confused

109
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Dialysis

110
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,551
I'll behavior and is narratives over the course of this week

111
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
I told you this before we started recording

112
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
I don't know exactly what his point is that almost anything

113
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
We can track it and hopefully make sense of it

114
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
By the time we finish up

115
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,423
Here is the first we're going to start on the 21st

116
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
So this is Monday show

117
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,591
You know these will give his speech

118
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,687
Where he decides to recognize the

119
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,735
The Breakaway states of donuts

120
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
Answer

121
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
That has not happened yet

122
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
Is just the beginning of the show

123
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
Is where Alex is at

124
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
Russia

125
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
I've already been an eight-year proxy

126
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
Obelisk

127
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
And

128
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
Blacksburg animal heavy weapons

129
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
The last few years

130
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
Accelerate under Biden

131
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Until puttanesca

132
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,335
A bunch of troops on the border saying you need to not

133
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Tomato

134
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Top heavy weapons

135
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
We need to have

136
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Armistice

137
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Demilitarization

138
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
Ceasefire meeting

139
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
Under there Denese

140
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
Compact

141
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:37,375
So we can just go ahead and say right off the bat Alex is taking literally everything Putin says as gospel and

142
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
He's back in Russia 100%

143
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:45,567
Keep coming back to it as we as we go through he's a Putin spam

144
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Being a proxy war against

145
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
The globalist

146
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
That seems like an absurd concept but it's something that I was just casually toss around like a perfectly normal idea that it's stupid

147
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
The Vic anything else could possibly be going on

148
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,327
Alex doesn't even have a solid consistent group of people who actually makeup

149
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
The globalists have no faith

150
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,679
It explained this proxy war if you were forced to

151
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Like if I had a follow-up

152
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,799
Inform I don't think it would make sense that the globalists

153
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,359
Broadband using other people

154
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
Who are also globalists

155
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
Sure to fight against Russia it's direct than isn't it

156
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
So Russia.

157
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
Has been using

158
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:33,183
Russian no yes it does seem like proxy doesn't make sense

159
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,487
It's a strange idea

160
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,143
Something was really funny of that clip those he's not rushing for a few years now.

161
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,543
It started under Trump so he has to immediately qualify that

162
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,919
Instincts to cover his ass stuff are really strong

163
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
Considering

164
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,783
He's already said like that guy loves vaccines

165
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
Justin said hacking forethought

166
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:05,951
Just a just a knee-jerk like I don't know if people are going to get mad at me for criticizing him about

167
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,279
There's no such thing as the domestic

168
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Compact

169
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
That's an agreement that Alex is making

170
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,679
I think that he's trying to remember the name of the Minsk agreement

171
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,239
But he came up with the wrong mental file

172
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:24,383
The Minsk Agreements are two formal attempts to stop the fighting that's gone on in the dumb Bossa region which have both been on

173
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Successful

174
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
The first was he meant protocol in 2014 followed by mints

175
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
2 + 2050

176
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,671
The Goldie's agreement was to put in place a ceasefire between the Ukrainian military and the russian-backed separatist groups in Tonasket

177
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,511
Who have been they've decided that they are their own Breakaway States

178
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Not apart of

179
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,887
Disagreement or super complicated cuz he have to look at it from

180
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
The status of the parties

181
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,495
From each other's viewpoint

182
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,823
And when you do get a sense of how this was probably do a failure

183
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
According to my

184
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Most of the world

185
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,687
This was essentially an agreement between Ukraine and Russia

186
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,551
Separatist groups in Dawn boss wouldn't be able to continue any of their actions without rushing back

187
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,647
It's not really necessary to say that San Francisco tonight

188
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,511
Need to withdraw happy heavy weapon since without Russia they wouldn't have have you ever happened

189
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:18,655
But from Russia standpoint this is a negotiation between Ukraine and the separatist Indonesian lot

190
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:25,311
Routinely taken the position that they're just observers and that they're there to mediate the process and they don't exist as a party of the

191
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
The agreement

192
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
Who deceives himself as Unbound

193
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
From the group

194
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
Itself at least partially for this reason

195
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
At the same time Ukraine

196
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,319
Specifically sees this as a negotiation between themselves and Russia

197
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,647
Ukrainian president zelensky

198
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
No intention of talking to terrorist

199
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,511
And it is just impossible for me in my position

200
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
His perspective on the agreement is similar to how much of the world sees it as a conversation between Ukraine and the Russian government or Fuccillo

201
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
The action

202
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,519
Of the separatist groups in Don Bosco the Ukrainian government

203
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
CSN truly as an insurgent

204
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
Right right right

205
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,455
So you can see from the perspectives of all the table be very difficult

206
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Navigate

207
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
Based on

208
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,575
Perception

209
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
This is where we get

210
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
So much of that like

211
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Space space

212
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,767
International Intergalactic contract law being so important is with

213
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,119
These types of agreements you know you have food and being able to be like

214
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
Na na na

215
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
As it's them

216
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,591
What are you talkin about it's on a technicality don't have my signature

217
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,407
Do their writing do you eat like a f****** Capone

218
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
So there was an inherent lack of agreement in this agreement and it clients almost immediately with the accusations from both sides of the other

219
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Decided broken the ceasefire

220
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,439
So I don't know what the desk compact is

221
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:50,559
Alex doesn't know anything about the Minsk agreements but is making a passing reference to a justify Russia's actions

222
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,887
Now because he's invested in defending everything food and does

223
00:12:54,143 --> 00:13:00,287
Monday Alex's built him up as the only major geopolitical force that stands against his imaginary

224
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,151
Get me so whenever it looks like the rubber is going to meet the road Alex is going to be on team

225
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,223
And he'll use whatever flimsy grasby has on history or past

226
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
Agreements to convince his audience

227
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
But they should be too

228
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
And that's kind of sucked

229
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:18,463
He's pushing the he's pushing the car

230
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:24,095
Talk to me about what you think the globalist hierarchy is right now we know the devil fliptop

231
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
Write the devil is definitely up top

232
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,959
Who's his second-in-command second-in-command

233
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Pcloud Schwab

234
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
You would think that

235
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,311
And then since we're dealing with

236
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
I'm going to go with soros's up there

237
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
He's got to be way up there at 2

238
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,527
And then I mean naturally the trilateral roll

239
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
Other power is Brian stelter so I think it's those three there's a new flowchart in town

240
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
Here's the headline

241
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
The world is now in World War 4

242
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
Global

243
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
A war against humanity

244
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,191
Designed Apple controlled implosion of society

245
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Do they carry out their endgame

246
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
Other destinations are gold

247
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
Eighty-two 90% depopulation of the Earth

248
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
Official documents

249
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
90%

250
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
Going back to the 60

251
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,391
The CFR the trilateral commission it's all the same group

252
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
They're the

253
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Capture

254
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Elite caps

255
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Sure grips

256
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,047

Is the main PR Mouse

258
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Lord of the Rings an hour

259
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Don't

260
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
They're on the edge of Mordor

261
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Blackgate

262
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
Open

263
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Marchezais

264
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,111
They say are you sore on the Mouth of Sauron

265
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
Mouth of Sauron

266
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Alright

267
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Okay

What

273
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
And about that of course is that

274
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Okay okay

275
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,127
Who is Larry Fink Larry Fink is the head of a black rock

276
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
Oh

277
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:19,551
You also on the board of Liquor World economic Forum like a bunch of

278
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
Yeah okay cool

279
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:30,047

00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,839
You second-in-command real quick

281
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:40,031
Wow now that's wild I didn't tell you

282
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:46,687
There's a wrestling storyline where Vince McMahon was the higher power that was running Undertaker

283
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,695
Hood that's how I imagined Larry Fink reveal yourself to Alex alright

284
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:10,495
Larry Fink cuz I haven't listened to literally every episode of

285
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,847
Is not one of the villains that I had to be second-in-command

286
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Yeah

287
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:22,015
You might have got bumped up from the middle management or Council of twelve

288
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
Impressive

289
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
Yeah good for him

290
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,559
Stupid killing of time here and this is something that I always find very interesting and

291
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,167
I don't think I'll never ever ignore when it comes up

292
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
We're going into World War 4

293
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
What is economic

294
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
The psychological

295
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
That is cyber

296
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
That is radiological

297
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
That is electromagnetic

298
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
Radiolab

299
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
Covert

300
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
Silent weapons

301
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
For quiet Wars

302
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Weapons

303
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,535
For quiet Wars just look these terms up

304
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
And it's what

305
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,631
The globalist are obsessed with and they brag

306
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
How you're dumb animals and they brag

307
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,775
How they're going to annihilate you

308
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Thank you love it

309
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
While they brainwash you using pavlovian

310
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,407
Behavioral psychology these are the worst

311
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
Villains the Earth

312
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
Has ever

313
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:31,391
Silent weapons for quiet Wars as we've mentioned before is a fake documentary was a hoax document that got published in

314
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Behold a Pale Horse

315
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
Duckbill Trooper wrote we went over this ingrate

316
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,791
Detail on episode 381 of the podcast

317
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,399
So if anyone wants to know why it's really pathetic that Alex is referencing this as a real thing

318
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
I'll check that up

319
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Episode

320
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,847
Name

321
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:57,247
Really is a great title

322
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,647
Agenda 21

323
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:10,047
If it was actually something the government had produced

324
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,375
You should never date you don't actually maybe

325
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,775
I guess the fact that you know it's b******* kind of makes you able to take it until it goes through realm of fiction

326
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,103
A little better it does get into like

327
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,503
You know you like the judge in the Blood Meridian but if the judge were actually alive you be like I got to get away from the dead

328
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Lisa Vidal

329
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
Yeah yeah you may be right

330
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
So Alex is Cena meme

331
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,951
And I come to realize

332
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,255
Probably brought this up before

333
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,071
A lot of Alex's reporting is just based on me

334
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
MCC

335
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
It's really shocking

336
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,215
I'm particularly when we're sitting here talking about you know the

337
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:54,591
The. Where tensions are really high discussion of a potential invasion

338
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
Are going on when you're reporting

339
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Stuff that has

340
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
To do with Ukraine

341
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
Based on a meme

342
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
That's not good

343
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,575
It's not great it's not good

344
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
From where they were ordering people.be lot of protests

345
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
The police there just dropped

346
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Their Shields

347
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Send control

348
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
And technocracy

349
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Control

350
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
And there's not

351
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Human

352
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
The Blazer told

353
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
What's the router piece

354
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
No we'll just drop our Shields

355
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
That's the real courage

356
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
You know that all the talking about it before they did it

357
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
Then the one guy decides

358
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
They orderly just got dropped

359
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Nepal

360
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
No we're not going to beat

361
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
People over there ever be another piece

362
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
We're not going strong

363
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Should see

364
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,967
So this is a great example of the information that Alex disseminates in like a

365
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
Be trusted even when he shows a video

366
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,807
You show us the video of this

367
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,927
He's playing this video of police dropping their Shields into a pile just describing but the

368
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,255
The context of the situation is completely different than what he saying

369
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Either saw this posted as a meme somewhere with a false story attached to it he saw the video and decided to make up his own plot about

370
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
Wanted to imagine this was

371
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
This was not from covid X

372
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,383
It's a video from 2014 that was filmed in Slovenia

373
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,175
City in East Ukraine

374
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:39,807
There's been skirmishes in the city between Ukrainian government forces and the pro-russian separatists

375
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,135
Point of the video being shot the police have detained some of the supper

376
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,535
The video depicts a crowd of people threatening the police the police realizing they're outnumbered and then dropping their Shields Envy

377
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,423
Right that's the situation not so much

378
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:00,799
Freedom fighter truck drivers

379
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
Bach

380
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:08,991
This really interesting is how much of the story Alex is telling has to do with

381
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
His own imagination and how he's come up with.

382
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
Detailed motives

383
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
For the people in the video

384
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:18,464
He sure that they talked about how they were going to do this in advance to make a statement about covid measures

385
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
It's all just

386
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:24,096
Product of him seeing the video and then deciding how he wants to make up a story about it to sell the audio

387
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
That's his deep research

388
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,936
It is researching his mind

389
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,008
Imagining nonsense has written an entire like

390
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:37,408
High school basketball movie where they're all in the locker room getting together and there's some guy giving a big speech about how I'm going to stay

391
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
Kind of s*** yeah

392
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
It's weird it's it's

393
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
They're so real

394
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Assertive

395
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Herbs for the dramatic

396
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
Everything has to be movie

397
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,864
At the same time but that scene is itself quite dramatic that video is just not in the way Alex

398
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
She wants it to be

399
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Well I mean

400
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Print the legend

401
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
That's true that's what they say it is or y'all Villages Alex

402
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:14,016
About to speak sometime in the next hour

403
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
We'll see what he's going to announce

404
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Probably that

405
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
Attacks on

406
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
Hilarious

407
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Tropical

408
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Or perhaps

409
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Ukraine

410
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,872
They will stop shipping heavy weapons into their border

411
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Tractors

412
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
Or that he's going to invade

413
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
It's all been done

414
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
Pressure on expansion

415
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
To get to the back

416
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
Security concerns

417
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Globalist hate God

418
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
What

419
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,448
They hate Russia because Russia is now having

420
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Just like China

421
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,104
So you can kind of get the sense that we're heading into this

422
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Putin speech

423
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
Seagrave

424
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,624
Top-level s*** that West's the aggressors for sure

425
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,024
Leaving the prediction he's going to say that either

426
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,096
These places or make an ultimatum but it's easy

427
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:37,472
He's already appearing is audience to like except guys like this is exactly what should happen

428
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
Strange

429
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,896
That would be if it wasn't him it would be strange

430
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,688
I mean Annie strange

431
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
In the context of how the world

432
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,272
Should work or is supposed

433
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
But man

434
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
Just

435
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
Why is everybody doing this

436
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,744
I'll be on the far right

437
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
On the far right I just don't understand it is

438
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,888
It is bizarre

439
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,824
Yeah I don't know I think really don't know I think obviously one piece of it is probably just an obsession

440
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Well strongman leader

441
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
I think that's a big part of it

442
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,992
Being able to protect all of your

443
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
Let's say

444
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:29,696
Culture-war obsessions on the way there

445
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Alex

446
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
Is so defined by opposition

447
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
Is meaning

448
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:38,400
Yeah opposition to sjws or like trying to own the libs and what have you

449
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,800
And I think they projected bit of that on the food and him as an ally against his

450
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
Vietnamese food

451
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,664
I think a lot of people on the right too and I think that that

452
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
It is a piece of it

453
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:57,600
Right there's got to be more somewhere but I don't know what it is exactly ultimately the only thing that I can really

454
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
Please put my

455
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
Had around

456
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Is just

457
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696
These are people

458
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,000
With non-stop violent fantasies

459
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,912
Probably a piece of a 20 and like if

460
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:17,312
I was running a country this is how we'll go bum bum bum I would just do it like I don't

461
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,920
With me off my borders

462
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
Yeah it's just a fantasy

463
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,320
In order to

464
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,368
Lead up to the speech of moon was giving

465
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
I noticed

466
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,696
How much is doing just a lot of water carrying

467
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,976
For the Russian government

468
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,072
All of the western unconfirm reports

469
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,888
That the lgbtq

470
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
Are going to be putting cam

471
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
What is the low

472
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,944
What's the length of our you put our children in

473
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
They're not arresting

474
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
Homosexual

475
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
In

476
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
But anytime

477
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Gets arrested

478
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
Pink sweater

479
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Purple sweater

480
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:21,568
Someone to tell Alex that it's illegal to be gay in Russia he does realize that you will be arrested

481
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
On account of it being illegal

482
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,408
Everybody's going to get arrested

483
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:30,272
I've been widely reported purges and arrest people who are either gay or

484
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Suspected

485
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:37,440
Yeah 1013 the government to build stopping quote gay propaganda

486
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
Which has been used to Target activists

487
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,048
Speak up for the community

488
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,912
The first same-sex marriage recognized in Russia between two men married in Denmark was

489
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
Weekly unrecognized

490
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
And then the men fled the country

491
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Prepare for their life

492
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Yeah there

493
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
Over 100 tortured in chechnya in 2017 which the Russian government doesn't even theme

494
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Worth investigating

495
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
What Alex is saying is Bolt

496
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
And he knows it

497
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:07,136
But he also knows that he can't allow the picture he paints of food into be water of someone who's harshly

498
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,208
Repressing People based on sexual identity orientation

499
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:15,072
Bus Alex decides to just pretend that every instance of targeting the lgbtq activists

500
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,888
Is secretly them detaining a CIA agent

501
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
I mean weird

502
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,216
You know it's wrong

503
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
You know it's wrong

504
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,336
You can't not know you can't not know it's wrong

505
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
If you're also lying about it

506
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
Because even this

507
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
This is like

508
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:37,600
You're already talking to the crowd you already tossed now white nationalist slogans it clearly your audience is fully on boy

509
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,928
Bored with all your transphobia be gone by now if they were

510
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:45,280
Exactly so it's like just say we like Putin because he arrest

511
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,072
And disappears

512
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,608
Lgbtq members

513
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
And that's what we like

514
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,192
But I think that Alex

515
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,288
I mean it's flimsy grasp as he has over history

516
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,592
Though he fancies himself a scholar

517
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,896
I think even he knows that that was

518
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:07,296
A little bit of the early Nazi purges to celebrate the

519
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
Right

520
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
And it's like

521
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
But that's what you're doing

522
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,672
That's amazing

523
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:17,280
Play the game that he is doing there is because

524
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:21,888
If you was going to be honest about the gay propaganda law that Russia has passed

525
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,472
He would need to explain it okay for the state to curtail for

526
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
Free speech to this drastic of anak

527
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,664
Isn't the real serious problem but I kept her Free Speech Warrior like himself protest

528
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,480
Consistently Crackdown on in Russia

529
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,296
All the things that he thinks are essential

530
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Elements

531
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,136
Of course quote Western culture are not

532
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,952
Carried out in and respected by Putin

533
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Yeah

534
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
He can't

535
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
Except that or like

536
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
Sell that to the audience

537
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
So you deny it

538
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Well I mean

539
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,448
Just you just create a new story

540
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,240
Can you how can you literally

541
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
Be one of these people

542
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
And just watch

543
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,664
Putin literally like the moment and anti-war protest

544
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,992
Chester walks out onto the Street Moscow they're f****** arrested

545
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,040
And think to yourself well

546
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,600
If that's the type of leader that I want

547
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:17,440
Because I remember and I when we were protesting the war in Iraq

548
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,256
Especially Alex whenever he was strongly against

549
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,608
I'm sure you would've been stoked to have a president up f****** arrest him immediately

550
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
It was that kind of

551
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
F***** up

552
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,056
Is an ability among some people to

553
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,104
Abstractly imagine themselves

554
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,152
In various positions

555
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
Within Society

556
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,272
I think you gained a lot of empathy for people who are living

557
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
In poverty

558
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,368
By being able to imagine yourself

559
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:49,184
If you've lived in it and experienced it

560
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
And you can call back some of those memories

561
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
I think that Alex sees himself

562
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
As

563
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
The person who

564
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
Doing beef

565
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,216
Attacking protesters

566
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:05,056
He does not abstractly imagine himself as being someone who would be

567
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:10,688
Protesting the Russian government never occurs to him

568
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
These people protesting are wrong

569
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,016
Oh they should be

570
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:18,368
You're right that's kind of how I think of brain works only free speech if you're right

571
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
Correct and he's never right

572
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,256
So Putin starts his speech

573
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
I noticed

574
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
Very bizarre dynamic

575
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,400
Well perfect timing as we speak vitamin Putin has just take

576
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,264
We're going to go to this announcement by The Rush

577
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Cheerleader

578
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080
About the ongoing armed conflict

579
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
Western Europe in the proxy war

580
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,432
Is Ukraine

581
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
Of course my address

582
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Is also

583
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
Aimed at our fellow

584
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,368
Citizens

585
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
In Ukraine

586
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Rollhouse

587
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
2/2

588
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
And details

589
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
Conversation

590
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
The matter is very

591
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
.

592
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,680
It was surreal to listen to this on Infowars because the Putin speech itself was pretty f***** up but

593
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:09,824
Are much more local level it wasn't saying how Alex just plays the whole thing and doesn't interrupt except for commercial

594
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
What

595
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,920
His actions really indicate a very real reverence

596
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,808
Alex Fields towards play a video without jumping in

597
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,856
It went on over multiple segments

598
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:26,208
Even with Trump speeches he'd often cut into double down or say something to do damage

599
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
Control

600
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,816
He was just airing a straight feed from Russian TV to Infowars

601
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:35,680
And it was it was very strange holyshit

602
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
It's just

603
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,520
Putin speech yeah so there isn't like a lot to even

604
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
Go over he's not really saying all that.

605
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
No

606
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
Just a Luna

607
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,176
Do it one of the brakes

608
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,456
When he's

609
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Taking a break

610
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,552
Putin speech gears his take on it

611
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
History

612
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,648
I've never heard of modern world leader me the song

613
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
We came in herds

614
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
Ukrainians

615
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
In a way

616
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,096
And linen David all the way to begin with it's always been part of us

617
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
When your son's talk other balls cut off

618
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
That's really what this comes down to

619
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,920
Cuz she's going to put your kids

620
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
With adults

621
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
Because

622
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,952
He wants to go back to Russia being Russian things

623
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,352
Things that are Caesar's

624
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,680
What you're not over there in Russia

625
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Wow

626
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,544
Interesting take

627
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,336
I mean

628
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,432
I didn't know Alex

629
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,504
Hero worshipping Neville Chamberlain these days

630
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,624
So Alex believes incorrectly even if you just wear to

631
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
Watch that speech transcript of it

632
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,232
He believes it with Putin the saying is

633
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:09,632
Hey Ukraine Live and Let Live if you want to go with the West go with the West

634
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,728
But you seems like you're making animus boyfriend getting broken up with I mean

635
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
Very strange

636
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
Take the take is wrong

637
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,616
Yeah yeah yeah

638
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
I mean you could say

639
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:25,248
In a way it was a modern leader being very honest

640
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
In the sense that they were

641
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,904
Revealing that there a psychopathic supervillain ready to invade a country because they want

642
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Territory

643
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:40,352
It was honest in his much as especially with the gift of hindsight that we have from a few days later

644
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
You could scare a lot of people

645
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936
Arguing this even

646
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
On Monday

647
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
This was

648
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:52,640
Keeps listing of excuses for why he wouldn't

649
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:59,040
No I mean you listen to that song I listen to the speech and I was like

650
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
He's going to die

651
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Like that's the only

652
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,136
Conclusion you can draw from such a f******

653
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
Crazy sweet

654
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:11,072
If it feels that way but the same time Alex is still saying this this notion of like what he's going to do

655
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
Do is probably

656
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,936
You know with the dawn boss those those areas

657
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,800
He's going to take those because that is part of Russia in

658
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:27,200
Right the wrongs of Lenin which is a great way to frame it if you're a lunatic

659
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,248
But that makes and very strange yeah

660
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
Cialix does

661
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
Continue that prediction

662
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,112
Didn't ask

663
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
Scar are going to crush

664
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
Come take them

665
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
So they're going to Annex

666
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Eastern

667
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Tax on it

668
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
That's a serious situation

669
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
Consequences

670
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,432
Soros New World Order

671
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
The West

672
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,320
Vault of Soros

673
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:08,928
Speed art Isaiah instigating is meddling around

674
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,768
Who works for Larry Fink who work for the devil

675
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
You got to keep that org chart

676
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,352
You know BlackRock

677
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
The devil

678
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:22,240
The devil would sit on a black rock Black Rock was the name of the ship in lost that has

679
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:26,080
The dynamite in it Wells Fargo

680
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,360
Episode in

681
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,152
Season

682
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,880
So this is this is where Alex is at

683
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:43,232
Anti we've heard him say what he says in his next fight before

684
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,024
But it's always funny just too

685
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,072
To remember that Alex may actually

686
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,912
It's a shame

687
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
48 years I've been under 20

688
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
Basketball crazy

689
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,896
And I knew that pretty started meeting with Shelton eats in the last

690
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Great

691
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
But now I

692
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
Are you seeing more more

693
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,488
Vladimir Putin repudiating communism

694
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,840
Western powers

695
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,472
Free from this restarting exten

696
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,800
Can get free of this club ilysm as well

697
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
Infowars

698
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:38,016
Putin Putin loves a war just one of those

699
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
I can't imagine

700
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
To like

701
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
Listen to this show

702
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,440
Right right

703
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
I even

704
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
I barely can handle

705
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,864
I can't imagine if you're the head of a country

706
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,912
Making the time to like

707
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,704
Oh I got to check in and see what this

708
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,544
Drunk texting is angry about today

709
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
His day look like

710
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,872
He can fit in some info

711
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:10,272
Right right

712
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:16,672
Very much but it's not like after he eats dinner at an absurdly long table with whoever you know he goes

713
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Close down and he's like

714
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:22,816
Now I'm in my man cave with a nice comfy chair ready to listen to Alex f******

715
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:29,216
King Jones listening group may be with the Lord of blocks

716
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:34,848
I got one of those look like a lost viewing party if you will European weirdos that might

717
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
Show up

718
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
Alex is a man

719
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,248
He loves this he loves this speech

720
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Kick it enough

721
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Alright

722
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
I don't see how you

723
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,184
Historically true

724
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,328
Blah blah blah what do you want to know it's coming

725
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:00,704
We don't want you with you

726
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,032
Please please don't go to war with us

727
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,664
Level is powerful

728
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
It's the truth

729
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
Is powerful

730
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
Infowars

731
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Hell yeah

732
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
Right

733
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,280
We just want to do business with you Russia

734
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
It's so

735
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
So from

736
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
He listened to Bhutan

737
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Speech

738
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
That that that

739
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:38,080
Hampden interrupt interrupt it was played in entirety on his show we know he listened to it because he probably

740
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Smacked

741
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,944
At least yeah so it was probably difficult to hear for about 10 minutes cuz he's chomping

742
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
Probably

743
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
Maybe maybe soft food burrito

744
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,280
I think that it's real it was really difficult for me to listen to this cuz it was really jarring

745
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
The dissonance

746
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,632
Between Alex's interpretations of things and the things I was hearing

747
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
Yeah yeah I mean that

748
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:07,008
Stats with that fux with my head right now I can't imagine being alone

749
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
You know

750
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,384
I think Alex might just have had his mind blown by the notion that like

751
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,920
You know Putin

752
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,456
Doesn't like communism

753
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,248
I guess and the

754
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,784
He has distaste

755
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
For Lenin and Stalin

756
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,624
Wow

757
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,792
For one of them who is also a complete badass apparently.

758
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
Digest

759
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,680
If you listen to the actual speech explains really

760
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
What his problem is

761
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:41,568
Yeah so this Bisquick was really where I think I figured out one of the most

762
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,104
Mccentral

763
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
Problems

764
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,408
With Alex

765
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Interpretation

766
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:53,088
Hard on Ukraine with a rhetoric referring to a cranes process of decolonization

767
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,136
You want to be communize well

768
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,792
We're ready to show you what real

769
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
Becoming eyes

770
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
But the Hardline

771
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
Right-wingers here

772
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,408
So brainwashed

773
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Russia was our enemy

774
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,296
It's a secret plot they're still in bed with an O

775
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,856
The Larry sanction black rocks in

776
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648
Global organizations

777
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Is not

778
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,720
Under their control

779
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,256
Where is Thanksgiving autoplay

780
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,816
Here is the actual clip

781
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,376
From the speech that Alex is talking about

782
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,936
And as a result the Bolsheviks policy

783
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
It's obvious Ukraine was created

784
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
And we have

785
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,568
Every reason to say now

786
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Ukraine

787
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
Created

788
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,176
By Vladimir Lenin

789
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
He's

790
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
It's crater in Arkansas

791
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
Skooly

792
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,832
Confirmed by the

793
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
Documents from The Archives

794
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
Also including the

795
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Decrease

796
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,512
Play music Chris regarding.

797
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
Dequeen and now

798
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Grateful

799
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,168
Demolishing all this

800
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
Statues old monuments

801
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
Kaladi communization

802
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
You want

803
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Communization

804
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,640
Well we are quite happy with that

805
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
Don't stop halfway

806
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
We already

807
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
To show you

808
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,808
What would mean

809
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,856
Actual Dam ation for Ukraine

810
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,648
What Putin was saying was a threat

811
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,536
He was not saying that he was going to get rid of Communism which is the way Alex is reporting that comment

812
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,168
What are you saying is that the people of Ukraine or moving past their Soviet past and smashing statues of Lenin

813
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:49,056
But Putin says if you want to do that go all the way and revert your borders back to what they were before 1922

814
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,104
Would you crane join the Sophia.

815
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,991
Frederick scary and Brazen, that has implications for all the former Soviet member state

816
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,647
There's an underlying premise here that in order to actually leave the Soviet Union you need to go out exactly as you came in

817
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:09,535
And if your borders are different than when they were previously he has a right to take that land because it's actually still Russia Today

818
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:14,655
It should be pretty obvious why this mentality could be a problem for a whole host of states in the region

819
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,263
And Alex does not seem to be willing to understand what is being said

820
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
Highway Avenue

821
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
I mean

822
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,847
It's like talking

823
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,687
Finland's worried again that's the level of

824
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,527
Where we're at with this is not like a he's going to get

825
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
Crimea

826
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,575
This is like he is

827
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:37,695
Stated that before he dies he's going to try and reunify the Soviet Union

828
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,487
That's basically what that speeches

829
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,303
There's there's there's a lot of there's a lot of calls for

830
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Concern

831
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,167
I'll say that that's for sure

832
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,959
So

833
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:55,103
That is I think one of the central misunderstandings that Alex has this idea that is

834
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Rat around

835
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,919
Idea of becoming ization

836
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,223
Alex is interpreting eyes

837
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,807
They're going to be part of the free-market again exactly

838
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
Market

839
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:11,487
Not they're going to replace a democratically elected governor with area so we go to the next Tuesday

840
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,279
Here's where Alex's head is at

841
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
It was so incredible

842
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,887
An emergency broadcast

843
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
We take calls for 3 hours

844
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,799
Replaying his speech and

845
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
My mouth

846
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,919
Cuz I

847
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,223
Last night my

848
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
My mouth

849
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Was

850
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,295
Hanging open

851
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,879
Bad Stalin was bad

852
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
Lennon was bad

853
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,719
You want a d, nice things we're doing

854
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
We're having kids

855
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Free market

856
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,119
And we're going to fight back against the globalists in the Monopoly

857
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
And and

858
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
That the West

859
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,215
Corporations try to make everybody Papa

860
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,175
It's so weird to turn into world leader and just proof

861
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Who's coming out

862
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,015
It's all true the Russians

863
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,623
Came into Ukraine we were bored you're really the most Russians freely

864
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,207
We're sorry that the Communists killed YouTube usually apologize

865
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,279
We want you to be free

866
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071
And we're not going to take you over

867
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,119
Just your government needs to go it was

868
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,935
I do actually have your own government

869
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,031
You need to stop attacking eastern Ukraine

870
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,943
Knowing world history

871
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
Milly Rock

872
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,135
Hard to find pulse

873
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
LeVar Burton

874
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:50,559
Wow it's great to Russia to say you have to overthrow your government

875
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:54,399
Right not be just involving

876
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,031
Are the areas in Dubai government was put in by the West so you have to get rid of your entire

877
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:04,895
Overthrow the government

878
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
You'll be free

879
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,479
We're going to take your land

880
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,527
And overthrow your government cool

881
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,159
Reading comprehension

882
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,695
You can understand a book

883
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:24,095
But I like you can understand a chapter you can understand a page or paragraph or a sentence a word

884
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:28,959
He was like that

885
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Oliver

886
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:36,127
He's written a story about a food was saying I don't know that word was a prompt

887
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,687
For him an essay

888
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:45,087
That's totally what it is complete rejection and abandon

889
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
The communism

890
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:52,767
Maybe part of it but it's actually a term that refers to the states that were formerly part of the Soviet Union moving away from their time as a part of that

891
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,071
All sometimes by way of purchase

892
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,375
So people who were involved in the Communist Party

893
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:01,983
The things that Alex is saying are the characters actions of what he imagines the word me

894
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,055
It's like having kids of being free market or fighting the global

895
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,359
I bring this point up for two reasons

896
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:12,735
The first is that Alex seems to be really hang his hat on that Miss interpretation

897
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,319
The second is that it really illustrates how much of Alex is reporting a

898
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:21,439
In geopolitical analysis is storylines based on those assumptions

899
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,255
It's a really unreliable method for report

900
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,375
When Putin discusses his dislike of Stalin and Lenin the Communist Party

901
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,191
He isn't saying that he doesn't like them for the same reason to Alec

902
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:32,959
What does

903
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:39,103
If you actually listen to the whole speech it's super clear that doesn't like them because he blames them for breaking up the Soviet Union

904
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
Quote

905
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,455
It is now that radicals are nationalist including

906
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:47,551
Primarily those in Ukraine are taking credit for having gained independence

907
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,111
As we can see this is absolutely wrong

908
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:56,767
The disintegration of our united country was brought about by the historic strategic mistakes on the part of the Bolshevik leaders

909
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,559
And the cpsu leadership

910
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:03,423
Mistakes committed at different times and State Building and in economic MSN

911
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
Mick policies

912
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:08,799
The collapse of the historical Russia known as the USSR is on their conscience

913
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:13,919
Also I think I'll be real stretch to say that he was apologizing for anything even

914
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455
At the predecessor is dead

915
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,479
Snow

916
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783
This is the state that Alex is enduring

917
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
The early week

918
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,831
He's fairly

919
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,623
Bully cheerleading on Putin

920
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:26,207
You think he's a fountain of Truth somebody can find no fault in him as a leader

921
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:32,351
How much is fully aware that Putin is most likely going to in some way or another Annex the donbass region

922
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
And Alex

923
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,911
Completely in support of that

924
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:40,031
He's bought this action will be taken to defend Russian speakers in the region which is

925
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,079
Inconsistent pretext that Putin uses

926
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,127
Hostile actions against his neighbors

927
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663
And Alex has every reason to know that

928
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
On Wednesday night

929
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,015
The status quo change dramatically

930
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
And Russia declared war against

931
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
Ukraine

932
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:55,391
Security Council held an emergency

933
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:00,255
MC meeting Putin announced his intention to demilitarize and quotidian ossify Ukraine

934
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,047
And began a campaign against the car

935
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:07,423
The assault wasn't just limited to danfoss region but included attacks on cities far to the West

936
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
So the reader

937
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:13,823
Yeah the turn of events is not on but it's far more extreme than most people's

938
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
Even though

939
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
Yeah I'm no expert on the Regent soda

940
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
Don't take my

941
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,967
Word is any

942
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,807
Anything meaningful but from everything I've read and see and I was not expecting anything

943
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,087
On this scale

944
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,743
It's ultimately not the most important piece in all of this but because this is a show about Alex Jones it should be pointed out that Alex was also

945
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,023
Also entirely wrong

946
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,815
How about his assessment of the situation

947
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:41,727
He completely whiffed on his interpretation to Putin speech on Monday and use that misrepresentation and misinterpretation

948
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:45,823
To justify Putin subsequent actions that led to the invasion of Ukraine

949
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,383
As it's pretty much always the case Alex's

950
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,199
Painfully wrong because he created his narrative

951
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:55,295
Biking combining uncritical acceptance of hostile government propaganda

952
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,087
With figment of his imagination

953
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,903
But that leaves us to pick up the pieces on Thursday

954
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,463
Now that Ukraine has been invaded now it says

955
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,047
Attire weeks is collapsed around how is he going to proceed

956
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,327
And more importantly

957
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,887
How will he pretend that he's been right all along

958
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,191
That's the question we ask ourselves

959
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,471
Enter

960
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,495
The 24th

961
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,567
Yeah you know I mean he's wrong about everything

962
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,359
And the early week

963
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,431
But it does seem like he's cheering for like

964
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
Minimal loss of life

965
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:30,367
You know I mean he saying fine you can take care of regions and s*** and maybe it's right

966
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,951
And all of that stuff is good but the the endpoint is

967
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
We're not going

968
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,511
To start a f****** more

969
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,071
That's the idea

970
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:42,655
That's what that's what I'm saying that's his mindset coming into

971
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,959
The war he imagines

972
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,495
That there's a way for that

973
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
To happen

974
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,895
Ready for Russia to force the overthrow of Ukraine's government without there being

975
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,455
Civilian casualties in

976
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
Terrible consequence

977
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,063
He's pretending that's true but it is not it is absolutely

978
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,111
And I think that

979
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
Much like

980
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
Myself maybe I was naive

981
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,487
I don't think that Alex expected

982
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,535
What happened on Wednesday

983
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,095
I think he is caught on his back foot

984
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
And

985
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:20,287
Really have to figure out what he's going to do now we're floundering

986
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,335
Yawning pretty much everything

987
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:29,247
Well we don't have to come in with our own canned air raid sirens for during the Cold War

988
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,879
Hillary sirens

989
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,415
Get dropped on Military targets

990
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
Housing

991
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
Park Place of a Slavic

992
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:39,999
Peoples

993
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Ukraine

994
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,607
I should jealously just not one

995
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,143
What's Soros

996
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
Self self

997
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
Precious

998
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,543
That's the reality

999
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,079
How much going on

1000
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
I'm saying

1001
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,943
Oh that's

1002
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:05,599
He's been saying that I'm going to take it over he is he's not been anything I'm sorry you guys can run your own country

1003
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:11,999
No you saying I'm going to take this land if you want to be with cirrhosis and newworldorder you do you

1004
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,023
But you can't cuz I'm taking

1005
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,583
And that's what I've always

1006
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:22,239
This is strange that's a little bit off-putting it's a little bit of the opposite of entirely

1007
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,311
If you're listening to Alex's show throughout the stretch of the week

1008
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,871
Have to be like

1009
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,663
This is not good

1010
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,455
What's going to happen

1011
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,015
Myrtle Beach

1012
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,807
We interpreted Putin's words

1013
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,903
In a way to tap this is all cool what he's doing

1014
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:44,511
Great friend now there's an amazing the table today or interpreting these words in a completely different way

1015
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,839
And even then still being positive about it

1016
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,119
I like it's fine

1017
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,399
Well I mean

1018
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,471
I don't think it's good that you can take over an entire country

1019
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:57,823
But Soros is taking it over so it's really taking it from Soro

1020
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,615
Taking over turkey

1021
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,639
Sure

1022
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,175
So

1023
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,199
Boy

1024
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,735
Alex is proud of himself

1025
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
For reasons that are

1026
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,807
Unclear to me

1027
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,111
Putin has invaded Ukraine

1028
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:14,463
Is he just taking out the military targets so far but will he continue to ratchet up

1029
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,303
That's how the US.

1030
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,095
That's how Hitler did it

1031
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679
That's how you meant worm

1032
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,007
Take over a population in war you never tell people

1033
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,335
But you're really planning to do you're going to get the inside scoop

1034
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,383
Sister is

1035
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,295
YouTube ABC

1036
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,183
Or you can tune in here and actually really understand the history of things in

1037
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,999
About where all this is going

1038
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,535
All hell is breaking loose

1039
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,839
There's a few clips of yours truly

1040
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,167
November of last year

1041
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,775
So you just play some clips of himself talkingshit about how there's going to be a war and

1042
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,543
And such

1043
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:04,639
Any. Ms career you could come up with clips of him saying

1044
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,199
Stampy water being any

1045
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
Random month

1046
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:14,879
Yeah it one of them I do remember is in the context of him talking about being out with Joe Rogan

1047
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:18,719
And some other Joe's friends

1048
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,255
About how there was going to be a war

1049
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:26,655
And I was just part of the prediction is somebody's got drunk and ice

1050
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:33,055
Play that is a Victory lap

1051
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,079
Great

1052
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,919
You have to understand. He's maligning

1053
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,967
All sorts of other information

1054
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:43,295
Cancel versus wild saying I keep tuna in here you get the real s*** like

1055
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,319
Yeah it's not

1056
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:47,391
Listen to Infowars

1057
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,695
And you get information that leads you to

1058
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,719
Wheatley ill-equipped

1059
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,791
To deal with with Brett from Santa's like this

1060
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:57,119
Because you've been fed a line that Putin has no fault

1061
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,447
He is a wonderful leader and all he really wants to do

1062
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,215
Is is

1063
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
Enoteca

1064
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:08,383
What you don't like unification you don't like the Communist Asian you don't like meat denazification Dan

1065
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
Those are all great things

1066
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:14,527
Just like Americans for progress is a great group of people who are for progress

1067
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:18,111
That's how words work they always mean literally

1068
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
What it is there about

1069
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,671
Yeah you

1070
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:24,511
It's just strange for him to be bragging intuitive

1071
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,559
Pumping up his own chest when

1072
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:31,423
He's living in the cops like that the aftermath of his own

1073
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,495
Failure information

1074
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,031
Take me to Victory lap

1075
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,079
Yep

1076
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:43,455
You can turn into the BBC in here the Putin's the new Hitler in a mean tone of voice

1077
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:49,855
Are you can turn in here and hear that the new Hitler is going to keep going

1078
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,647
You have a great time

1079
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:57,023

00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:23,903
Every

1095
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
Protect lapray

1096
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,511
CNN is running this

1097
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
Promo

1098
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,303
Every break

1099
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,399
The only time seeing as viewers is during election

1100
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,703
Ordering a war so they've gone from

1101
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,287
What was the ratings of ever had their ratings are quite high right now

1102
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,847
And why would you be running

1103
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,151
Promos

1104
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,943
About Alex Jones being the devil

1105
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:47,967
Every

1106
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,271
Single braids

1107
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,063
Every single break so I did something

1108
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
Purdue

1109
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,879
I went to Andover to seeing in this morning

1110
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,927
The first

1111
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
The devil

1112
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,863
Mouth of the New World Order

1113
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,935
Demonizing me

1114
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
So he's the devil

1115
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:15,359
I've gotten a number of questions about this CNN megaphone of conspiracy

1116
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,943
Sure I don't know if I talk to them

1117
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,783
I did talk to somebody

1118
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
It was months back

1119
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:29,183
Right I never heard back from them tell everybody what you said

1120
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:35,583
Well I didn't I don't know if I would get in trouble for saying this but

1121
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,887
One of the things I made very clear

1122
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,959
Is it I would not be willing to be a part of any

1123
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,007
Kisor documentary or anyting

1124
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:47,103
That played up Alex as some kind of a like Mastermind are like

1125
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,919
Big like

1126
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,223
RaeLynn kind of thing because I

1127
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,783
Let me know he's a bumbling idiot who has

1128
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,367
Weird beliefs about interdimensional demons fighting against

1129
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:04,767
F****** George Soros in the gang and I feel that if anything I'm going to lend

1130
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,815
Myself to her appear in for my own sake

1131
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,351
If nothing else

1132
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,423
I don't want to perpetuate that image of him as

1133
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,751
Some kind of a megaphone wielding

1134
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,055
Write a valentine

1135
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,639
Know if that is with a deal-breaker

1136
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:24,735
Decent chance that the person talk to me like an a******

1137
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:31,135
Oh you're just going to go around thinking you're some kind of special expert on Alex Jones

1138
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,951
I think

1139
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
It's possible

1140
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
That

1141
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,047
I rub the person the wrong way

1142
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,375
I don't like the metallic we had an unpleasant conversation or everything

1143
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
I just

1144
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:49,055
I find myself to be unpleasant.

1145
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,615
So yeah I'm not in that

1146
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,431
For all the people who have been asked

1147
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,991
Did not hear back

1148
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,783
Again I want also be clear

1149
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,599
When I talk to the person at CNN

1150
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:04,671
They said that there were possibly multiple projects

1151
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
So this might be a

1152
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:06,975
Completely

1153
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:10,559
Something that the person I talk to you I don't know I did not hear back

1154
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,583
Hey

1155
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,983
Based on this I bet I'm never going to talk to anybody else I would not be surprised by that

1156
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:24,383
I've declared talking to Brian stelter my white whale

1157
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,199
Yeah that is going to be something I need to check off the bucket

1158
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:32,319
So anyway CNN doing the tape piece on Alex

1159
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
And there's a reason

1160
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,207
Hundreds of newspapers a day

1161
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,511
Dozens of TV show today

1162
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,047
National shows every week

1163
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,399
Alex Jones is sick

1164
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:52,799
Because they see me butler

1165
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,103
Stream Kodi

1166
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
Man who's a father

1167
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,199
Who believes in Freedom at his rally the people

1168
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,759
Has survived their attacks for decades

1169
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,551
And they think if we can just

1170
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
Destroy him

1171
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
Building

1172
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,671
Prison

1173
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,463
Then we can somehow defeat

1174
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
Get to you if they hate you they're your enemy

1175
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,679
War with you

1176
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,727
It is a b

1177
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:29,407
Attacking me because I stand between you and Powerful

1178
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,943
Toxic line for propaganda

1179
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
Sears

1180
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,991
Because it achieved

1181
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,527
Really potent goals

1182
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:41,439
The first is that it creates a centralized point that the followers need to support to the point of considering the survival

1183
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,975
Well being of that Central Point

1184
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,767
Is as important as their own

1185
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,791
If not more

1186
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,095
Yeah cuz they're not as important as the fight

1187
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:52,447
If Alex Jones or Trump is all that stands between you and sir

1188
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:56,031
Globalist Onslaught that it's in your best interest to do everything

1189
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,311
Think you can to protect them

1190
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,847
So you don't get onslaught

1191
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,639
This hustle is perfect

1192
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:04,479
Because it works no matter what because the dreaded Onslaught is imaginary

1193
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:11,391
As long as you're in business and siphoning off support from your scared audience you're doing your job and holding back this imagined arm

1194
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:18,303
If you go out of business or died then it doesn't matter if that Onslaught doesn't actually come because you aren't in a position to exploit

1195
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:24,703
The audiences fear anymore it works coming and going it's perfect position to receive any kind of car

1196
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:30,591
Consequences for doing such a business already

1197
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:36,991
Scams by American tradition

1198
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:41,087
You were in essentially Sidelines any legitimate criticism of this centralized

1199
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:41,855
Point

1200
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:48,255
Alex is a complete liar and a noted piece of s*** in just about every aspect of his life that we have any information about

1201
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,535
But none of that really matters

1202
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:52,095
If he's the only thing holding back this imaginary Army

1203
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:58,495
Trump is a lifelong con man who treated the US government is as cool to exploit for his own agenda and self-interest but

1204
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:02,591
If he's all that stands between you and this imaginary Army does that really matter

1205
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,615
And hey does

1206
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:10,015
He deserve it for standing in between you and not coming on site what's a little corruption honestly if I were

1207
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,343
We're doing so much good I wouldn't be able to resist a little

1208
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:19,743
Corruption this is how

1209
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:25,631
Insidious 2 of manipulation and it's a direct abuse that Alex is perpetuating on his audience

1210
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:32,287
People who criticized Alex for plenty of other reasons and not just because he's a strong man who has

1211
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,055
Raz-Kids

1212
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,359
It is Honorable and Noble

1213
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,639
I can think of

1214
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,943
0 of those

1215
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,967
Reasons

1216
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:44,319
And I found a come up

1217
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,903
Manly

1218
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,463
His ability to cry

1219
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:55,071
Wine and do nothing for anyone else of any good

1220
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:01,727
Just think of honorable people I think of those who refuse to take responsibility for anything

1221
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
Oh yeah

1222
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,543
For honorable

1223
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823
So we started

1224
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:11,967
This 24th Episode and Alex some of the interpretations that he had

1225
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,503
Obunga

1226
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,295
Sure sure

1227
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,831
But now he's

1228
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,623
Narrative again

1229
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,999
Russian flag in Ukraine as Z tank

1230
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
Butcher

1231
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,559
From the East

1232
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,095
No tanks

1233
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,399
From Belarus

1234
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,423
Dinner

1235
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,215
Deeper into the nation

1236
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
Panera

1237
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,871
Because just like the US

1238
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,175
The Iraqi leadership

1239
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,223
For 2

1240
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
94

1241
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,527
Copper Cellar generals

1242
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,343
You see that Putin is already done

1243
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,111
Work

1244
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
What and is already paid off

1245
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,183
Military

1246
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,207
And that's why the rush

1247
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,999
No they can roll right in

1248
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
Call snow resistance

1249
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:58,815
What

1250
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,119
Because that's how real war

1251
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
John

1252
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:06,239
This is really interesting because definitely wrong and multiple way I mean so many

1253
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,287
First it's wrong in the sense that it took

1254
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:12,127
Complete contradiction of everything else was reporting and predicting earlier in the week

1255
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:18,527
No point is Alex taking stock of how wrong he was and how he was supporting Putin directly in the

1256
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,295
Lead up to this

1257
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:25,951
The second way this is wrong is it making up everything about Putin paying off Ukrainian troops and there being no

1258
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
Resistance

1259
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:31,839
There's been a ton of fighting with a Russian air units shot down in ground

1260
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,607
Do hotspots

1261
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,887
Not just in Dunbar

1262
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:39,263
What I just want example of this is fighting this taking place at the gospel Mel Airfield

1263
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:43,615
Russian paratroopers came in and took over and they were confronted by Ukrainian troops

1264
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:48,735
And as I Was preparing this episode the outcome was still on.

1265
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,015
It's been like

1266
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:54,111
Back and forth

1267
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,951
I'm taking it back from them and so much and there is reports

1268
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:00,255
Many other instrumentals

1269
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:05,119
Well it is the island of the Snake Island

1270
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,191
I saw something about that just before we started recording

1271
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:15,103
Does reporting this complete fabrication because he need this to be true to emotionally disconnected self from the fact that he was poor

1272
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,895
Are the media chorus in the United States

1273
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:17,919
The cheer.

1274
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:21,503
Actively promoted the lead up to an invasion that is not killing civilians

1275
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:24,319
And causing widespread fighting in an invaded Sauber

1276
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,087
Bring country

1277
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,183
How much supported the thing his brand is all about pretending to be against

1278
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,743
All because he's blinded by his imagination

1279
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,839
Did Putin listens to his stupid show and it's an ally against his pretend enemies

1280
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,143
How to extrude on something that is at

1281
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,959
Just an attempt to overthrow a neighboring countries government

1282
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,519
And at worst an attempt to take the whole thing over

1283
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,823
And he doesn't want to feel bad about that

1284
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,431
So if this is just a situation where military

1285
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,223
It is Marching In uncontested

1286
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:58,623
It's not a situation where civilians are hunkering down at Subway stations for shelter where shells are hitting

1287
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,927
Residential areas where Russian troops are attacking

1288
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,695
Far more than

1289
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,975
Region

1290
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,767
Which is the flimsy

1291
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,071
Text that I bought from the Kremlin it's all through his body

1292
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,607
How to draw

1293
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
Majorly wrong

1294
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:12,447
In order to maintain the feeling

1295
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,751
Throng this has to be fake

1296
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
It's fake

1297
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
What's going on

1298
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,431
Can't make

1299
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,991
Can't take responsibility for a single cell

1300
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:30,111
It's got to run has got to be always running

1301
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,903
It's not even just a responsibility

1302
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,927
It's the feeling

1303
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,207
Oh yeah no course

1304
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,511
Well I mean I don't have that feeling

1305
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,047
To feel like

1306
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,351
Save cheerleader the next Hitler

1307
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,911
Probably probably

1308
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:43,935
Nobody

1309
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,239
There's some people will probably be thrilled to have

1310
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:50,335
And it sure seems to be those people generally don't have large

1311
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,359
Million Dollar business

1312
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
Doesn't seem to be that way

1313
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
Myself

1314
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,943
Huh

1315
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,991
Anyway this is not the only time

1316
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,551
That people have just bought off Army

1317
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,623
Victor French just gave up and

1318
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,391
10 days

1319
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,671
What Hitler

1320
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,695
Invaded

1321
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,719
1940

1322
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,487
No

1323
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,815
He bought off the entire

1324
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,351
French command

1325
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,143
I know

1326
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
Taylor ship of France

1327
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,727
Headquarters

1328
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,519
For the next five years

1329
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,407
The attack on France didn't last 10 days

1330
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:29,247
Also at a France was bought off to let Germany just come in

1331
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:32,319
People die for no reason

1332
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:36,159
I think what Alex is talking about is that they entered Paris unopposed

1333
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:39,743
That was because the French army is already taking a gigantic hit by that point

1334
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:42,815
And the French government had fled from Paris

1335
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:48,447
That's one of the historical things that contributes to the whole right-wing joke about French people loving to surrender

1336
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,239
We went through that with

1337
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:55,359
Freedom fries cheese eating surrender monkeys

1338
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,895
Groundskeeper Willie

1339
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,455
This is not how things played out

1340
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
WWII

1341
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,295
Nor is it an accurate description of how the Vichy French came

1342
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,623
To be I guess it's simpler for Alex just imagine

1343
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:11,231
These events in history were just like a simple Financial transactions

1344
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,279
Everybody ever

1345
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:17,119
Paris whenever whenever the Vichy took over

1346
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,679
Everybody was super cool with it cuz they were paid off

1347
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:26,079
There wasn't a consistent non-stop resistance from that single moment on until the end of the war

1348
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,919
Government-in-exile absolutely not

1349
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,223
Anyway I guess this is simpler

1350
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:35,295
It must be going away now Alex kind of Hester

1351
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
Wrestle with the fur

1352
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,343
Back to poot with lion

1353
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,183
Can't think of any way to fold

1354
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,559
Can you crank

1355
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,119
He denied it they denied it

1356
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,911
We're just going over to

1357
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,703
Songs

1358
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,983
We're just going to

1359
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,775
The Nazis

1360
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,055
Which

1361
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,847
How's the left side under that

1362
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:02,431
To look here's the thing I will tell you how sir there's nothing

1363
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:07,807
Alex is saying like

1364
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:08,831
Great

1365
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,623
That's just good strategy

1366
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,671
That wasn't saying that

1367
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,975
Denies that

1368
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
Now

1369
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,047
Do a little soul-searching

1370
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:18,815
About how

1371
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
You

1372
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,679
When on air repeatedly parotid those lies

1373
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:28,543
And also said this is the most truthful person that I have ever seen

1374
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,847
The greatest world leader in terms of

1375
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,383
Just give him the truth

1376
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,943
Dust fact power of honest

1377
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,711
Sticker power

1378
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
That is what

1379
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,503
He said

1380
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,527
Power of honest

1381
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,599
States parody level shape

1382
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,391
Alex

1383
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,207
And I had done what he did

1384
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,535
And this was the result I don't pretend

1385
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,815
Freddie Bennett

1386
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,863
In any serious way

1387
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,423
That Alex is actions had a direct result

1388
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,495
Anything like that

1389
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,031
He's lying to his audio

1390
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,079
Possibility

1391
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,359
To apologize

1392
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:06,175
To deal with hey look I bought that lie

1393
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:09,503
And I sold it to you

1394
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,271
Yes

1395
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,087
Would be effective

1396
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,879
Something to sell you

1397
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,439
It would not be fun

1398
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:22,303
And you probably would get mad at me if I were to say hey Biden might be onto something here

1399
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,607
No one would have accepted that

1400
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:29,471
Maybe the president was telling the truth the entire time and button Putin was lying which

1401
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:32,543
Is an inversion of how things are supposed to work my

1402
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,311
My home

1403
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,591
Marketspace Academy

1404
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:38,431
You f***** by that and so I went with Putin's lies cuz he's great

1405
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:43,551
I sold it to you as the most honest thing in the world whether or not I actually believe that at the time

1406
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:50,719
You need to do some unpacking on that something he's not he refuses to do it while at the same time accepting the Putin would lie

1407
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,767
How about his intentions and what he was doing

1408
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,047
What to do

1409
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,583
It's Blitz cowardly

1410
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,119
I mean

1411
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,399
It is like

1412
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,423
He is spinning

1413
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,959
Tons of plates right

1414
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,727
But big

1415
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,775
Because because

1416
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:07,103
Because there are no plates it doesn't matter if one of them Falls

1417
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,127
All right because they

1418
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
Don't exist

1419
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,967
So it's like oh no this

1420
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,503
Theoretical plate would have

1421
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,039
Really f***** me up but

1422
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,831
I'm just spinning a f******

1423
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,111
Stick

1424
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,647
Yeah yeah yeah

1425
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,695
Or even

1426
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,231
Like I do I don't even

1427
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:26,815
I don't even know how to make a metaphor that works better than

1428
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:30,143
Thanks

1429
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,471
Want to be alive

1430
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
Going to be allied with Russia

1431
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,567
What is the Slavic

1432
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,103
You found Russia

1433
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
We want you

1434
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:44,479
Because Ukraine's always been the good part of town

1435
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:45,759
What is a rush

1436
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,551
What

1437
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,391
And they're not going to let George Soros out

1438
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
Mama

1439
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,695
And so

1440
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
What's happening

1441
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,071
Yeah so they can't Source can't have mama

1442
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:03,167
I mean it's just got to feel like so much more work

1443
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,447
On this one

1444
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,983
To try and like

1445
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,055
Pretzel your way through Austin something like like

1446
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,079
You can't just be like

1447
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,103
Holyshit

1448
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:11,871
Got nuts

1449
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:19,039
Changing even over the course of this episode so far cuz I don't even know where I'm at

1450
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,575
Ouroboros of lying

1451
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:25,951
So you not getting with like he's attacking military installations is it going to go farther

1452
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:28,767
He's going to take the whole country of the invasion

1453
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
Fake

1454
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:37,983
Purchased it also nothing is actually happening every Soros literally every

1455
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,775
Thing that you are going to see

1456
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,567
He's a lie is what he say

1457
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:48,735
Include his real interesting change of tone

1458
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,759
Different previous days

1459
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,551
It's not yelling about how Putin

1460
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,903
I was so full of Truth in those straight up leader in the world who Alex can't find fault

1461
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,951
Just wanted to protect Russians and do boss

1462
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:00,767
It's taken Ukraine to Soros can't have it

1463
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,583
And Alex doesn't seem like he is offended by that

1464
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:04,863
Twitch

1465
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
Is

1466
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:11,519
Also Alex is full of s*** about it being 50-50 in Ukraine about joining with Russia or the way

1467
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:15,615
Center for inside research poll from December 2021 asked

1468
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:21,503
If Ukraine was able to enter only one international economic Union which one of the following should it be

1469
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:26,367
58% said the EU compared to 21% who said quote

1470
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,927
Customs Union with russia-belarus and cause

1471
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:36,095
Another poll from 2021 reflected 64% support among ukrainians for joining NATO compared to 19 /

1472
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:36,863
Opposed

1473
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:40,703
Alex is trying to create the impression that the issue was split down the middle because

1474
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:43,007
It lends greater credibility to the side that

1475
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,031
It's far down in the

1476
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:44,799
The polls

1477
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,847
Which is beside Alex supports which is boot

1478
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:49,663
Its climate denialism as a

1479
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:55,039
Boats a lot of

1480
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,343
It's not necessarily their fifth

1481
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,367
50/50 exactly

1482
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,647
Play but they're equal in strength

1483
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,951
You know how I feel about them

1484
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,719
Yep

1485
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,511
So Alex continues

1486
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:07,071
In the middle of this show as it goes on

1487
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,375
To pretend that there's no fighting

1488
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
Going on

1489
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,423
And Ukraine which is just

1490
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,191
Wild

1491
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,983
But that's why you're not seeing any

1492
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,079
Because it was all

1493
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,359
Her show

1494
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,735
The comedian Hollywood

1495
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,271
President was a

1496
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,039
Double

1497
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,575
The whole time

1498
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,903
Oh yeah

1499
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,719
Money

1500
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,743
Is on

1501
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,559
Experts on Ellen I'm an expert myself

1502
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,583
No

1503
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,887
And so

1504
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,703
We already won

1505
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,983
For Ebola

1506
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,079
That's why we're infowars.com

1507
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,383
Tomorrow's news

1508
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:56,479
This is brazen even for Alex

1509
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,039
I mean they're going to kill zielinski

1510
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,319
Like that's the

1511
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,087
That's the plan

1512
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:07,487
I'm sorry if my response was a

1513
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,791
No I mean it's f***** up and he's saying that

1514
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,327
He's a double agent

1515
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,607
They're going to kill him

1516
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,215
I have

1517
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
Difficulty assessing what

1518
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,055
I think is going to happen

1519
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,103
Especially with

1520
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,919
Circumstances as have happened over the past week

1521
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,199
I

1522
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
Don't know

1523
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:34,367
Write like that as the intelligence that was given out by

1524
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,439
By biting his that he is Target one and his family is Tiger Woods

1525
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:42,559
I wouldn't be super sport

1526
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:45,631
Beyond my capabilities of like Assassin

1527
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,703
What's going to happen outside of like information that is in front

1528
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,727
At this point

1529
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,055
Terms of Alex like

1530
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:57,663
How is tomorrow's news today when today's news is a direct contradiction of yesterday

1531
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,711
Yeah I don't understand how that works

1532
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,991
Today's news.

1533
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,551
S*** up yesterday so

1534
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:06,367
You're listening to him you should probably recognize that tomorrow is

1535
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:09,183
Probably going to be the time when you realize who's making s*** up today

1536
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,999
It's important to understand that this stuff

1537
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:15,071
About a fake invasion into lenski being a double agent is

1538
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,351
Rationalization

1539
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:20,959
I was just worried that this conflict is going to escalate and end up turning into a wider War

1540
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
And he knows that

1541
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,775
He's been way too public in his support for food

1542
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:27,359
Continue in Russia continues to a grass on their neighbors

1543
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:30,943
Alex's business model can survive being a media mouthpiece for the

1544
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,711
The enemy

1545
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,015
His twenties talkingshit

1546
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,551
Sounding like he knows everything

1547
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:40,159
It's not good when he's getting into Lord haha or straight-up father Coughlin territory

1548
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,999
This rationalization also helps out with pivot away from over

1549
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,023
Putin cheerleading

1550
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,815
Without having to accept the consequences

1551
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:53,727
If things do get worse he can say that after Putin wanted to Ukraine he stopped hearing Abad at that Ukraine was a false flag

1552
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,567
Where there wasn't even any fighting and the double agent president surrendered for money

1553
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:03,199
This allows Alex to avoid feeling bad about the people who died in The Invasion which he supported and promoted

1554
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,759
Because he's an emotional and intellectual coward

1555
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,295
That is what's going on

1556
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
Heartbreaking

1557
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,695
Not not for him to be no the real world

1558
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:16,255
Heartbreaker

1559
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,791
So like

1560
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,351
You read about

1561
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,143
America in 1930

1562
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:26,495
Haven't you read about how so many people were like

1563
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,031
It was great

1564
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,079
Taylor super cool

1565
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,383
Book I get why you don't like him but

1566
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:37,503
He's going to be calm down by the elements around him. They're going to moderate

1567
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,063
And it's like we're just doing it again

1568
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,111
And it's just so f******

1569
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:42,879
Sad

1570
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,951
It's really hard for me to assess what's going to happen

1571
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,231
In the

1572
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:51,327
The idea that this is going to necessarily spill into a World War

1573
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,119
Seems to me to be

1574
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,911
Getting ahead of ourselves a little bit

1575
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:58,495
That's the only thing that I'm pushing back on

1576
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:03,871
And I mean you know it's easy to say that any comparison to WWII is

1577
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:08,223
In totality but I am I am just describing the the amount of

1578
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
Propaganda in

1579
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,271
Support

1580
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,807
That is being pushed

1581
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,855
I don't disagree with

1582
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:16,415
That is very strange the

1583
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,207
The

1584
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:21,279
Seems fairly uniform among the

1585
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,327
Assertive higher-end of the Trump

1586
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,607
Propaganda

1587
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,655
Being on

1588
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,495
Is there Nazis

1589
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
Weird

1590
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,823
So I look this is all just fake

1591
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,687
And you'll never guess who he blames

1592
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,343
Are taking over

1593
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
All nuclear power plants

1594
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,231
And coal power plants

1595
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,279
And gas plants

1596
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,839
Amber taking Oliver

1597
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,631
Billings MT Airport

1598
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:04,543
It look like a bunch of young 18 year old Russian

1599
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,591
You're there aren't even special operation

1600
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,383
Countries around

1601
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,455
And no one's opposing I'm just this looks fake

1602
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,783
Well that's cuz it's all a big drill

1603
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:19,903
Military

1604
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,999
And so now

1605
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
We'll see what happens

1606
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,583
What are the Publix

1607
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
End up getting hung

1608
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:32,191
We'll see what goes on but this is all directly

1609
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,983
Because it was

1610
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,519
Baptist Western forces

1611
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,895
Are pregnant flight suits and all of their

1612
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,247
A complete

1613
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,271
Joke now

1614
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:51,647
It shouldn't surprise anyone that does loopback somehow to being the fault of the meddling sjws

1615
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,671
I want to such an

1616
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:59,071
Immediately so caught up in his own narratives that the literal invasion of a sovereign country has to somehow be related to

1617
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,607
Is bigot culture-war obsession

1618
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:07,519
It's really remarkable how little of substance he has to say and how much you were treats to these things he's completely making up

1619
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,543
Like the war is fake

1620
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,151
Muscle memory Big Al War memes that he makes money spreading

1621
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,431
Kitsap it's

1622
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,199
It's

1623
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:18,015
Pathetic I don't know any other words

1624
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,831
I mean Henry he should really

1625
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:24,927
The boss to give him a performance review

1626
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,511
I mean is that is that is an element that I have seen

1627
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,791
Repeatedly

1628
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:33,631
Come up that is an undercurrent of a lot of support for Russia on the

1629
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,655
Is that like

1630
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,447
We hate trans people too

1631
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,007
That I mean it's deep-set

1632
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,543
There's so many

1633
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,847
Little arguments of you better like

1634
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,151
And we got trans people and you're like what

1635
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:49,247
Remember what what are we f****** talking about is that it is that what you mean

1636
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,807
You need somebody to kill trans people for you

1637
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,831
That's what you want

1638
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,623
And it's f***** up

1639
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,927
It is so f***** up

1640
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
It is

1641
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:03,583
To be fair Alex also took a swipe at CR

1642
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:06,399
That one I think it is just that's just

1643
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:09,983
Sabonis I don't really know how to to say anything

1644
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,287
Other than what you're saying but it's just

1645
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:16,640
It is what it is it speaks for itself it really does

1646
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
Complete monster

1647
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,736
Alex has a new conspiracy

1648
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:24,576
A little bit later comes back from break and you got a new one

1649
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,112
Where Putin is mist

1650
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,648
Elated

1651
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,464
Is that they're going to

1652
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,488
Power off in areas

1653
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
You can bet

1654
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,328
Your ass on that

1655
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
Okay

1656
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,144
Default movie

1657
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,960
Volkswagen be blamed on the Russians

1658
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,728
Directions

1659
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,800
That looks like taking the bait to me

1660
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,592
I would not have done what

1661
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,408
People

1662
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,688
Taken from them

1663
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,480
Started with the Ukraine

1664
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,880
So here's the narrative up till this point

1665
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:04,256
Ukrainian military to stand down thanks to some involvement from the devil Asian

1666
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:07,328
President zelensky

1667
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:13,728
Right I guess that Ukraine is now in on the whole thing but the international Global is 2 still don't like Putin they're going to do

1668
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,520
Volkswagen where they cut off the power

1669
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:18,336
Maybe in Ukraine or something and blame Putin

1670
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,128
For reasons that I don't really

1671
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:25,248
Yeah I don't know what the game plan is here like the rest of the stuff Alex's things to believe

1672
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:28,064
I don't really know how this would be a meaningful part of the story

1673
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:33,440
It's not even clear storytelling and I think Alex is just throwing whatever the wall

1674
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:36,000
It does have that feeling of just like

1675
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:38,048
Okay and no I got a new thought

1676
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,096
Alright so that ignore the last

1677
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,144
Okay here's my new pitch

1678
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,216
Leggett it's got that writers room of like

1679
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:50,336
There's just a bunch of people throwing out ideas like is this something is this a good

1680
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:56,736
Suckered into this somehow but he also paid off the Ukrainian military

1681
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:03,392
Preparing to buy off of Ukrainian

1682
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,928
Military and now

1683
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:05,952
Send

1684
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,488
They're going to do false Flags

1685
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,280
To blame him

1686
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,328
So when the Ukrainian military fight

1687
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,096
Back

1688
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:16,704
It'll seem like they weren't paid off with Ukraine and Soros paid them off now

1689
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,264
The false flag

1690
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,312
Power Attack

1691
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,104
Ukraine

1692
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,128
I don't get what that achieve

1693
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:27,968
If they're outside of Ukraine like in the United States are United Kingdom

1694
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,064
I don't think you need to invade Ukraine to say that Russia did the

1695
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,160
No I don't think that's necessary piece of this donated

1696
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:39,744
It's I would if I were reading the screenplay

1697
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,536
I would ask for an edit

1698
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,560
I would ask

1699
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:45,120
Just go give another pass bright money

1700
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,656
Well I mean it does seem like

1701
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,472
I guess what he's trying

1702
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,496
2

1703
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,800
I think I guess he's trying to go back to

1704
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,592
The proxy ID against

1705
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:57,408
Read so Putin's paid off Ukraine and they're just going to take

1706
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,176
Price

1707
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
But then

1708
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,504
The EU doesn't want them to just take it

1709
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,272
Thesaurus

1710
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,624
So they are going to put Mala Flags in Ukraine

1711
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,392
Which gives

1712
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,952
Batman excuse to go into Ukraine

1713
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,488
To fight Putin

1714
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:16,096
Is that what he's trying to say if so that's such a long walk

1715
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:21,984
That's so crazy Joe like hey man you can attack here and then go go go go

1716
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,520
I don't know that's crazy

1717
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,288
Anyway

1718
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,568
Speaking of crazy

1719
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,848
Yeah we got to guess

1720
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:33,248
Except in the mix all God no it's not Steve

1721
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:36,064
Who else

1722
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:41,952
Steve's Steve might be too much in the in the gas if someone else

1723
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,488
Rodger Stone

1724
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,256
Grammar

1725
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,536
Trump advisor

1726
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
Always has been

1727
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
They talked quite

1728
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,936
Florida

1729
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:54,496
And he's got a lot to say about Russia

1730
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,568
January 6th in Rogers today

1731
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:04,224
Alex is great to be back with you well as we used to say when I was a correspondent for Infowars

1732
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,016
Tomorrow's news today

1733
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,040
We

1734
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,320
Predicted this

1735
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,368
A good 10 days ago that the

1736
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,440
Plancha war was inexorable

1737
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:17,792
This was as I am

1738
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:21,888
I don't know what Rodger might have been saying

1739
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,680
Absolutely did not call

1740
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
Wild

1741
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,728
This is

1742
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,288
Yeah that's a little bit offensive

1743
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:33,408
I just don't have you know that's it say it is a little bit maybe I'm a little jealous

1744
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,272
You know cuz I don't have that level of confidence in Psychopathic ability to just

1745
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,808
Declare that I did see

1746
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,368
Especially

1747
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,416
Even if I did something

1748
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:46,720
Well I'm terrible at being like

1749
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,488
Hey man

1750
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,352
That was all me and I would like all of the credit

1751
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
It's brash

1752
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,656
Baby Bowl

1753
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,936
Yeah got to get it

1754
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:59,008
Fortune favors

1755
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,128
So Alec Hamilton Rodger Ukraine news

1756
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,176
Rodger drops

1757
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:08,224
A piece of information that even Alex

1758
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,016
Has to be like wait hold on

1759
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,808
My job for this is wild

1760
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:17,440
Show all one thing that did bother me and that that was that we one of the

1761
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,464
Show called

1762
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,816
Where the Russians have already taken control

1763
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,352
They're starting to force

1764
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,632
People of the Jewish faith

1765
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,912
To register

1766
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,704
I don't like that

1767
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,336
Is there a pressure point that I read this morning

1768
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:37,664
Shortly before coming on I hope that it is

1769
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:44,320
I think Rodger is pretty out of line here if Alex had done a very out-of-character follow-up question

1770
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,136
I would have been allowed to Clement are as fact that Jewish

1771
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:50,208
People were being forced to register in one of the parts of the Dawn boss reach

1772
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:53,280
Because Alex asked if it was true which is

1773
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:59,680
Again bizarre for a baby it's not true kind of Defense

1774
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:04,032
Feel so conveniently doesn't say where this news report he got it from was

1775
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:07,104
So it could just maybe not even

1776
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:13,760
Since Rodger doesn't specify I'm left to speculate about what he's talking about in the best I can do is that in 2014

1777
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,320
There were Flyers that people found in East Ukraine

1778
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:19,648
It said Jewish people over 60 and had to register with the coma

1779
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:24,000
You were terrifying obviously but also they appear to have been a hoax

1780
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:29,120
With neither the Ukrainian or the pro-russian separatists I'd clearly being behind the distribution

1781
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:32,192
Some believe that it was possibly an extortion racket that sums

1782
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,728
Splinter groups of the separatist

1783
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,752
Trying to get going

1784
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,032
But it's hard to say for sure

1785
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:39,104
That said this was news from the last invasion

1786
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,384
But

1787
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:45,248
Who's the super serious allegation that Rogers just throwing around he's going to act like that

1788
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:50,368
He needs more to back it up in some random thing he may have heard that he doesn't even know if it's true or not

1789
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,184
I can't do standards

1790
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:58,304
Are too low he said he said that Russia is forcing Jewish people to Reggie

1791
01:26:58,816 --> 01:26:59,584
Is that what he said

1792
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:03,168
Or was he saying that Ukraine know he's saying that the rush

1793
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,960
Actions are going into a territory

1794
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,752
And saying that Jews must

1795
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:07,776
Register

1796
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,544
Right

1797
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,568
It's confusing

1798
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:14,432
I mean if that's what he say I feel like he's justifying a war against Russia

1799
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:15,968
Right

1800
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:20,320
Like you can't you can't also be like and it's cool that Jews are ready

1801
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,368
Maybe maybe it's

1802
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,392
Is it like

1803
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:27,232
Situation where he's assuming that Russia doesn't have

1804
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,536
Like control over damask

1805
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,352
And so maybe the ukrainians are doing

1806
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:37,216
I mean yeah along with the dean ossify kind of

1807
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,776
Idea that the rise in the just

1808
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:43,360
Location for the Declaration right but I mean it wouldn't make sense

1809
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:45,152
For them to do it now

1810
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,432
After the war has

1811
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,480
Let me tell you about

1812
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,576
No need no need to explain further

1813
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:56,672
Yeah I don't feel we get any other clarification on this because

1814
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:01,792
I always ask that follow-up question Cuts Rodger off at the retreat

1815
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,560
Because you can't

1816
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,584
Defend this position

1817
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,352
Absolutely

1818
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,632
So we don't get any more information

1819
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,424
Anyway

1820
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,984
Putin invaded a he's going for the whole country

1821
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,264
And

1822
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,592
Alex again refuses to accept that he fell for this s***

1823
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:21,248
Why Rodger Stones ride shotgun listen to the next Alabama have two hours of open phones at had

1824
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,040
Call Joseph Watson

1825
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:25,856
I'll be on the War Room

1826
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:30,208
Also huge

1827
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,488
Ukraine

1828
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:32,768
Putting that

1829
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,560
Amused

1830
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,888
I should do in war and it is now moving into the whole thing

1831
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,168
Use deception on

1832
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
You

1833
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,216
Hi

1834
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,240
He used

1835
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,520
Deception

1836
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:49,408
You well you know what sometimes this information is necessary for enemies ahead

1837
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:53,248
The deception

1838
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,648
Really work with much of the International Community so you're saying they worked with Alex and Tucker

1839
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
Alright

1840
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,952
Now that does make sense

1841
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,976
Yes

1842
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:10,400
Get off your f****** highfalutin horse gear with this deception stuff

1843
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,936
You have to then say

1844
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,216
Other people got it

1845
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:16,032
Well I got it wrong I'm glad you brought that up

1846
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:22,944
Brn a global conflict

1847
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,480
Helicopters

1848
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,016
Full-scale invasion

1849
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,928
People are broken or right twice a day

1850
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:36,256
Got to give it up

1851
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,304
Map got to give it up to the Somali Biden

1852
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,888
So now Alex

1853
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:44,448
Yeah fighting was right you know what he's now what do we do

1854
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,728
He was wrong

1855
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:51,104
What does raw well I think it's implied that if you admit Biden was right

1856
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:53,408
You have apologized for being wrong

1857
01:29:54,688 --> 01:30:00,832
Also the whole shot down helicopters thing would seem to contradict Alex's earlier point about the Ukrainian military just being paid off by

1858
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:05,696
I don't see him retracting that or correcting himself a wrestling with how he was wrong

1859
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:12,352
Like I also think you should take the realization that Biden was right a little harder than he is cuz it really hurt that

1860
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:18,752
Really hurts his whole thing I mean for just to be blase

1861
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,032
If I mean banana

1862
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,080
Jesus the devil

1863
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:25,920
He's literally working flower design

1864
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:32,576
Kikyo

1865
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:37,184
Junior cosmology Biden is working for the literal devil way down the flow chart

1866
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:37,952
Sure that's

1867
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,656
So Rodgers appearance can go fly a kite

1868
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:49,472
Quite honestly it's just the same as wants money

1869
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:57,664
And we can't fight if we are unarmed Financial

1870
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:00,992
Do people need to go to Stone defense fund,

1871
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:04,832
Adam Schiff in the January 6th

1872
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:07,392
Help me Sue Hillary Clinton and her retinue

1873
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:11,744
Alex Jones

1874
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,304
Join me in that class

1875
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,608
We have to do it

1876
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,400
Show defense fun.com

1877
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,168
Books

1878
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:19,936
T-shirts

1879
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,472
And more on your other side

1880
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:23,264
I'm thrilled for this not to happen

1881
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,800
Wow so f****** Petty

1882
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,848
Really sounds in Port

1883
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:27,872
And today doesn't it

1884
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:33,248
I'm going to sue Hillary, I've got a fake lawsuit

1885
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,552
You should give me money today

1886
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,832
So I can fake

1887
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,368
To Hillary Clinton

1888
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,160
Isaac Rogers taken

1889
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:44,512
Do this like lawsuit Griffith a little too

1890
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:45,792
Eagerly

1891
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:52,960
To thirst it doesn't come off well he cannot come up desperate the moment he comes off desperate his Misty

1892
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,008
Seek is punctured to the point where you like

1893
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,312
Oh you're a sad Petty old man aren't you

1894
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,080
With

1895
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:01,408
A tattoo of Richard Nixon on your bag

1896
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:03,200
I don't know weird

1897
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:07,296
Consulting fees paid by Foreign dictators

1898
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,600
Paying for his top hat

1899
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:16,000
He can't be coming to you and asking for money for a top hat

1900
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:18,560
With

1901
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:21,888
Crowdfunding you got to come up with

1902
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:27,008
You can't come down if you want to be a real information

1903
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:31,360
I'm sorry it did it is done to the people on the lower level

1904
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,896
The money Kongos up

1905
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,176
That's the

1906
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:36,224
The flowchart for Rogers ship

1907
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,528
So Alex has a meme

1908
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,320
Barbie memes

1909
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,344
Love memes

1910
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,648
Putting out on Twitter

1911
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,672
G m

1912
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,440
Everywhere in

1913
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,464
It's going viral

1914
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,768
I need to look it up

1915
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,584
The world economic forum

1916
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,704
Kris where the prime minister is a member of the world economic forum

1917
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,544
In Western Europe

1918
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,568
Except for Spain

1919
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:09,504
What does it mean to be a member of the world economic Forum as an individual

1920
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:14,880
Because it means you've gone and given a speech at one of the Davos conferences or that you've attended one

1921
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,696
Hello bar

1922
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,976
I don't I don't like

1923
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,512
It's not people on the board

1924
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:24,608
Alright

1925
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:27,936
But every

1926
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:30,752
Okay so all the people go to the world economic forum

1927
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,288
Obviously they can

1928
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,056
Become a member

1929
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,336
And if you choose

1930
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:39,968
About 10% of those who become members are taking to their underground brainwashing

1931
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:43,040
Sentara where they are hooked into a chair

1932
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:47,392
Enf on the temple w.w.

1933
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,672
That's bad

1934
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:58,912
No Electro neural what was no nevermind

1935
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,704
It's whatever

1936
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:01,728
But

1937
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:10,176
So this is just b******* that was posted on Twitter by former NHL player in current

1938
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,224
Conspiracy Peddler Theo Fleury

1939
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:16,064
If you recall he was one of the people who was originally pedaling the million

1940
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,648
Truck nonsense on Fox News in the lead-up to the Ottowa occupation

1941
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:24,768
And I guess that brand was lucrative for him so he's doubling down on the world economic Forum stuff right

1942
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:30,912
He posted a meme that wasn't even about Western European leaders but if people in the Canadian federal government who are quote

1943
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:34,496
Listed on world economic Forum. Org people

1944
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,032
That peaches blank

1945
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:40,128
It happened and all the captures in the way-back machine go back to 2016

1946
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:43,200
I'm not sure how anyone could even go about checking this list

1947
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:47,552
But even assuming that all the people he has on there attended Davos

1948
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,088
That proves nothing

1949
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:50,624
And it has nothing to do with Western Europe

1950
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:53,184
Also not to split hairs here neither

1951
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,208
But

1952
01:34:54,976 --> 01:35:01,120
Most people who have breakdowns of world regions they consider Spain and Portugal Portugal to be in southern Europe not in West

1953
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:07,264
It is a dummy metallic so I decided was groundbreaking he thought he should write a new story about it before

1954
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,800
Reporting on it this is dumb

1955
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,336
This is process this is what he does

1956
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:12,896
Tommy

1957
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:19,296
Former NFL player NHL player Theo Fleury

1958
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,856
Are you didn't you didn't pull up the stats no

1959
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,928
Do we have any do we have a card but here's a problem to with me

1960
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:31,328
I don't know anything about hockey and so like if I looked at his card it would probably be like

1961
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:36,960
Right I don't know what these stats are for a goal

1962
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:43,360
Icing is whenever you skate and then your likes

1963
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,664
And then you hit somebody in the face with some

1964
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,432
Is it really

1965
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,712
I don't know probably

1966
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:55,648
Maybe it's not see this is how little I know about whatever you pushed to get the puck out of there so you're

1967
01:35:55,904 --> 01:36:02,048
Defense and the offense is like and you're like out of here if you get it

1968
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:06,144
I'm a boy. So

1969
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,424
Alex's head

1970
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,960
What I would describe as

1971
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:12,544
Internally inconsistent narratives about Ukraine

1972
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,824
On the 24th

1973
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,872
Fly in

1974
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:18,688
Stark contrast to the nonsense he was doing

1975
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,224
Right at the beginning of the week

1976
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,296
Clip is where I believe he gives

1977
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,344
We're here

1978
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:29,184
Watching all this up.

1979
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,976
Watching this

1980
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,256
As it takes place

1981
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,048
And then we're told

1982
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,888
At the borders of Ukraine are the most holy thing in the world

1983
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,424
And that the Russian should

1984
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,192
Be there

1985
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,496
When

1986
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,776
The people controlling

1987
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,080
And running our country

1988
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,784
Sovereignty of our nation

1989
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,856
He's being erased in from the plan

1990
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:01,952
It isn't just

1991
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:03,744
The Border

1992
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Set the globalist

1993
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,792
You in

1994
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,584
Have told the third world to come here

1995
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,656
Here's a lockdown

1996
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,960
Cuz then flush them up here

1997
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:16,544
2B now political pawns a new permanent underclass

1998
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,080
Globalist

1999
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:21,152
Making us the third world world

2000
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,944
Permanently

2001
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:27,296
Use these masses of people they've been exploiting as an invasion

2002
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,064
Enforce

2003
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:32,928
You can see here that Alex essentially has nothing to say about the situation in Ukraine

2004
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,488
This is very clearly an attempt to shift the

2005
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:41,120
The focus into a subject matter that he's much more comfortable yelling about namely is racist great replaced

2006
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,704
This doesn't even marry response

2007
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,776
Because the situations he's describing art analogous and anyway

2008
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,544
Instead

2009
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,080
I'm playing this Calypso leap

2010
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,640
Need to demonstrate one of the ways that Alex's coverage work

2011
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:57,504
He's throwing so much s*** at the wall because he has no idea what's going on but

2012
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,552
He's still expected to be the guy who knows every

2013
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,344
This manifests

2014
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,696
First of the beginning of the week as his supposed deep wisdom about Russian history

2015
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,720
Handheld Putin

2016
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:10,048
So right that there's a need to defend Russian speakers and dumb boss

2017
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:14,400
Alex pouliot understand because he's an info Warrior

2018
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,960
Free market in prosperity for the people

2019
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,776
The kids and we can survive and thrive

2020
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,824
Falls Park

2021
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,128
Invade Ukraine so Alex needs a new story

2022
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:30,784
This largely takes the form of Alex make it not that there's no Ukrainian resistance and then Putin paid off Ukraine including the double

2023
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,064
President zelensky

2024
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:35,904
Alex knows that this isn't going to fly and by this point in the show

2025
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:40,000
I'm sure wanted is in terms of telling him that there's fighting and multiple locations around Ukraine

2026
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:43,072
Russian helicopters down

2027
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:48,960
That narrative isn't going to last but it was a first try to make a further conspiracy out of the situation

2028
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,728
But he could use them

2029
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:50,496
In the future

2030
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,520
Buying time

2031
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:54,080
With that failing he needs another distraction because

2032
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,616
Without distractions

2033
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:59,200
It's really too obvious that Ukraine is under attack and Alex reported

2034
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,480
Completely false information

2035
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:03,552
Tomatoes audience support the actions that led up to it

2036
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,880
The perfect distraction here is exactly what Alex is doing

2037
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:12,000
His arguments have failed his information is shown to be bulshit so the last Refugee really has has

2038
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,024
Just a point

2039
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:18,400
Racist brake replacement obsessions and say why should I care about their board or when we're not fighting to the front door border

2040
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,448
It's essentially a white flag

2041
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:22,752
The whole narrative building exercise here

2042
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:26,592
And maybe a white nationalist flag will be more appropriate in terms of this but

2043
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,384
Marvel white Hood

2044
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,712
Alex

2045
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:38,368
This indication of given up kind of even started earlier in the show where he was trying to say that acceptance of trans people in the United

2046
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,136
They've somehow LED

2047
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:39,904
Despite

2048
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,720
This is where his resignation is really crystal clear

2049
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:48,864
Maybe it was something more to say the later day or someone will feed him some information during commercial break but

2050
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,888
At this point

2051
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:51,168
This dude is done

2052
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,960
Hear this bed is done

2053
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:54,496
Yep please bake

2054
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,264
Yeah that's

2055
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,800
That's straight-up

2056
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:01,408
Like Pat Buchanan like 9/11 happened because we allowed gay marriage or whatever it is

2057
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,688
Does he know like it's it's

2058
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,480
Straight up that kind of

2059
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:11,136
F****** Pizza no more anchor to reality

2060
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,672
Is a punishment for us

2061
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:13,696
Caring about

2062
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:18,816
People that was that was sort of earlier in the episode a little bit of lash out

2063
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:24,192
Sitting here saying why do we care about Ukraine when our Southern border

2064
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:27,264
There flooding an invasion force of

2065
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,056
Third world population

2066
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,080
That's given

2067
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:31,616
Yeah that's that's

2068
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,152
Okay guess what

2069
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,224
All the s*** of the race of s*** that I yell about all the time

2070
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,272
That's more important than this

2071
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,552
Who cares

2072
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:43,904
You wouldn't do that if he actually had something good to work with

2073
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:48,256
It is the sign of somebody who has no f******

2074
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:51,840
You got to be in text from skousen

2075
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:52,864
During a break

2076
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:57,216
Here is here is a interesting mirror

2077
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,240
That I notice

2078
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:01,824
Early in the episode we talked about Monday

2079
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:04,896
Alex plays without interruption

2080
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:05,664
Putin

2081
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:06,944
He doesn't

2082
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:10,272
Cut in and then say like know what actually

2083
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,296
Anything nothing

2084
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:15,136
Instead he just listens reverently

2085
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,696
On this episode on the 24th

2086
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:19,232
Alex Goes

2087
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,768
Do a b

2088
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,120
Listen to his behavior and how it's a little bit different

2089
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:28,448
Imagine will be a little different even before it start

2090
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,520
We are back live cellular phone calls but fighting just start

2091
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:34,080
Please be patient colors I love you

2092
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:37,408
Maurissa and Virginia nobody else and I get Tina Mama Collette's

2093
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,480
Let's hear some abide that he can get his words from together

2094
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,248
Are Dash

2095
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:43,808
Sorry to keep

2096
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:47,904
Even before it starts he insults

2097
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:52,768
If you can get his words together grumpy old dum dum can even

2098
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,048
Speak words right

2099
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,072
The reverence

2100
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:59,936
That he showed of the respect that he showed for Putin isn't direct contrast most honest

2101
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:00,704
And

2102
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,728
Powerful man

2103
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
I've ever seen

2104
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:06,592
And only saying that after you've already formally cut off

2105
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:09,664
The speech you're not talking over him at all

2106
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,456
Here is

2107
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,736
How Alex babes

2108
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,504
Dirt bike

2109
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:16,576
This is a premeditated attack

2110
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,880
Vladimir Putin ism

2111
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:21,952
Planning this for months as I'm as we've been saying all along

2112
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:25,536
More than 175,000 troops

2113
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:29,888
Military coup

2114
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,984
Blood supplies in the position he'll Hospital

2115
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:39,104
Black lives matter burning all you need to know

2116
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,664
See this is what he does what

2117
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,224
Child was right

2118
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:44,992
About

2119
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:49,600
The situation that we're looking at right now I don't care about Ukraine because with more important

2120
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,624
Is Keystone

2121
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,160
Sure

2122
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:56,512
Am I guess it's just a position to buy performative

2123
01:42:56,768 --> 01:43:00,352
But it also leads to like what you described as a

2124
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,888
A bad

2125
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,424
Stand-up wrif

2126
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:05,472
But y'all know

2127
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,240
So much

2128
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,288
But he gets distracted until like

2129
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:11,360
You know what the problem with this is get out of here

2130
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:13,408
Like a bad Adam Carolla written

2131
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,968
It's unfolding largely as we predict

2132
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:30,560
Cyberattacks against Ukraine

2133
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:40,032
He's so desperate to say stuff over by 10 so you can't hear him that are being brought up

2134
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:46,432
Because they are threatening to because Russia is attacking with 175000 Troop

2135
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:52,320
Yeah I need sign language people

2136
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:54,112
Yeah you got them

2137
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:57,184
Battle that's what we need to deal with it

2138
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,512
Awesome

2139
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,048
So

2140
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,328
I mean

2141
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,864
This is this is

2142
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:07,168
The way he's behaving

2143
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:08,704
So different

2144
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:10,752
Between these two speeches

2145
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:11,520
Is

2146
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:13,824
It tells you all you really need to know

2147
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,360
It's absurd

2148
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:17,664
Two new show called

2149
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,432
Republic

2150
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:21,248
I'm Sovereign Ukrainian Church

2151
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:25,088
Snowboarders

2152
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:28,160
No USA at all

2153
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:31,488
We don't have borders

2154
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,536
Now sovereign

2155
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,560
Territory

2156
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,584
Which is part of Russia

2157
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,608
4000 years

2158
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,656
Continue wait hold on now

2159
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:43,008
I'm sorry you seem to be going back on some stuff because you want to yell

2160
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,544
Wow

2161
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,384
Airnow instantly were like I would take over Ukraine and also

2162
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:54,016
Hey hope the f****** breaks it what B was never chanting no Borders mobile.

2163
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:58,624
I would give anything for a president to be like borders are bad

2164
01:44:59,136 --> 01:44:59,904
That'd be great

2165
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:00,672
Yeah

2166
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:05,024
I think that Alex in much the same way that he'll say like

2167
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,328
George Bush was a liberal

2168
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:09,376
Or something like that

2169
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,912
He paints with such a

2170
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:12,448
Targeted

2171
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:16,288
Is so dumb with his definitions that he's like

2172
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:18,848
Oh yeah by Nano borders people

2173
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,896
Like right the f*** out of here

2174
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:24,992
Convinces himself basically YouTube

2175
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:26,016
Go back to being

2176
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:30,368
Just because he gets mad just goes by

2177
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,744
Chose this war

2178
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:40,864
On your doorstep

2179
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,144
How to say I'm going to live on your porch

2180
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,728
Machine gun

2181
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,264
It's actually true

2182
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:49,056
If you finally walked

2183
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,408
I mean I mean really

2184
01:45:57,248 --> 01:46:01,344
So you can see Alex's becoming more and more probe as siding

2185
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,136
Speaks because I went to politics

2186
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,160
His perspective

2187
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:06,976
It is anchored to anything other than opposition

2188
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:09,536
Is only coherent perspective is to be against

2189
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:12,096
The positions that are expressed by his imagined enemies

2190
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:15,936
Is giving a speech thing

2191
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:19,776
Alex esta tonight right go on his knee jerk when even after saying

2192
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:23,104
Earlier in the show that was right about this situation

2193
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,128
That

2194
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,944
Is taking the whole country

2195
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:30,528
Simple this is an emotional outbursts on Alex's Park

2196
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,344
He doesn't even really mean the things he's saying I don't think

2197
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:38,208
It's coming out of his mouth contradict earlier in the show but it doesn't matter

2198
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,768
It doesn't matter because the product is selling the audience

2199
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:43,328
Isn't analysis it's an emotional experience

2200
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:47,424
The emotional experience of pretending to yell down by

2201
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,728
And shut him down he would liar

2202
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:53,568
The emotional experience of pretending to know secret information that no one else has

2203
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,360
The emotional experience

2204
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:59,968
Being proven right even when all the things that are happening by the opposite of what you predict

2205
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:02,784
This is the emotional resonance

2206
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,344
Is enjoyable for Alex's audio

2207
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,368
Yeah and it's

2208
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,136
All

2209
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:09,184
The facade it doesn't mean anything

2210
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,256
Yeah I mean if what you're selling people is

2211
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:17,376
Secret special knowledge that makes them smarter than everybody else

2212
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:19,424
More powerful than everybody else

2213
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,960
And

2214
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:21,728
I mean

2215
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,008
Who cares what's real

2216
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:25,824
As long as you're providing

2217
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,616
The feeling of being

2218
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:32,224
Smarter than everybody else and if you feel it then it's real Advent it's that doesn't matter if you're not

2219
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:37,344
Holding anything I'd say It's Magic and I think that this next clip

2220
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,392
Biden speech

2221
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:41,440
Design fucus I can't listen to this a******

2222
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:44,256
Pretty quickly compared to the

2223
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:46,304
Such very long time he listen to

2224
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,120
You know isn't that such like

2225
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,656
You know that

2226
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,680
They'll never do it

2227
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:52,960
It's never going to happen

2228
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,496
This is so

2229
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:56,288
Such a simple moment of like

2230
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,104
You're going to listen to everything Putin says

2231
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,152
Even though Biden's right

2232
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:03,968
You're still going to side with Putin just because

2233
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:04,992
Just because

2234
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:11,648
Never not even this one time when I do know he's right

2235
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,976
I've said it not even this one time can I listen

2236
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:17,280
I can never do it without one

2237
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,304
Nope never

2238
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,072
Nope

2239
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,096
Not even one

2240
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:22,144
It's f****** w**** which you are against

2241
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,192
Theoretically he hates intervention

2242
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:27,264
Like you know everything

2243
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,032
Supposed to do

2244
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:28,800
The Clipper now

2245
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,080
It's

2246
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:31,616
Strange but not that strange

2247
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:33,920
Like this like this

2248
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:34,944
Healing verses

2249
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,480
Reality,

2250
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,760
Conflict

2251
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:41,088
I think is actually really indicative of that

2252
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:45,440
Alex has a little bit of a clip of Nancy Pelosi that

2253
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,976
Pics of such a slam dunk

2254
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,096
Where she saying a country

2255
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:55,936
In a whole different area of Europe is Ukraine

2256
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:56,704
Doesn't

2257
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,008
Even know the country of

2258
01:48:59,264 --> 01:48:59,776
Ukraine

2259
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,824
And she says a totally different country

2260
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:05,152
I'm at leadership of

2261
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:09,504
And you see hungry

2262
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:12,064
And you see how it is encircled Russia

2263
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,600
Belarus

2264
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,392
Crimea

2265
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,416
Batiste

2266
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,952
Have taken over butthead

2267
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:21,024
You know it's still a danger now to Ukraine

2268
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:24,608
And then you see Poland and Romania and all of us

2269
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,656
Just a budding

2270
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:29,216
Oh that's a Russian influence

2271
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:34,080
Hungry

2272
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:38,176
Sandwiches a liar and this clip is deceptively edited to make it sound like

2273
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:40,224
Pelosi thinks Ukraine is hungry

2274
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:43,296
YouTube This by cutting off what she had said just

2275
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:44,832
Prior to the eclipse starting

2276
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:45,856
Quote

2277
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:52,256
What was interesting was to see the heads of state with him we had interactions as well of countries who are newer member

2278
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:54,304
Members of NATO in the concerns that they have

2279
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:58,144
What's next for Putin if he were to be successful in Ukraine

2280
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:02,752
I had the privilege of sitting next to the president of Latvia for most of the plenary session

2281
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,800
And others have

2282
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:07,616
Others there were very concerned about what would be next

2283
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:10,944
When she mentions hungry as well as Poland in Romania

2284
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:16,832
Do reference in countries that were of concern to Nato members about states that could be in trouble with Russia took over Ukraine

2285
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:20,416
Alexander knows this new playing the clip deceptively or he

2286
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:22,464
He never even took the time to find contacts

2287
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:26,816
Is just desperate to play clip that seems to show someone he doesn't like misspeaking

2288
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:31,936
Which I guess is a huge win for the info War I mean that's the feeling he wants to spread this feeling of

2289
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:34,752
Nancy Pelosi doesn't even know what countries are what we got

2290
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:35,776
Yassi

2291
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:41,664
Look at this look at how smart you are and how stupid she is with the reality of it is

2292
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:42,944
Just a lie

2293
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:45,504
I mean it's not hard

2294
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,064
To come to the conclusion that if today if Putin

2295
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,088
Not stop

2296
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:49,856
He's going

2297
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:50,880
To do it again

2298
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:52,928
It is a very simple thing

2299
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:53,952
If he wasn't stopped

2300
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,488
From 2008

2301
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:02,144
Hey did Crimea Crimea he's does Ukraine has not stopped

2302
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:06,240
Hungry's in South America it borders Ukraine absolutely

2303
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:11,360
Anyway or van is worried about it the word real trouble there

2304
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:18,784
So Alex interviews a guy named Patrick Lancaster who's a

2305
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:20,320
We're journalists

2306
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:23,392
On the sea and in done by us

2307
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:26,208
And yeah

2308
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:27,744
I'm catching vibes

2309
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:30,816
I don't know what tone about him but I looked at them a little bit and

2310
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:33,120
Must be some very serious distrust

2311
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:36,448
His motives and history

2312
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:42,848
One of the things that I thought was a particular red-flag is he claims to be a crowdfunded journalist

2313
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:46,944
Makes $15 a month on patreon or something like that

2314
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:50,784
I don't know exactly where this crowdfunding is I looked

2315
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:51,552
It's a mother

2316
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:54,624
ESO PS4 support

2317
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,648
And

2318
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,416
I don't

2319
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:59,232
Okay

2320
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:03,328
Just cuz you have one rich backer and a bunch of very

2321
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:06,656
$1 givers does not mean it's not a

2322
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:08,192
Crowded some sense

2323
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:13,824
He doesn't really actually say anything that adds to real conversation

2324
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,104
Alex

2325
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,944
Assassin

2326
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:22,016
We'll see how this all got now we have

2327
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:26,368
And now you got class while we have the clip I want to go to calls

2328
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:27,904
Shore Club

2329
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:29,184
Last year

2330
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:31,232
Exist

2331
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,768
Jacquee's what this coming

2332
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,120
It's what makes it covid-19 look like nothing

2333
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,168
Power will be out

2334
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,240
Everything we're doing is around that

2335
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:44,544
Going to cut our power

2336
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,592
Joe Biden's and clips

2337
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:48,896
Last week this week

2338
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:49,664
Today

2339
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,480
Get some

2340
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:55,552
Like I said I think the Russians have been let into a trap

2341
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,344
What

2342
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:01,184
That's another lead into a trap

2343
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:06,048
Play possum I guess and said we're not going to attack

2344
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:09,632
So I guess maybe the the whole thing

2345
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:11,936
He was selling about it being fake

2346
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:12,704
Invasion

2347
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:14,496
Was just him talking s***

2348
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:18,592
It's abusive

2349
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:21,664
You know we go back to him anytime

2350
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,712
This is abusive you've said it that it is

2351
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,736
Is abusive

2352
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:26,272
This is so

2353
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:27,552
F****** abusive

2354
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:31,392
Furious that this is allowed to

2355
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:33,184
Even in one man

2356
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,744
Even if he wasn't on the Arrow

2357
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:42,144
Abused by the idea of somebody saying all this debate not to be around this person

2358
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,728
Yes

2359
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:48,032
It's it's that I mean like this

2360
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,312
It makes no sense

2361
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:52,384
Like included with the totality

2362
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:55,456
All these coverage over the course of the week let alone the day

2363
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,736
Yeah and it also doesn't

2364
01:53:57,248 --> 01:54:00,576
Obviously he plays that clip of course Rob and he's just saying that like it's

2365
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,368
Something to be concerned about

2366
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:05,952
And that if there were widespread cyber-attacks it could be something

2367
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,768
That would be more damaging Society

2368
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:10,560
Inboard disruptive then

2369
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:11,328
Covid lockdown

2370
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:15,936
A massive chunk of the power

2371
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:17,728
And then we're all five leave alone

2372
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:22,080
Like Russia doing it there's a lot of actors that could be there's a lock

2373
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:24,384
Potential vulnerabilities

2374
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:28,480
It interprets that is like Holly threatening to do this

2375
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:31,808
Whatever that's how I was his brain operates it's stupid

2376
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,344
Been over that a hundred times yeah

2377
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,392
Leaving that aside

2378
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,928
Like I mentioned earlier

2379
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,464
You don't need

2380
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,488
A

2381
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,560
The Lord in invasion of Ukraine

2382
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,328
2

2383
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:47,424
We like hey we got to be worried Russia might have a cyber-attack plan

2384
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:50,240
That is a completely unnecessary middle step

2385
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:54,848
Along the way it makes no sense for the larger storyline

2386
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:59,200
It's just I was trying to find ways to rationalize

2387
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:00,736
It has to be

2388
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:05,344
Anything other than the guy I said was the most honest guy in the world

2389
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:09,696
Lied to me and then started a war that only see one

2390
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:12,256
Cannot be

2391
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:15,072
That the guy I say is the truth teller

2392
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:20,960
Is lying and is not even a conquest her or anything like that

2393
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:21,728
Just a

2394
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:24,288
Plain old mass murderer

2395
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:27,872
That's it he's a criminal he's not even a powerful leader

2396
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:29,920
Let's not forget this

2397
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:32,224
The person who fell for that lie

2398
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:32,992
Was that

2399
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,808
Alex sold at

2400
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:37,600
Yeah

2401
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:38,624
So

2402
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:41,696
And he just doesn't want to recognize that he never wanted

2403
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:47,072
It is it is so much just like

2404
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,608
You know he lied

2405
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,376
Do you

2406
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:55,776
You know that like don't you feel offended by that a little don't you I would feel offended if the guy that I see

2407
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:56,544
Think it's honest

2408
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,336
Was lying to me the whole that I know that

2409
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:04,736
Steve is told him that Putin listen to Infowars he doesn't give a f*** about you and he lied about

2410
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:07,040
Never heard if you lie to you

2411
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:11,648
Does not care in such a way to make you lie to your audience

2412
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:13,952
You were manipulated

2413
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:17,536
By somebody who absolutely does not care about

2414
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:20,352
Just like you've been manipulated by Trump

2415
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:22,400
I'd like you've been manipulated B

2416
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,168
Steve

2417
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:26,496
You're just a f****** moron that's what Alex is

2418
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:27,264
Yep

2419
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:31,872
And we can see the kind of steaks that he's willing to be a mark

2420
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:32,640
About

2421
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:36,480
And then after the fact try and rationalize it with these bizarre stupid

2422
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:38,016
Conspiracies that he's making up

2423
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:41,344
It was just one cuz even Trump was like

2424
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,392
Hey

2425
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:46,208
Love the move of overthrowing Ukraine

2426
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:51,584
It wasn't like hello there's a dead excuse for why Putin my buddy is overthrow Ukraine he's just like

2427
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:57,984
Phuc yea killed I just saw the headlines about that I thought he was just saying that likes in 2014 it was genius what

2428
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:00,800
I don't know I didn't I didn't read the full thing

2429
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:01,824
I'm not sure

2430
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:05,920
But I also think happened under my watch

2431
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:07,968
Because it's also inside great

2432
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:09,248
Cool

2433
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:12,576
Yeah

2434
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,856
I'm interested to see

2435
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:15,904
See particularly what's going to happen

2436
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:16,672
When

2437
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:17,952
Galaxies have taco

2438
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:20,768
Yeah cuz that I think might have

2439
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:21,792
Some kind of

2440
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:24,096
I just feel like

2441
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:28,704
Literally everybody's waiting for Tucker to tell them how to feel is like

2442
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:30,240
F*** this

2443
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:31,264
Putin's right

2444
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,824
Everybody's going to be like yeah absolutely

2445
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:38,688
I've died

2446
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:40,736
I feel like I have no faith

2447
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,784
That Alex is going to have his own

2448
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,320
Like actual tape

2449
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:45,344
Baseball

2450
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,672
Based on this waffly nonsense like

2451
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:50,208
I don't think he has any

2452
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,000
He's not standing on Solid Ground

2453
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:55,072
And the kind of people that he could bring in to give him

2454
01:57:57,888 --> 01:58:00,448
No good you passes expiration date

2455
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:04,544
You have Joel skousen and he's not going to play ball

2456
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:09,920
I don't know what other kind of like legitimate geopolitical experts he has in the bullpen

2457
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:12,224
That could Calico Rogers no good

2458
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:15,552
You can't have a legitimate political expert

2459
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:17,088
It's not a possibility

2460
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,880
Because this is so cut-and-dry

2461
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:22,208
You know like this is Steve would help him

2462
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:23,232
Seafood helper

2463
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,280
You can't have Steve

2464
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,816
Christiwood Guru

2465
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:29,376
You don't know what Steve is going to help him with

2466
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:31,424
Yeah Steve cannot be a helper

2467
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:34,496
He's going to get you into the Hague

2468
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,080
You're going to

2469
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:40,128
Yeah

2470
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:46,528
Temperature might be too high for this s*** that's too bad

2471
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:47,296
Ivy

2472
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,600
As you can

2473
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,368
You can't

2474
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,648
Because I'm imagining

2475
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:54,976
Having fun with it

2476
01:58:55,232 --> 01:59:00,864
No circumstances it's disrespectful to

2477
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:03,936
Hopefully

2478
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:08,800
Hopefully

2479
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:12,640
Hopefully

2480
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,664
Hotmail

2481
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:24,416
Jordan

2482
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:26,720
I forgot to play this out of context drop

2483
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:32,096
At the beginning of the shower now

2484
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,960
Call somebody

2485
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:45,152
Yeah thank you that was a good note to end

2486
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:50,016

2487
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,064
