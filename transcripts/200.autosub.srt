123
00:08:54,527 --> 00:09:00,671
Especially when you track the the roots of it that were around from the Alexa system for a sound economy

124
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Before

125
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767

To know about this from the sources that we know he looks at

154
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
He's not mentioned it

155
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
So now as we get closer

00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751

165
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047

00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,631

167
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,703

168
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471

Recession coming out of

170
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,175
It rewards those losers

171
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
You know

172
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
The people who were scammed

173
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
Money was stolen from them

174
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599

179
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
Some Congress

180
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,991
I guess

181
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
K

182
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,215
Congress Critters is some call them

183
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,431
Hardcore criminals

184
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,831

185
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719

Disagree with criticism

188
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,591
Whenever the President addresses Congress

189
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,991
You don't stand up for many years

190
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
You wouldn't want that

191
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,023
I'm not just least of which but if you're not making some people angry

192
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,607

These things

196
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,407
Obama's doing something wrong by addressing Congress when it's not the state

197
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,503
As if it's only one

198
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,879
Only one man one would ever address numbers on

199
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,207
But the reality is it is a very common practice

200
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,559
February 27th 2001 George W bush

201
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
The Joint session of Congress

202
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
Sounds right after 9/11

203
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,775
On February 17th 1993 Bill Clinton

204
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,103
February 9th 90

205
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:40,223
Address The Joint session

206
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
For the first time

207
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
On February 18th

208
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,023
In 1977 until April 20th

209
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,167
Click until April 20th but it was not

210
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
Did 1973

211
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
A little busy

212
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
On March 19th

213
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,639
5 lb

214
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,175
The joint

215
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
The Joint session

216
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
The great impression

217
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,423
On May 16th on May 16th 1797 John Adams address

218
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,983
The Joint session

219
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
What's the deal

220
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,103
Typically in especially the first time a president Wednesday

221
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,687
Generally not if they get real first time

222
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
The General

223
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,015
Election day give a speech to the Joint session of Congress

224
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,807
About a month after being inaugurated

225
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
Is a very common practice

226
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,903
Especially in modern American political tradition

227
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
Oh and also on February 28th

228
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,047
2017 Donald Trump addressed The Joint session of Congress

229
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,863
It was not the State of the Union just the exact

230
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,423
Same formality speech that so many president

231
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,983
Tyrant Barack Obama

232
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Has given in the past

233
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,895
Very very tough and Alex should know that complaining about it making it seem like

234
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
It's on the weird

235
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,991
Means to me he doesn't understand American Civic

236
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,807
Reality

237
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
He complains about this probably throughout

238
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
A lot of this episode

239
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,079
You comes back to it over and over again

240
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
David gave a speech

241
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,431
This is an entire Apple

242
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,503
No it's

243
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
He brings it up with his gas

244
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
But he has on it

245
00:15:54,111 --> 00:16:00,255
It sort of something that he's really trying to make a make a eagle out of

246
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
Alex is going to in a mood

247
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,447
You get the caller that asked him about secession

248
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
He addresses the issue of secession

249
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
Of the states

250
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,175
And I don't know if he does a great job

251
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,975
I am

252
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
Hypocritical

253
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
I am not

254
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031
Secession

255
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Okay

256
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,087
Merged with

257
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,631
Declaring their inherent sovereignty

258
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
It was a state

259
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,847
Not real

260
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:29,855
Let the feds come in here

261
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,695
Is there job

262
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,255
Created the Federal

263
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,327
Government that's why

264
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,167
35 States

265
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
Well I think you just

266
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
Summed it up appropriately

267
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,607
If you have 35 States you decide to abolish the Federal

268
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
Then the federal government has two weeks

269
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
To get out it's like

270
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,287
I'm glad you started it by saying let me be clear

271
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151
Crystal Clear lyrics

272
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Let me be clear

273
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,503
I do but I don't

274
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,903
That would be a last-ditch effort if it's federal government was doing everything is currently doing right now

275
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,959
Exactly

276
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,103
Emergency

277
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,431
In favor of

278
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,735
You don't want

279
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,719
Over the idea that

280
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:19,167
Also

281
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,799
Principality

282
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Feudal City

283
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:30,431
Countries with the governor is

284
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,831
Authority in the land

285
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,927
I don't like that vision of the future

286
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Like that vision

287
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
The pest

288
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,119
Here we go

289
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
Finally

290
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
On February 25th

291
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
Yeah after

292
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
Copious amount of

293
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
Looking

294
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
Please finally signed

295
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
Cool not Alex

296
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,943
Holly Susan Illinois go ahead

297
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Hi Susan

298
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,647
Well I've been awake for about 3 months

299
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,511
Betrayed

300
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
And I

301
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,911
But with that I wanted to remind or tell everybody to go to

302
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Nationwide

303
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
Chicago Tea Party.com

304
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
I don't know if you've heard of it but there is

305
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,359
You know a nationwide tea party happening about 35 cities

306
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
People protesting

307
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,199
I'm really encouraged about that

308
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,527
So unfortunately at this point you like what you think

309
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,183
Alex goes off on answering questions

310
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,535
He gets lost in his own world of like

311
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,191
Yeah yeah we still have we still have ratzinger

312
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,079
And so I only know that because someone requested that I go to

313
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,151
To the day that

314
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,783
And David night was hosting

315
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,855
The Pogues

316
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
Is no longer

317
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Hope

318
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
This is not been

319
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Seems in

320
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Other popes

321
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
Enough

322
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
Leo zagami

323
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,800
All right. That's that's not a good impression

324
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
Roll today

325
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
Where to eat

326
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Circle

327
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
Question about the Tea Party

328
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,648
And we can see where his head is at but before that

329
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,560
YouTube

330
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:58,144
He wants you to f*** with your priest a little bit

331
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
I keep forgetting

332
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
Alex's whole thing is like

333
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
The government's trying to can

334
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:32,448
Trolls he's the preacher is a 501 c 3

335
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
I'm very simple solution

336
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,016
Really don't understand why they don't pay tax

337
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,160
Jim Bakker

338
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,488
Except

339
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
These weird

340
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
Broadcast

341
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,120
Because it's a religious

342
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
Yeah you could do that

343
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
That's the only thing

344
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
Just cuz you believe in something

345
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
I really don't think you should be

346
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
Tax exempt

347
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,736
I feel like that's what sounds terrible thrust

348
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,552
Unpack I do

349
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Religion isn't real

350
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,696
Don't necessarily want

351
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,976
Texas

352
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
Churches to be

353
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
Not tax-exempt

354
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
Because there are a lot of

355
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Good thing

356
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
Getting paid for

357
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
In terms of like soup kitchen

358
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Staffing like

359
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,568
Helping the poor

360
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:48,224
Complicated tax code even more

361
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Look

362
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,600
Ivory religion I'm fine with making their lives harder

363
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,160
The idea of churches being taxed

364
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,280
If you want to preach Patriots stuff or even if you want to

365
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,840
Democratic talking points from the pulpit

366
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
Your Scientology

367
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Pay your f****** tax

368
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
Simple Solutions

369
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,688
Praise for whatever their Rabbi other Imam

370
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,232
I want to help

371
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,560
Suspicious

372
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Sounds right

373
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,664
Imallexx are you encouraged about the

374
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
Tea Party

375
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
On Friday

376
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Friday the 27th

377
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,112
You know I heard something about folks having their own protest

378
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,536
Just getting on the streets

379
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,608
Muscles

380
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,960
Is just awesome Susan I appreciate your call

381
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
Alex has no idea what's going on

382
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,312
He doesn't know about the Tea Party

383
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,104
Because I I don't I don't believe

384
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,664
I don't think you can play anything close to the vest

385
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,480
If he does know about it

386
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,296
On board at the point already

387
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,672
He be going nonstop he wouldn't be able to fame

388
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:37,024
Lack of awareness

389
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
The sympathetic caller

390
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,608
Talking about these

391
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:47,008
It seems to be like maybe he's heard about it

392
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,592
Tickets to the plant for sure I'll probably

393
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
I think we all know

394
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
I've been awake for three months

395
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
Legos five

396
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
But be that as it may

397
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
I wrote down

398
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
Okay

399
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
You're probably right

400
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Alex probably

401
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
Got wrecked

402
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,256
Walk by Alex Jones radio

403
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,560
Maybe I don't know or saw a link

404
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,264
You know or she was paid by every radio station

405
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,080
Give them

406
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,432
Multiple times and website

407
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,992
Like a lot of radio stations have fake collars

408
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:37,952
Yeah

409
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
Using the platform

410
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Get something else out

411
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
We seen that a million

412
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,376
Clear dictionary

413
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
Suspicious

414
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,056
Little weird mode complain about Obama bunch more but before he does

415
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Astarte's

416
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Think about it

417
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
Of course

418
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176
He's got to talk about

419
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
Yeah

420
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
Week

421
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,352
Cool and your father

422
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
Eat what you want it's what you get

423
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,032
This is what they want

424
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
Everybody

425
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
This is what

426
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:34,528
YouTube that I bet you can just like this is what they want this is what they do

427
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
Trevor nuclear war

428
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,256
Girlfriend

429
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,096
The Warriors

430
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:54,496
Wall-E Droid

431
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,920
Apartments

432
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,992
This is

433
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:12,928
This is what they give you are.

434
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
They hate you serve them

435
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,888
Afraid of you

436
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,968
9

437
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
I love that

438
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,264
How do I get to the new address

439
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
Springs

440
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
Depleted uranium

441
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,664
Whatever

442
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,248
Can you spray it first

443
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,392
Not sure all right

444
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
I've looked into Chemtrails enough to know that

445
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,768
But I don't think that's one of the weirdest conspiracy

446
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,888
I don't think it's depleted uranium you know it's crazy though

447
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:39,712
It's moments like that make me wonder if this show would work

448
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,760
So much better if Alex had a co-host

449
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:48,416
You know to bounce the movie

450
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,488
The other guy can come into be like where I live

451
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:56,352
Whatever the f***

452
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
The problem is it whenever Alex has anybody

453
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Subordinate

454
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,344
There's no way he could adjust

455
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
Free

456
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
Existing respect for life

457
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Mike Adams

458
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
I think he could

459
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
Have the authority

460
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
2

461
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,240
Time travel

462
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
We're going to book

463
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
We're talking

464
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,104
Major League era Charlie Sheen

465
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Sossaman

466
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:47,808
He could have used Victory not sure that Charlie would want that

467
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,208
We would never have had Two and a Half Men

468
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:58,816
Would have had to deal with it

469
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632
The second one

470
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
A lot of other stuff we wouldn't have

471
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,712
My friend Alex

472
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,856
It is a continuation of all of his state senators and state representatives

473
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,440
Is an Oklahoma

474
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,000
I believe might have been a rap by the name of Rick

475
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,632
That's the most Oklahoma state senator named you could ever have.

476
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,936
This guy is not cool

477
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,312
Most of his career is just like Tenth Amendment

478
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
Things like that

479
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,224
He was created by the Dare program

480
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
What do you mean

481
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
Keep kids off drugs

482
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
Another agenda

483
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Andre

484
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,048
Big more recent pad

485
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,840
He's shown a bit of his

486
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
Is wild

487
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,656
Is Wild Feathers

488
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,008
I'm using the wrong now we're trying to get colloquialisms in here

489
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,384
Call Brock

490
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
Call executive director

491
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
Gerber Oklahoma

492
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,528
DC Ryan Young Band

493
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,904
Stop be too upsetting except

494
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
After Ryan was

495
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,352
Domestic assault and battery in the presence of a minor child

496
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,424
As well as interference with an emergency telephone call

497
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,728
Rajan said Ryan was being quote Drive

498
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,544
Through the mud at those critical of him quote should not be

499
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
Casting the first stone

500
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
The ironic part of that is Broad

501
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,808
That guy was arrested for dragging his wife through the mud literally

502
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,344
Police reports

503
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,696
Specific

504
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
It is

505
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:12,448
So I also I'll just tell you right now he is really punching up

506
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,032
I will just tell you right now this man here he's

507
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,616
Baseball real hard at a person

508
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
Call Leticia

509
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
Has the Oklahoma Republican Party

510
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,880
Call disgrace

511
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,976
Party became a little uncomfortable

512
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,048
Puppy party Facebook account

513
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,352
Defeating animals in national parks

514
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,656
Cool

515
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:46,752
Cool coco coir

516
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,336
During a debate about this

517
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:56,736
Oklahoma Legislature

518
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Real Racing

519
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:11,072
Hilarious parody of racism

520
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,144
Using your race so racist

521
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,264
You mean by that

522
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:23,616
Is the snap program

523
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
Do that

524
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:30,784
Watermelon

525
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,648
So I can confirm this from the site I looked at those

526
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
Apologize

527
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,304
Ballsy on both the

528
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,632
I'm on the

529
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
You said it

530
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:52,288
So apologize already support

531
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:57,408
Reflected on how help Implement legislation

532
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,432
The required

533
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,712
Seeking abortions

534
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,272
Ultrasounds of heart monitors of

535
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,856
In fact tempting to terrorize women into keeping unwanted

536
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
He lamented

537
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,440
Not ended abortion in Oklahoma

538
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,256
And repented for his sins unless the pro-life camp

539
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,168
Sing there's a

540
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:24,032
What do you like to call an abortion

541
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:29,152
Seeking

542
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
So yeah

543
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,160
No women

544
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,488
Which is cool great

545
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:49,120
Also in April 2018 came out that Randy Brogden was the executive director of a super

546
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
Free states

547
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:55,008
We could at least $24,000 into the gubernatorial campaign

548
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
The pastor

549
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Fisher

550
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:01,920
Fisher is also an abortion abolitionist

551
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,968
Making his first order of business

552
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,320
Outlaw abortion acceptable to women in Oklahoma

553
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,880
Sounds like you probably drag someone

554
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:16,768
Also feature is known to preach at his church

555
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:23,168
Which looks exactly it looks exactly

556
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,752
It looks exactly

557
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,848
He's trying to bring back what she calls the black Rogue

558
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:37,248
Regiment which was a group of creatures in the Revolutionary War era

559
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
The British

560
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,136
There's literally nothing exactly that

561
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
Just pay your taxes

562
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,208
So you could do that

563
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,024
But no problem

564
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Muster up

565
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,400
$25,000 to give to monsters campaign

566
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,680
Boyd Texas

567
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,544
Given Brockton and Fishers

568
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,872
The fact that Brogden endorse

569
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
Fisher

570
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
State representative

571
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
2012

572
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,968
The fact that their friend

573
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,624
It's unrealistic to think that they didn't coordinate a little very serious FEC vie

574
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Violation

575
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,976
Probably not worth looking into those until we got 7.9% of the vote

576
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,512
Republican primary

577
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
What a waste

578
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,912
Never going to never going to get that 20 for Grand back I could use that

579
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
24 G

580
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,752
Brockton

581
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
Support

582
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:38,688
Anyway that's a little bit of fun about this I don't want to listen to most of his

583
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Because it's very similar to

584
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:46,880
Other 10th Amendment

585
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,160
Alex

586
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,464
Complaining more about Obama's speech

587
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,840
Quite quite escaping review

588
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
It was probably one of those sophomore

589
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,240
I've ever heard in my life

590
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,520
Parrot

591
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,824
To the Constitution if you compare it

592
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,872
Founders of this great nation

593
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
Alright

594
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
What are we talk

595
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Grammar

596
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,880
Whatever

597
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,928
This speech is nothing

598
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,976
The founder

599
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
Seems like you're setting the bar

600
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,864
You know what I'm going to be honest with you

601
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,144
The Constitution

602
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
Benefits news

603
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,568
Siri doesn't bring out the emotion like the Declaration of Independence

604
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,384
Maybe you can toss that in there that would have been a great speech

605
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
Come on man

606
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:46,784
Those amendments are boring or a little dry nothing much going on

607
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,856
No

608
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,512
It's a sophomoric

609
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,328
Just stop

610
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
What about

611
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
Compared to an Oscar speech

612
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,448
How about that

613
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
Another guest

614
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,128
Was the guy named William William

615
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
No

616
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
Like a little too much

617
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,136
Because you sort of new to our scope

618
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
Embarrassed

619
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
Who is this guy

620
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,512
Political and economic

621
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,304
Are they

622
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:38,496
Engelsman published released 2014

623
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,568
What's the foreign propaganda front we encountered a couple episodes

624
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,872
Which is run by the Russian Academy of Sciences

625
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:50,528
He's published almost exclusively anti US stories than many that followed the exact line the Russia puts out about

626
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,880
Including this headline quotes Soros

627
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,416
Kiev Central Banker

628
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:01,280
Even wrote an article in 2015 titled quote why I wept at the Russian parade

629
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
Here's an excerpt

630
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:07,680
My tears that's being the silent Marchers and Putin amid them was

631
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,728
Conscious reaction to What on reflection

632
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,544
I realized with my very personal sense of recognition

633
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,848
How remote from Anythink

634
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
Comparable in my own country

635
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
The United States of America

636
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
Such a memorial March

637
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
In peace and serenity would be

638
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,088
Oh boy

639
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,904
Pretty indicative of his

640
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
Strongly

641
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:40,448
The government's stuff lot of Ice Age

642
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
Muscle pain

643
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,664
Like late. Robert F Kennedy and still be like

644
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,224
He was

647
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,256
Articles from new Eastern Outlook

648
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,328
Partnership representative

649
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:13,728
Effort

Publication

651
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,544
At least 26

652
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:21,408
Important works for the center for research on globalization

653
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,224
The canada-based think-tank Run by Miguel

654

Bosch

655
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,528
Dopeski

656
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,624
In 2017 the center for research on globalization with

657
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Communication

658
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,488
Which is where their information Warfare Special

659
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,792
As a website

660
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,840
Icky accelerant

661
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,912
And helping popularize articles with little basis

662
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
In fact

663
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,496
Also happened to fit the narrative being pushed by the

664
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,568
They further described it as quote a link in the

665
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,336
Concerted

666
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:56,735
Effort to undermine The credibility of mainstream Western media as well as we North American and European Publix

667
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
Government Republicans

Rite Aid careers

669
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
Just a laundry list

670
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,671
Working a conspiracy Outlets

671
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,439
Russian

672
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
In other words

673
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
He is a

674
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,583
Very normal Healthcare

675
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,679
Do you think do you think he's like a

676
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
Listen

677
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,519
Whittier writer just

678
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:25,151
So maybe he just answered answered an ad or something like that.

679
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:31,551
Do you think he's just a jobber do you think if somebody boris's list

680
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:36,671
Somebody within the American government

681
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,999
What are you just jump over and be like cool America's the best

682
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,047
I don't know no I don't think so

683
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:47,935
I would assume not cried at a military parade

684
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,727
Like its contact

685
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,823
Early early

686
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
Career Test

687
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
That's a no

688
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,783
Probably not

689
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:11,487
It would have to be very difficult to buy a lot of them now because there's too much traffic

690
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
A lot of money

691
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,655
And foundational moment

692
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:23,007
Could use to pay that the writer

693
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:29,407
You still need to have some sore

694
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,735
Had a little speech by dr. Like right after all

695
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,063
When are we welcome him back with open arms

696
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,111
Do

697
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,671
Here is Alex talking to F William

698
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
Stock predictions that did not come to pass

699
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
And then

700
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
So something hours shooting

701
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,911
Because

702
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:57,567
New York

703
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
In the last 3 years

704
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,175
And corporate lawyers

705
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,903
My 2010

706
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,535
The islands of Caribbean islands

707
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,799
Certain places in certain point there's no place to hide

708
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
Affects everybody

709
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
We can't live on another planet

710
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
Yeah

711
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,879
No I I I read you

712
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:49,023
I think they realize that they're going to be some very very angry citizens were going to wake up and say wait a minute

713
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,583
How did

714
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,655
The head of Citibank accumulated a billion dollars

715
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:59,519
President of a bank

716
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,799
He pushed on

717
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:06,431
People who couldn't even write their own name but we're told they would get a dream house if they just put an x on a piece of paper

718
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,991
Regulation

719
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,855
The other part of

720
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,695
Speed switches that we rise up and murder them and their readouts

721
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
Mustafa people

722
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,631
I see much more on the left

723
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
Yeah

724
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,239
Except for the fact

725
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,615
Right right

726
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,455
Prediction United States

727
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
Months 10 months

728
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:46,623
But there's a black president

729
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,903
Betfair

730
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,719
From their viewpoint

731
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,423
Like to see like I was probably coloring a lot of their opinion

732
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
Episode

733
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,543
Fried Chicken was going to be mandatory

734
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,967
Affordable Care Act

735
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,783
Now that just feel emboldened or empowered

736
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:21,183
Talk like they're racist all the time like I texted everybody

737
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,487
The birth because you don't hear stories about like

738
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:30,143
Not like you don't hear anything about state representatives unless you lived in Oklahoma you might have

739
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
That's right

740
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,007
Every single Alex Jones

741
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,055
He has all the 10th Amendment

742
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,079
Raps

743
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
Come on

744
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,735
Yep

745
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,527
You do that

746
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
It's been just as awful

747
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,911
It's the one that's going on now

748
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:13,407
This reminds me of s*** that my dad my family would say where it's

749
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
Okay well

750
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,735
Would you

751
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,759
Vote for this guy

752
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,319
He's clearly an obviously a rapist

753
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,367
They be like now I just wouldn't vote

754
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
So is like

755
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,231
Possibly allow him

756
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,327
To be Governor could wash your hands of it as opposed to actually stop it

757
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,679
A knot before being elected there's some sort of corollary there

758
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:41,823
It's almost like that kind of thinking contributed to the rise of the Nazis

759
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,127
It's almost like there's a

760
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,943
On the right side

761
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,343
Just feel like doing nothing

762
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Crazy

763
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:58,719
So you don't want to you don't want another Governor but you don't

764
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,535
Want to stop at nothing from being governor

765
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:07,167
Governor

766
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:13,055
What's there but what stopped

767
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:16,127
Florida I'm sure they'll make the right

768
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,687
Sojourn

769
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,087
I don't think he realizes how much

770
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
You could be talking to his

771
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
Yourself

772
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
I believe that

773
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
Very precious

774
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
About something

775
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,607
This clip made me like

776
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,655
Are absorbed

777
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,679
So enjoy

778
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,807
Just snowed

779
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,367
That's the most important thing

780
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:09,119
Just been suckered

781
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,823
And you're going to have to experience this mail

782
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,991
This is the bankers having your way with

783
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,743
Direct

784

Proto at pivot

785
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,655
That the wrong just know you did this to yourself

786
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,447
Alex right now

787
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,335
You did this to yourself that was jarring

788
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,223
You think you're one of the protected

789
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:02,623
You think Trump is going to stop you from getting kicked off Facebook

790
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,415
Everything you've been suckered in by

791
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,975
Vista Global spring Washington

792
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,511
Propaganda

793
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:15,679
Over his life about the globalist

794
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,447
And you're complicit

795
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:20,543
To a certain extent

796
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,567
And repent

797
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
Cuz that is what life is all about

798
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,151
I don't think that's

799
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:27,967
Turn yourself around

800
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,503
I thought it was

801
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,463
Jordan

802
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,839
We need 30 more policy wonks and then we can rent the biggest bounce house

803
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,935
George removing all to the 26th

804
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
February

805
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:54,591
We're going to answer a little bit of an Oklahoma City situation

806
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
But

807
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,431
This next clip is one of the things that

808
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:06,367
Stupid stupid her for another

809
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,903
And I August

810
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:14,815
Majority of u.s. states joined sovereignty movement amendment rights

811
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:22,751
495 Oklahoma City

812
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,287
Salute

813
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,175
Absolutely

814
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:39,135
Eric Holder

815
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:43,231
Eric Holder did Oklahoma City

816
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,839
You know

817
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
No

818
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,679
Like contrary position

819
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,471
And it's up to him to prove it

820
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,007
You're like these specific thing

821
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
Narrative

822
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,919
He's overarching things that Alex talks about Oklahoma City or

823
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,991
He'll use like they'll just say I have a false flag

824
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,551
They blew up the building Eric Holder

825
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,111
Is complicit in it he was using Volvo

826
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,903
I can't do anything with

827
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
I can only do something with

828
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
Pacific Power

829
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,767
Pieces that he's going to bring out

830
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
And so

831
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,631
I'm not going to sit here and go through literally every

832
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,167
Piece of information

833
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,959
Could be involved in Alex's

834
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:29,823
Possible conspiracy theory about Oklahoma I can't do bunk

835
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,847
This nonsense

836
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:37,247
Did you see that on the Eric Holder was photographed walking out of the Oklahoma City

837
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,551
Rebuilding someone else

838
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,415
Then let's this other bit of evidence

839
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,231
I didn't doesn't necessarily correlate but

840
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:51,839
Did you see that Eric Holder was walking out of The Book Depository

841
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,911
On 11th.

842
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:01,055
The problem for me

843
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
Sure

844
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,639
The time traveling

845
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,991
Jumping-off

846
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,807
The only reason I bring this is like

847
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,855
Trying to find out what he's talking

848
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,879
Sing about

849
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,463
It leads me on wild goose chase

850
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:23,071
Because I end up trying to look into what he's talked about and I find like

851
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,887
And then I go down this path

852
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,519
Savannah

853
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,823
And then I end up spending seven hours

854
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,103
Reading bulshit

855
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,431
May or may not be talkin about

856
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,503
So we had that one time we talked about Oklahoma City

857
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
The police office

858
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,135
Suicide from Survivor

859
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,815
Grabill

860
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,583
Pacifica

861
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,191
Implying that Eric Holder was involved isn't good enough

862
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,615
Because I'm going down f****** wild-goose chases about his nonsense

863
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:11,711
I love that I love that rhetorical technique is as well

864
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
Guarantee

865
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,527
That the government

866
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,855
That's it it was the government we can prove

867
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:22,975
And you know who was the librarian at the time

868
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,023
His eyes go to Siri exactly

869
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,839
Anybody who might have been an office is involved

870
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,375
That's WeChat

871
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,679
The other thing I need to bring up

872
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,959
Is it I did a disservice

873
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
Restore audio

874
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:38,335
And I only realized it after going down all these f****** stupid road

875
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,151
So

876
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,199
I mentioned that Alex

877
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:43,967
DHHS

878
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,735
Report

879
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,295
That they were concerned

880
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,903
This is an unfortunate incident

881
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,695
Where I took Alex

882
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,535
I didn't look into what you was talkin

883
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,095
King about

884
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,191
What else to talk about

885
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,471
Department of Homeland Security

886
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:06,751
It is a

887
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,567
TSA that they put out or a video that they put out

888
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,847
That has a

889
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,127
Bunch of people

890
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,735
Advising people

891
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:22,111
There's things afoot

892
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,159
In terms of being eyes and ears

893
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:27,487
Which I'm slightly uncomfortable with play understand why

894
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,767
Society would be like

895
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
Hey

896
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:34,143
Or I don't know what we do if you see something say something

897
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,423
Sing

898
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:38,239
They aren't

899
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,287
Alex watch the man

900
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
Alex watch the video

901
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
And you thought

902
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Huh

903
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,199
Too many white people terrorists in this video

904
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,991
It's not that they

905
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:55,391
Are you commissioned a report or anything like nobody did a s*** ton of research there's no speak only

906
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,695
He's a video watch where he sought

907
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,975
On his own

908
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,255
Objective basis

909
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
So

910
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,423
It made me realize that a lot of these

911
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,727
Timezone Alex's bringing up a colonel

912
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,543
It doesn't exist

913
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
It's in his head

914
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,359
It's just his subjects

915
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,895
Give experience of the world is

916
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
The ghs

917
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,503
Do you think that

918
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,807
Because of your experience of watching this video

919
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:38,143
I can't remember specifically

920
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:43,007
Women wearing these are like 16

921
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
Nobody

922
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,055
Sexualizing

923
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,431
Realized

924
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,503
So nobody is insisting that these people are saying that

925
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:56,319
All whites are terrorists other than Alex

926
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,087
Who's like

927
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,695
Well yeah I mean all whites are terrorists

928
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,999
He's appealing to the authority of his

929
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,303
Watching that

930
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:10,399
And that's a really troubling thing that I realized

931
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,215
About this world

932
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,287
I can't study

933
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,407
Until he reveals on the show

934
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
If so

935
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,039
It's just it's weird

936
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,599
It's really weird to have this year's in

937
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,903
This colonel

938
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,183
Long ago

939
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:33,951
CID

940
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:37,791
Resources might be ramping up

941
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,815
Something you thought

942
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,607
Yeah I'm at

943
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:41,887
Not good

944
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,423
What's even more concerning

945
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:49,567
Is that the reason that neither of us were even considering looking into it is because we were both immediately like

946
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,103
Oh yeah that's

947
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:55,455
Yeah even exist

948
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,479
I could see it

949
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01,599
Interested in looking into it specifically is that like

950
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,159
Level I kind of

951
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:04,927
Just assume

952
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,279
I mean even if you do

953
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,327
Consider the idea of like

954
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,863
Rising right-wing

955
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
The militia

956
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,703
The Patriot movement

957
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,727
Fooled into that

958
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,031
Environmental

959
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,335
Rat and large

960
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,407
If you include those.

961
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,455
It would make sense

962
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,479
For people who were trying to

963
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:33,087
Keep an eye out for terrorism

964
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,111
Or paper

965
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,135
What

966
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
I'm just

967
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,279
Something like that I don't think

968
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,047
Oh this is

969
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,655
You're misrepresenting Something problems

970
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,727
Yeah it's it's always been so secondary

971
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,751
Two things that

972
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,823
Did I've never saw fit to actually like

973
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,615
Buckledown finds the

974
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,967
Based on his

975
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,735
Rhetoric

976
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,759
Boots Justin

977
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:04,831
Well the other thing that makes it obvious

978
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,367
They're just more white

979
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:18,399
A lot of murders in Chicago but statistically that's

980
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:24,799
Who's most likely to kidnap a child

981
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,711
Simple statistics

982
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,927
Blew up Oklahoma City

983
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,487
I could sit here and give you all the evidence

984
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
Of all us he like

985
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,071
Timestamp

986
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:47,839
Bills

987
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,959
Look up watch a f****** documentary

988
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,727
We're looking

989
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,263
Because everything I could

990
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,591
Re-strengthen

991
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
Basically the

992
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,431
Of the Oklahoma City

993
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,295
They're been

994
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087
Every

995
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,111
Piece of

996
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,415
Stop.

997
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
Is flimsy

998
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,719
Everything is circle

999
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:19,583
There's not much to it until like

1000
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,143
Do the f****** text bride to tell you

1001
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,679
Here's exactly what happened

1002
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:30,079
Went through the legal system do you know who is Kennedy attorney general at the time

1003
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
No is Eric Holder

1004
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,967
So I can't I can't do s*** with that we'll see if he eventually comes up

1005
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,623
Before

1006
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,927
To talk about how much you love guns

1007
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,463
I have you don't

1008
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,255
You are basically

1009
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,279
Housefly

1010
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,727
Oh man

1011
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:08,735
Great

1012
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:15,903
But vaguely

1013
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:20,255
The United States

1014
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:28,447
Exhaust slave

1015
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,983
The slaves got a weapon

1016
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,975
I see articles

1017
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,815
Woman calls 911

1018
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:09,663
Somebody starts bus into my house

1019
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,135
Discharged

1020
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,743
That's not good

1021
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:29,887
I'm not sure that Kelly would be

1022
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,447
I don't think that you would be

1023
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,751
Chill shooting somebody

1024
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:38,591
Exactly

1025
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:42,687
Calmly aim at the center of mass and discharge

1026
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,527
F***** up even more f***** up live

1027
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:50,111
Explains what

1028
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,279
Open fire

1029
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,839
Open fire

1030
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,887
He's doing that voice

1031
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
Voice that he does

1032
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:10,335
Grabagun

1033
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,431
Oh my God people who have gum

1034
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455
Now

1035
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:20,575
That's not good that's a bad way to think about life it's not all of the people who have done

1036
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,647
Free consistent within people who love

1037
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,439
You know that sort of

1038
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:30,303
Like I want a reason to use my gun to kill a person

1039
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,863
That's probably

1040
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,191
That give me a reason to kill a human

1041
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,239
Like

1042
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,079
Like a robot Grabagun

1043
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,383
That don't answer the description

1044
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:48,223
Robot

1045
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:54,623
No longer has a thief or other human

1046
01:03:55,647 --> 01:04:01,279
Like a good person and definitely not at all like what I imagine a serial killer

1047
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,303
Beep bop boop

1048
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,095
Boom boom boom

1049
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:07,167
A robot would actually be more

1050
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,639
RoboCop

1051
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,943
He doesn't aim for Center Mass I'll tell you that right now

1052
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Jordan

1053
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,015
This next clip

1054
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:25,087
Start literally right after Alex said

1055
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,255
Yeah

1056
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:39,423
After he said that he is fine with killing a human being he then says something f***

1057
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
Connected I don't

1058
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,055
It is a play

1059
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,103
It's a jarring jump

1060
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,087
What

1061
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,647
What is that is it look like

1062
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:17,055
No it's totally normal you can't

1063
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,663
That's a good idea

1064
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,727
Bad trip

1065
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:59,551
Imbalances in an aggression hormones flood

1066
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,135
Well

1067
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,159
Being

1068
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:10,303
Closed-minded is nonsensical as well

1069
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,423
If you're coming in with like

1070
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,471
Affects the serotonin

1071
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,775
Butter system

1072
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
The class of

1073
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,311
Drugs

1074
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,591
CO2 serotonin

1075
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,895
Apple invented that right that's Siri

1076
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:26,943
Hooters

1077
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
The drug

1078
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,479
Not a part of

1079
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
Your brain

1080
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,807
Do you think he's just

1081
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,599
Grasping at straws trying to

1082
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,135
Demonize the idea of cycle

1083
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,439
And s*** like that

1084
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,999
Really bad

1085
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:46,399
Really smart if you're a person with paranoid schizophrenia medication

1086
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,287
Kind of true

1087
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:57,151
If I took care of myself I would not believe in these apparitions I call globalist

1088
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:02,527
Probably true I don't know if

1089
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
Like an active

1090
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
He must know

1091
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,903
If he advocated wellbeing

1092
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,927
For his listeners

1093
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,719
And advocated for them speaking

1094
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,535
The help they actually knew they would often drift

1095
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:16,607
Better about life they would under

1096
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
1st and

1097
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,423
Guys just try to make me

1098
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:25,055
Scared all the time

1099
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:29,407
That's that's kind of a

1100
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,943
Mannequins with our time

1101
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,247
Manic demagoguery

1102
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,671
Just because we're so

1103
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,951
Pro

1104
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,719
Medication

1105
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
I think we should

1106
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
Not everybody

1107
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,519
I don't I don't believe in a world where everyone must be

1108
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,311
Diagnosed and put on a

1109
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,079
Regimen

1110
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:58,847
But I do

1111
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,199
It's probably good idea

1112
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,783
Well we do now

1113
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,135
We don't do s*** like this where he scares people

1114
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,159
With terrible prediction

1115
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,975
You're just a lister's of his show

1116
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,151
But we only

1117
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
PetSmart

1118
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,183
He already said America's probably not going to exist in 2010 with 10 months

1119
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,999
Maybe a year from now we had another big one coming

1120
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,047
So

1121
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,911
It's usually wrong

1122
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:06,431
Stevia probiotic yogurt

1123
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:12,831
That I'm going to go with a lot of the health benefits to those are over-exaggerated

1124
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:17,951
Love it

1125
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,487
Take probiotics

1126
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
Biotics

1127
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,559
I used to drink

1128
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,095
Liquid yogurt

1129
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
This is me

1130
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,455
Hello yogurt shot

1131
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,783
Terrible that sounds disgusting

1132
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:46,367
So

1133
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:52,767
I just went all-in on Greek yogurt

1134
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,327
What happened at my name in it

1135
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,935
Tonality I LifeStraw

1136
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,335
From textbooks

1137
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
As I did

1138
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,639
In element

1139
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,455
High School

1140
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,271
But I would like to point out that Alex

1141
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,039
Different version

1142
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,063
Afterworld

1143
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,367
Little bit differently

1144
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:25,279
Three different textbooks

1145
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,423
Second Amendment

1146
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,639
There's a bunch of textbooks

1147
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,431
The government

1148
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
The song

1149
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:58,559
Time Magazine

1150
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,119
Your parents are backwards

1151
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:11,359
What is science fiction nightmare dystopia

1152
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,431
The cup is clip for this Alex

1153
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,711
Highlights for kids

1154
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,087
Goofus and Gallant

1155
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,903
What's

1156
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:28,511
Close to reality

1157
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:33,887
Except for the Goofus and Gallant reference now that I think about it there's no way that he's he's on that tip

1158
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,775
But I have

1159
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,567
Has a plan by the globalist

1160
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,871
Change the minds of

1161
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,639
Kids

1162
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,687
Textbooks and

1163
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:52,575
Time magazine for children I didn't know there was a Time magazine for children

1164
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,343
But

1165
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,111
That's not the

1166
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,951
Cuz they don't give a s***

1167
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,799
Child

1168
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,175
Is always

1169
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:22,015
Richard

1170
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:32,767
Couldn't come over

1171
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,399
That's all you got

1172
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,167
Yep

1173
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,335
Wait there was a town drunk

1174
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:52,735
Yeah it's Andy Griffith

1175
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:56,319
Sleeping it off in walk-up

1176
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:13,471
And then of course The Lovable Town drug who's always in prison

1177
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:19,871
Call jail I apologize at all

1178
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:26,271
Now there was Aaron

1179
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:32,671
Come down on them

1180
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,535
Is the problem

1181
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
F****** way there's

1182
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:44,703
Population was minuscule

1183
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,519
Drunk all the time

1184
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,919
Crazy recidivism is a real problem

1185
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
Wild

1186
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,479
What time is part of this route

1187
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:59,039
How much is it

1188
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,063
Depiction of drunks

1189
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,343
Should be like Winos

1190
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,879
And stuff like that where they

1191
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,927
It was

1192
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,535
Who cares

1193
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:14,911
But the best the best depiction of that time was always the the drunk

1194
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:17,727
Who is on like the the sidewalk

1195
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,263
Just holding a brown bag

1196
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:22,335
And then something crazy happens and he turns and looked at it

1197
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,615
He looks at me like

1198
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:36,159
Happen all the time

1199
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,695
Cuz that was like a classic

1200
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,463
Comedy

1201
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,487
Houston

1202
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:46,911
Fabolous Rosa Baca

1203
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,567
Hold on

1204
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:57,663
Betty White

1205
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:00,735
Haven't you ever seen The Good Wife I don't know why that

1206
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,015
That was a weird Paul

1207
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:05,599
Not positive face on the cliff

1208
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:13,023
Time magazine for kids and textbooks are traded

1209
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,655
Probably

1210
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,191
You know

1211
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,495
Politician

1212
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
And one

1213
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
Only

1214
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,847
Is Ron Paul Wright

1215
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,871
Caller calls

1216
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,711
Clowning and Duncan on these global

1217
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,503
Alex has an interesting

1218
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
And then I have

1219
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,647
What I want to see from

1220
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,951
Ron Paul

1221
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
Next time he has

1222
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,743
Bernanke

1223
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,535
I mentioned this before

1224
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,583
Why can't you just start embarrass

1225
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,399
People in automated system

1226
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,447
Any reason

1227
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,495
Still listening to the globalist

1228
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,519
Is because

1229
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,543
Globalist

1230
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,311
Still have this

1231
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:00,127
We have to call them out

1232
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:04,479
Criminal

1233
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:15,487
There's too much of a gentleman

1234
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
Gore

1235
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,375
No

1236
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:22,911
New

1237
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:23,935
You were not at 1

1238
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:32,127
It's really funny that Alex is alleging the Ron Paul is too much of a gentleman to call out the globalist

1239
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:37,503
We've already discussed this very definitely self author

1240
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
StoryBots

1241
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,927
Even more exciting in the 1980s

1242
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:45,951
Jordan

1243
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:46,975
Story

1244
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,023
It's something you've never heard I'm certain

1245
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:49,791
Okay

1246
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,607
This is one of the greatest things I think I've ever read

1247
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,143
That's not

1248
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,727
Alright on April 27th

1249
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,775
1981

1250
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:10,015
Nobu Nobu

1251
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,439
Who are suspiciously

1252
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,511
A bunch of dynamite in a Nazi flag

1253
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:28,191
These men had planned to meet up with a hastily thrown together militia and overthrow the government of the island nation Dominica

1254
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,007
In hopes of setting up a white supremacist

1255
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:31,775
What

1256
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:38,687
The guy who created I just a regular old racist website

1257
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:44,063
333

1258
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,879
Yeah

1259
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:53,791
Weird way to look at it but

1260
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,839
Broadway

1261
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,703
So yeah I had a plan

1262
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,751
To perform a coup

1263
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,799
You better and take over

1264
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:07,615
Really

1265
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:11,967
Yep the 1981

1266
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:19,647
Is really think highly of themselves again he got arrested surprised by that

1267
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,415
I can't stress

1268
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:23,487
It was 90 they were going to

1269
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:26,815
Get on this boat and then meet up with

1270
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:32,703
They were going to beat up with

1271
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:38,847
Perform the coup

1272
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,687
So

1273
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:48,575
Originally secured a captain to take them back out in February

1274
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,671
1

1275
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:59,071
Conspirators Klan member Mike Perdue found a new captain operation

1276
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:02,911
You are smart

1277
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:06,495
Who put some countermeasures into action

1278
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:16,479
Put down the phone and then immediately

1279
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:24,671
Install is the new prime minister in Dominica

1280
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,951
Patrick

1281
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,975
Was erected

1282
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,743
In Dominica

1283
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:30,815
Those are

1284
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:42,591
Naturally the ATF blankets and towels crew and arrest everyone

1285
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:49,759
Also naturally wants Mike Perdue got arrested he started squealing on everyone

1286
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,575
Start trying to cut it video

1287
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:59,999
Both personally aware of the plan

1288
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:02,815
As was revealed governor of Texas John Connally

1289
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:07,679
What is a catered three men is financiers of the adventure one of them

1290
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,215
Kirkpatrick suicide

1291
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,263
Before he was due to appear in court

1292
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:14,080
John black as mentioned would go on to create storms

1293
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:18,944
He would also go on to aggressively campaign for Ron Paul anytime he was up for election

1294
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,552
Particularly in his Direction

1295
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:30,208
David could also be a very loud supporter of Ron Paul's presidential effort

1296
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,840
Decline to subpoena Ron Paul and

1297
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,120
Conspirators trial

1298
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:42,240
A pictures about anything that I am absolutely

1299
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,776
And may have been involved

1300
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:51,200
There's so many people who were connected to him who were involved

1301
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:54,272
Definitely

1302
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,064
Yeah Ron Paul

1303
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,880
Other people

1304
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,160
You said were involved

1305
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,696
One of them killed himself

1306
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:09,632
The other two

1307
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:17,056
Probably were involved subpoena Ron Paul

1308
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:21,152
Really feel like you should have subpoenaed

1309
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,432
Governor of Texas

1310
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,224
Suspiciously

1311
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,064
The conspirators who ended up being found guilty or pleading guilty

1312
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:32,160
3 years in court wonder why really

1313
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,976
Really feel like I really feel like

1314
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:39,584
Planning and attempting to commit a cool should get more than 3 years

1315
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,424
Well the guy

1316
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,448
But that's because

1317
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,752
Mikey was here

1318
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,776
Yeah

1319
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,128
Are you are you telling me

1320
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,200
I could Charter a plane

1321
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:58,272
With like let's say what are they got made

1322
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,040

And then just fly to a ran and be like we're going to take over this b****

1326
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:26,432
Yeah it's tough

1327
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,992
Champaign Illinois with 60 guys

1328
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,552
Yeah

1329
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:37,184
Logistics

Guys

1331
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:42,816
This is a

1332
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:43,840
Really bad idea

1333
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,776
Call UCF

1334
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,384
It's the sort of thing that I think you could make

1335
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,920
Oh really good

1336
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:03,296
Dark comedy about

1337
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:08,416
Because the story is hilarious

1338
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,952
Hasn't never

1339
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:15,840
He's never made a statement about Italy

1340
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,608
He was

1341
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,424
It's crazy

1342
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:23,520
What's the wind

1343
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,592
You just

1344
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:33,248
You secretly aware involved in helping us to ask a question about how old white supremacist

1345
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,624
Ron Paul keeps his hands

1346
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,928
You'll have people like John Black

1347
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:45,280
People like he's playing members were involved spreading the word on the low

1348
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:47,584
Anyway that's not provable

1349
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,632
He was part of it

1350
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,912
Keith back in what's up

1351
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,680
Shrek

1352
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,960
You can put that rhetoric out in

1353
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:53,728
Publix

1354
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,056
Publicly disqualified from ever being an office

1355
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:03,456
DaVita paper trail

1356
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,248
Well that's true

1357
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:10,368
He wasn't one of the finance

1358
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,744
Okay well

1359
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,144
Money orders untraceable money orders and

1360
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,704
Like with manafort there's definitely that like

1361
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:30,080
The worst thing that happened to manafort was Trump won because otherwise nobody would have looked into it

1362
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,152
Well yeah but they know

1363
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,432
Yaks

1364
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,976
Ron Paul tried to overthrow Dominica

1365
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,536
Ron Paul will be elected president of Dometic

1366
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,728
Yes

1367
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,008
So

1368
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,080
Alex has representative Charles

1369
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:02,848
Keanu

1370
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,688
Isaiah

1371
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:07,968
Francis

1372
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,736
Scott Key

1373
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,528
The guy who wrote

1374
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:13,088
Which is

1375
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,280
Yeah that sounds great

1376
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,584
Third cousin

1377
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,120
Not what

1378
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:30,752
Exactly exactly he is a state representative from Oklahoma

1379
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,848
Deep dive on him

1380
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:39,200
The Oklahoma City bombing

1381
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,480
This is sort of

1382
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,528
Charles

1383
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,064
Cheese bread and butter

1384
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,344
Oklahoma City

1385
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,880
Conspiracy theorists

1386
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:47,904
95

1387
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,280
This is

1388
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:58,912
These problems examples and

1389
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:03,520
Oklahoma City Bombing case has a very good one. Thank God for Jesse credited people like him

1390
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:07,872
What going to keep fighting this thing a dick born where

1391
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,944
But there's more than enough evidence for the people to see the

1392
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,248
Their government is out of control

1393
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,320
So this is where we can go

1394
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,880
Because I've heard the name Jesse Trent

1395
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:19,904
You brought up

1396
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:24,000
Some of the wild goose chase

1397
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
From Alex's

1398
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:29,888
Like let's see what he's talking about

1399
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,472
Fun to say

1400
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,496
That is fun

1401
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:37,568
Detective Charles Keith bring him up as likes

1402
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,104
Somebody who's been doing

1403
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,808
So we finally have like a climbing the rock we got ahold

1404
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:49,856
Little X

1405
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,624
Super Inn

1406
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,672
Because here's

1407
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,976
Jessie Trice do is a

1408
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:59,840
Utah-based lawyer whose brother Kenneth was probably murdered by the police in Oklahoma

1409
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:04,704
The official Declaration was that it was a suicide believe that evidence shows

1410
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,240
The official version of the story isn't

1411
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:11,616
To get Justice for his brother that is light him to become a

1412
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,408
My hero for the militia and Patriot

1413
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:20,576
Without becoming a hero to the militia Community believe that

1414
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:24,416
Crossroads in your life

1415
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,280
It very much looks like Jesse trentadue has a good point

1416
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,840
That killed his brother.

1417
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:35,424
I think he has a good point unfortunately leads to a really bad

1418
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:38,496
After reviewing the evidence I have very little reason

1419
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,520
Dial Jesse

1420
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,312
Was murdered by the police

1421
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,640
They're massive inconsistent season we all

1422
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,944
We're pretty well-versed in the idea of police brutality

1423
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:50,784
It's kind of

1424
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:56,928
The idea that he might have killed himself I recognized a certain possibility to it I would say too much less

1425
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,976
It's likely based on the evidence then

1426
01:27:59,232 --> 01:27:59,744
He was murdered

1427
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:05,120
Because there were like ligature marks on his on his arm from

1428
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,168
The probably wouldn't be there

1429
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
Struggling

1430
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,264
Third wound to his face

1431
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,032
Don't

1432
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:12,800
Inconsistent

1433
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
Hang himself

1434
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,592
Cell

1435
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,384
Unless there's some sort of

1436
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,664
Unreported

1437
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,712
In the prison like us

1438
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:22,528
Spiky got into debt

1439
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:25,344
So he was killed in

1440
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,112
Oh

1441
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:34,816
Impossible for me to know like based on things that I've looked in

1442
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,400
But I would be pretty comfortable

1443
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,424
85%

1444
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,496
I think that there's a good

1445
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:43,520
Good champ

1446
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,568
Now the reason that I think was a shift

1447
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,896
And some of those

1448
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:50,176
Wounds were from

1449
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,480
Him struggling while he was alive with him

1450
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,504
Cops

1451
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,528
I have

1452
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,832
Lasted after

1453
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:00,928
Could have gotten ft prison and then hung himself

1454
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,208
He was a heroin addict

1455
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,000
A lifelong Criminal

1456
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,072
So like the idea of it possible

1457
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:08,864
This point

1458
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,144
Despondent

1459
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,216
I think there's a small possibility

1460
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,520
Much more likely based on the evidence

1461
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,616
He probably did

1462
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,896
Which I think is f***** up

1463
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:25,248
The argument that this has something to do with the Oklahoma City bombing

1464
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,576
Seems to have something to do with the fact that the government was resistant

1465
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,344
Investigate

1466
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,440
The County Medical Examiner became frustrated

1467
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,488
You couldn't get together to look at the

1468
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,024
So you tempted to get the

1469
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,304
Oklahoma City

1470
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:40,864
The Peace of their

1471
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:43,936
In reality they didn't want to get involved

1472
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:46,752
I went because it was unrelated

1473
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:49,056
But the perception is

1474
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,848
The two crimes were connected

1475
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:53,408
In fact they wouldn't deal with it on that g

1476
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:55,968
Is evidence that they were trying to shut it down

1477
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,504
Now I believe

1478
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,552
Again it's 8

1479
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:03,392
Very important that I make clear where I agree with this guy and where I jump

1480
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:06,464
There's probably a cover-up

1481
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:09,024
I don't think it's a vault Oklahoma

1482
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,048
Back

1483
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:10,816
Crazy

1484
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,120
It is this corner

1485
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:17,472
Her know what was it

1486
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,264
Was just like

1487
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,056
Nobody's paying attention to me

1488
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,872
Toss this in with the OKC

1489
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:31,296
That's what I gather that's what I gathered from an interview with the medical examiner

1490
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:36,416
Really feel like you can't just do that

1491
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:42,816
Now if I ever heard one

1492
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,584
Resistance

1493
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,936
It's exactly what would happen if the cops killed

1494
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:48,960
Exactly

1495
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,008
Like

1496
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,312
Awful

1497
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,592
But it doesn't

1498
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:57,664
Necessarily better than that to prove to me

1499
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:02,528
That this is somehow involved Oklahoma

1500
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,296
Same time

1501
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,832
It doesn't necessarily mean

1502
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,112
But they're connected

1503
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,904
I have a bit of empathy

1504
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,184
Ford

1505
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,976
Even though he's a f****** Criminal

1506
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,304
Even though he's someone who got himself back in prison

1507
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,864
If that is what happened

1508
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,680
I still have some empathy about that

1509
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,472
Jessie

1510
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:26,080
Trying to find out the truth

1511
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,152
It is

1512
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,944
Very much like

1513
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:37,088
There's a Crossroads there's a One path the other path kind of situation

1514
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:40,160
Either I can become a crusader for good

1515
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:44,512
I can believe that it's part of the Oklahoma City bombing

1516
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:45,280
Now

1517
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,584
Beyond all the stuff that I've already mention

1518
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,888
Du's argument hinges on

1519
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,168
Anonymous phone call

1520
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,192
Video

1521
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:55,520
He's received told him that his brother's death was involved with the bombing

1522
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:58,080
Including one from Timothy McVeigh

1523
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,640
According to

1524
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,408
Trentadue

1525
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,712
The theory is that the feds

1526
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:06,784
Confused do with Richard Lee Guthrie

1527
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:11,392
The creator of the white supremacist in Neo-Nazi group Republican Army

1528
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:15,488
23isBack

1529
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,792
Between 1994 and 1996

1530
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,584
In order to thunder terrorist

1531
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,888
He was inspired by the Turner Diaries

1532
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,424
Just like Timothy McVeigh

1533
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,472
Elohim City

1534
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:26,240
Just like 10

1535
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,568
Witnesses of Elijah did Guthrie and his members

1536
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,104
Republican Army

1537
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,408
Use the funds that they stole from those 22 back

1538
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,480
To pay for Timothy mcveigh's expenses and putting together his attack

1539
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,040
There are unsubstantiated

1540
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,064
But alleged

1541
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,344
Connections between them

1542
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,624
And Associates

1543
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,904
Richard Lee Guthrie

1544
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,928
Had I been

1545
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,976
Placed at like

1546
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,768
The Timothy McVeigh was at

1547
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,304
Prior to

1548
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,072
The attack

1549
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:55,936
I can see why that, a wrote bank robber movie

1550
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,544
You know Robin Hood

1551
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,848
Bank robber sorry that we always

1552
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,384
See over and over again

1553
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,992
Bank robber story

1554
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,320
I don't think that was going to be famous

1555
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:15,392
Schedule

1556
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,184
What is a nugget

1557
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:23,584
What

1558
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,168
Most of it hinged on the fact that they

1559
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:30,752
Mostly targeted small-town Midwestern Bank

1560
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:31,520
Security

1561
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,288
And didn't

1562
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,848
Easy A

1563
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,920
It would be close to the highway

1564
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,968
Would be

1565
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,992
Because you get in

1566
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,272
Get on the interstate

1567
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:43,808
And generally speaking

1568
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,832
Harder to catch

1569
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:56,352
Like as long as we kept it till like 2 or 3 years ago

1570
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,144
So the technology of

1571
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:01,728
Surveillance

1572
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:10,944
Around in order to

1573
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:14,016
That's a good plan related to Kenneth

1574
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,320
Two things come up

1575
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:17,344
First

1576
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,136
Kenneth allegedly looked a lot like

1577
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,160
Shirley Godfrey

1578
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:23,232
2nd Timothy the rap sheet that included

1579
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,024
Which is the reason he was in Costco

1580
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,048
In the first place

1581
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,608
He refused to conform to the terms of his probation

1582
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,960
Not that part

1583
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:35,520
He told me he wasn't going to stop drink

1584
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:38,848
King Boos so there was no reason for him to come in for drug screen

1585
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:41,408
Is there anything like that

1586
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,688
Right cuz he's going to be

1587
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:43,712
Caught

1588
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:53,440
And so he just stopped going in for piss test

1589
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,976
Which weather condition of his parole

1590
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,048
He also hit in laws in Mexico

1591
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,352
And right before he was wrapped

1592
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,912
Country

1593
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,960
Sentence probation

1594
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,032
Is the argument just were

1595
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:12,896
Drawing of Guthrie out in the world as John Doe number two

1596
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:13,664
Yeah

1597
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,968
Handprint to do look a lot like

1598
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,064
Then I think you have a theory that makes the

1599
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:23,392
I don't believe it

1600
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,440
It's not proven in any way

1601
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:28,000
But there aren't any glaring problem

1602
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,536
However

1603
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:32,096
Jesse trying to do his narrative is far more,

1604
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:36,960
He believes that Waco Ruby Ridge in Oklahoma City are all part of the federal government attempt

1605
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:40,032
Disrupt Patriot organizations

1606
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,568
It's a part of an operation

1607
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:44,128
Or the Patriot conspiracy

1608
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:48,224
Because he involves this as part of his

1609
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,832
San Diego

1610
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,672
Because he involves as a part of his argument everything falls apart

1611
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:59,488
If popcorn is real which I'm not sure it is I don't

1612
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:04,096
Then the feds know they were looking for in John Doe number 2

1613
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,912
They knew they would be looking for Richard

1614
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:10,240
But probably didn't want the public to know how they lose

1615
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,080
Surveillance

1616
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:18,432
Putting out this app

1617
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,456
Maybe on a person

1618
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:21,760
They were looking for because of

1619
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:22,528
The Patriot

1620
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,808
Conspiracy Network

1621
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,624
Putting out to the right and just

1622
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,184
After Shield that from public awareness

1623
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,744
But if that's the

1624
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,280
It follows

1625
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:35,072
That they would know.

1626
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,120
What

1627
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:39,168
Given the fact that trying to do

1628
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,472
Violation

1629
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:43,264
Beautiful raps

1630
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:49,152
They would know that

1631
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,688
If the rest of Jessie

1632
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,480
Narrative

1633
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,552
Going on this Crusade is true

1634
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,344
It always self-contradictory

1635
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,136
It doesn't work together

1636
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,160
It's impossible

1637
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,720
Display

1638
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,768
The story is really really sad

1639
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,072
And you can't help it at besides of Jessie

1640
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,400
Here's a man who had his brother most likely murdered by the police

1641
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:13,216
And always try for years to get some modicum of just

1642
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:14,752
This estate is not allowed enclosure

1643
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,544
It becomes even sadder

1644
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,848
What do you see how he'd allow the pain and grief

1645
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:20,128
He feels about this tragedy

1646
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:21,920
Be transmuted into a right-wing

1647
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:22,688
Conspiracy

1648
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:25,504
On another level it's really sad to recognize all of the

1649
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,344
Non-white families that have to go through this exact same pain every day

1650
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:34,208
Having their family members killed or wrongly incarcerated but don't have enough circumstantial evidence

1651
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:37,280
Core Connections to white supremacist in Neo-Nazi group

1652
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,328
Alex Jones to even care about their plight

1653
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:43,424
I watched an hour plus long presentation by Jesse trentadue

1654
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,960
Where you laid out all the relevant

1655
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:46,496
Evidence

1656
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:49,056
And I think the connection to the OKC bombing

1657
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:49,824
Profoundly Slim

1658
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:53,408
But it's what he needs in order to keep his brother's death relevant

1659
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,224
To make it more important than just another inmate stamps

1660
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,504
Murdered by

1661
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,064
I would feel a lot of empathy for him

1662
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,856
If he didn't say this

1663
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:03,136
Towards the end of his prison

1664
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,976
You asked me how long I'm going to fight these sons of b******

1665
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,256
Till I'm dead

1666
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,560
And what Justice will I ever get out of that

1667
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:13,376
Will they ever prosecute anybody for my brother no

1668
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,144
Never will

1669
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,704
But I can harm the reputation to Department of Job

1670
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,264
I can harm the reputation of the FBI

1671
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,336
I can do great damage to them and that's my objective

1672
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:24,896
That's the only Justice my family will ever get

1673
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:28,992
It seems like trying to do primary objective as he clearly says

1674
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:31,296
Is the hurt the FBI in the Department of Justice

1675
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,344
If you were doing that by sticking

1676
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,440
I would support that whole heart

1677
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,976
Unfortunately

1678
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:41,792
He's correctly realize that the way he can hurt them the most

1679
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,584
Is the side with the right-wing terrorist

1680
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,376
Petal unfounded nonsense

1681
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,936
And for that my empathy for his situation

1682
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:48,960
He's greatly

1683
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,544
I feel very sad

1684
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,336
I wish I could care more but

1685
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,616
He's got tricked by the

1686
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,408
Please do

1687
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,944
All around

1688
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,736
Best socks for everybody

1689
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,016
Vandeventer

1690
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,040
Stocks

1691
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:09,440
I'm bummed there's nothing good about hero everybody

1692
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:17,376
Serial killer

1693
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:25,056
Is the guy who got murdered in prison and we don't even know that

1694
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,080
Deserve

1695
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:28,896
That sort of only ones with the town drunk

1696
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:35,552
Grievance

1697
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:36,320
Numbers

1698
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,440
Everything sucks

1699
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,816
What's

1700
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,192
Kenneth Jessie

1701
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:53,728
We're actually twins

1702
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,008
Jessie

1703
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,336
Was the one who was accidentally mistaken for

1704
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,616
And put in prison

1705
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:01,664
Is actually

1706
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,712
Kenneth was always a what two prime

1707
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:08,576
Going to prison for 8

1708
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:17,280
Kenneth Branagh

1709
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,328
It sucks you're right

1710
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,864
All that just sucks I had

1711
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,704
No pleasure out of learning about

1712
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,008
I'm fascinated by it like

1713
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,032
You know

1714
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,312
Witness

1715
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:31,360
As I was complaining about earlier

1716
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,016
Chase the ghost of Alex's

1717
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:40,576
When you find something that's like there's a specific

1718
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,624
Are you look into it and it's something like that

1719
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,928
Heated be very literal definition

1720
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,696
Sour grapes

1721
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:50,304
Yeah that's like all man look up there on the branch

1722
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,656
That's just a tragedy all the way around

1723
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,448
Because

1724
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,216
Like I said

1725
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:02,336
Almost

1726
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:06,176
You know like it is absolutely

1727
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,552
You Muddy Waters

1728
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,856
Another piece

1729
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:16,416
Eventually

1730
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,184
Payoff

1731
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,208
From the government

1732
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:24,864
Yeah

1733
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,312
He got a payoff not from

1734
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,592
The murder

1735
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,616
But from

1736
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,480
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

1737
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,832
They keep

1738
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:49,696
I don't think that makes it better

1739
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:51,488
I think if there is obviously

1740
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:52,768
The best

1741
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,792
Could come out of it

1742
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,328
Do you have police reform

1743
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,192
Isn't any more satisfying than anything else

1744
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:06,592
That's just like Hey we're going to keep murdering people but you get some money because you wouldn't shut up about it

1745
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,128
Cover up

1746
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,944
If there if it wasn't

1747
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,736
Yeah

1748
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:21,440
Now I don't know if it goes all the way up

1749
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:25,024
I still do

1750
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:25,792
The bombing

1751
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:27,584
But there's a different conversation

1752
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:29,376
Hey

1753
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,216
You got to rain in the police forces in this country

1754
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:35,264
But at least

1755
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,824
It seems like

1756
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,128
With God

1757
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,944
Conversation

1758
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:46,528
Trolls

1759
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:50,624
There should be some sort of oversight for any human being that's allowed to have

1760
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,696
Regardless of whether or not they are in love

1761
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,584
Vets

1762
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:04,192
Now we're out of it and Alex Jones is going to talk about you

1763
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,728
Dumb bulshit but how

1764
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:18,016
The rosicrucians

1765
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:26,976
Ron

1766
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:34,144
Yeah we're huge fans of them

1767
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,128
Christian

1768
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:48,224
What's truechristian Jesse's trying to

1769
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,784
But

1770
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,600
He was talking to his death

1771
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,416
Nougat

1772
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:59,232
From cutting-edge Ministry

1773
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,888
And there are already out there on because

1774
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:08,960
Which is on the dollar bill

1775
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:13,056
I do like the title VI of the

1776
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:17,408
That's not bad Bill represent

1777
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:23,552
The mythical Phoenix and at the globalist are going to take it down and from it

1778
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,672
You should also know

1779
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:29,952
That

1780
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:30,976
They haven't

1781
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:34,048
Website

1782
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:38,400
It's one of the lamest

1783
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:44,032
And because they came out before Harry Potter right

1784
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:50,432
Yeah yeah Phoenix is like it's a good thing and they're like no the Phoenix

1785
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:52,736
Yeah that might be some sort of like getting on our turf

1786
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:57,856
Yeah absolutely boring Christian nonsense of life

1787
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,232
Yeah I know but I did I ever tell you whenever I was whenever I was like

1788
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,256
12 or 30

1789
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:06,816
My church

1790
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:12,192
To read the first Harry Potter book so I could determine whether or not it was

1791
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,984
Blasphemous

1792
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,800
In case other children Reddit

1793
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,080
They asked you

1794
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:22,176
The Sorting Hat exactly you got it

1795
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,480
Yep

1796

1798
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:39,584
These guys are wacky

1799
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:45,984
I wanted to like get some quotes from the website

1800
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:46,752
Stupid b*******

1801
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,544
But that does not stop me

1802
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,360
From playing

1803
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:53,664
From cutting-edge Ministries.

1804
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,736
Probably

1805
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:03,136
The exciting part of this process

1806
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:09,280
Is that this all comes down in it and they are they are aiming for the very thing the Bible says will happen

1807
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,304
And that is

1808
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,584
That is a yacht

1809
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:16,448
Hey quite figure it out.

Remote control Global religion

1811
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:32,064
I'm pushing for this

Yelp

1813
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,096
Whomever he was at the time

1814

Uno

1815
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,960
I just

1816
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:49,728
Kept

1817
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,032
That long and then

1818
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:54,336
Just rambling

1819
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:00,736
You should really know which pope it is you're talking about if that's part of your conspiracy

1820
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:06,880
Like you should have that information like on hand

1821
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:13,280
Globalist

1822
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,584
I think so

1823
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,912
I don't know

1824
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:20,448
So that

USA

1826
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:27,872
Oh yeah

New season of young Sheldon timeline

1829
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:38,880
Anyway I just picked

1830
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,696
I love I love your

1831
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,744
Your lifestyle

1832
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,328
I love it

1833
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,352
Like the good

1834
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,120
Define confer

1835
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:03,200
Is it a palindrome is that what it is probable that I think

1836
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:05,504
It lives

1837
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,320
I know that it can be a funnel to more Danger

SeaWorld

1839
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,368
But it's fun

1840
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,416
How do you spell lives in this place

1841
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,488
Mostly outside of bigotry

1842
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,512
I think

1843
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,536
Although probably

1844
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:19,840
It's just more fun

1845
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:23,424
The idea is like a it's like

1846
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:28,800
In 1991 the Illuminati decided that no one will ever find Bigfoot

1847
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:31,104
There was a

1848
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:35,712
There was a time but right no more

1849
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:38,016
Bill Clinton president

1850
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:39,552
Nobody can find Bigfoot

1851
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:45,952
Mexico

1852
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:53,376
She's going to find those hitting squash

1853
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:58,496
I don't know I have not

1854
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:02,592
Absolutely

1855
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:03,616
I think

1856
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:04,384
You know what's interesting

1857
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:11,552
Search cuz I don't know if I've ever heard about it

1858
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,576
I'm sold it

1859
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:15,392
Probably

1860
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,672
Here's the thing

1861
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:18,208
I'm not interested in

1862
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:19,232
Cryptozoology

1863
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,256
For the most part

1864
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:23,328
I'm not sure I've ever heard Carrie talk about

1865
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:27,424
Really I need to look into

1866
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,496
Maybe pass and she said that they were some sort of alien race

1867
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:35,872
Something she'd be like

1868
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:38,688
And the Raptors are fighting the reptoids

1869
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,248
Steamed up with the Sasquatches

1870
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:51,232
Archives if I can find a spot

1871
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:54,048
I would definitely do it

1872
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,864
For sure

1873
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:03,008
Chicago Cubs players

1874
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:07,872
Right

1875
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:08,896
Which means

1876
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,688
Now to Dave again

1877
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:16,320
What kind of party

1878
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:17,344
Tea Party

1879
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,096
Jexi

1880
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:35,520
He was in Independence Day it was

1881
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:39,872
Write instead of instead of the July Fourth 1776 it was like

1882
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:46,272
Throw these aliens

1883
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:49,856
Because okay

1884
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:53,696
Going on maybe as long as

1885
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:59,328
Or at least it feels that way we are now finally it's a day of the Nationwide

1886
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,352
Chicago.

1887
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:04,448
They are not

1888
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:06,240
Weather on Sunday

1889
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:07,008
If you're white

1890
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,800
But

1891
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:11,616
Here's how he starts the show

1892
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,664
Really f***** up

1893
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:26,208
I guess about six seven eight years I want to be clear

1894
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:27,488
She's married to a lord

1895
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:33,888
Literally

1896
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:41,824
Exactly like

1897
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:51,040
It's not like we got a woman

1898
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:53,856
Who cares

1899
01:51:56,416 --> 01:52:02,048
I said who cares because like me

1900
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:07,424
CBS

1901
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:15,872
Learn this when I was a child because my dad

1902
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:24,064
Precious

1903
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:28,160
I mean literally

1904
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:30,720
Their houses are

1905
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:35,328
Yeah

1906
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,424
The problem

1907
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:01,952
Married to a lord

1908
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,536
Maybe it is I didn't work

1909
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:10,144
I can neither confirm nor deny that he's married to Lori monster

1910
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,168
Climate creep

1911
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,472
But

1912
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:17,056
Big narrative with her is

1913
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:20,384
Beat the s*** out of her and said you shouldn't make this movie

1914
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,432
He's going to repeat that

1915
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:27,808
At least six times during the

1916
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,576
Who knows

1917
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:32,672
He's going to repeat that over and over again it's the big selling point of life

1918
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:33,952
This documentary that she

1919
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:40,352
To put out to dangerous she lived it man to her rough

1920
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:45,984
Look if you don't want this to happen again you're going to do I don't know why I'm doing so many voices

1921
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:54,432
I like it though I like it

1922
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:56,992
Okay alright

1923
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,784
This, can't go on a yacht

1924
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:00,832
Is that court order

1925
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:02,368
Don't know why

1926
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:09,792
But you some sort of a nautical vampire

1927
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:12,608
Sagami

1928
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:28,480
Here is that his dad was

1929
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:34,880
South Africa has really bad

1930
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:40,000
French South Africa South Africa

1931
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:46,912
It's almost like a long time

1932
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:49,472
Connection Envy's connections

1933
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:52,800
Apartheid South Africa

1934
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:55,872
It seems like

1935
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:03,552
It's almost like a lot of the Proto right-wing in the John Birch Society

1936
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,600
Maybe a lot of their funding came

1937
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:12,256
From strip-mining countries

1938
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:18,656
People would never do that we have a long history of not exploiting others

1939
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:22,496
Day of the Dead

1940
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,568
Seems like

1941
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:29,152
On the last episode on the 25th

1942
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,176
Two days prior

1943
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,200
Alex headache

1944
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:31,968
Clearly playing

1945
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:34,272
Call Dempsey

1946
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,040
Checkers

1947
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:36,320
Maybe he's going to

1948
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,344
Be up on it

1949
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:42,208
Instead what does he talks to his survival food

1950
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,400
Today

1951
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:54,240
Steve shank has been the storm for 28 years

1952
01:55:59,360 --> 01:55:59,872
And

1953
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:06,272
Didn't have any

1954
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:08,320
I found out there and

1955
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:13,696
And sweet

1956
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:16,512
Attract

1957
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:20,608
Elsa's having his f****** survival food guy on as a guest

1958
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:22,144
To talk about the economy

1959
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:25,728
This weird business model where his

1960
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,264
Sponsors have to be guess

1961
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:30,848
Limericks

1962
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:32,128
This isn't the first time

1963
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:34,432
Ushanka

1964
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,456
Survival

1965
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,736
So it's super weird

1966
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:40,576
You nosey ever say that

1967
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:41,600
For his

1968
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:43,904
What is this

1969
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:49,536
16 Parsons bro

1970
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:54,656
Good place might as well because

1971
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:58,496
I'd like a little boy back

1972
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:01,568
I like I like the attempt

1973
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:04,640
I like where you're going with it but that would never be a slogan because

1974
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:06,432
It would be like an egg

1975
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:07,712
Accu-Chek

1976
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:12,832
You never make your survival food think we blew it

1977
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,392
What if

1978
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,672
You got to recontextualizing

1979
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:19,744
The Wii and the Wii shanked it is

1980
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,512
Society

1981
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:31,008
Now yet

1982
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:37,920
So it's a long walk

1983
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:38,944
7 - 1

1984
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:45,344
Now you recontextualizing I get a plus-one where I give myself a -14

1985
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,928
Help you

1986
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:55,840
He's having his food so I can sponsor on to talk about the economy

1987
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:01,216
Am I cramping it's a little early in the show

1988
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:11,712
Now cookbook are Lucy yeah

1989
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:13,760
Yeah that's the difference

1990
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:19,648
He's heading maybe later in the show he'll get his thoughts but ho

1991
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:24,000
Nationwide uprising

1992
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,304
He has Bob

1993
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:30,400
And he makes

1994
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,168
Darling

1995
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:33,984
He's a white South African

1996
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,520
No he's already confessed.

1997
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,592
These are the main things in a quart

1998
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:40,128
Unfortunate

1999
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:41,920
4

2000
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:43,968
The key holders

2001
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,784
It is going to an absolute

2002
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:48,064
Nosedive

2003
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:49,856
And

2004
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:50,624
They've just

2005
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:53,952
Stock

2006
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,768
We got it was going to go down

2007
01:58:57,792 --> 01:59:01,888
At the $38 a share $42 a share somewhere up there

2008
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:04,960
JPMorgan cuz we

2009
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:06,240
Shorted out as well

2010
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:09,568
The same price and that selling for around 20

2011
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,408
Citigroup

2012
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:15,712
Is down $0.56 today

2013
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:17,760
It's only for about a buck and a half

2014
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:21,088
It would probably cover that short none of it works by then

2015
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,392
And somewhere around a dollar I hope

2016
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:25,696
And the

2017
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:28,768
Will have

2018
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,816
Made the difference between

2019
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:33,888
Say $40 in $1

2020
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,424
It's an awful lot of money

2021
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:37,472
So what keys

2022
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:38,496
Is it

2023
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:40,288
Predict it

2024
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,824
We're going to lose

2025
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,104
Valuing

2026
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,384
So he's short

2027
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:47,456
Heap

2028
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:53,856
And made a bunch of money off of it

2029
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:57,440
What's Jones primary complaint about George Soros

2030
01:59:57,952 --> 02:00:04,096
He has shorted Bank he's the man who broke the bank

2031
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:14,592
Use George Soros of being evil for doing Market

2032
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:15,616
I understand

2033
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:19,968
Which is the problem

2034
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:23,552
Speaker problem

2035
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:25,856
We have the stock market as it exists now

2036
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:28,672
You need people short batting in order to pay

2037
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:32,512
Whoever's wrong pays

2038
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:34,304
And whoever's right makes that money

2039
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:38,656
I feel like gambling with Pension funds probably bad

2040
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:39,424
I don't like

2041
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:42,752
Moral aspects of short

2042
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:43,520
If that's

2043
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,544
The system we live in

2044
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:46,592
I would rather

2045
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,384
Wow it's there

2046
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:51,968
Rules of the game

2047
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:57,344
Although on the other hand the other

2048
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:00,928
Whatever it is

2049
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:07,328
Those both seem like opposite ends of the same Insider training exploitative insiders Insiders

2050
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:08,352
Breeding exploited

2051
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:11,936
Both of those being an option

2052
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:14,240
. is a very bad thing

2053
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:18,848
Crime in front Elementary

2054
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:21,152
If you have a situation where like you

2055
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:24,480
Great

2056
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,040
Going to get worse

2057
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:32,160
Economy should work what

2058
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:36,512
Mercy makeup

2059
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,328
No more wrong

2060
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:41,632
Is Tibet

2061
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:42,656
You betting against

2062
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:43,680
It doesn't make it

2063
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:44,960
Right

2064
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:47,008
Petros would just

2065
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:55,456
Eastlake let's say the president of Citigroup shorted Citigroup

2066
02:01:55,712 --> 02:02:00,320
You get a lifetime ban from the Hall of Fame

2067
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:06,464
For sure absolutely

2068
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:11,840
The Bankers Hall of Fame is also in Cooperstown

2069
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:16,448
Note the other reason that we've been going back to 2000

2070
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,216
Figure out when

2071
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,824
In this appearance

2072
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:23,104
I don't have the Clippers

2073
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,128
Because it's snowing

2074
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:24,896
Consequential

2075
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:26,176
Bobcat

2076
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:27,456
Bring up George Soros

2077
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,480
Oh no

2078
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:31,296
Yeah as a good person doesn't

2079
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:34,112
In reference to

2080
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:35,136
Glenn Beck

2081
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:37,952
Talking about how there's going to be this

2082
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:40,000
Bubba

2083
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:42,048
Absolutely

2084
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:46,656
Glenn Beck and George Soros

2085
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,680
Being in concert

2086
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:48,960
No

2087
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:51,520
He's implying that

2088
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:52,800
Towards

2089
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:53,568
Alright

2090
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:55,872
But the only reason is like

2091
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:57,408
2 seconds

2092
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,344
Like I do

2093
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,136
To play the clip I would have had to playlist

2094
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:07,904
4 minutes

2095
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:08,928
Alex

2096
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:10,720
Completely no selling

2097
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:11,744
Jordan

2098
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,024
Broadcast

2099
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,560
Not on his radar

2100
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:15,840
Doesn't matter at all

2101
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:17,888
He's like

2102
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:21,728
Flip back socks

2103
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:28,384
So you stole George Soros

2104
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:32,992
Ignore that back might be in concert with George

2105
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:35,040
Well

2106
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:36,832
William

2107
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:41,184
I know about George Soros is that he's not going to be like

2108
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,208
Glenn Beck

2109
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:47,328
Some good ideas will see what's up with you

2110
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:49,632
The first time his name

2111
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:53,472
Good impression

2112
02:03:57,824 --> 02:04:00,384
Sequential a

2113
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:01,664
In this

2114
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,736
At least month of episodes

2115
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:06,272
It's the closest

2116
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:08,320
28 your story

2117
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,160
You know

2118
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:18,048
Sign of things to come again

2119
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:18,816
20 years

2120
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:20,608
Yeah yeah

2121
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:21,376
Maybe

2122
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:22,656
Maybe the reveal is

2123
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:23,424
Close

2124
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:24,192
I don't know

2125
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:27,520
But

2126
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:32,384
In the same way that earlier in the episode that caller brought up at

2127
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:39,296
How much that would change his life

2128
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:40,576
He has the same response

2129
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:42,624
Bobcat

2130
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:48,512
Earlier was talking about how his dad is friends with South African

2131
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:52,608
Diamond

2132
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:53,888
Literally

2133
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:59,520
His career

2134
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:03,104
And the apartheid South Africa

2135
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,384
White farmers

2136
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:10,784
They're not doing well Loki maybe the worst person

2137
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,952
And how he has that like

2138
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:20,256
All Chucky voice the same way Ron Pope

2139
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:23,840
This unassuming character to them

2140
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:24,608
But like

2141
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:30,752
You look into their careers you see like oh no the amount of damage

2142
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,032
On the ground

2143
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:33,568
Floor involved

2144
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:34,336
Monstrous

2145
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:35,872
I could say

2146
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:40,992
Did anybody in Rhodesia

2147
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:42,272
Then fled

2148
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:43,040
When

2149
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:47,904
Equity was starting to come around

2150
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:48,672
African gold

2151
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:53,536
Yeah you know on some level

2152
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:54,560
You were

2153
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:56,096
Where you be raping the people

2154
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:58,656
And so that's why I think

2155
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,472
Basketball

2156
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,008
Just save this

2157
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:05,568
When Alex Jones backup South Africa

2158
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,336
Diamond

2159
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:11,712
Absolutely

2160
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:12,736
Is enough

2161
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,272
Diamonds in the world

2162
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,040
Burien

2163
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:17,088
I mean they ain't they

2164
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:19,392
Intrinsically they have little or no value

2165
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:22,720
And has been created by debeers another

2166
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:24,512
Debeers

2167
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:25,792
Which is controlled

2168
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:27,584
Indirectly by the Royal Family

2169
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,192
Who financed all the projects

2170
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:33,216
South Africa

2171
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:34,752
And the other one says

2172
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:36,032
Used to

2173
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:38,592
Madison Ave

2174
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:40,640
Especially during the

2175
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,456
After the turn of the

2176
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:45,248
21st century

2177
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:57,792
Just a different commodity

2178
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:03,680
I mean

2179
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:05,472
Didn't even mention which one

2180
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:08,288
Like that

2181
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:13,664
The Danish girl

2182
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:22,368
Yeah yeah yeah

2183
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:27,488
Just a like a South African

2184
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:28,512
Apartheid

2185
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:29,792
Tunis

2186
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:30,560
Another one

2187
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:36,448
Absolutely true as much as

2188
02:07:36,704 --> 02:07:39,264
Like artificial scarcity

2189
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:43,872
Prices

2190
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:45,920
If the supplies it actually

2191
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:46,944
Stated

2192
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:53,344
We're all amazing ad campaign that that whole concept of two months salary or whatever

2193
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:59,744
What are traditions in words

2194
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,024
5 no

2195
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:07,680
I don't know these are just the diamond commercials I remember from my childhood

2196
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:08,960
The Shining

2197
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:15,360
Vampire vampire Rihanna song

2198
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:18,176
They're really great

2199
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:18,944
Incredible

2200
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:20,992
Should we use them for

2201
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:22,016
I think they do exist

2202
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:26,368
Movie franchises

2203
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:27,648
No that's okay

2204
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:33,536
Too many salt movie

2205
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:36,352
I know there are like

2206
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,632
Actual functional use

2207
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,496
But in terms of jail

2208
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:53,248
People have those but it's crazy it's crazy

2209
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:57,856
What toothache

2210
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:58,880
1

2211
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,416
The song Grillz

2212
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,208
Paul Wall

2213
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:04,512
Nope not going well

2214
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:10,912
This isn't going to happen on that song

2215
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:15,264
The song bling bling

2216
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:18,592
Lil Wayne alright

2217
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:19,616
Mannie Fresh

2218
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:26,016
This one's better this one's better actually the remix better Lil Wayne on it

2219
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:28,832
Better than than your previous

2220
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:36,256
Refreshes

2221
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:40,352
We talked about

2222
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,120
Helicopter

2223
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:44,704
I love Minecraft

2224
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:46,752
Brett Brett Brett

2225
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:50,080
He's the best use the best of that

2226
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,152
New Orleans

2227
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:53,920
Hip Hop

2228
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:55,712
Frisch's found

2229
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:57,504
Good

2230
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:58,784
Bang

2231
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,320
And has like a realist

2232
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,344
Symphonic quality

2233
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:09,280
Less than shocked that you know so much about a guy like Mannie Fresh in that

2234
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:11,840
Could not

2235
02:10:20,544 --> 02:10:21,056
You know what it is

2236
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:25,920
There's like a like I was

2237
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:28,224
Super into 1

2238
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:31,296
Time my life I learned everything I could about that

2239
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,856
And then I started to like like others

2240
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:35,904
And everything I could about that

2241
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:44,608
I'd love every time anybody has played any of his

2242
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:51,008
But I don't give a s*** about cuz I know he's very

2243
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:55,616
It's not something

2244
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:58,944
That doesn't make any sense I don't I don't accept that argument

2245
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:02,784
Like something

2246
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:04,576
The bracket

2247
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:05,600
Refresh

2248
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:09,440
She's going over

2249
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:12,000
Incorrectly

2250
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,072
Real big

2251
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:16,352
Patrick Star

2252
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:24,032
First song from a real big fishes

2253
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:32,992
Microwave oven

2254
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:40,160
Well that was before they had the express

2255
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:41,952
Optional most

2256
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:46,048
So you have to push like 1 and then 002

2257
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,352
But you can just press one and get a minute

2258
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:49,376
Pac-Man

2259
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:52,448
No I think he's talking about how he in his car

2260
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:54,496
Prices on microwave ovens

2261
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:59,104
That's how I meant at all

2262
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:03,712
IMDb the good work

2263
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:10,368
Fresh production

2264
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:16,000
Alright

2265
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:22,144
What are the great things by Big Tymers

2266
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:28,544
They pretended that all of their albums were sequels to each other

2267
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:31,616
Part 1 event

2268
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:38,016
They have a bracket 11

2269
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:48,768
How do you know if I need this conversation

2270
02:12:51,584 --> 02:12:52,864
Alright

2271
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:53,632
Earlier

2272
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:55,168
Alex

2273
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:58,240
Teasing that he's going to have this Janine

2274
02:12:59,008 --> 02:13:00,288
Robert

2275
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:02,848
Talk about her diamond

2276
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:04,384
Documentaries

2277
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:08,480
Like we've already talked about the idea that there is artificial scarcity

2278
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:14,624
Does she have at least six teeth made out of

2279
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:16,160
Because she had her teeth

2280
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:16,928
Knocked out

2281
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:18,208
Well

2282
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:24,864
The only logical thing for her to do that would be

2283
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:33,568
I don't know much about jean-robert but I'm guessing that you would cause a cold spot

2284
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:40,224
Penny Candy you know what that mean

2285
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:43,040
Jelly and Bean

2286
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:52,512
Is this show about Alex

2287
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:56,352
Sometimes I wonder

2288
02:13:56,608 --> 02:14:01,984
Getting a lot of reaction I don't know why

2289
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:04,288
I don't know why

2290
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:08,128
Young Jeezy

2291
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:18,880
I don't know why I don't know why I don't care to listen to

2292
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:22,720
Too much because I sort of implicitly agree with a lot of the stuff

2293
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:23,744
Did you say

2294
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,048
Corrupt

2295
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:26,816
Business

2296
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,864
Mostly using Arthur

2297
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:32,448
Rise up

2298
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:36,800
Because diamonds aren't available in a

2299
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:37,568
Every part of the world

2300
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:40,896
Temperature

2301
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:42,688
Very end

2302
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:47,552
Like I said

2303
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:49,600
Over the course of this episode

2304
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:52,672
Beat up

2305
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:55,744
People were beating her up said hey.

2306
02:14:57,792 --> 02:15:01,120
And so now he asks her about that in the documentary

2307
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:04,448
Specifically

2308
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:16,480
So is personal insight

2309
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:23,392
Her when she was in the hospital and tried to get her to sign over the rights

2310
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:24,928
To her.

2311
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:29,280
Beating

2312
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:33,376
To the people who came

2313
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:34,656
Company BBC

2314
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:35,680
Okay

2315
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:36,704
That is

2316
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:46,432
Remember when Kim Kardashian got robbed

2317
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:48,480
Know what something like that

2318
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:50,784
I don't know anything about that was a couple years ago

2319
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:53,344
I don't remember all the details.

2320
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:55,136
But like

2321
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:56,928
Nope people

2322
02:15:57,184 --> 02:15:58,464
Sure that she's

2323
02:15:58,720 --> 02:15:59,232
Lorde

2324
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:01,024
Texting sometimes

2325
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:03,072
Skins break

2326
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:06,144
Metaphor

2327
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:07,168
Okay

2328
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:11,520
Hollywood he's a f****** God I'll tell you that right now.

2329

My coming-out in

2331
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:19,712

2332
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:20,992

Play

2335
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:29,440
Some people still like Roman Polanski film

2336
02:16:34,816 --> 02:16:35,328
Pizza

2337
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:40,192

2342
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:57,344
Tricks in order to

Gin up

2344

Popularity

2345
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:00,928
Publicity for

2346
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:02,208
His project

2347
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:06,304
Does like sensational

2348
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:07,584
In order to

2349
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:08,352
Dubai his

2350
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:09,376
Supplements

2351
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:14,240
Like this comment

2352
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:17,312
Talk about it

2353
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:19,104
He does this

2354
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:20,896
Who cares

2355
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:23,712
Freshwater

2356
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:24,480
Never do some

2357
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:27,552
I bet

2358
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:31,904
So we're done

2359
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:32,672
Better

2360
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:36,768
He did

2361
02:17:37,024 --> 02:17:39,328
Darius

2362
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:42,912
He's never done anything that even compares to run away

2363
02:17:43,424 --> 02:17:48,288
I do like runaway Kanye

2364
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:52,128
I know I'm wrong but

2365
02:17:58,272 --> 02:17:58,784
Don't act

2366
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:09,792
Set song

2367
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:24,640
Should I just wait in the other room until you're done with it

2368
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:25,408
Call

2369
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:27,200
I don't know what song it is but it's the best

2370
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:28,480
That's the best Big Time Rush song

2371
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:32,320
One thing that I love about your

2372
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:35,136
Hip-hop fandom

2373
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:39,488
Is how complex interesting the lyrics

2374
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:40,512
Good stuff

2375
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:46,400
Soggy bottoms no no no no

2376
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:58,432
From party

2377
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:03,296
Not one

2378
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:06,624
Seems like if it was in 40 cities Nationwide

2379
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:09,952
0 time is almost like the Main Street

2380
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:18,144
Straight yeah it's almost the same way Alex

2381
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:19,168
Kind of given up

2382
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:19,936
Ignoring

2383
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:24,032
He's even been

2384
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:28,128
He's been brought up on his

2385
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:29,152
Couple days before

2386
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:30,688
Doesn't do any coverage

2387
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,480
Doesn't bring it up

2388
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:33,504
But he does

2389
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:35,040
Have someone by the name

2390
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:36,576
Barbara Fisher

2391
02:19:36,832 --> 02:19:37,344
On the show

2392
02:19:38,112 --> 02:19:39,136
Is a

2393
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:40,160
Very

2394
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:44,256
I mean like in that world

2395
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:46,816
She said she's the heiress to the Fisher-Price

2396
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:47,584
Found a

2397
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:53,984
What is vaccination

2398
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:56,032
She's a very big ant

2399
02:19:56,288 --> 02:20:00,128
Vaxxer

2400
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:02,176
You guys got to stop

2401
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:04,224
He's he's always easily

2402
02:20:06,272 --> 02:20:09,600
He came out the womb Auntie's ass really don't think that's a good idea

2403
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:12,416
Not good

2404
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:15,744
I mean it

2405
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:18,304
Just a little bit

2406
02:20:21,376 --> 02:20:22,144
Cowpox

2407
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:24,192
Can give him cowpox

2408
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:27,520
You're right actually

2409
02:20:27,776 --> 02:20:29,824
You didn't know that

2410
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:32,896
I don't care

2411
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:36,480
I don't care to talk about her interview

2412
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:39,040
Evax Non-Stop

2413
02:20:39,296 --> 02:20:40,320
Yeah I just want

2414
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:41,600
Because

2415
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:43,648
It's so disqualify

2416
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:45,184
Like the fact that you

2417
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:46,464
Making this argument

2418
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:49,024
She's coming onto Alex's show to talk about

2419
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:51,328
In the fact

2420
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:52,608
It means

2421
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:53,632
Know any

2422
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:56,448
Resume.

2423
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:57,984
It's exactly

2424
02:20:58,240 --> 02:20:59,776
There is effective as the company

2425
02:21:00,032 --> 02:21:01,056
Said they are

2426
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:02,592
And then

2427
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:05,152
You should have said them back news should have nothing to fear

2428
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:06,176
Unvaccinated

2429
02:21:06,432 --> 02:21:07,968
Is it shouldn't be such an issue

2430
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:08,992
About forcing

2431
02:21:09,248 --> 02:21:11,296
People to get vaccinated

2432
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:15,904
That doesn't track even the slightest indication that she has no

2433
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:16,928
F****** idea

2434
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:17,952
Talkin about now

2435
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:21,536
To anybody who hasn't heard the times we've broken the 100 times

2436
02:21:24,352 --> 02:21:25,632
Like for example

2437
02:21:27,168 --> 02:21:29,984
Orb

2438
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:34,080
There there it's not a perfect science

2439
02:21:34,336 --> 02:21:34,848
And there's a lot of

2440
02:21:35,104 --> 02:21:36,640
People who are at risk

2441
02:21:37,152 --> 02:21:40,992
Like there is a very real possibility of bringing polio

2442
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:47,648
Mainstream conversation

2443
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:51,488
If if we leave the world where everybody

2444
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,768
Could get vaccinate

2445
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:56,352
Perhaps

2446
02:21:56,608 --> 02:21:57,120
That is correct

2447
02:21:58,144 --> 02:21:59,936
And that's why it's an appealing argument

2448
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:00,960
Don't understand

2449
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:03,776
Like

2450
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,896
Thick if you are

2451
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:10,688
You can't make this

2452
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,224
Because you look like a f***

2453
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:13,504
It means

2454
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:14,272
Don't know

2455
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:16,320
Directions

2456
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:20,160
Well if there's one thing I know about virus

2457
02:22:21,184 --> 02:22:24,000
It's that they never change or adapt

2458
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:25,536
To any kind of

2459
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:31,936

2460
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:38,336

Weird

2466
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:07,264
Freeze dried food

2467
02:23:08,288 --> 02:23:11,360
You brings it Bob Chapman to talk about shorting stocks

2468
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:13,152

You should have said Lord

2479
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:41,056
No cuz you started with this Diamond Lake

2480
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:51,040

02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:01,536

02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:16,544
Pro wrestling

2515
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:20,128
Kevin Nash

2516
02:25:20,384 --> 02:25:21,408
He was outside

2517
02:25:22,176 --> 02:25:23,712
The two of them were

2518
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,600
And then they went over to

2519
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:30,624
The WCW

2520
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:32,672

Vaden

2522
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:40,352
Federation has always wanted to do that

2523
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:44,448
The storyline of them coming in as outside

2524
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:46,240
Who came in to Blackreach

2525
02:25:46,496 --> 02:25:47,008
Havoc

2526
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:55,712
It became the end of course

2527
02:25:56,736 --> 02:25:57,760
Coolest things in red

2528
02:25:58,272 --> 02:25:58,784
In the 90s

Steph

2530
02:26:03,648 --> 02:26:04,160

Brink of death

2535
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:11,584
Yeah you can watch

2536
02:26:12,096 --> 02:26:12,608

2537
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:15,936

2538
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:19,520

2541
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:31,808
To die and

2542
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:33,856

02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:37,440
You was on

2547
02:26:38,976 --> 02:26:39,744

2548
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:41,280
Hey now he's

2549
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:43,072
Pretty healthy

2550
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:49,984
It's awesome

2551
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,520
I don't know if it's awesome

2552
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:52,544
But the story

2553
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:54,080
AR

2554
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:54,848
Amazing

2555
02:26:55,104 --> 02:26:56,640
The only reason

2556
02:26:58,176 --> 02:26:58,688
The last night

2557
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:00,992
Bigot

2558
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:02,784
They sold out the Sears

2559
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:09,696
Like no no independent wrestling

2560
02:27:09,952 --> 02:27:11,232
Has ever done something

2561
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:13,280
So it's

2562
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:19,680
The only reason ddps involved at all is because he was part of the aunt

2563
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:21,472
Cody Rhodes

2564
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:22,496
He was in a

2565
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:26,080
My match for the NWA championship

2566
02:27:27,104 --> 02:27:27,872
Glacier

2567
02:27:30,688 --> 02:27:31,456
In the middle of the match

2568
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:42,976
Alright

2569
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:48,096
Great work

2570
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:56,288
Why don't you want on the rolling tanjun you got A plus one this time you get a negative one

2571
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:58,592
Yeah but all in

2572
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:02,432
Anyway.

2573
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:06,272
Even now

2574
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:07,296
Year old man

2575
02:28:07,808 --> 02:28:08,320
Anyway

2576
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:10,368
I thought to myself

2577
02:28:11,136 --> 02:28:11,904
After listening to

2578
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:12,928
The 20

2579
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:14,976
I thought to myself like well

2580
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:16,512
Maybe Alex didn't

2581
02:28:16,768 --> 02:28:17,536
Realize the

2582
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:19,584
And only would know

2583
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:20,608
In hindsight

2584
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:21,632
Right now

2585
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:24,192
That was on Friday maybe Sunday show

2586
02:28:24,448 --> 02:28:25,728
Is going to be like

2587
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:27,008
Holyshit

2588
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:27,776
I didn't

2589
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:29,056
Realized people were going to

2590
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:30,336
40 City

2591
02:28:33,152 --> 02:28:34,688
I'm going to pretend I was on board

2592
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:36,480
Even though

2593
02:28:36,736 --> 02:28:39,040
You on Friday

2594
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,600
Coverage of people being

2595
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:48,000
Hiding the fact they were like for guys

2596
02:28:48,256 --> 02:28:49,536
I put a camera with a

2597
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:50,304
0 Folk

2598
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,328
Guess on the floor guys

2599
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:52,352
I'm so

2600
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:55,168
I got at least check in on the 1st

2601
02:28:56,704 --> 02:28:57,216
Boy

2602
02:28:57,472 --> 02:28:57,984
I'll tell you what

2603
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:01,568
Alex admits videos

2604
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:08,224
I don't know what to feel about that that works

2605
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:12,576
Reflexively

2606
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:15,392
Yeah

2607
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:18,208
I still don't know

2608
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:21,280
Beyond that Alex back in the day

2609
02:29:21,536 --> 02:29:22,304
President

2610
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:24,608
Would leave after 8 years and go back to their

2611
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:25,888
But Obama's

2612
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:26,656
Do that

2613
02:29:26,912 --> 02:29:28,192
As we look at it from 2018

2614
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:33,312
He's metaphorically gone back to his farm

2615
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:34,592
Did was Carter

2616
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:41,504
And he didn't even go back to his Peanut Farm want to help other people build their own Farms

2617
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:45,600
Peanut Farm which literally

2618
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:47,904
What's peanuts

2619
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:53,792
Is sort of

2620
02:29:54,048 --> 02:29:57,120
You know metaphorically when his term is up

2621
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:04,544
Shower

2622
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:09,920
The metaphor there is real rough

2623
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:11,200
Consider what's wrong

2624
02:30:11,968 --> 02:30:12,480
Havasu

2625
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:17,600
There's no way

2626
02:30:17,856 --> 02:30:19,136
It's amazing how

2627
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:25,536
Like the only thing he has right now is

2628
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:27,072
Access an influencer

2629
02:30:27,584 --> 02:30:29,632
Because everybody's

2630
02:30:29,888 --> 02:30:35,264
Cuz everybody hates him like them moments that he doesn't have access

2631
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:38,336
No one is going to give a s*** about

2632
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:39,616
Real debit

2633
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:45,248
He has to stay the president

2634
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:47,808
Anyway

2635
02:30:48,064 --> 02:30:48,832
I was like

2636
02:30:50,368 --> 02:30:50,880
Dude

2637
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:52,160
You going to talk about

2638
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,440
Right

2639
02:30:53,696 --> 02:30:55,232
Until he starts taking callers

2640
02:30:55,744 --> 02:30:56,768
Who won the college

2641
02:30:58,816 --> 02:31:01,376
When you talk to her

2642
02:31:18,272 --> 02:31:19,808
Listen to say

2643
02:31:26,464 --> 02:31:30,816
Their own documents like you always preach their own documents

2644
02:31:31,328 --> 02:31:37,472
Exactly

2645
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:48,992
Is it okay if they going to call those guys like

2646
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:51,296
Some friends you don't f****** believe

2647
02:31:51,552 --> 02:31:52,320
You put up

2648
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:53,600
Everything

2649
02:31:56,416 --> 02:31:56,928
What's a verb

2650
02:31:57,184 --> 02:32:00,768
Labor camp stuff

2651
02:32:01,536 --> 02:32:03,584
Now that is real but that's more about the private prison

2652
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:09,984
Just like that one that one

2653
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:13,568
Constitutional Amendment that was like

2654
02:32:13,824 --> 02:32:15,104
No slavery was like

2655
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:21,504
No slavery but like every put people ones

2656
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:27,904
Kind of makes music

2657
02:32:32,256 --> 02:32:36,608
Brings up the

2658
02:32:36,864 --> 02:32:37,632
Which is

2659
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:41,984
Eddie says they already Americans

2660
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:44,032
Further not

2661
02:32:45,824 --> 02:32:47,104
Responding to this guy being like

2662
02:32:47,616 --> 02:32:50,432
Hey I try and get my friend to love your s***

2663
02:32:50,688 --> 02:32:51,200
Even though

2664
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:52,480
You proved everything and

2665
02:32:54,528 --> 02:32:55,040
Kernel of Truth

2666
02:32:55,552 --> 02:32:56,064
To life

2667
02:32:58,624 --> 02:33:01,696
Still no mention of the Tea Party

2668
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:04,768
Steve and Alex Jones video and goes

2669
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:06,304
I have no idea what he's talking

2670
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:11,680
About that is not because he disagrees or is very warlike

2671
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:12,704
It's more like

2672
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:13,472
What

2673
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:23,712
Responsible

2674
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:27,296
No idea what you're talking about

2675
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:29,344
Probably intentional

2676
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:33,952
So we have

2677
02:33:34,208 --> 02:33:35,232
One last quit

2678
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,536
I looking for it I want to say that Alex

2679
02:33:38,304 --> 02:33:39,328
Also on this episode

2680
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:40,864
But in the last year

2681
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:41,632
He's got

2682
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:42,400
Billion

2683
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:44,192
Visits to his website

2684
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:46,496
And 170

2685
02:33:46,752 --> 02:33:47,776
Individual

2686
02:33:48,032 --> 02:33:49,824
People IP addresses

2687
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:51,104
Coming to his website

2688
02:33:51,872 --> 02:33:55,200
What rich

2689
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:56,480
Is

2690
02:33:58,528 --> 02:34:01,344
170

2691
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:02,112
From

2692
02:34:02,368 --> 02:34:03,904
IP addresses better

2693
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:04,928
100

2694
02:34:05,184 --> 02:34:08,256
70 unique user ID

2695
02:34:08,768 --> 02:34:10,304
Showed up on his website

2696
02:34:12,096 --> 02:34:13,632
10 billion *

2697
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:14,912
10 billion hits

2698
02:34:19,264 --> 02:34:20,288
On a daily basis

2699
02:34:20,544 --> 02:34:21,312
Boy if you

2700
02:34:21,568 --> 02:34:23,360
If you do that math in your head I'm going to be impressed

2701
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:26,176
But I also think that all this b*******.

2702
02:34:30,784 --> 02:34:31,552
Crazy for like

2703
02:34:31,808 --> 02:34:33,088
Really large website

2704
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:36,672
The top hundred websites if you look at them are all

2705
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:38,208
Places that have

2706
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:39,232
Like

2707
02:34:39,488 --> 02:34:41,024
Places like IMDb

2708
02:34:41,536 --> 02:34:42,048
Or Google

2709
02:34:43,072 --> 02:34:44,864
Twitter

2710
02:34:45,376 --> 02:34:46,400
Places that have like

2711
02:34:47,424 --> 02:34:47,936
Hundreds

2712
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:49,728
Civilian

2713
02:34:49,984 --> 02:34:52,544
10 billion hits is

2714
02:34:53,056 --> 02:34:53,824
Absurd

2715
02:34:54,336 --> 02:34:56,128
Yeah but it would put him

2716
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,920
Sepsis

2717
02:34:58,688 --> 02:34:59,968
Individual person

2718
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:06,880
Giving something he like 1 billion 100 million hits

2719
02:35:07,136 --> 02:35:07,648
No

2720
02:35:08,928 --> 02:35:09,440
107

2721
02:35:11,232 --> 02:35:17,376
100

2722
02:35:17,632 --> 02:35:23,008
Oh no no no no

2723
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:24,032
No

2724
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:30,944
Because that's one do doing a lot of

2725
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:31,712
Click

2726
02:35:32,224 --> 02:35:36,064
I've got the population of bar in Chicago

2727
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:38,112
That's my fanbase

2728
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:43,744
10 billion + 70

2729
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:48,864
Play Morissette Map works out a little better

2730
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:51,168
Ludacris

2731
02:35:51,424 --> 02:35:51,936
In terms of

2732
02:35:52,448 --> 02:35:53,728
You consider the population

2733
02:36:00,128 --> 02:36:01,920
Spread out around the world

2734
02:36:02,176 --> 02:36:03,200
Half of the population

2735
02:36:06,272 --> 02:36:07,552
I say absolutely no way

2736
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:08,320
There's no way

2737
02:36:08,576 --> 02:36:09,856
I was like

2738
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:13,184
I need something

2739
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:16,000
Another caller

2740
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:21,376
I thought you were a cuckoo by years ago

2741
02:36:21,632 --> 02:36:22,912
You are

2742
02:36:23,168 --> 02:36:26,752
Keyboard me over completely

2743
02:36:27,264 --> 02:36:29,568
What is the underlying Foundation

2744
02:36:29,824 --> 02:36:30,848
How are you

2745
02:36:31,104 --> 02:36:32,384
Become sore Droid

2746
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:33,408
Oh yeah

2747
02:36:35,712 --> 02:36:39,552
One thing I don't understand why are you so

2748
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:41,856
History

2749
02:36:42,112 --> 02:36:42,880
History search

2750
02:36:43,136 --> 02:36:45,440
That the more

2751
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:49,280
Thanks

2752
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:52,096
Are doomed to repeat it

2753
02:36:54,912 --> 02:36:57,472
I have been when I was about 12 13 14

2754
02:36:57,984 --> 02:37:01,824
To start reading history books because they were much more entertaining and science-fiction

2755
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:02,592
Louis L'Amour

2756
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:07,200
You live in Texas you should love Louis L'Amour

2757
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:12,320
He goes on a really long time

2758
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:21,024
So now we just bring it up at all doesn't bring up the Tea Party on this Sunday episode

2759
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:25,376
He's not on board that caller might have had the order reversed

2760
02:37:25,632 --> 02:37:26,144
Like

2761
02:37:26,656 --> 02:37:29,984
You shouldn't be 100% on a guy's side

2762
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:32,288
Before you ask

2763
02:37:33,568 --> 02:37:35,104
How do you know

2764
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:43,040
Why do why do you know all this

2765
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:44,576
Instead of like working back

2766
02:37:44,832 --> 02:37:46,880
You're missing your missing

2767
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:48,928
Hero worship

2768
02:37:50,976 --> 02:37:51,488
How does

2769
02:37:52,512 --> 02:37:53,024
This happen

2770
02:37:53,536 --> 02:37:54,304
There wasn't

2771
02:37:55,072 --> 02:37:56,096
Why are you so smart

2772
02:37:57,376 --> 02:38:01,472
That works too

2773
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:05,312
More less

2774
02:38:05,824 --> 02:38:08,640
And Alex is more than happy to oblige

2775
02:38:08,896 --> 02:38:10,688
I started

2776
02:38:10,944 --> 02:38:11,456
Yeah

2777
02:38:12,736 --> 02:38:14,528
Have you ever ready

2778
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:17,088
Episode

2779
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:18,112
Like

2780
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:19,392
I know that this is like

2781
02:38:19,648 --> 02:38:23,232
100

2782
02:38:24,256 --> 02:38:24,768
So much

2783
02:38:25,024 --> 02:38:26,048
Over and over again

2784
02:38:26,304 --> 02:38:27,328
And most of the time

2785
02:38:30,144 --> 02:38:33,984
That is what will last

2786
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:36,544
10 billion things he was wrong about

2787
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:37,824
It only 300

2788
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:38,592
65 days

2789
02:38:41,408 --> 02:38:44,480
100

2790
02:38:45,504 --> 02:38:47,040
How's like

2791
02:38:47,552 --> 02:38:48,064
How

2792
02:38:49,856 --> 02:38:50,624
What is wrong

2793
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:52,416
Because every

2794
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:55,488
It becomes a fraction

2795
02:38:55,744 --> 02:39:01,376
Bullfrog.

2796
02:39:01,632 --> 02:39:06,496
Sojourn this brings us to the end of this investigation 2009

2797
02:39:06,752 --> 02:39:07,776
I'm f****** glad we

2798
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:09,056
We finally got through

2799
02:39:09,568 --> 02:39:11,104
Because boy I'll tell you what

2800
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:12,640
We put it off a bit

2801
02:39:12,896 --> 02:39:14,944
And I feel bad that are listening

2802
02:39:16,736 --> 02:39:18,784
But I'm glad that we finally got to

2803
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:25,440
Tea party now the new

2804
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:31,072
We've got to the date of the Tea Party breaking out right now the new adventure becomes

2805
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:37,728
How long does it take him for him to realize the Glenn Beck

2806
02:39:37,984 --> 02:39:38,496
Bunch of money

2807
02:39:38,752 --> 02:39:39,264
Yeah

2808
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:41,312
I know but I got a I got a usurper

2809
02:39:42,592 --> 02:39:43,616
Secondarily

2810
02:39:43,872 --> 02:39:45,664
How long does it take him to realize

2811
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:47,712
Bra tops Rose

2812
02:39:47,968 --> 02:39:50,016
On this episode

2813
02:39:51,296 --> 02:39:52,832
Soon from now

2814
02:39:53,088 --> 02:39:55,136
Or all of our narrative that we're trying to

2815
02:39:55,392 --> 02:39:56,928
Figure out play

2816
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:57,696
Now

2817
02:39:58,976 --> 02:40:00,256
I have no faith that's

2818
02:40:02,304 --> 02:40:02,816
You know what

2819
02:40:03,072 --> 02:40:05,120
What's what's this

2820
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:10,240
Like going this far back with this relatively nebulous of a

2821
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:16,896
Like we have a concrete

2822
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:20,480
The concrete narrative is when does he jump on the

2823
02:40:22,784 --> 02:40:23,808
Investigation

2824
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:25,344
When does

2825
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:26,112
Thesaurus

2826
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:28,416
But that could also be pretty concrete

2827
02:40:28,672 --> 02:40:34,816
It could be but we don't know when it's going to be

2828
02:40:35,072 --> 02:40:37,888
2009 to 2011 Corvettes

2829
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:43,264
I know you are concerned

2830
02:40:46,592 --> 02:40:48,640
Things like that says

2831
02:40:50,688 --> 02:40:51,456
Hello campus

2832
02:40:51,968 --> 02:40:55,552
Hated

2833
02:40:58,112 --> 02:41:00,928
But I didn't go

2834
02:41:05,536 --> 02:41:06,816
I was catching I will

2835
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:10,656
I've been out there I know how to throw a stick

2836
02:41:11,424 --> 02:41:13,472
I feel like this is a weird level of our

2837
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:17,312
If it takes that long it takes that

2838
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:21,664
Biggest 2009

2839
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:23,712
Roundabout

2840
02:41:23,968 --> 02:41:26,272
He's a pretty serious Flashpoint

2841
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:27,808
George Soros

2842
02:41:28,064 --> 02:41:29,600
Becoming an enemy of

2843
02:41:30,112 --> 02:41:33,184
Wrecked in the same way in 2014 was another

2844
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:35,488
Those are two pretty

2845
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:36,512
Seriously

2846
02:41:37,792 --> 02:41:38,304
Demarcated

2847
02:41:39,584 --> 02:41:40,864
Soros meddling

2848
02:41:44,192 --> 02:41:45,728
By trying to

2849
02:41:45,984 --> 02:41:47,264
To give support to

2850
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,544
Free speech

2851
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:49,824
Movement right

2852
02:41:53,664 --> 02:41:59,808
When he was like you shouldn't kill journalist on your birthday 2014 it revolved largely

2853
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:01,856
Before

2854
02:42:02,368 --> 02:42:02,880
Involved

2855
02:42:04,416 --> 02:42:05,440
So the theory

2856
02:42:05,696 --> 02:42:06,464
Could happen

2857
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:08,768
I think that is zero chance

2858
02:42:10,304 --> 02:42:10,816
Happen

2859
02:42:11,328 --> 02:42:12,096
Frooties

2860
02:42:12,608 --> 02:42:13,376
Yeah you think so

2861
02:42:13,888 --> 02:42:14,656
I do I do

2862
02:42:14,912 --> 02:42:18,240
Directions by the idea

2863
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:21,568
Because I think Bob is also

2864
02:42:22,848 --> 02:42:23,616
Propaganda

2865
02:42:26,176 --> 02:42:26,944
Please bring it up please

2866
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:29,248
Downhill to Alex

2867
02:42:30,272 --> 02:42:31,040
I would be interested

2868
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:32,064
To know when

2869
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:35,136
Because based on the way that the Tea Party things go

2870
02:42:35,392 --> 02:42:36,672
It seems like he's

2871
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:40,000
He's a bandwagoner who insisted he's been there

2872
02:42:40,256 --> 02:42:41,280
Big time

2873
02:42:41,536 --> 02:42:44,864
Interested to know when the bandwagon

2874
02:42:45,632 --> 02:42:46,912
Got on thesaurus

2875
02:42:47,424 --> 02:42:48,704
You know what I'm saying

2876
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:49,984
Glenn Beck

2877
02:42:51,008 --> 02:42:51,520
Report about

2878
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:53,056
I think it was an early

2879
02:42:54,592 --> 02:42:55,104
Okay

2880
02:42:58,176 --> 02:43:00,480
I really don't think that he was on it first

2881
02:43:04,832 --> 02:43:06,368
We'll see I mean I love that we have Miss

2882
02:43:07,136 --> 02:43:07,904
In front of us

2883
02:43:08,928 --> 02:43:09,952
We all kind of hope

2884
02:43:10,208 --> 02:43:10,976
That we get to the

2885
02:43:11,232 --> 02:43:12,000
Happy party day

2886
02:43:14,304 --> 02:43:17,632
Actionable results

2887
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:21,216
No interest in it

2888
02:43:23,008 --> 02:43:23,776
Cuz I think it might

2889
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:31,456
Because you still at this point trying

2890
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:33,504
Posture as a Libertarian

2891
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:35,296
Right

2892
02:43:35,552 --> 02:43:39,136
Libertarian is essentially

2893
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:41,440
Purely Republican

2894
02:43:41,696 --> 02:43:42,976
He doesn't know that

2895
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:45,280
Well I think anybody

2896
02:43:45,536 --> 02:43:47,072
I think anybody who's

2897
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:48,096
I don't think

2898
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:50,400
Take

2899
02:43:52,704 --> 02:43:53,728
I've been wrong a bunch of times

2900
02:43:54,496 --> 02:43:56,032
But I think my mind

2901
02:43:56,288 --> 02:43:58,080
My prediction on the ground right now

2902
02:43:58,336 --> 02:43:59,104
How is that

2903
02:43:59,616 --> 02:44:00,128
He starts

2904
02:44:00,384 --> 02:44:01,920
Notice that Ron Paul

2905
02:44:03,456 --> 02:44:04,224
Party

2906
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:05,248
Okay

2907
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:07,040
Restart

2908
02:44:07,296 --> 02:44:08,320
People gaining

2909
02:44:08,576 --> 02:44:09,344
Attraction from

2910
02:44:10,112 --> 02:44:12,416
He starts to see a lot of his like world

2911
02:44:12,672 --> 02:44:14,464
You getting popular is like

2912
02:44:15,744 --> 02:44:18,304
I'm not making money on this there's money on the table

2913
02:44:18,816 --> 02:44:20,096
I should already be there

2914
02:44:20,864 --> 02:44:21,888
How many retcon

2915
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:22,912
He was

2916
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:28,800
Elders of Zion

2917
02:44:31,104 --> 02:44:31,616
F****** walk

2918
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:34,688
I tried

2919
02:44:34,944 --> 02:44:39,040
I tried

2920
02:44:39,296 --> 02:44:40,832
Flip Flip

2921
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:41,856
But I will agree with

2922
02:44:42,112 --> 02:44:42,624
You even like

2923
02:44:43,392 --> 02:44:43,904
That's fine

2924
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:49,280
We'll see what happens but I'm glad we're through

2925
02:44:50,048 --> 02:44:50,560
Fun

2926
02:44:51,584 --> 02:44:52,352
It's cold

2927
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:01,056
Do we have a Facebook group

2928
02:45:12,576 --> 02:45:13,600
Too complicated

2929
02:45:14,112 --> 02:45:16,416
Confused by the direction

2930
02:45:16,672 --> 02:45:18,464
Bunch of reports

2931
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:19,488
Tripe

2932
02:45:22,048 --> 02:45:23,328
Helpful for

2933
02:45:26,144 --> 02:45:27,168
I've heard that feedback

2934
02:45:29,472 --> 02:45:33,824
And also also in any situation

2935
02:45:35,104 --> 02:45:36,128
Not proactive

2936
02:45:36,384 --> 02:45:37,920
Towards

2937
02:45:40,224 --> 02:45:41,760
Psyqui legit

2938
02:45:42,528 --> 02:45:44,576
Yeah

2939
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:51,232
We can't get on

2940
02:45:51,488 --> 02:45:52,256
Because they would

2941
02:45:52,512 --> 02:45:53,280
Absolutely

2942
02:45:53,536 --> 02:45:54,048
Flakka

2943
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:58,656
Are you using

2944
02:45:58,912 --> 02:46:05,055
Plays the tracks

2945
02:46:05,311 --> 02:46:06,847
Running afoul of

2946
02:46:07,615 --> 02:46:11,199
Music

2947
02:46:11,967 --> 02:46:12,735
We didn't do it

2948
02:46:13,247 --> 02:46:14,783
Yep

2949
02:46:19,391 --> 02:46:23,487
Jordan This is been fun going through 2009 with you but

2950
02:46:25,535 --> 02:46:27,327
And that is the reason back then

2951
02:46:28,351 --> 02:46:29,119
He knows something

2952
02:46:32,703 --> 02:46:35,007
Holding

2953
02:46:37,055 --> 02:46:40,639
Alex
