00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,792
Looks a little bit about Alex

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
Jones

7
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,352
We are Dan Jordan

8
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,912
Quick question for you

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
That that was

10
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:19,360
Are you still trying to come up with memory

11
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,944
Stories of hey dude honestly I was thinking about ways

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
Is to keep water from getting into your window in the afternoon

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,160
In Chicago after a massive

14
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:37,536
Rainstorm and

15
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,632
When you showed up to record I discovered that there was a

16
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
A group forming in the middle of my living room

17
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,128
I didn't know what to do

18
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
There was a diverse ecosystem being built around this this Oasis in your home

19
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,576
I'd no idea that somehow there was a leak

20
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
Or something and like it was just

21
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:09,280
Just a nightmare and that's the only one in the house

22
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,840
Great so that's fun that's not my right

23
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:18,240
It is officially today the end

24
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
Of the dreamy creamy summer

25
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,640
True love and I will be crossing the 100 ice creams

26
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,944
Later this evening

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
I've not had it yet

28
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,320
But I am I you had I started the day off with a

29
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,648
A frosty ccino from

30
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
Wendy's

31
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,840
What it's a frosty in a cappuccino coffee

32
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Cream is Ross

33
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,192
The frosty ice cream

34
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
That was an idea that took 5 minutes and that God no need to rework that fat at all

35
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Fantastic night out of town I love that

36
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,784
It's good that was something that was some enterprising employee 20 years ago is just like anybody

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
I got an idea

38
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
I'm just going to put some Frost

39
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:12,256
I want to end things with one of the suggestions that you actually had that I have taken you up on

40
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,656
And that is the Insomnia Cookie I believe the ice cream sandwich

41
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,008
It was too much going to blow your head off so I'm going to finish things off this evening with that

42
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,568
Annapolis via the dreamy creamy summer

43
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
Man bought ice cream

44
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:33,504
100 is is a lot I like that you got 99 on the morning of vets

45
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,880
So good I might have had a number of things that I had already had

46
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
You know Patty

47
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
Padding the stats a little bit

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
What's it what's in a what's the difference between a rebound with five seconds left to go in the game in a rebound with 20 min

49
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
And I think there's some

50
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,056
But lessons that I've learned that I'd like to impart

51
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
On the audience

52
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
Classics classics for a reason

53
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
You know something

54
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
But you think like a

55
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,808
Your basic ass

56
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:13,440
7-Eleven or grocery store ice cream sandwich

57
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,047
Good never never ever since you were three years old you've eaten one

58
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
You don't know who make

59
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Make those

60
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
There's something to it

61
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,935
And the scarf

62
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,263
There's a reason that those are still in business

63
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
That's good fantastic

64
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Second

65
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
JoJo get too weird

66
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
Like okay

67
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
Frosty's on the subject in Frosty

68
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
When I was growing up there was a chocolate

69
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
Frosty

70
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
Now there's a vanilla Frosty there's a strawberry frosting

71
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
It really showed true

72
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
They're not worth it

73
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,911
Frosty is great it's supposed to be

74
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
McDonald

75
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
McFlurry

76
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,127
Eminem and Oreo right they've tried to Branch out and every time it has been a with

77
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,687
Don't do it

78
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,575
Stick to the safe ocean in there

79
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:17,951
But they don't put reasons they put like the Reese's Pieces from those are just I can put those and I think that McDonald's doesn't have a

80
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,791
I think that could be an issue recent hates Ray Kroc

81
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,863
Or something new just they want to give him break

82
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:30,239
Manresa MacDonald had a fight and 400

83
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,335
I also think that things like

84
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
Like a Dairy Queen

85
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,343
Peanut buster parfait I think cuz I didn't have one of those in years but I remember the

86
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,159
The ice cream the peanuts the fudge

87
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
And then the ice cream the peanuts the flood

88
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,767
Did the AAA or whatever

89
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:58,655
It might be great for a child I worked at Dairy Queen when I was younger and I have terrible memories of

90
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:05,311
Making a chili bar and what have you and I don't want to I don't want to open that can of worms backup

91
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
Define

92
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,223
Whatever other things custard Superior to frozen yogurt

93
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
Trailer sure

94
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Some of these

95
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
F******

96
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Overpriced

97
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
Ice cream pints

98
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:28,607
Are so overrated you have no business charging as much as they do

99
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
Parfait one

100
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
Those are a scam there's like this much ice cream with them and then know that's bulshit

101
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
Like a sundae cupcakes disgusting

102
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:48,831
Yeah that's another thing big loser of the bracket for sure no wasn't bracket

103
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
A bunny tracks

104
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Spy Blue Bunny

105
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Do they make a

106
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
They make a bar

107
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
Yeah

108
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
It's

109
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
Too much

110
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Too much too much it's busy

111
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
There's like

112
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
Fudge peanuts

113
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
Hellboy rabbit shaped

114
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
Caramel filled

115
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
No I don't know what I'm eating

116
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Yeah

117
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,039
So we'll see how this ice cream sandwich close things out but I'm excited for it

118
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
And

119
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,207
Things are going out periodically they're going out sporadically even has ended

120
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,279
This will go on for the next couple months or so people beginning button

121
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Because I

122
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,375
Woefully underestimated hey goodbye

123
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
I underestimated the demand last time

124
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
And I thought it would be about the same

125
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
I have had to enlist

126
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
The help of a business

127
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
Frankly

128
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:51,039
I feel like the first time ever I physically dependent make this money button

129
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087

Until we're done sending out the button

136
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,639
So people care to chip in and support these great causes

Yeah I know

143
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,047
It is but it's made by some of the people who made

144
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,607
Adventure Time so it is not

145
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,679
It's more like that surreal uncanny

146
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,007
Point of view on a certain like

147
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:49,407
Almost magical magical girl you know like Sailor Moon kind of thing but imagine

148
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,295
More like it's a it's a modern woman trying to deal with s***

149
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
And then stuff goes crazy

150
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:02,463
You know that's kind of but then also it's so very mundane at the same time

151
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
That it's

152
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,303
It bounced things balances things out with a

153
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
LOL

154
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
Was non-existent chiptune soundtrack

155
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,423
Really really interesting in good

156
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
I don't know if I would recommend it to ones I like bills

157
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,663
Yes bills are piling up and then you have to have superpowers chilling

158
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,271
At the end of the day if you've if she achieves her goals

159
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
She gets like 50 bucks

160
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,903
Like with it with magical powers all of this s*** going on

161
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
What time she gets paid in change

162
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,255
You know like it is a tough life out there

163
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,559
Fernanda Galactica superhero toys

164
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399

Some stuff and I want to have a little treat

And I will talk about that but here before we get into this business

178
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
I'll take a little moment

179
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
Say hello.

180
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455

00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
Thank you very much person said that the name is supposed to be pronounced like it was in The Witcher

182
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,255
And I was not watching The Witcher play The Witcher 3 but it was on mute so I had subtitles

Do not apologize

191
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
But it's an anime I guess that I think I've heard someone mention it before so it's an anime

192
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,935
About forcing these children to Pilot

193
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,495
Giants organic robots

194
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
To defeat

195
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
The exist

196
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,127
Distance of separation between conscious

197
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
Do child Soldiers with a real life

198
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
Hard Psych

199
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
And they don't

200
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,087
They don't shy away from the child in Child Soldier they

201
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Torture that kid

202
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
I mean

203
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
There's memes about

204
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,535
Just get in the robot if you hear somebody say like get in the robot towards that

205
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Fairies

206
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Decades

207
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
Torture

208
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,679
Easy kind of like

209
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:58,079
Not that heavy kind of entertainment that's why I listen to Alex Jones all the time

210
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,431
Episodes are live action serial Adventure nonsense

211
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,039
Text me space Ashley

Four stars don't get mad until you're brilliant someone

216

Sodomites

Has a Caribbean

218
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
I don't want

219
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,535
Jesus Christ

220
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
Where you left off on August 6th

221
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
20

222
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
2003

223
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
Picked up there and

224
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
Listen to the 7th

225
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
And it's

226
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Just

227
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Man it is

228
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
Yeah that is

229
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:12,575
Tootsie little bit of a round table with a couple pastors who are complaining about how like

230
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,159
They're trying to run a scam where they give teachers credentials but they aren't lice

231
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,767
To do it

232
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
So it's kind of a snooze

233
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
And I had to skip pass

234
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,655
Round table with pastors is never fun

235
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
So we get to Friday

236
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
August 8th

237
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,615
And there's actually something that I found really fascinating I think this is an incredibly helpful

238
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
Teachable

239
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
Episode about Alex

240
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
And how he operates

241
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,783
The story that he tells

242
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Has to do with the child protective service

243
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:51,231
Feeling surrounding it obviously thinks they're just out to kidnap your children

244
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
Imagine her CPS of the path

245
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,375
Riyasat episode talking about

246
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
There are over a million

247
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
You have polluted

248
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
Private organization

249
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Problem

250
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Abuse

251
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Statistically

252
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Because baked

253
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
You go get a message

254
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,303
Analogy

255
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,935
He has to tell me to do that

256
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
But if you're middle class

257
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
So this is this is something

258
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
He's at

259
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
Blow this is pretty standard

260
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
From Alex's

261
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
The point

262
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,775
Something that needs to be brought up to is this notion that

263
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
The like

264
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:46,175
Child Protective Services doesn't need to exist because there were criminal laws for this

265
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,015
Is a little bit of a weird perspective

266
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
The cops will come steal a kid

267
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,903
And then they'll raise them in the precinct and that's where we get

268
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
Cops

269
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
I think

270
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
That sounds

271
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
Like a boss

272
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,375
But you might watch

273
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,239
I think it's silly to like this because

274
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
There are laws

275
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
And

276
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
There are

277
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,663
People who need to be specialized in dealing with certain laws particularly

278
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,247
Sensitive type situations like family Dynamics

279
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
Antabuse

280
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,367
That's not that's not something that you would want to

281
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
Entrust to your normal

282
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,463
Beat cop or just add someone who doesn't have

283
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
Some training in that field of course

284
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,095
So if you don't have CPS then you just have to take

285
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,167
8 unit inside the police department and

286
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Turn them in

287
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
Do CPS basically

288
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,335
Yeah matter what you do for someone to accomplish the job you're looking

289
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Looking for

290
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
Someone has to be there

291
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,783
Or do you have to create a situation where we like we don't do anything proactive we don't do anything

292
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,647
You know address situations and instead what we do is when there's

293
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:04,255
Something when they get a murmur of like there's some abuse going on we

294
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
Your normal detective in there I guess they are as parents

295
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,519
The kids can fend for themselves okay so your parents are going to go to

296
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
You'd be fine in this house by yourself

297
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,127
Was it will see you later

298
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,455
I'll check in on your once a week or so I'll bring you some food

299
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
I don't know what the the alternative for what Alex will take care of every

300
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:36,255
It's kind of the same thing he has about like he will not having insurance will take care of you

301
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,191
Be great if there was more of it but relying on it institutional and structurally seems like

302
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:51,871
We created a government because we wanted Community Aid on a bigger left

303
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,223
That's why we all pay the government to then provide Community Aid

304
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
Yeah it's something like that

305
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,135
So Alex is a story about the CPS taking the child and I do not believe that this is true

306
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Criminal record

307
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
What

308
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
We go there and

309
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
Turn around

310
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
So then the cops are bad for this right

311
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
And then I went

312
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,767
I don't believe this story as it's told

313
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:17,887
How do you do make a really good point I guess Alex is responsible to be cops are only doing this

314
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,727
Because the CPS makes them do after something like that I'm sure there's

315
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
There's a workaround

316
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,871
Yeah but this is I mean this is scary if you listening to something to be scared of

317
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
Yeah I suppose

318
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,319
Coming in and stealing your baby in broad daylight with all of these people around witnessing it

319
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,207
And only one of whom is apparently retelling the story all of those people in the hospital all of the doctor

320
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:48,607
Monsters versus all the wrestling people never told this story once but he sounded Mike Hansen

321
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Problem

322
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,775
I've not seen this I've watched a lot of his contact even from

323
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
The back of these times

324
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
Documentaries or what have you

325
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
I think this would be pretty shocking

326
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:04,735
If I was telling the story I'll be like you know what let's play that footage right now

327
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Maybe it'll be helpful

328
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,367
Contextual but I think that it's more just a misrepresentation of something

329
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
That he wants to present as this they're going

330
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
To steal your kids

331
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:21,119
They are going to steal a particular kind of kit

332
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:26,239
Crack dealer they don't want your kids

333
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
Where they had

334
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
They go in

335
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
Baywatch

336
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Surprise white babies

337
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,343
Right right what's the going what's the going rate for a white baby these days

338
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,647
I don't know but I don't think this is a major

339
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:20,256
Concerned for the

340
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,328
And all of this is being brought up

341
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,632
Open this is the theme basically the end

342
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,472
Entirety of this episode because Alex has found a story

343
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
In the Denver Post

344
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,336
That is going to basically spiral perm

345
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Interview

346
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,408
So it's wild 2003 The Denver Post was a socialist publication

347
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:45,504
Especially considering that he was operated by media News Group Incorporated

348
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
The second largest newspaper conglomerate in the country

349
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:54,976
Seems like Alex might just throw that word socialist around randomly like it doesn't mean anything

350
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:01,376
Free with them from time to time huh explicitly endorse V severely right wing

351
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:07,776
In politics that I love

352
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,104
About a woman who had taken temporarily by child protective service

353
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,408
But there's some very important

354
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,736
Details in the story they're going to be interesting to see if Alex ignores

355
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Because

356
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
The reality of the story

357
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,624
Does not work for the narratives that Alex is trying to build up about the CPS

358
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
Oh yeah they do

359
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
If you lie

360
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:30,048
That's such a good trick always get away with that

361
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
So here Alex gets more into the store

362
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
The police

363
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,328
So one of the sources that cited in the article is there past

364
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
McGinnis

365
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,984
And speculated that their Hospital thought they were homeless

366
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,800
And tell Alex brakes about it a little bit

367
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,360
Covers the story a little bit more

368
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
Department of Human Service

369
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
Confirm

370
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,088
Morning

371
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
She talked about

372
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
We were obliged to follow up on

373
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,272
So if you're just listening to Alex you and I

374
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:59,392
Very important context about the story that he's reading

375
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
He tells the story he wants we audience

376
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,048
To hear and hide the details are inconvenient for his ability to spin a bowl-shaped yarn

377
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:12,960
The biggest piece of information he's leaving out is that the family was unhoused a couple years prior and good luck husband

378
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,520
Pretty sure that this

379
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,824
Had to do with outdated medical record

380
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Rides

381
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:24,992
He believed that there was a misunderstanding that's them for medical records They had on file being from a time when they were experiencing

382
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,784
Homelessness which makes the whole thing

383
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
Kind of make a lot more set bright

384
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,416
Over the years since they've had tons of temporary address

385
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,768
So you can kind of understand how none of these would necessarily be in the medical record

386
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:40,864
And CPS would be tasked with offering resources to a nun house family have

387
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Sing a child

388
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:48,288
The second thing is that the baby was put in CPS custody on Sunday and was returned to miss

389
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Good luck on Monday Eve

390
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Evening

391
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,384
It's something that's unfortunate

392
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
May not have been handled perfectly and baby

393
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Shouldn't happen

394
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,064
And then likely if you know better record-keeping was done by all parties involved

395
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
It wouldn't

396
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,160
But this wasn't the kidnapping and it lasted around 24-hour

397
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:09,792
It was needed to correct their clerical error and do the paperwork

398
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,192
The third thing that I was leaving out for now but we'll have to address later is that good luck is Navajo

399
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
Oh and her husband is

400
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Lakota

401
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,384
Alex is not bring this detail up because he's trying to do this whole Jacobite other systems really after white children Act

402
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,760
Presrite not existing in this big story he's covering would be kind of suspicious

403
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
Especially

404
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
In kitchen

405
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,392
Another major problem for his entire Naruto

406
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,304
According to a 2017 release from the national Indian Child Welfare Association quote research and data from

407
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,608
The state's tells us that American Indian

408
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:49,984
Alaska native children are disproportionately represented over-represented

409
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,056
In the child welfare system Nationwide especially in Faust

410
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
Aftercare

411
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,224
This means that higher percentages of aian children are found in the child welfare system

412
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
General population

413
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:07,648
The over-representation of aian children often starts with reports of abuse and neglect it rates

414
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,952
Fortunate to their population numbers

415
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,792
But grows higher each major decision point from investigation

416
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
Replacement

417
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,144
Culminating in the over-representation of aian children

418
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,936
In placement outside the home

419
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,032
One study found that due in large part to systemic bias

420
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:29,664
Where abuse has been reported aian children are two times more likely to be investigated

421
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,504
2 times more likely to have allegations of abuse substantiated

422
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,832
And 4 times more likely to be placed in foster care than white

423
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,952
This disproportionality has gotten worse in the time sense but their rates

424
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
It would still

425
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,816
In 2003 but this is a dynamic that Alex is not equipped

426
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
To deal with

427
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,424
He doesn't actually care about fixing real problems with how the CPS operate

428
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
And he's actually over

429
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,520
To even acknowledging those problems because for him

430
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,104
The CPS narrative is really just a vehicle for him to engage in white grief

431
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Yeah

432
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:06,528
It to the extent that he will ever acknowledge that these are Navajo mother in Lakota

433
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Bother

434
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:13,696
You only will recognize it and I like now they're do going to do it like that that is the

435
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Who's this

436
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
And

437
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,840
Actually looking at the real dynamics is counterproductive for napping

438
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
And it's just such

439
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
F****** b******* of like

440
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,960
You are you are at

441
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,520
Symptom number seven of the problem

442
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
That is

443
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Why were they on house

444
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
In the first place

445
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,992
What start f****** way back when they're not sure allowing that to happen

446
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
And then you go back

447
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
Even further in you go

448
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,880
Not only are they on house currently in our terrible system

449
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,976
But they're from a people who were genocided by everybody

450
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:51,584
And we're not well and disproportionate to taking of children

451
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,704
Is a knock-knock apart of Gem State

452
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,896
Oh my God understood in the proper context this story that Alex's covering as a prime opportunity to

453
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:10,528
Discuss this very clearly did a discriminatory pattern and how these government entities treat Native family

454
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,416
Further it could be an opportunity to discuss the ways the benign mistakes like out-of-date medical information

455
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,976
Can we do really difficult situations but

456
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,024
They don't necessarily have to lead to disaster

457
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,632
Either of these options bring new real useful information to his audio

458
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,448
Neither would create the feelings that he wants to evoke

459
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:32,544
Namewee that all white people are under attack of the government is going to take your children

460
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:39,200
Taking note of the details that Alex chooses to ignore about stories is often a really important part of understanding is that

461
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Editorial process

462
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
Illustrating

463
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
What it actually is

464
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
He considers it

465
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,904
The truth is informing the audience isn't import

466
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
The truth itself isn't

467
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,488
But spreading racially-based fear is

468
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,768
Pretty super important

469
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
Yeah and I want to be totally clear about

470
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:59,168
Alex is excluding information actively and intentional

471
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
So the audience doesn't get the full picture

472
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:05,568
After he comes back from break he continues reading the article if this is

473
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
F****** damn

474
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,552
This is right

475
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
Months

476
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:34,496
Here's what Alex accidentally started reading and then stopped himself mid-sentence

477
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:40,128
Good luck said she told Hospital admissions Personnel her address but why was there people

478
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
Coming up to me and asked me if this is right

479
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
She didn't understand it

480
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,856
The family had lived in a Denver area homeless shelter for about 6 months in 1999 and later in a basement

481
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,672
Apartment provided by a member of the church where Phillip Gates

482
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,696
Has become an ordained

483
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
Elder

484
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,024
It's just one chapter in the family's struggle

485
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:03,424
Alex you heard him say they have lived in a Denver area and then stop at right there

486
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,752
Right there at the word homeless because that validates

487
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,312
Why there might have been concerned

488
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,360
That went awry obviously

489
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:17,248
Not handled perfectly in the situation but it gives an explanation for why this situation is happening

490
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
Why there was cause

491
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
4

492
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
People to

493
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,624
Think that maybe

494
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
She was on house

495
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:29,792
He can't let that be it has to be a random thing where there is evil intent

496
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,096
On the part of the CPS people

497
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,632
He's lying to his audience

498
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
And it's so clear

499
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,728
When you hear him drop off right there when reading

500
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
Yeah that's

501
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
That's far

502
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
That's just

503
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,152
Fuct I'm I'm actually more

504
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,688
I'm happier when he

505
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,480
He's making s*** up whole cloth

506
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
Because that's just

507
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,296
Sad and Evil

508
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,088
Like that's an actual

509
00:31:54,624 --> 00:32:00,000
Didn't you do it also very clearly shows that he didn't read this before he

510
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,072
Decided to dedicate an entire show to

511
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,888
Auntie CPS narratives based on

512
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
Fort Lee

513
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Bolstered by

514
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
This kind

515
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,384
Bulshit seemingly precipitated by him reading this story

516
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
Pinpoint for him to have

517
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,736
A show all about the CPS of the evils of it

518
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
Fry pan

519
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
He doesn't even read it

520
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
You didn't even read it

521
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
This was before he

522
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,440
He spent three hours every morning reading

523
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,768
And then did a show and then spent 5 hours every evening read

524
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
This was before he got

525
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
Serious dad

526
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,888
And started doing a lot more drug

527
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
Yeah I'm sure

528
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,728
So this is also bulshit

529
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,560
Did I already get there

530
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,840
By this time

531
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
Oh man

532
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Wow

533
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:25,760
Alex is not telling his audience of the family it already got the kid back by the time the article he's reading was

534
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
Published

535
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,368
He's also stopping himself from disclosing the part where it says big Gates

536
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:36,768
Permanently disabled because of that shooting that he mention which truly would be even more

537
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,328
Services to be interested in providing whatever assist

538
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
Baked ham

539
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:45,472
This stuff works against Alex's narrative though so it's centered from the most uncensored

540
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,776
And most unfiltered news program in the world

541
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
Alex

542
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:54,688
Truthful

543
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,528
Not because he's a f****** the same time tunnel liar

544
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,320
Truth to power and

545
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Threatens the people

546
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,928
Hope you know I mean it is it is so weird

547
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,768
When we we can separate it because he's doing the radio show

548
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
But essentially

549
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,400
If she was there holding her baby you would be looking in their eyes screaming

550
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,192
You're never going to get that baby back

551
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
Holding anything

552
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
This is crazy

553
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:24,640
Just out of the days people are 1984 in all over the place here

554
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,344
But he's on the radio so it's like oh I don't even noticed this person isn't exact existing dryers supposed to distract you

555
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,160
Doesn't matter

556
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,464
Doesn't matter does fake emotion and

557
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
Pennywise real

558
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
Is that a

559
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Is that a conversation that we

560
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
We need to have with Alex of like other people

561
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,032
Object permanence that's definitely true

562
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,824
So yeah I don't know I

563
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
Certainly

564
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
More

565
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,528
In the present then it was the past but maybe it's maybe it's always been there

566
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:06,880
John Birch books before you teach them object permanence I think we wind up here

567
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,696
So yeah you have just

568
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
This

569
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,488
Rio

570
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,280
Nonsense

571
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
Demonstration

572
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
He's lying

573
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,424
Very intentionally about this article

574
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,472
As a way to push

575
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
His

576
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
Gcps

577
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
So

578
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
Look

579
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Goes to another break

580
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,176
Checking baby accidentally read the article

581
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:35,040
Good chance

582
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,352
But so many times

583
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
They're probably going to

584
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Andover Andover

585
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,592
Over and over again

586
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,368
Read the article

587
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
He's aware of that information now but

588
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,280
Assuming that he has read the article he now knows

589
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,864
You know the thing that he's censored himself

590
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,656
And I was just saying it's because

591
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
The guy's a cop

592
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,776
Years ago

593
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:33,152
Yeah in the line of duty permanently disabled

594
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,176
Right

595
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
So

596
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Great

597
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
Good work

598
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Yeah

599
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,368
I just think this is trash to be awful

600
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
I'm going to get even worse because

601
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,208
This whole pageant goes on for quite a while

602
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
And then Alex has a guess

603
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
And it's his water

604
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,584
Filter sponsor

605
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
That's not reverse osmosis

606
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,544
Removing

607
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
Portable is awesome

608
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,152
Always a pleasure Alex

609
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
I don't know where you get all your in

610
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
Information

611
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
Be a prodigy to get all the

612
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Stephen Curry

613
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,392
I mean

614
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,824
Yes I find it really

615
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,688
Sad I mean that they're in a commercial relationship so you don't expect necessarily

616
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,296
Weirdly like

617
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:49,696
You are so smart you got so much information than that being

618
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,768
Wolf and intentionally leave out

619
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
Information that is illuminate

620
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
About a story

621
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
There is that

622
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,424
Conman kind of feel

623
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
That you just

624
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:06,336
It's like it still blows my mind whenever you feel that actual conman feeling of that person

625
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
Something

626
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,664
Wow you are smart

627
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,064
We clearly making everything up and it's just like they got taken in the commercial relationship

628
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
Smoke

629
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,464
Yeah I would imagine that if you have reservations now is not

630
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Yeah yeah

631
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,816
To be at the other thing I was thinking about a really good point

632
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,352
Is it

633
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:34,240
Alex could recognize every piece of information about this article and still tell the story

634
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,520
He wants to tell

635
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,080
He would have a more difficult time with a chat

636
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,408
We could not paint the picture that the CPS

637
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
Is randomly just

638
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,968
Accusing people

639
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
Of

640
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,784
Beat up being on house or something

641
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,832
It ain't like you think that

642
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,160
False accusation as an excuse to steal their child

643
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:56,768
He perhaps couldn't do that but you don't have to open it up you could open it up into a like

644
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
That is not caused

645
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:04,448
To take someone's child

646
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
And

647
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,056
It's more difficult in a way that leads you to actual solution

648
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,616
It leads you to reforming

649
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,920
The the system that is there as opposed to

650
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
Creating a cartoon

651
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:21,088
Tunis version of it to be mad about in demand be demolished ultimately it just simply

652
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,392
Allows you to identify

653
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,440
As I mean

654
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
Despite Alex

655
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
Insisting that this only happen

656
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,096
Do white people it allows you to identify with somebody non-white

657
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,912
Which cannot happen on this show

658
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,192
Bear basin

659
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
So Alex Dixon call

660
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,640
People who have situations trouble with the children

661
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
Now they made it up

662
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
So he's got a call

663
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,808
And this color is having a difficult time with her child

664
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
Weird things

665
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
Things to say

666
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,440
Diagnosed

667
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
With ADH

668
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,256
What time is it

669
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Skateland

670
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
Different labels

671
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:08,192
Psychiatric labels

672
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,288
She was given to actually

673
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,616
The father who abandoned her at Birth are who has

674
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
History of abuse

675
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
In the situation.

676
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
Anda

677
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
Has been very hard

678
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,744
Well

679
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
In person

680
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
What

681
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,408
Alex Wood Faith heal

682
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
Wow

683
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:55,296
Forehead and pushed her to the floor and then when she stood up

684
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,624
She would go back and live with her mom and RJ eyes

685
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,744
I don't remember exactly where this woman is calling for a

686
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
I think

687
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,096
They're really dancing over something

688
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
If

689
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
His child was

690
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
Given

691
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,800
The custody was given to a father who hasn't been in her life who lives in a different state

692
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
There's something going on

693
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
And it's not just

694
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,200
She got these diagnosis that I disagreed with

695
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
Yeah that there's something

696
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,808
Really messed up here

697
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,344
Am dealing with

698
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:36,512
People who are telling these stories and being like yeah you're totally right

699
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
Morelia responsive

700
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,864
I mean yeah you wouldn't I wouldn't want to be like

701
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656

Say thank you for your call and then

704
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:51,104
I mean if you wanted to keep talking then you would have to ask like

705
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,503
Further probing questions like OK Google

706
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,063
You're totally right know you're totally right

707
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
Yeah

708
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,671

Just about every day is off

712
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
Why can I stop

713
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,655
Doing what I'm doing to listen and learn

714
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,703
Girlfriend

715
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,239
I lost a lot of

716
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,799
Friends along the way and I've lost a lot of my family

717
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
Yeah

718
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,695
That is a bummer

719
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
That's called

720
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
Yeah

721
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
Yeah

722
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,375
Boy I study your broadcast

723
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:50,495
And I told people in my life about it and I've lost friends and family

724
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
Yeah

725
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
When you start

726
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
With

727
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
Bye

728
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,895
Child was sent to live with a

729
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
Father she didn't

730
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
Really no

731
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,783
In a different state and then end with

732
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,159
I've lost friends and family because I tell them all about what Alex Jones says all the time

733
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,231
Then I mean you're starting to put

734
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:17,631
Some things together. That's not the full picture it's so bad for I know Alex Can't Behave any

735
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:23,263
The other way really but it's so bad for him to be like yeah that's cuz they can't handle the truth they love worship together

736
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,823
Yeah you've just doubling down on this

737
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
This abusive influence

738
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,503
Yeah you're never going to see a cult leader be like Hey listen you might be going a little bit too far with my b******* about you step back

739
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,855
Lights go out go go hang out with your friends at the at the Sonic

740
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:44,255
Or whatever it is you kids do and then come back and we'll get back into this called this is supposed to be a fun con

741
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,327
You're really bugging me out later

742
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:53,727
I'm just trying to screw people out of money and now you're telling me I'm hurting others so

743
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,311
Is it going to be time for me to look in the mirror but I will

744
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
Triumph

745
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:04,479
Deal I'll deal with my wounds by rubbing money on them that I feel better

746
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Buy another house

747
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
So

748
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,295
That's a bummer

749
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,831
And I think we need to

750
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,647
Feel a little bit better by going to something a little more fun

751
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
It is

752
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
It's time

753
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,511
To go to Alex's memories of his past

754
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,399
Corner there's a fun story about Alex in high school

755
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,127
Call Art

756
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,151

More

759
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,903
4 year Junior

760

That is a joke

761
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,431
That's why

762
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,511
Police

763
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:27,935
That's so true upright their man's like Mike has a joke

764
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:31,519
Like what in the 2,000

765
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:37,919
Three man they were born for each other they really we're barely Alex

766
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:44,319
Perfect grades and basically every class and also he's constantly having sex with

767
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,343
Fellow students

768
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
I'm getting abortions

769
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:52,767
And he's a Satanist by the elite in Rockwall

770
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,351
That's me of being the linchpin and God's plans to Vanquish the devil

771
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,375
Also at

772
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:03,775
Some point in the middle he uncovered a drug-dealing conspiracy to Rockwall Police Department who threatened to kill him

773
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,079
Austin the constants

774
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:09,407
Street fights because black people wouldn't stop harassing him because he was white

775
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,455
Right also you smoke crack a couple times

776
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:17,855
Amazing almost unbelievable backstory unbelievable is the operative

777
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:24,255
Words are forever to self mythology I would say a little bit over stuff

778
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:29,375
If I was if I was describing the plot of this movie here I would say overstep streamline

779
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:35,775
Streamline focus on a few important details I didn't get good grades in high school and I did end up dropping out before

780
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,591
I went to college

781
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:42,687
But I was friends with a lot of nerds and

782
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:47,039
I knew I was friends with the guy who was the valedictorian of the class before me

783
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,087
Year older than me

784
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
And

785
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,951
Look they don't just choose one person who gets accolades

786
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
There's like

787
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:01,631
First of all I dropped out of high school and it was a National Merit scholar

788
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,215
National Merit Scholars are all kinds of people who get scholarships

789
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
College scores

790
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:10,335
There's the valedictorian there's like a dick sometimes co-valedictorian

791
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
There are

792
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
The other like oomloud

793
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,199
Even like in high school

794
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,735
Like I remember there being a

795
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,527
For people who are like

796
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:24,927
The like not not like president vice president Treasurer and secretary

797
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,975
People who were who were like

798
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:34,143
Real damn good grace

799
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,191
Borderline Braun silver

800
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:40,031
Gold medals kind of situation

801
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:46,431
Also in high school my buddy Cole he helped out with the counselor's office going around and delivering passes to students

802
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,223
To an appointment so they could be

803
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,831
It would be counted as tardy or truant in their class and I do definitely didn't have all A's

804
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,647
He doesn't open. And the counselors likes him

805
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:59,487
But I guess now it's okay if they're really trying to secretly deputize him or some

806
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,583
I think that would have been the first like we've talked about the

807
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,167
The school-to-prison pipeline but we don't talk about the school to globalism pipe

808
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,823
Right through the counselor's office are not busy

809
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
Lovecore

810
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,895
I would sometimes come and help him

811
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,431
Hand out passes cuz

812
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:25,087
Skip class

813
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,415
That is great

814
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:34,815
That is great that was much darker collegial relationship

815
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,375
Three teachers and students in high school that was not the case for

816
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:42,239
Is very very confrontational

817
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,543
I feel like I know it went both ways

818
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,127
For me some teachers is very confrontational then some

819
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,175
Far more like

820
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:56,831
Treated treated you like a almost like a little equals now

821
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:01,695
My favorite teacher did say like well if they didn't f*** around with you then you they would have had a problem

822
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:08,095
As like a like that's probably not what you should tell to a fourteen-year-old avanade probably not but I mean

823
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:12,191
You did have a point around with me and we had a great time

824
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,495
Broadcast production class

825
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,823
The teacher guy named Ron with B

826
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
Auntie

827
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,175
I was in the class 3 years in high school

828
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,223
Key to the room

829
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,271
Because I had like an editing Bay

830
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:31,391
And so I would come like after hours and edit video on Hangouts

831
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
Mostly just

832
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,695
Just about

833
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:37,279
Making stories for the public access

834
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,071
Like there was a

835
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,607
Show called 16 minutes

836
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:47,007
Haha that was the schools at the students make stories about the local community

837
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:53,407
60 minutes but you only get 60

838
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:59,807
And so I would go nothing but you're still a fourteen-year-old I just want the story about how secretly Cheska

839
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,879
Club was like a hotbed of Communism at the high school

840
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
It's all I had my friend Matt

841
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:11,071
Pretend to be like a plant and like one of the guys in the chess club was a friend of mine until he played along

842
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:17,471
Decorate the guy who sponsored the chess club like the teacher and I house on friendly terms are game is messing around

843
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,799
Three aired

844
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
Music

845
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,383
I would always

846
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,431
You're killing me

847
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:33,087
But you'd still be still put it on that's good stuff I like it I like that

848
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
Okay

849
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:37,695
That's that's a good teacher move where you like you're doing this wrong but also

850
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,255
Come on baby on the screen

851
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,583
Alex

852
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:50,751
Gestapo for the counselor's office or something

853
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,519
Lie about

854
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,543
Why

855
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,591
Why would you lie about it

856
00:50:55,103 --> 00:51:01,247
Incredibly insecure

857
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:06,367
All of the information on the test was because the batter information was everywhere else

858
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:13,023
Yeah yeah I mean I think if you do well in school and you're proud of it this is nothing

859
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,815
To be ashamed of

860
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
I think

861
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,935
That if you didn't do well in school and you're lying about it because

862
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,495
You want people to think you did well in school that's not good

863
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
Stop doing that

864
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
Hey listen

865
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,127

866
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,431
See Now We're Off to the Races buddy

867
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
Easy peasy

Eminem line stupid rich is f****** proud of it

869
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,647
Another story from his youth

870
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,183
In school

871
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
Amazon's a little bit longer

872
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,999
Just a little bit

873
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:50,399
Confusing to the store like what the fuc

874
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:54,239
He should be allowed to say that

875
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,223
And we have some

876
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111

Call your mother

Alex was kind of sick

891
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,271
Not that sick

892
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,831
Wanted to go home anyways so he's going to give his mom a call

00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,327
Like I couldn't swallow pills

910
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
I didn't know what was going on I

911
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,399
And had it before

912
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:37,727
And so like I have terrible fever and

913
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,543
So the guy who was the doctor that

914
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,103
Gave me some liquid

915
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,919
Steroids

916
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,967
And he did say

917
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:48,991
Careful

918
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:53,087
This is what the rappers rap about

919
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:58,719
That's the way you do it it's not like he was trying to give me bro

920
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:05,119
That was a little bit inappropriate but in a delightful what I really enjoyed it

921
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:08,191
The very what would I say

922
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,775
Uptight way of describing this is what the rappers rap about

923
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,311
He might have said the rapper is sing about

924
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:21,247
That's that taking up another level wasn't like an old out-of-touch person or anything

925
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,551
Dreaming of it is freezing was still weird

926
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:27,391
Play I can still remember that 20 years later that delightful moment where I'm like

927
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:32,767
Hundred something fever just like unable to swallow a pill

928
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:37,119
Hey this is the purple stuff every now and again there are those moments where I'm like

929
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,679
What if I could run into that person

930
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:43,775
You know after it's cuz there's tons of those little memories you have or you're like

931
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:47,871
This person has no idea that because they flipped a penny at me

932
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:54,015
20 years ago at that is in my brain forever like I want to go talk to them and have them have that

933
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,063
Very validating feeling up

934
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,111
I have no idea what you're talkin about

935
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:04,511
Probably come off real crazy because you would do be like

936
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:10,655
Remember this at all but I need to bother you

937
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:16,543
So we get the we had a fun time in that corner of Alex's remembrance

938
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,079
Nonsense

939
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,103
Where was the state

940
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:25,759
The man that story not exist in all of these actually the school nurse was working on behalf

941
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:32,159
Check on speed in order to take him away.

942
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,719
You going to be so important in the plot of battle later on

943
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,511
We've installed it

944
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,559
Smell something really f***** up happy

945
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,607
Okay I can't believe this happened

946
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,167
Alex has

947
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
The dad

948
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,751
From The Denver Post story on as a guest

949
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,519
No

950
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,079
No

951
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
And

952
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,903
Of course

953
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,863
On the show

954
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,159
So yeah

955
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
Which is crazy

956
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:41,535
Because this is so much more disrespectful

957
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
They had booked

958
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,327
To them as guess

959
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,375
That show

960
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,215
I was I was floored by the

961
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:55,615
That's why I said if you do like a nightly talk show I didn't I didn't I didn't think that Jon Stewart red ever

962
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,895
Free book of the purse

963
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:03,295
And he was interviewing that night he did his best for everybody I bet

964
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:04,831
Some people might

965
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:10,719
Equate to a

966
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,767
Stay single article

967
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:18,655
More than a thousand words of every single one of those books I will guarantee it

968
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:25,055
That goes interviews are probably booked pretty well in advance about this is like this is 2,000

969
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:29,407
Wife is probably booking the show right I mean like

970
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,711
He doesn't have a big team at this

971
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,991
He doesn't have his.

972
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,599
How did this happen

973
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,647
I understand

974
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
The booking happy

975
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:45,023
Chat makes sense to me you can reach out to them see if they want to come out and do an interview

976
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
Absolutely

977
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,095
How does it happen

978
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,655
That you know you're going to do this interview

979
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,447
And you don't read the article

980
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,263
You with the story

981
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
Essentially

982
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,079
How is it that you

983
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,127
Didn't even have somebody

984
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,151
Give you the

985
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,431
CliffsNotes version

986
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,455
Of the article

987
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,551
Yeah you know how to get the correct yourself that got their kids

988
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,831
I mean that's crazy

989
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:15,487
That's essential thing to the story how do you seem to be caught off guard in the middle of the story that the guy is

990
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,255
Is a cop

991
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,815
Yeah that's not good enough but the pretty big detail

992
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,423
They don't talk about the past homelessness

993
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:29,311
Steers away from a lot of the like Jermaine issues

994
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
Hey

995
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,127
Let's talk about how evil beef if you want to talk

996
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,687
Normally social worker

997
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:51,839
Or

998
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,607
What's

999
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
I believe

1000
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,703
Stepdaughter

1001
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,471
Call Wade

1002
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,263
Out in the hallway

1003
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
What went on

1004
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,127
Charge nurse

1005
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,919
That wasn't charged

1006
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,479
Or there

1007
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,575
Can get her purse

1008
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:17,183
Stayed in the room

1009
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,567
Should have the robot

1010
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
Outlaw Way

1011
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,151
I was going to say what is the vampiric celebrate

1012
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,199
What's the robot because it's dehumanizing

1013
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,527
It's taking a human and think about the characteristics of a robot

1014
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,063
Do vampires

1015
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,855
Traditionally what robot

1016
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
Yes

1017
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,183
I did not know that okay

1018
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,463
In an Alex is

1019
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,767
World the metaphorical robot

1020
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:59,167
Metaphorical vampires want little robots along the lines of life

1021
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,983
Ray Lewis's celebration dance

1022
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,031
Cuz this is 2003 right

1023
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:07,615
Do Ray Lewis and the Baltimore Ravens still reckon the world

1024
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,175
You know yeah and so I'm assuming that

1025
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:10,943
Like

1026
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,503
The door

1027
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:19,903
And then like did one of the things you know what I'm saying have you seen the

1028
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,183
If I have not

1029
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,999
Yeah I don't know I don't know what they're doing

1030
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,791
Yeah Alex just wants

1031
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:32,191
To create these images these like evil images that are evocative for the odd

1032
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:35,007
The spelling is good for bringing those up

1033
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,287
And

1034
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:40,895
Selling them to the audience important

1035
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,431
Before he's

1036
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
Like he's talking

1037
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,991
To the father and the father

1038
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,039
Is trying to tell the story

1039
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,623
And so whenever Alex says like all she was smiling wasn't

1040
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,391
He's like

1041
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:57,535
Well I mean she did leave the so he's implanted into that guy's mind before we even go any further

1042
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,583
That it's possible in fact

1043
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,375
Likely and then later

1044
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:08,031
Guaranteed and true that you did the charge nurse was talk

1045
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:13,919
Did you think it was inappropriate what went on in the room the conversation that the

1046
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,735
That the CPS people had with the mother

1047
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,319
It's unclear but it doesn't really matter on the show because it's all just

1048
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,879
Does fuel on the fire of

1049
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,415
Evading CPS Yelp

1050
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,743
So what are the things that is clear

1051
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,535
Is that the

1052
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
Reverend

1053
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,607
McGinnis and his father are both

1054
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,655
Upset with the CPS

1055
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,679
And

1056
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:40,031
One of the things that they want to make clear is that there should be ways

1057
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:40,799
2

1058
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,079
Stop these

1059
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:44,639
Processes when they're being done in error

1060
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:48,479
You know they're not talking about overthrowing the CPS

1061
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,831
Right if there is something that is erroneous

1062
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:57,439
Outdated information to people are acting on their Speedway to put a Holt in the preceding

1063
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:01,279
So they don't go so far as to remove a child's

1064
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,303
I when you're just

1065
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,375
Going to have them away for 24 hours or what

1066
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
Like its

1067
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,423
There should be safe

1068
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,215
Basically

1069
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:15,103
He wanted to say that there many dedicated social worker

1070
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,967
Remember what we

1071
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,759
We are really short

1072
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
About

1073
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,831
Is that there's no mechanism

1074
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,695
I think you're listening audience

1075
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,583
Weekend

1076
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,863
Slowing down

1077
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,959
Is the

1078
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:44,799
Weight speed

1079
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,007
Illustrates the dynamic

1080
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
Titanfall

1081
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,615
If there is in a campaign

1082
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,919
It is

1083
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,687
Legitimate

1084
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,295
A request

1085
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:32,159
Something that is a structural Improvement that I don't even people within the CPS to be like

1086
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
You know what

1087
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,231
That is something that needs to be dry

1088
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,023
We could do a better job

1089
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:41,631
If you just said to a regular CPS employee all day everyday just like hey

1090
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,447
Maybe we don't rip newborns from their mothers hands

1091
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,983
Like maybe we just don't do that

1092
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,775
They be like yeah I think that makes sense

1093
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,079
And Alex has a different take on it

1094
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,895
Burn it all town I'm very.

1095
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,455
And you can see that Alex doesn't respect his guests

1096
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,991
Perspective

1097
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,527
To get them tubes

1098
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:00,575
Mirror his perspective

1099
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
Because that's what

1100
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:06,207
And that's what we'll sell the feeling to the audience that he needs to sell them in order to keep them

1101
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:13,119
In that cult like state but Drew bump this out earlier

1102
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,959
He's a little bit like he's trying to redpill them at the same time

1103
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,567
We're at the trial you know he's trying to redpill the jury anything

1104
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,591
He's doing it like

1105
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:29,247
On the phone right here is like don't you guys want to help start a f****** w**** like no started

1106
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,551
I started it on us

1107
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,855
So this was the 8th

1108
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,647
Maya Friday

1109
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:41,279
I'm going to jump to the MonDay show because it's kind of also a wasteland not much going on

1110
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,559
But

1111
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,583
There is something

1112
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,863
Really big

1113
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
Going on

1114
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,423
Call Joseph Watson

1115
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,359
It is order out of Chaos

1116
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,199
Order 300

1117
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,831
Infowars.com

1118
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
Improved

1119
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,927
You are secure online

1120
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,023
So please don't take advantage of that

1121
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,863
The Doctor David

1122
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,143
Murder

1123
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
My murder

1124
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,799
Not with no evidence

1125
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
Botanica

1126
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
Preponderance

1127
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:38,367
So this is about a month after Kelly died and Alex's presented literally no new information passed the big insinuations

1128
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,671
Used to call Kelly's death of murder when he first cover

1129
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:45,535
This is something that the Alex Jones is always right about stuff crowd should really think about

1130
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,815
Are these

1131
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,607
Protracted long

1132
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,191
Nonsense narratives that he gets up to

1133
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,263
Also I love the way that Alex catches himself mid-sentence there

1134
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:01,663
He said that the media is calling Kelly's death a suicide with no proof and he almost said so we're going to call it a murder with no proof

1135
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:05,503
You already did he really did have a certain amount of like

1136
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:10,111
Yeah if they're going to do it then I'll do it right back to manners

1137
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,391
There right there

1138
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,695
Also Paul's book is out

1139
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:19,839
And that is just an opportunity for me to say that in my hand I have a copy of the great reset Alex's book

1140
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:26,495
Oh my God I unfortunately did buy a copy of it

1141
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:32,383
Money which honestly it's just me cutting myself and sword

1142
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,175
But a

1143
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:40,575
It sucks a little bit of that it's not good

1144
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,367
Tell at a later date

1145
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,415
It's maybe the next time we have some like

1146
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,975
Really Monumental episode number like

1147
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
7

1148
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,559
48

1149
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:55,167
720 something something like that we're doing

1150
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,215
Some random number

1151
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,031
37 OVR flight up

1152
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:06,431
We'll fly out of 750 7777 really don't know how high it goes

1153
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:12,063
Is there a 787 nobody 777 that's like a lottery that's like it's true

1154
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,367
4777 not to wish account

1155
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
What we would cover

1156
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,743
Sodas balls

1157
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,047
But the David Kelly narrative

1158
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,327
Is now growing

1159
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:29,983
It is no longer just that this was a guy who's going to blow the whistle about the Iraq War and be weapons of mass destruction

1160
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:34,079
He's hanging out with Saddam Hussein's kids no no no but it goes deep

1161
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,575
Free Press

1162
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,391
Abrasive

1163
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:48,927
Morton,

1164
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:57,119
Yeah so now well recall Kelly being unvaulted race-specific Sister, you worked at Porton down and that means that

1165
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:04,031
Is there a specific people are dying

1166
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:06,591
And David Kelly is an example of one of the murderers

1167
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,663
To cover up their race specific bioweapon

1168
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,199
Because they're about to release it

1169
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,271
There is a preoccupation that Alex has with

1170
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:19,391
Race specific by I wonder what race it is he reaches

1171
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
Warts

1172
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,975
Race specific

1173
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,815
I have some theories as it is ironic that he's

1174
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,887
He's never been like and you know what would be terrible

1175
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,423
A race specific

1176
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,055
Not by a weapon that is a bioweapon for all other non raised was over by 11 you know what I'm saying

1177
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,847
That's kind of what he wants

1178
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,127
Well think it's

1179
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,943
I think the people who don't listen to his show much

1180
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:47,039
You might hear some of the the covid stuff

1181
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:52,671
Let's say like especially in the early days of covid-19 like as a racist a bioweapon

1182
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
And you think like

1183
01:10:53,951 --> 01:11:00,095
That's an interesting angle he's going on right now

1184
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,631
Free specific bioweapon

1185
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,911
Are always

1186
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:09,567
Somehow he'll play it's always been like at the end of the

1187
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,335
The Dayman

1188
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,639
White people

1189
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,455
Are the only people that matter

1190
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,271
That's what he's trying to get across that's his

1191
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,807
His raison d'etre

1192
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,087
So Paul is on

1193
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,903
Little bit

1194
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,439
But Alex has a

1195
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,975
Another little little Theory

1196
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,279
Exercising panda

1197
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,071
We'll also

1198
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,095
Hear it

1199
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,191
About a half-mile from where I'm at

1200
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,487
Thumbprint you already

1201
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,071
And

1202
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:03,839
Whoomp There It Is

1203
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
Eminem

1204
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,687
About a year ago

1205
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,967
They pulled out

1206
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,503
And I have about 15 Lanes

1207
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,343
Where it would be self-serving

1208
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,471
Then they put the song

1209
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,031
I mean

1210
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,383
Filter have DNR

1211
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,455
Michael

1212
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,503
Denise Denise

1213
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,271
Selfie

1214
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
Supermarket

1215
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,439
The government

1216
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:15,263
Still waiting on those phones scanners in police ID databases to go into the grocery store is 19 years later here

1217
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,031
Carlos cards

1218
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,311
Like 3 years ago

1219
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,359
Honestly

1220
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:25,759
If you don't sign the back of your debit or credit card when you use it people are supposed to ask for your ID and they don't do that

1221
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:31,391
What was going on here in Alex's. Maybe wasn't real thing

1222
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:34,463
Maybe the move towards automation was more about cutting down operating

1223
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,511
Expenses by eliminating human workers

1224
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,119
Also I assumed that Alex's describing Israel

1225
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,167
It was a woman just whatever

1226
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:46,495
I don't want to talk to you

1227
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,543
Football teams have no idea what he's talking

1228
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:54,943
Right now McDonald's can refuse to serve you for any reason as long as it's not because you're a member of a protected

1229
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,711
The class

1230
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:58,527
If someone's making a scene they can be refused service

1231
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:01,343
If you suspected someone's drunk you can refuse service

1232
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,927
Barefoot or wearing no shirt you can refusing service

1233
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:11,839
As long as you're not discriminating based on protected classes you have the right to run your business how you see fit like for instance

1234
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:16,959
It's not illegal for a high-end restaurant to refuse to serve you if you don't fit their dress code

1235
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:21,823
More like a hotel can. Take a reservation from you if you stay there before you cause the problem

1236
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,103
They can do that

1237
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,151
Get refused service said you have that right

1238
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:31,295
Politeknik Lisa isn't it to putting in self-checkout is about being able to deny purchase of some particular product but this makes

1239
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,063
WhatsApp

1240
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:38,463
If you suggesting that I might one day go to McDonald's and they refuse to sell me anything but a McChicken because they think I'm high

1241
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,999
I had too much red meat that day

1242
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:46,399
But that seems that it's the self-checkout things

1243
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,191
It's doing it then that would say

1244
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,471
Suggest to me that you're

1245
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,007
Bringing all of these items

1246
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,287
You're checking

1247
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,127
And you get it items that they're like not a

1248
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,663
You don't get to buy eggs

1249
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:04,063
Right like I don't understand I went in and how is that helpful there's not even a person there to stop it

1250
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,879
I could just steal it and put it in my bed

1251
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:11,487
Break from the self-checkout line by accident all the time

1252
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:17,887
David Drake has that joke about everything is bananas bananas

1253
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,447
But lock it is actually about this

1254
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:28,639
That's making it

1255
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,759
Depending on what you're getting

1256
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,879
Unless you buy

1257
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,703
Report

1258
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:56,543
So this is dumb but also tracking

1259
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,615
Your purchases of food would have no effect

1260
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:04,223
Being able to protect the supply chain from any kind of terrorist influence

1261
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:10,623
That's right like the consumer end of it wouldn't make any sense as an excuse for them I find the sun compared

1262
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:14,719
Yeah you know it is it is like it is

1263
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:18,303
So stupid especially now that we know about metadata

1264
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:21,119
You know like before they had no

1265
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:24,447
Can track you if they have a chip on your finger and it's like now man

1266
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,775
Because your cellphone is someplace

1267
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,591
They can figure out what your day is like

1268
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,871
Easily

1269
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,639
Just done

1270
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:39,039
Your cellphone exist so they know where everyone is go there is some amount of data that is

1271
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,575
It is not

1272
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:44,159
Toby level that Paul is predicting in the next

1273
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,951
It's not Enemy of the State

1274
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:49,279
Starring Will Smith

1275
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,839
I mean it's far beyond that even

1276
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,863
DePaul

1277
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,751
Play music

1278
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,775
With the new development

1279
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,103
Predicting the everyone

1280
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,383
LifeLock fix

1281
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,199
Brainwave

1282
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,039
Is it recorded

1283
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,439
Macy

1284
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,535
Few weeks ago

1285
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,583
Every breath

1286
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
Brothers

1287
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,751
MRI scanner

1288
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,775
It look in your brain

1289
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,103
Come over to speak with you

1290
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,127
Samantha

1291
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,943
You're lying

1292
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,551
Is a great example of Alex is an idiot and stupid

1293
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:49,951
He's saying that there are MRIs in the airport and then reporting it as some kind of a plan to detect aggression or nefarious intent

1294
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,719
10 people

1295
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,743
This is insane

1296
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,535
But it's based on a kernel of Truth

1297
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,607
Which is the MRI technology is used in airports

1298
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,399
It's used to scan bags

1299
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:03,007
Because the idea of human application of moriann airport is laughable

1300
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:09,663
Have you ever had an MRI done you'll know that is a complicated process where you are put into a big machine and then you have to say

1301
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:16,319
Completely still or else you'll ruin the pictures that the doctor is taking inside your head angrily yell

1302
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:20,671
Velvet you have to give people like sedative

1303
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:27,327
Imagining that you could effectively use MRI technology on something not staying completely still is absurd

1304
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:30,399
And it would pretty much be useless in a crowded Airport terminal

1305
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:35,007
One of the primary applications of MRI Tech in the airport has to do with Screamin liquid

1306
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:38,335
It's because that's something that x-rays are not traditionally very good with

1307
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:41,663
Also 19 years later and Paul's 10-year predictions look

1308
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:47,039
City cuz I mean like yes there are things like data that's collect

1309
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,831
There are things

1310
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,855
About

1311
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,647
Concerns about

1312
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,671
Things listening

1313
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,951
Or what have you

1314
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,255
Even though that may be true

1315
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,559
That is a far cry from every

1316
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:05,215
Conversation you have being recorded by the government database rag heartbeat that you have

1317
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,263
This is like a system that is

1318
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,311
First of all

1319
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,847
Would not be useful

1320
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,615
Exactly

1321
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,431
That's the thing about it

1322
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:18,783
That we did that we do know for a fact evil folks would have

1323
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:25,439
No use for that it would it would be too much it's too much information to find anything

1324
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:29,023
White sweeping programs like when they start looking into how much used

1325
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,303
They get out of it it's like

1326
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:33,375
No now your signal-to-noise ratio is

1327
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,423
All know if you have everyone

1328
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,471
Heartbeat login something

1329
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,543
I don't know what the heck are you listening to

1330
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:46,943
Everyone in every single conversation and every breath

1331
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:48,991
Cool

1332
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,831
Anyway. Just to check in on you make sure you're okay

1333
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,623
Strong predictions

Are going to end this episode with like I said the 11th

1336
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,023
There's not much

1337
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,327
But there's something

1338
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,351
Flocking

1339
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,119
Awesome

1340
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,143
And it

1341
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,959

All the other men.

1352
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,664
Crowded around

1353

Gold

1361
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,456
Greenlight is here

1362
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,784
I got an old episode of

1363
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,088
I can't think of anything

1364
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,624
Dumber

1365
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,904
Tammy person

1366
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:38,304
Then the idea that you are going to pull up an old Frasier episode as proof of whatever argument you or May

1367
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
Yeah

1368
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,096
The end

1369
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,936
I am

1370
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,984
Depressed cuz I was a bummer

1371
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,776
So

1372
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:54,176
Is a great opportunity for me to go watch an episode of Frasier

1373
01:21:55,456 --> 01:22:01,600
Note with Kelsey Grammer but I put that aside and just enjoy what it is

1374
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,392
X-Men the dudes Beast

1375
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
Fine

1376
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,440
Not a good Beast not a good beat

1377
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,536
Plot of this episode

1378
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,096
Goes to a shooting range

1379
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,168
Because his dad was a former cop right

1380
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:18,496
Snow gacha

1381
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:22,848
Yeah there's a reason for

1382
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:23,872
Lip doesn't want to shoot

1383
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,688
He does

1384
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,016
People who are at the booth next to him

1385
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
Come on

1386
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,392
Encouraging

1387
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:40,768
Gets a little love Bob

1388
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:47,168
Doesn't want to go because he's like I you know I go about once it once again I've had enough

1389
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:49,984
Niles goes he makes friends with these guys who are there

1390
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,800
If they end up inviting him to a gun show

1391
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:59,456
And so the dad and Beth made decide to go along the gun show

1392
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,064
He's going to get a like

1393
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,624
Ankle holster in Daphne

1394
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,440
And so it's all good time

1395
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:13,024
Niles goes away for a minute and the guys

1396
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,304
Forgotten friends

1397
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,584
I'm over it

1398
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,144
Hey they say something about the New World Order

1399
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,448
Anti

1400
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,264
Do use are these our militia types

1401
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,336
Wow weirdos

1402
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:28,128
Until they tell Niles like hey

1403
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,688
You don't want to hang out with these people they're not

1404
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,224
They're not your

1405
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:32,992
Certipay

1406
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:39,392
Traffic when I make intellectual friends you don't like my friends and now I weigh cool friends and you don't like my friends

1407
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:45,792
I'm going to hang out with these guys and there's no compound in Idaho

1408
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:52,192
He walks over to them at the gun show right there like around a piece of paper

1409
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,008
The plans for the generator

1410
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,824
We're going to need the New World Order comes out

1411
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,360
Oh okay

1412
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:06,016
So yeah there's a good

1413
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:09,344
Justin episode about how sometimes they're those militia types

1414
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,440
Buy a show that was famous for being famous in the 90s during

1415
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:19,072
When all those militia types were everywhere little late

1416
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,352
Yeah

1417
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,144
Yeah but I also think that

1418
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,704
Elks fairly often

1419
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:27,008
Freezer one of the jokes

1420
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,544
Is there snobby

1421
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:33,664
Better day or the butt of a joke because they judge people too quickly

1422
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:34,688
Often time

1423
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:38,272
And dials or boat they have to deal with like

1424
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:41,088
Are snooty presumptions about people

1425
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,624
Are not right

1426
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:47,744
I thought that for sure that was what this was going to be but just

1427
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,120
Overthrow the Government Street and Niles almost accidentally went to Idaho

1428
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:59,520
Should not go to Idaho place that Nile should not be involved in it

1429
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,824
Also be plot

1430
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,592
Yeah

1431
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,944

1432
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,528
Enter she's going to stop being Frasier's producer

1433
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,552
Yeah

1434
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:13,600
Start of a bigot

1435
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,928
Justin Bieber lot for the for that up

1436
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:20,256
Answer Frasier is making out with Felicity Huffman

1437
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:25,376
I don't know who her character is I've forgotten what she is on the show baby

1438
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,912
Yeah they're getting hot and heavy

1439
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,960
How long did Frasier run for

1440
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,752
Wow

1441
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,056
Cheese's people used to just watch anything

1442
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,360
Fraser's fun

1443
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,128
Sure

1444
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:41,760
I don't know if it was just because I had been listening to Infowars I switched over to research

1445
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:47,136
Yeah you made you made all your snobby friends

1446
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:50,464
Edmark your cool friends I get it I see how it is

1447
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,304
So anyway we come to the end of this Andy and Alex

1448
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,376
We got some interesting view into his childhood

1449
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:01,472
Paul's book is out.

1450
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,520
To take away from this

1451
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:07,616
The control of information that Alex has in order to

1452
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:12,480
I'll tell his narratives and his stories the way he wants the audience to experience

1453
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,248
GameStop

1454
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:16,576
He doesn't give access to the full picture

1455
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,856
Because if you did

1456
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,392
He would have a harder time telling

1457
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,416
The story that he wants to

1458
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,184
Patel

1459
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,512
Not the mark of somebody who's straight up

1460
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
Nope

1461
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
Because he's a liar

1462
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,352
Battle

1463
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,912
I'm trying to get across

1464
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,728
The other point is that

1465
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,776
Cult leaders are scary man

1466
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,080
Cult leaders are scary when you are

1467
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,360
I can't

1468
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:42,432
Cuz that's the thing that I really could never get across

1469
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,200
Forget past

1470
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:45,504
You know that moment where somebody says do you like

1471
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:48,576
I've left my family and my friends behind

1472
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,904
And you have to look them in the eyes and be like that was a great move

1473
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,232
You know what's really weird about it is

1474
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,584
Someone saying I left my family and friends behind

1475
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,608
Is

1476
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,144
Takes a little bit of

1477
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,704
Try not to different.

1478
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,776
All my friends and family have left

1479
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,848
Because I'm too right

1480
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,128
That's a diluted

1481
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:14,688
Person who doesn't realize

1482
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:17,504
True true

1483
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:20,576
Yeah they're in a well I mean that's

1484
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,880
Kind of funny there in a secret cult

1485
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,160
That is hidden

1486
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,696
From the rest of society

1487
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:28,000
Controlled by a small group of people

1488
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,536
Ina

1489
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:36,192
A nondescript studio in Austin Well actually this was in Round Rock he was in that Johnson Millers

1490
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,216
Studio

1491

Yeah it was on the road broadcasting on this one

1492
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,872
So your theory Falls

1493
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:45,920
So Jordan
