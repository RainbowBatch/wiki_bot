1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damned important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge by now.

00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
Knowledge vype.com

5
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,976
Everybody welcome

6
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Little bit

7
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,960
That's right we do Jordan

8
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,872
What is the first time you ever felt achievement

9
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,016
The first time you want to race

10
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
Literally crazy I know this specifically it pop directly to my mind and I'll tell you what it is Dan

11
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
Equestrian

12
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
I understand that the rhetorical technique I remember in

13
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
1

14
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
Week

15
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
I want a personal pan

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
Too many for one

17
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,064
All out I don't think I read a book again for like 6

18
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,952
I read all of the books and that was the first time that I truly felt like I did

19
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
I bet f

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,704
The rest of the class kicked your ass

21
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,032
You're correct

22
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,920
Just absolute disgust like I read so much

23
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,712
That sort of embarrassed the rest

24
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,112
The tears the Macarena cancel

25
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,256
That was not a sense of achievement for me as much as it was

26
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,656
There was another

27
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
Woman

28
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
Head always

29
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
Read more books than everybody else

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
She was like famous in the class

31
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,992
For being famous

32
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
The whole school

33
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
And I kicked your ass

34
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:13,280
Wow

35
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,840
Bizzy Bone easy on you

36
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,192
Okay so yeah they're probably like I don't know

37
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,592
Ramona Quimby Age 8

38
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,480
Jensen

39
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
Today something that isn't okay

40
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
That's not bad

41
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,984
Taking over this episode

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,824
Had to give people a little bit of context

43
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
Listen to present episode for Friday about Alex's

44
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,344
Intensity in the present

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,672
So I felt like it would be kind of repetitive and not really

46
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
Serve anyone's interests all that well

47
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:21,119
Simultaneously I thought it would be kind of abusive to go and do another Boston bombing episode

48
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,703
Keep going

49
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
Like a light

50
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,383
Mnml you know somebody's Wacky Wednesday folks are bringing it there's nothing really good over project Campbell Atlanta

51
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
Reverend Manning I don't really think that guy

52
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
Dave's boring shitt

53
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,463
A lot of these other candidates just really aren't all that interesting someone like a Steven Crowder you know we can't do an episode about him

54
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,863
No joke I considered number these over

55
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
White supremacist typo

56
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
You'll have to talk about cuz they are overt with a little bit of

57
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,063
You guys are being raised

58
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,463
Okay criticism a little bit perfect

59
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,911
Let Jordan take over and seen what happened it's the one day of the year Dan remembers

60
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,311
I think I will relearn that once again will find out I don't know anything about what you're going to do

61
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,711
No except I have a hunch that'll be probably surrounding one of your big picadillos

62
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Main issues

63
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,367
Redwall

64
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:52,255
Weird weird

65
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Yeah

66
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
Conor friedersdorf

67
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:03,263
Partially because Twitter fight with you

68
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,151
Just responded to you it was lovely to call him

69
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,759
That was one of the most surreal things ever

70
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,975
He's not wilting for this

71
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
Punches right back if it's a nationally syndicated

72
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:34,751
Backed out at 8 p.m.

73
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,311
The combination of both of those things

74
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,639
Insignificant weirdos day

75
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Mark Moreno

76
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
Is a giant pizza

77
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,927
Certainly what you went over on the last time you took over the show

78
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
Not just

79
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Ever needs

80
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
To speak to Mike Moreno Everett

81
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
I will get to that proof

82
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,959
It just one moment

83
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,543
So first of all Thomas

84
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,199
I heard about a nap, that I was just really pissed him off

85
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,831
I won't do that to this very kind Donuts

86
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,695
Next

87
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:31,327
Episode

88
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,399
Text Journal about was you want

89
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,031
Text Gianluca

90
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
Look up

91
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:54,111
Wonderful technocrat

92
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,399
Money off at heroin

93
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,263
Freakishly large

94
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,783
I would like

95
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
Button set for the show

96
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:33,535
It's all you buddy

97
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
Sure counter program

98
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:50,687
That makes sense just called lord monckton

99
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,599
Out of context

100
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:05,791
We can go to Walmart by so we can stop this nonsense about the green New Deal

101
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Alright

102
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
That's my favorite

103
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:18,079
Express renewable energies and we would need a green New Deal

104
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,919
Okay as a sarcastic aside

105
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,319
Is just like sure they say that we need renewable energy

106
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
We can stop the green New Deal

107
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
I was just

108
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,767
Absolutely surreal

109
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
He shows up

110
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
And Friends

111
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
Morning

112
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,775
It is filled with type of Dum Dums are going to allow him

113
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
To say

114
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
Absolutely ridiculous

115
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
Sure

116
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
But do you think about him

117
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
Is if you are booking him

118
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
In 29

119
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
You know exactly what he's going to

120
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
Completely invalid

121
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
He has nothing new

122
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
He has nothing that hasn't been debunked

123
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
A million times

124
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,871
Reference

125
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
So you put it on yourself

126
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
For one reason and one reason only

127
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
And that's it spread climate denial

128
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,207
And if you put them on yourself that that is what you are

129
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Trying to do

130
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
God dammit

131
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
He hasn't

132
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
It's ridiculous

133
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
This time

134
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
He has

135
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
One ring

136
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
He is done some

137
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Man on the street

138
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,919
These people are so convinced that those means

139
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,735
B Wild

140
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
You finding so many different places

141
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
You know what I mean

142
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:09,951
I guess Fox News and Infowars are too far from each other spiritual

143
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,191
Bone weird

144
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
They're supposed to be nude

145
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
Here's the weird

146
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
Or at least

147
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
Is brilliant as far as

148
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Strategy

149
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Unlike

150
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,039
So many other man-on-the-street interviews where the idea is

151
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:41,695
People who are together to make it look like all these time

152
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Stupid

153
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,791
They did something

154
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
Really really

155
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
I think

156
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,215
Which is they got all these kids to say 100% true and accurate things

157
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,055
Every one of these people

158
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Nailed it

159
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
Every single thing they say

160
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
Is correct

161
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
And it's just like we talked about where they're going

162
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
For your strength

163
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
You on the strike they're not trying

164
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Play Taylor Swift

165
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
They're trying to make their ideas

166
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Coming from

167
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,399
So here's our first interview this is the first thing that they play

168
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
About like

169
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:46,463
8 years old and the other one looks like she might

170
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,767
Photobomb

171
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:56,959
I guess with the argument that I can gather is sort of like just believe

172
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
This you agree with children

173
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
It's like Hitman children are sometimes right about things like chicken fingers are great

174
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:11,039
Universally children are wrong about everything their reasons for believing that what they believe that

175
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
I agree with might be

176
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
Different

177
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,439
Chocolate

178
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,839
Around 1

179
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:30,239
Open Gmail

180
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,079
It gets yelled at me by friends a lot cuz I don't like a lot of foods

181
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:40,735
That's what they say that's basically what it mean

182
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
I don't like

183
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
Like the tofu

184
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
The fuk away from Factory

185
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
I cannot chew that

186
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Right

187
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
Kids

188
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,663
They want you to look at how silly this girl is

189
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
Jumping and screaming

190
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,575
All the same exact words that those kids

191
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
Random talking head on Sienna

192
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Say what sound

193
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Perfectly read

194
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:28,351
There's no way that you could take those words in that order

195
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,935
They don't react to that with

196
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,751
And here's how Trump is helping they just

197
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,383
So the idea is

198
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
If you're watching Fox

199
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
And you see that

200
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
They're saying

201
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
The deck stain

202
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
Sentences

203
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
And you're laughing at them cuz they're children

204
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
And then on CNN

205
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,975
Somebody says that later that night and you're like that's what that stupid children

206
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
Yeah it's a good strategy

207
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,607
Killing our shooting the messenger kind of thing

208
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,423
How to deal with what's being said she's already

209
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Said f*** the kid

210
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
Values like you protect the children kind of celebrate

211
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
The child

212
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
God bless

213
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,271
You know that that kind of network and yet there they are using

214
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,343
Just the appearance of children is to make an idea stupid

215
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,415
Oh yeah that's the Great

216
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
Good stuff

217
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Let me ask you

218
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,791
Do you know why children

219
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Love

220
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Credit Karma

221
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
Probably version of

222
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,983
Seeing themselves reflected in her a little bit

223
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
Some sort of identification

224
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
Compactor

225
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
The idea that

226
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
Making positive change in the world

227
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:51,551
Through her believe that maybe they too could make positive change in the world that by guess

228
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,671
Price Rite

229
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:02,559
That is interested so many young people

230
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,607
Rusty stellosphere

231
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,311
That's why the youth are still into Alex

232
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Haha

233
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,407
I thought they were going to say

234
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
What is that

235
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,599
What's your name

236
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,207
I was also thinking of what was the other one

237
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,535
There's another like

238
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
Young woman who

239
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
He's taking of like the Ricola

240
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:48,383
Longhorn Cafe

241
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Absolutely

242
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,247
Yeah I don't I don't know if I agree with them so far

243
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
I'm trying to take a really objective

244
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,111
Costanzo's I've known to do

245
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Seem like

246
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
What was funded

247
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Literally

248
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,535
He is saying

249
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Throughout this entire interview

250
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
We need to be afraid of Greta

251
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
And he is

252
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,799
Basically telling that to everybody who is watching the show while at the same time starting with

253
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:23,711
Greta is the one who's trying to make you afraid

254
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,855
Our message is one of hope hope

255
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:35,487
Found in fossils

256
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,559
Sixteen-year-olds scaremonger

257
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,375
Is out there trying to make you afraid

258
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,471
So be afraid of her attempts to make you afraid

259
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
The warmth

260
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,151
Soft comforting blanket of coal

261
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,015
Basically we are we are going to keep going with this interview it is all like

262
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,111
Here's what's wrong with Greta here's how Greta is hurting you and with Beth

263
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,415
What's the best part is there's always like

264
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
And also

265
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
Children

266
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,327
She is also doing yeah we heard from Alex

267
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Caswell

268
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,215
Greta thunberg started in Sweden every Friday outside the Swedish Parliament

269
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,031
And it spread to skip school in order

270
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
They have a future and otherwise

271
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
She's actually said

272
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,431
Angie's address to EU the United States Congress testified

273
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,783
Why should kids go to school if they have a future that will be no more

274
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,647
Unless government passes laws like the green New Deal more UN treaty

275
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,303
It's her fault entirely she's telling all your kids to go to school

276
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,703
Probably before Greta was born

277
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:53,055
There's other

278
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,639
And she's just weaponizing that towards the positive

279
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
She's weaponizing the fear that people have

280
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,111
Being formally educated

281
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,439
You can make an argument for that

282
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
But I don't know how much that

283
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Stray kids

284
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,703
I dropped it really hurt me that much but still wants College it's no big deal

285
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
The thing about that

286
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
It is

287
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,335
Unbelievable how

288
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
Quick quality

289
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,687
It it's really really amazingly

290
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,991
Here's what here's when Greta started

291
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
A year ago

292
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,183
That was it there's the strikes right by skipping school on August 20th

293
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,767
2018 school and goes outside the Swedish

294
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
Telling them they need to do more on

295
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
Yes Wellness

296
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
On the 26th

297
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
She did it again

298
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
And this time

299
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,591
A bunch of other students

300
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
And parents all came along with

301
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,807
In September she began to do it every single Friday so this is September 2018 is about a year

302
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,903
All the sudden

303
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
Are doing this

304
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207

00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
More than 17,000 students

306
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Walk out on

307
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,839
On Friday in February of this year

308
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
The protest

309
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
Take place in 30 countries

310
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
In March

311
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
Sundberg is nominated for a Nobel Prize

312
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
Peace Prize

313
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,335
So

314
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
In August

315
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
To March

316
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,199
She got a Nobel Peace Prize

317
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
Nomination

318
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:42,367
You're describing Bisquick progression of it

319
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:48,767
There's no way this was the track

320
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,375
AstroTurf

321
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,215
It's now at the same time in March more than 2 million students

322
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,775
Over 135 countries

323
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
Start walking out

324
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
In May

325
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
She's named one of the most

326
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,687
Influential people in the world

327
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
She started this when she was

328
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
And in eight months

329
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,367
She is one of the most influential people in the world

330
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
I don't I don't know if you have this in your research

331
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,744
Has Mark Moreno ever been named

332
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536

333
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,936
Nominated

He's got a Pulitzer

335
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,640
I think I read that nearby I was

336
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
In

337
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
In August 14th

338
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,528
She gets out of climate neutral

339
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
To be she's invited to the UN climate Summit

340
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Against

341
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
6

342
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,976
And then on September 20th on September 20th

343
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,560
That was the climate strike that took place in / 185

344
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,376
Countries the number is in Cal

345
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
Are people who party

346
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,984
And then on September 23rd

347
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
He finally speaks

348
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,336
Hope everybody has watched

349
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
And seen the entire video but

350
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
It's just impossible like

351
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,504
Speech the entirety

352
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
And then I watch

353
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
People talk

354
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Sing about it on

355
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
All the Talking Heads

356
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
And they're just talking about it very

357
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Call muddy like

358
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,952
Greta thunberg's

359
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
The US

360
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
That is not how she

361
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
I shouldn't be up here

362
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
I should be back

363
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
School

364
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Appetite

365
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
Young people

366
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
How dare you

367
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:48,064
She had the balls to save it to the f****** you

368
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,904
What's up with the un's going to kill her like I mean

369
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,304
It does take a lot of strength that I'm not taking that away from her at all amazing actor

370
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
Of Bravery

371
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:07,776
Whittier 16 I don't think that most people would be able to just give a speech. Let alone something

372
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
Thing that confrontational

373
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:14,176
Powerful people

374
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:20,576
It's not like they're going to kill it's not like she became an incredibly famous

375
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
Caldera Bunton

376
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,304
Little Dipper

377
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,192
It's not like Yonker

378
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,360
But just for comparison go ahead

Hopefully our discussions here will be

383
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
Useful for you when you

384
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
Formulate

385
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Climatology

386
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,032
It's not like they're going to kill us

387
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,896
Isn't that the position of strategies

388
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,112
8:20

389
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136

00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
My childhood

00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Yeah she's a

394
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,960
I can't get over this

395
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,520
I cannot get over the fact that she is 16

396
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,664
I could barely do that now let alone when I was sick

397
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
Sure

398
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:57,344
And the amount of pressure and everything that she has been under and how she has responded to it

399
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:07,072
She has is so unique

400
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
I really could not

401
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168

She's very forceful and she's right and she's telling the world off

406
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
She's making sure everybody

407
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
You know

409
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Authentic

410
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,160

00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208

00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
You would think that climate change

414
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,608
Is a threat

415
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
Future right

416
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912

She is the great effect she's stealing fear

421
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,248
In millions of kids around the world

422
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,064
Okay

423
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:05,696
Mental illness anxiety disorder did not exist before

424
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464

I couldn't find anything specific

431
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,480
To the EU was because she's Swedish

432
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,784

442
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
Solastalgia

443
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,928
The distress that is

444
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,976
Produced by environmental change

445
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,280
Impacting on people

446
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,120

Build belief in one's own Raziel

451
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
That's pretty good General

452
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,600
Easier

453
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,160
You'll find a running

454
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
A running tally of that

455
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
General good tips for

456
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
Okay

457

Foster optimism

458
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
Not a bad idea

459
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
Tip number three

460
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,240
Cultivate coping and self-regulation

These are out there

465
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:13,440
You don't use the f****** b******* about that

466
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,144
These accusations causing anxiety and fear and other stuff

467
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
This would be

468
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,960
Totally right on

469
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,288
If Greta was getting up and being like you know what

470
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:34,688
And we should do about it

471
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:40,320
Coming up with a message of nihilism

472
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,416
Form of death called now

473
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:50,816
Is

474
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,960
So along with the anxiety there is

475
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,520
That might come up in some people

476
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:04,128
There's also an optimism there's also a clear actionable

477
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,432
Things that can be done

478
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:11,296
I don't know I just don't I don't buy I don't buy the idea of it

479
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,576
Climate activist

480
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,440
Are causing that kind of a reaction cuz there is

481
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
Action

482
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,000
Is there is

483
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:26,912
A way that would cause I just don't get it

484
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,288
Tires

485
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:41,248
And what she's doing all of this stuff and now they're anxious

486
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
They're they're all losing

487
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,136
To be true

488
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
But

489
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
Augmentin

490
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
OG's concept

491
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
Just raising temperature

492
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:03,776
Concept

493
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
To study

494
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,688
1001 by Anders

495
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504
And another in 2005 by

496
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
Sinister and Cooper

497
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
Sinister

498
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,880
Send mr. right it seems like

499
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
I thought it was a guy from

500
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,512
Sevenfold

501
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,304
I don't need another Ethan Hawke movie

502
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
Causal relationship

503
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
Between increase

504
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
And in increaser

505
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,336
Summers in Chicago we all know

506
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Well it's

507
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:47,808
Really f****** annoying to be hot I think we all know that just on it

508
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
.

509
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
It's

510
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Suck it

511
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
Really bothersome

512
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm a sweaty dude to even worse

513
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,400
It sucks every little bit every little temperature causes more and more aggression

514
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:08,544
I got to think about how expensive it is to

515
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,360
The Trap what is freon

516
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
Bright

517
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,920
Which also is killing the planet

518
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,368
It's a vicious cycle

519
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
And also it's not just like

520
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
Aggression towards other people

521
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,840
Higher temperatures have been increased levels of suicide

522
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,448
It appears that this is from

523
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Smiley

524
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,496
At all

525
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:45,408
Distress of feeling too hot can overwhelm coping ability for people who are already psychologically

526
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,504
Climate emergency exacerbate pre-existing system

527
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,576
Symptoms and lead to more serious health

528
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Sprite

529
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
So

530
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
Probably not Greta

531
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
Increasing iron

532
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
Difficulty there

533
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
Yeah

534
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
The worst one

535
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,608
Destroyed me

536
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,008
Conselho Whitlock

537
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Which I don't know if

538
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,616
They examined the impact

539
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,408
Climate change on a small Inuit

540
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
Community

541
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,248
These people have

542
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,808
Very personally indirectly

543
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Climate change

544
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
Action

545
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
It's not like

546
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,488
Not like that you know living in Illinois Lottery it is right

547
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,864
They see their land disappear they see their hunting-grounds disappeared

548
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,656
Just like most

549
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
In all of those places

550
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
Except they can

551
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,104
Tell people and

552
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,432
They specifically said that because of this

553
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
Change

554
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:56,320
Started feeling insecurity anger stress but most of all a loss

555
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Community

556
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,904
Like I didn't feel connected to each other as much

557
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,488
And the elders were specifically concerned

558
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,792
And about the preservation of the Inuit language

559
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
And culture

560
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,120
This quote is

561
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
We are people of the CIA

562
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
If there's no more CIA

563
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,568
How can we be people of the sea

564
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,248
As we see climate change

565
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
Progressed

566
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:30,624
The biggest issue is I think his is one that we're not really

567
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
And that is

568
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464
Massive amount of

569
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
Displacement

570
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
Combined with the loss of community

571
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:44,192
Urban areas that are going to be like

572
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Weather going to be

573
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
Uninhabitable

574
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:51,104
That

575
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,896
Yeah if you could be

576
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
Could be pretty severe

577
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
Yeah absolutely

578
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,064
And he's not really

579
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
Climate change

580
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:11,072
What about the people in the farmers in India that had like all their crops

581
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:17,472
Increase suicide rates month

582
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:22,592
Most people attribute that to that

583
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
Studied it

584
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,896
Political scientist

585
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
As well

586
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,248
But that probably the first war

587
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
Directly tied to

588
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,368
Interesting

589
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,512
That caused all of the previously

590
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,328
Disparate farming communities in all of the small community

591
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
2

592
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
Lose all of their food

593
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,192
And so they had to move to

594
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
The city and the City

595
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
Wasn't ready for an infant

596
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
That many

597
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Nobody had

598
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
You have

599
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
18 tonight

600
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,664
Twenty-three-year-old

601
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Less than

602
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,992
60% on employment

603
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
And

604
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Kaboom

605
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,344
Yeah that makes sense done

606
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
I was unaware of those variables connection

607
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,720
Nobody

608
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:16,608
Grievances in Syria

609
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,656
Yeah there's a few bad guys

610
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
We get back to

611
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
The children

612
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,568
Won't someone think of the

613
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
Someone needs

614
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,712
Then that person is Mark Marino and he is something that he would say

615
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
To a child

616
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,576
Watch their other

617
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,416
Say certain things

618
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:46,816
Earth Day projects

619
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
Or her

620
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,656
I would tell them the government can't legislate the climate

621
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
Fair

622
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
True

623
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,872
To some extent possible that temperatures are going down

624
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,480
What would you say to your child

625
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
I imagine

626
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
His child being like seven or eight

627
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,856
He's just like well.

628
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,648
Legislate

629
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,304
Curvy nice reassuring

630
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,888
I also love the idea that Dulce just jumped in there and called like

631
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,704
With the curriculum pure pressure

632
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,104
66 seventh-grader whatever they made us learn about like one month was monarch

633
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Reply month

634
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:36,224
Better learn all about goddamn monarch butterflies next month was pastas

635
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,528
I got to learn about different pasta shapes

636
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
Like

637
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:45,696
I don't want this is stupid it wasn't pure pressure

638
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
Durham School

639
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,048
Authority

640
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,888
I learned about pasta quite a bit

641
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
I don't remember, okay

642
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,736
Thirteen-year-old me good told you all about it

643
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,856
Speedy spaghetti

644
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,672
Is it called frozen pizza is out it is now

645
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,744
I don't know I don't know what mark would actually say

646
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
His own

647
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
He has called Greta and

648
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
Prophets

649
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Sure

650
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,424
He's not been very complimentary

651
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
Think that you can

652
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,200
Will you can't legislate the climate now you cannot

653
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:42,272
Which is fair

654
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,600
Right otherwise I pass a bill that these damn plants

655
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,648
Need to start getting some peppers out of them

656
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Wish I could do that

657
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:56,352
You still have any types of Bell right here peppers

658
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:01,216
Splat watch

659
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,568
What's up I made a mistake I didn't realize that you had to plant each

660
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:11,712
Sapling or treat like seedling in its own pot plants like two or three to a pot

661
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,600
Realizing I'm going to have to lecture

662
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:21,184
Cold in Chicago

663
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
So I can't be by the window

664
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,000
I could get a heat lamp

665
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:29,376
Look there's a lot of struggles I didn't plan ahead I don't know any of this stuff if I could legislate

666
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
I would do it

667
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,448
Yeah

668
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,008
Planting will be better next

669
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,312
But I'm sorry I didn't mean to derail there

670
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,408
You have

671
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
Nailed it on the head

672
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Here's the problem

673
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,016
With Greta

674
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
Right

675
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,344
And with really all the kids

676
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,952
They just

677
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,256
They just don't want to

678
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
I just don't want to work

679
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
That's it

680
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
Say if you really want to

681
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,192
Do something challenging

682
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:10,592
Skip school

683
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,432
Social media

684
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
Credit issue

685
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
She doesn't do anything Chow

686
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
Haha

687
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,672
I guess there's different definitions of challenging

688
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
You know

689
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,520
How's there's consequences that can come from skipping school

690
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,800
Or from

691
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Encouraging

692
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,384
Everyone to school

693
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,968
There's consequences that come from that take

694
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,272
Is a challenge in another cell

695
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,880
So what yes the active school if you want to go smoke weed play video games

696
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,696
Sure I mean there's a risk to it

697
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,232
There's a little bit of a challenge

698
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:06,144
You're not coming out and saying I'm skipping school to do that you're trying to hide

699
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,776
The openness about it is what's the meaning behind it adds a little more of a challenge

700
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
Absolutely

701
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,664
Giving up social media for a little while

702
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:21,248
I don't know people are really into social media

703
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:27,648
Social media while she was taking a climate neutral boat across the

704
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:34,048
Atlantic Ocean

705
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,584
Happen because her hands

706
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
Word sunburn

707
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,912
When she got off the boat

708
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:45,312
Really

709
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:51,968
Right

710
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
What other

711
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,928
I don't know I have no idea

712
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,232
I didn't look too deeply into it cuz it seemed

713
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
Crazy

714
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,704
I mean I don't know I guess parsec away to attack

715
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
Black people who make

716
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
Moves

717
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,664
And that is to say there's something else they should have done because there'll always be go on a hunger strike

718
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,528
Still using your phone

719
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,880
Will always be ejected

720
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:37,536
Your bodies are going to eat it's own fat you're fine social media not giving that up his stuff

721
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,936
I really feel like we are not that far away

722
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:48,288
This argument against anybody who's doing something you always

723
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,080
It's just a matter of

724
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
How

725
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:56,991
Craven do you want to be how opiate-like how transparently full of s*** do you wish to be publicly

726
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,183
I will set the standard by which the

727
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,023
Integrity or anything of your protest

728
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,071
Is Judge by and I

729
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
It's just

730
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Amazing

731
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,751
2/2 yeah that that naked Craven

732
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,031
Attitude

733
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
This

734
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,847
This girl is about

735
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
Speak

736
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,919
To the UN

737
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:31,295
This is Vista giving this interview like

738
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,599
Bananas

739
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
Absolutely banana

740
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:40,255
Insults in every possible way

741
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,071
We finally get to the sweet man on this

742
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,983
Oh hell yeah

743
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,079
Edited together three interviews

744
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,359
And I think you'll see

745
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
Through-line

746
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:12,255
We need to restructure the economy

747
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:33,247
That's not articulate that all that well to do I don't know

748
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:39,647
It's not really that nonsensical oviposition like whatever

749
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,951
Resented my parents growing up because

750
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
You know

751
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:46,815
Things would ever be acceptable

752
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:53,215
They refuse to buy me Lunchables cuz there's too much trash in them and stuff like that

753
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:58,847
Big little sweet bear with little pizza

754
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:04,991
But as I've grown older I kind of realize that

755
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,319
It's so much watts trash then

756
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,999
Costco box of something I meant Tupperware

757
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:21,119
That last person talk about sports

758
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,911
Kind of similar in the sense of like

759
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
If we had

760
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,519
We could cut down on a lot of trash that were

761
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
Especially plastic trash

762
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:36,223
I don't know

763
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,015
Little

764
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
It was like

765
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,647
The concept is correct

766
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,463
I'm making a little joke out of that last little boy

767
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,559
What's a sports a f****** funny word man

768
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,399
The concept actually is 100%

769
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,447
A very very good idea

770
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:02,847
But even intuitively I know you're about to explain why it does make some sense as long as you're not pry

771
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,383
Prime to Market

772
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,711
If we were like cuz the idea that

773
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,479
Their Express

774
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,527
If we took

775
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,599
What if we have forks and we have spoons

776
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:17,695
That's twice as much as if we had one utensil

777
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,303
Theoretically like the idea that their Express

778
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,143
You can even make a little sore

779
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,079
Hold on for going to be rich

780
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:39,199
Hundred percent already exist

781
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,039
There are about

782
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
Jose in

783
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,343
Science magazine

784
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,647
Published on February 13th

785
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,207
Study found that there are

786
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,767
Between 4 and 12 million metric

787
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
Tons of plastic

788
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,327
Poured into the ocean

789
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,631
There are

790
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,751
Garbage barges

791
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
Spinning around the fucken ocean

792
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,079
But maybe even more important

793
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
Is that plastic

794
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,407
Itself producing it

795
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,967
Leaves a massive Lehigh Carbon

796
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,295
Everything okay

797
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,111
And cutting it down in half would be

798
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,135
Ridiculous

799
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,791
Cutting down plastic of one Spectre

800
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:31,935
Lately correct but they are in a very stupid

801
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,543
Solve everything

802
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,591
But it would do something

803
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,663
So

804
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455
Even the most simple

805
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
Possible solution

806
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
Mock them first

807
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,575
Impossible

808
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,111
To do anything

809
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:50,879
Especially if

810
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
Large

811
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,231
Most importantly

812
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,791
Any reduction

813
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Huge

814
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,839
Especially at this point

815
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Anyting

816
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
Not only that

817
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
There are also

818
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,615
Here's the other thing

819
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,383
About what

820
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,175
There's a third one

821
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,759
There are a lot of there's a lot of poo

822
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,551
Pollution in the production of

823
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,367
It has to be there usually

824
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,903
The plants are built

825
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,951
Near water almost all the

826
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,279
The study done by the Clean Water Association

827
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,815
Shows that

828
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,607
In the Bay Area

829
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,911
Two-thirds of litter on the streets

830
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,751
What is made up of single units

831
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,031
Figleaves U10

832
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
Let the litter

833
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
On top of it

834
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,199
Every part of single-use

835
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,271
Silverware

836
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,551
Forks and spoons

837
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,855
Hey did

838
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
Massively destructive

839
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Bright 2

840
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
Yeah

841
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
There's nothing

842
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,767
Counterpoint

843
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,583
When I make turkey bacon

844
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,703
But if I use a metal Fork to flip the bacon

845
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,007
They often will end up scratching my pan

846
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,847
Doesn't do that

847
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,127
Ergo

848
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,407
I love

849
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,943
Disposable silverware

850
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
You're right

851
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:23,807
That isn't proven

852
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,855
Hit me up Mark

853
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,159
Beatbox

854
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,999
He could really use your help

855
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
Cuz he's a little bit

856
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,399
Wouldn't imagine that

857
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,447
It's if it's just

858
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:44,799
It's almost like medieval witchcraft

859
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,615
We can save our planet

860
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
I don't know if that was the right way

861
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,223
Can you play one more

862
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,551
I like to say that this is no more than medieval witchcraft

863
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,671
United Nations

864
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:04,255
Can save our Park can save the Statue of Liberty

865
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,071
Can save a species of

866
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,607
This is just

867
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:13,727
The height of Raikou

868
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,287
I think it's the next one

869
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,383
1451

870
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,663
Sacrifice

871
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,183
Real rhetorical flourish be like

872
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:33,951
Death

873
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,535
Do you think I'm saying when I say everybody knows

874
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,327
Exactly what you going to say

875
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
What he shows up

876
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:41,887
Funny

877
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:48,543
Interview quote-unquote he's going to call climate change stuff barbaric wizard

878
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
Cool that's his plan

879
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:02,623
100000000000000

880
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:09,535
That's just what I had to find a way to get that one is getting

881
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,607
I can hear him say that over and over and over

882
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,423
Queen.

883
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,751
He just doesn't understand

884
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,103
I guess this is fairly similar to some of the Alex

885
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,175
Be kind of s*** you know like calling things witchcraft

886
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:34,879
Giving kids vaccines

887
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,415
Oh yeah

888
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:43,071
More similarities than I'm comfortable with

889
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,679
Interview on

890
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,727
Fake interview on Fox and Friends

891
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:55,103
But it just turns into Sanders and Elizabeth Warren

892
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,895
Fly all the time

893
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,223
They say we shouldn't meet all the time

894
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:05,343
It's one of those it's one of that same Peyton I have

895
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,391
Very similar things

896
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,207
It goes all the way back

897
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:16,607
What you felt good arguments

898
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:23,007
Over and over and over again no one has rubbed the Witchcraft argument so

899
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,055
Going to keep doing it until someone

900
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,431
I don't think anybody could ever do that now

901
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,247
Later on

902
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,063
After being a complete idiot

903
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,087
Before Greta

904
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,623
Sure on Foxon

905
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,439
He goes on Barney show

906
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:47,839
Comedian okay

907
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,471
This is after gratis

908
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,543
I don't know who this guy is

909
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:00,639
Okay

910
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,199
Think that the solution

911
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:08,063
I know this guy just by his voice

912
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,159
Quote-unquote solutions to climate change

913
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:15,231
That have been offered are they still popular in Europe

914
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:21,631
Because Europe is really suffering from these so-called Celeste

915
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,655
Deficit increased

916
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,983
If this guy wants to know what the Europe

917
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,591
I'm seeing a real

918
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:37,247
Disinterested Lord monckton even on Fox news Wichita troubles me a little bit

919
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:43,647
Yeah probably be apart of it

920
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:49,023
Denmark Moreno's bitlord of climate

921
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,839
So people in

922
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:57,215
People people always remind me of the last episode

923
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,359
You know

924
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
Like one of those cases that he would bring up specifically looking

925
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:20,255
There's so much more going on here this has to do with financial stop

926
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,839
Climate change measures

927
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,119
Poverty

928
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,471
Oh yeah that is borne out by the office of Nash

929
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,007
Statistics

930
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:34,079
Is the most British name I can think of for a government age

931
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,895
Ons

932
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
These are our national

933
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,711
That's what we do

934
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,807
It America we call it the office

935
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,719
But

936
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:55,071
Actually what I found out was that winter deaths have increased

937
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,119
I was really I was

938
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,191
All geared up for fruit to be like this

939
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,727
Completely made up this

940
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,495
It's all bulshit

941
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,287
I don't even need to worry about

942
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,567
But

943
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:08,127
The number of excess winter

944
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,687
That's what they measure

945
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,271
What do you mean by excess

946
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:17,599
Access number of deaths

947
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
In winter

948
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,415
The other three months

949
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,231
Okay

950
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
Between

951
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:25,791
What is

952
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,327
April and

953
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
July and July

954
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
September

955
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,447
Does an average of 100

956
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:37,055
Then there's 115 in Winter that has excess.

957
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,335
Alright

958
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,383
So

959
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:53,183
Steps are expensive

960
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,863
2017

961
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,143
2018

962
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
Highest

963
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,935
Number of x

964
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,703
Seth winter.

965
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,471
Play recorded

966
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,495
70

967
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
Mainly due

968
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,591
2

969
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,383
Increase influenza

970
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,175
And of course

971
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,479
All the way around

972
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,015
Nothing to do with climate

973
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,831
Addison even further disingenuous argue

974
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,623
Because well yes you can

975
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,391
Can say it's the Hyatt

976
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Is recorded number

977
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
The 70s

978
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,975
It is also

979
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,767
One-half the number

980
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:29,791
Since the fifth

981
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,583
So it's

982
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:37,215
Absolute b******* the trend overall has

983
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:40,543
Dip down right over and over and over again

984
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,735
Complications of illness

985
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,159
When measures are past that make it so

986
00:55:56,415 --> 00:56:02,559
Like the electric company can't turn off your electricity during the winter pay your bill they can't turn it off

987
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:08,959
April measures like that that are protective cut awful

988
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,175
Needs to be across the board

989
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,991
Protected about that

990
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,783
Resources for people who are

991
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,319
Experiencing homelessness

992
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,111
Fast response

993
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,927
Remember when there was a blizzard

994
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,231
The last time here in Chicago

995
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:37,631
There was a lot of focus put on report them so we can make sure

996
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,911
They don't

997
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,191
Stay outside

998
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:43,263
Message from your local neighborhood

999
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,567
No it's that wasn't nice

1000
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:55,295
Number down to as low as it can possibly go

1001
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,575
Even with

1002
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,391
Severely inclement weather winter temperature

1003
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,695
Better solution

1004
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:05,279
To look at that whatever Mark is talking about

1005
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
Absolutely

1006
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,423
It is amazing how

1007
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,447
I have never

1008
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
Seeing him

1009
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,751
Give any

1010
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,031
Straightforward

1011
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,847
I've never I've never seen it not once

1012
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,663
Even if it's one that's not even damaged or

1013
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,967
Like almost unrelated

1014
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,527
What about that

1015
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,863
When it's dry out

1016
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,911
Yeah so it is

1017
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,191
It is kind of amazing

1018
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,519
Because even this is just a cherry pick

1019
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,335
Like he had to say from the 70

1020
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,127
He couldn't even

1021
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,663
Couldn't possibly be like

1022
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:57,503
Well it's twice as many years from 2014

1023
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
Hastily

1024
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
Create this chair

1025
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:00,831
That is

1026
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
Misleading

1027
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,391
It's just stupid

1028
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,607
We have to whenever you hear people using

1029
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
Majestic Theater

1030
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,703
Wise to look into contact

1031
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,775
Larger trends that they might be ignoring

1032
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,847
Just so consistent across

1033
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,383
All

1034
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:29,503
Distorted media positive

1035
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,319
I don't know why I don't spend the time focusing on those

1036
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,855
I'm sure

1037
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,159
Use on both sides

1038
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,951
The persuasive argument

1039
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:44,351
Easy game to play you sound like so like

1040
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:50,495
Irrefutable whenever you pull out things like that

1041
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:52,799
It's bad

1042
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,615
Absolutely this is why I still want to know

1043
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
What the OPP's

1044
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,223
Weather in Major League

1045
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,527
Sure it's unknown

1046
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,855
He said they gave us like 38 home runs

1047
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,927
Give me what is on-base

1048
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:15,583
Yeah that's what I was really looking for no type of organ

1049
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:21,983
Say Missy Football League you're going to play ever tells you what humble rating is

1050
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,287
Bridges punch / fumble

1051
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,615
It's a very crucial statistic to understand

1052
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,759
Tells the whole story

1053
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,575
/

1054
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,879
Bumble Mark get on

1055
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,975
Moreno Moreno

1056
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:49,631
I didn't know he had control over that to make himself useful just like Greta shouldn't be going out of school

1057
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
I like it

1058
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,055
I like it

1059
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,103
But you know what

1060
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,663
The biggest problem

1061
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,199
The biggest misconception

1062
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
Course

1063
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:11,391
I'm trying

1064
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:15,999
Erupting like I do

1065
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,559
Welcome to the

1066
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,887
Club I guess you just deal with that Silent Night

1067
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:25,215
You called me out on

1068
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:25,983
Fair enough

1069
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,263
I was going to let that one

1070
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,415
Do you know what people are not

1071
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:48,767
How great we are and how we don't need to do anything else

1072
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:56,447
We're doing better in United States then these European sinus we're going to be at the UN Summit in New York shaming President Trump wear

1073
01:00:56,703 --> 01:01:00,799
Nobody ever points that out

1074
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
Nobody

1075
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,943
It's been pointed out a lot

1076
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,991
Pointed out

1077
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,551
Specifically

1078
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,343
Scott Pruitt

1079
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,391
Noted

1080
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:18,207
Definitely not corrupt monster Scott Pruitt

1081
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,743
In 2070

1082
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,047
We are leaving the nation

1083
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,327
Excuse

1084
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,399
The world with respect to our CO2 footprint

1085
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,167
Introduction

1086
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,751
Another b*******

1087
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,519
Cherry Picked

1088
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,055
Because

1089
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:33,823
What

1090
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,591
He did

1091
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,639
They are doing

1092
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,407
Is they are

1093
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
Judging

1094
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
Differently

1095
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
They are

1096
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,295
About

1097
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,319
The way that's

1098
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,391
China-india both admit

1099
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
More carbon

1100
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,695
Right

1101
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,463
Right

1102
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,487
Because they are

1103
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
Then

1104
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,631
Where is that a conspiracy

1105
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:01,471
They're actually smart the Mercator Projection is actually right

1106
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:04,031
People living in

1107
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,335
And they were the ones

1108
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
Right

1109
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,455
Yes they are absolutely huge Carpenter

1110
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,735
But

1111
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,527
When you go by per capita

1112
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,599
You find out that the US produces

1113
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,647
16 1/2 metric ton

1114
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
Per capita

1115
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,231
Compared to China seven and a half

1116
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
India

1117
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:24,767
One point

1118
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
Savage

1119
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
So

1120
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,679
Inaccurate fact that America has reduced admission

1121
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,703
More

1122
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,775
But in terms of what we're doing it is

1123
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,799
Absolutely

1124
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
Nothing

1125
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,639
Like we went from in terms of reducing emissions

1126
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,687
16.5 metric

1127
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,967
When's was in 2040

1128
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,295
Down by a little average

1129
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
One-and-a-half

1130
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,343
The 2%

1131
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,183
Around that

1132
01:02:55,999 --> 01:03:02,143
Even as a whole I understand the point

1133
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,447
That's all good

1134
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,983
But like

1135
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:13,151
Just other people aren't doing good doesn't mean

1136
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,943
Instructional

1137
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,367
No doesn't the didn't help anything

1138
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:27,231
He's disingenuously trying to attack every possible counter argument

1139
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:33,631
Argument here actually strengthen the counterargument

1140
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:40,031
Feel like other people are doing worse

1141
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,871
It kind of falls apart upon it any kind of inspection when you're not talking to her

1142
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,199
Varney over here

1143
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:51,039
And the Duke he is wrong

1144
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,063
As a

1145
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,135
In 2018

1146
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,439
Almost directly due to

1147
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,487
Trump's bulshit the EPA

1148
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:03,071
Complete abdication of any moral responsibility

1149
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,351
And so forth

1150
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,679
Emissions rather than dropping Rose by the largest

1151
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,727
Amount since 96

1152
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,775
It was hell yeah

1153
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,567
Are the second-largest

1154
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,871
They Rose by 3.4 per

1155
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:20,223
Effectively wiping out most of the

1156
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,063
We are not leaving the

1157
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,087
World

1158
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,719
It is not happen

1159
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
Ironic

1160
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,535
In some ways

1161
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:38,655
Timing timing base irony

1162
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,935
He would have been fine

1163
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,031
Here's here's a weird what I like this

1164
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,359
This is very bad

1165
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:54,783
Someone proposed of the UN climate treaty or the solution

1166
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:01,183
Regulation Europeans are opposed to that challenge the science or look at the reason

1167
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,655
Attract that

1168
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:14,239
I couldn't look it up there a citation

1169
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
Yeah

1170
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,943
In America were like wait what

1171
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,295
Europeans are more into Central planning and regulation

1172
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,367
Therefore they don't question science

1173
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,135
Right

1174
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,207
I don't see the relation

1175
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,999
No it doesn't

1176
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,535
No I think you might have

1177
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,815
Problem with that construction

1178
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,119
Seems like the

1179
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
Follow

1180
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,519
If you trying to say that

1181
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,079
You can use that argument for like everything

1182
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,175
No take science out of the conclusion

1183
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,735
Europeans are more into Central planning

1184
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,319
Regulation therefore

1185
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,111
They make more balloons

1186
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
Sprite

1187
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:07,231
You got it that's it that's an omni purpose

1188
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:11,839
It's it's constructed the same way

1189
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
That 90

1190
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,655
Def Comedy Jam

1191
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,983
Europeans be like this

1192
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:24,383
Sure

1193
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:29,503
Leading climate denial guy Lord monckton

1194
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:35,391
Ford Mountain f****** parachuted into a year

1195
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:40,767
Just to cause a big big publicity stunt

1196
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:47,167
D.b. Cooper Rudolf Hess

1197
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,751
But he doesn't have any military service

1198
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,055
He's not a trick

1199
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919
How is it

1200
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
That we

1201
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Lead the world

1202
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
Fictitious I heard marks

1203
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,999
Okay I'm I don't know I'm excited to learn

1204
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:18,143
To technology and Innovation and then the troops truly to fracking

1205
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,935
That's how we

1206
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,983
Chiefly through fracking

1207
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,031
Counterintuitive

1208
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:33,759
And then never mentioned

1209
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,807
Of course

1210
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:46,815
Tracking

1211
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
Again

1212
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:54,239
Recitation of

1213
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,031
In the world of Medicine

1214
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,871
Because I have drawn the most blood from people

1215
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
I like it

1216
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:07,039
Robert

1217
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,087
Cornell University

1218
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,623
He does not believe

1219
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
Improve

1220
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,095
Commercialization of shale gas and oil

1221
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:20,863
20%

1222
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,911
Has dramatically increased

1223
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
Listen

1224
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,287
He continues on

1225
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,335
Shale gas production in North America

1226
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
Contributed

1227
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,687
Half of all the increase

1228
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,455
Methane emissions

1229
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,503
From fossil fuels globally

1230
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:40,063
Approximately one-third of the total in

1231
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
Increased emissions

1232
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
All source

1233
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,391
Over the past

1234
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,743
Yeah that's pretty universally

1235
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,535
Promoting I've looked into

1236
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,375
Like

1237
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,167
Save it

1238
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,447
Cracking great

1239
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
Nope

1240
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
Knowing

1241
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:05,407
Absolutely know what for I guess there are certain people who are on like payroll

1242
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
You know

1243
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:14,879
I am covered Coronavirus

1244
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,927
That is

1245
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,463
Absolutely and utterly

1246
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,023
Right to pretend

1247
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,839
Even if you mistakenly

1248
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:30,239
We are leading the world in protecting the climate and I know that cuz of all the trash we burn

1249
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:34,591
We have Tire fires are height

1250
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:41,247
How we protect the ozone layer

1251
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:47,647
Like what

1252
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,743
So there we go

1253
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
Lowe's

1254
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,167
No fracking does not

1255
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,495
Not even not help it is

1256
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,287
Utterly

1257
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,311
Utterly destroy

1258
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,847
Admission

1259
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,151
Talk about pollution

1260
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,455
The f****** destruction of the Earth

1261
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,527
Like you name it fracking is one of the single worst

1262
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
I've ever even saw

1263
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,391
The same is true of like a cool fan

1264
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:27,839
Anybody who presents that as being like a good alternative

1265
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:32,191
All information is worth

1266
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,751
The processing

1267
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,031
Usable is

1268
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,823
Heavily polluting

1269
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:41,663
If there was even there was some sort of

1270
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431
Netflix

1271
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,455
Net

1272
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
Offset

1273
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,759
Like even then if it was

1274
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:52,159
Just like this tiniest little bit destroys the Earth but it's 1% better when you factor in all that s***

1275
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
I know it is absolutely

1276
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,743
And there's nothing that

1277
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,279
Anybody has ever

1278
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,959
If it were

1279
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:07,007
People would be for it probably

1280
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:13,919
Like if these Alternatives like anybody who's Into Climate Change activism or would have

1281
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,967
If one of these Solutions

1282
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:19,807
Actually did like let's say cut down 15%

1283
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,343
Emissions

1284
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,927
It profited boil companies

1285
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,719
He would still be for it

1286
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:33,119
They would not be paying Mark Marino's

1287
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
They wouldn't eat

1288
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,191
But again

1289
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,983
One of our biggest

1290
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:45,919
Obviously they are mercilessly mocking and being mean to

1291
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,711
16 year old woman

1292
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,271
Really is about

1293
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,807
Is how much they care about protect

1294
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:55,135
God Bless the Child

1295
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:01,791
Different these kids are testifying before Congress saying they have no future unless we can essentially

1296
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:08,191
Killed the market economy in the United States and impose essential plan on it that's what they're testifying

1297
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:13,567
Talk to me the children

1298
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:16,383
Yes into the amounts by

1299
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,919
Adults

1300
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:18,687
Yes

1301
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,479
To have six

1302
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,503
7%

1303
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
The best

1304
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,463
400

1305
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,815
Back on

1306
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,447
Today's that figures

1307
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,543
They will not be any solution

1308
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
Appliance

1309
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:46,847
Placenta

1310
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,199
Because these numbers are too uncomfortable

1311
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,271
You are still not mature enough

1312
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,807
To tell it like it is

1313
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:59,647
I could see how an adult would like to hear

1314
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,439
Haha

1315
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,975
That's

1316
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,743
Put those

1317
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,815
Juxtapoz Ciara

1318
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,583
Obviously

1319
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,863
Right

1320
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,167
But that really got to Varney

1321
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,727
Got2b

1322
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,799
Sure he doesn't like the idea that

1323
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,335
These children are

1324
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,663
Basically pointing out that you're a bunch of f****** chilled

1325
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:28,063
He probably a good time to point out that there are not just read out there

1326
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,367
Other activists

1327
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:35,999
Maybe aren't getting as much attention as her that also deserve a good bit of like a

1328
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,023
A shout-out

1329
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:43,679
A tip of the cap every one of these every one of them across the

1330
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,959
The world wasn't organized

1331
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,751
Personally by Greta no

1332
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,287
Every single one of those

1333
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:54,687
Vitriol and praise is being directed at whereas

1334
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:58,015
There are there are many more people

1335
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,575
Who are coming out in that

1336
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,367
You know being being very active in the

1337
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,671
And I'll just climate-changing across-the-board

1338
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
Terms

1339
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,975
Social causes

1340
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,023
They're a lot more people who are

1341
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,327
That generation

1342
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:15,167
That probably deserve a higher profile

1343
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:17,215
Shout out to

1344
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:22,335
I didn't prepare for this episode and I can't remember anybody off the top of my head

1345
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,383
Cuz everybody's talking about Greta

1346
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,943
Well let me know

1347
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,271
Let me read you from the very mental health manual that I

1348
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,319
From earlier

1349
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,623
And I think that will be

1350
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,719
The way that they

1351
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,399
In some cases

1352
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:50,239
Information that increases perceptions of the reality of climate

1353
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,311
Denial

1354
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,591
And that's a reduction in

1355
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,359
Concern

1356
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,127
Support for act

1357
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,919
This is.

1358
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
McDonald's

1359
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,271
Communicating

1360
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:06,623
This complexity itself may be a

1361
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:09,183
One study showed that

1362
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,719
Steve more complex information

1363
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,535
Felt more helpless

1364
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,839
And more inclined to leave the problem

1365
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,607
To the government

1366
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,423
And those who felt ignorant about the topic

1367
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,495
Or more likely to want to avoid hearing about born

1368
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,311
Okay

1369
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,127
Exactly why they are

1370
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,919
Talkin the way that they are

1371
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,039
Making sure

1372
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,087
Fat people are

1373
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
Exactly

1374
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
Because

1375
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,695
Good morning

1376
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,975
And also

1377
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:49,375
Because the more helpless and more inclined

1378
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:55,775
How real you feel about climate more likely you are to be in favor of Regulation and

1379
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,311
Government

1380
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,359
Yes and their stated

1381
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,127
Life

1382
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:08,319
They keep their audience ignorant about the topic

1383
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,111
So they don't want to hear anymore

1384
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:10,879
Negative adverb

1385
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:17,791
Right they want to hear America is leading the world CO2

1386
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:21,631
American is yours my warm car

1387
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,655
Exactly

1388
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
And they know it

1389
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,727
And

1390
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,519
Mark Moreno noses

1391
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:30,079
Everybody who books him

1392
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,383
No that's what he is going to do for

1393
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,919
He is

1394
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,223
Slimy

1395
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:44,159
I hate him so much this episode get them to

1396
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:47,743
Mix it up with this guy

1397
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,279
I I just

1398
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,839
But

1399
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,863
Still further

1400
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,399
This

1401
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,423
It like

1402
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,959
How many times

1403
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,239
Has he been brazen

1404
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,263
In his

1405
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,543
Complete at Polaroid

1406
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:04,639
Office episode very obvious

1407
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:07,967
Very miserable

1408
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,503
Non-stop flights

1409
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,551
Pitter patter of

1410
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:14,879
I cut the clip short so they're not as long as

1411
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,927
The ones that you normally

1412
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,999
Mainly because he speaks

1413
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,303
40

1414
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:29,471
Structural different conversation

1415
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:33,055
Where is Alex's the long-form

1416
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,103
Rambling

1417
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,431
It's it's definitely like I just a function of

1418
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,735
The Source material

1419
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,807
These are obviously going to be shorter

1420
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,599
Blurbs

1421
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:48,671
I mean I could I could have put the Whole 30 seconds

1422
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
Clipper

1423
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:53,791
He's just such a unlike Alex where it's like he's got those

1424
01:17:54,303 --> 01:18:00,447
Rolling crescendos and then he break and then rolling

1425
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,007
Moreno is just

1426
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,823
Rapidfire monotone

1427
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,639
Just like I'm before you even have a thought

1428
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,431
I'm onto the next

1429
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,271
Thank you sounds

1430
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,063
Super credible through the

1431
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
Quick

1432
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:28,095
Make it sound like I know all these things and monotone certiflat delivery that you think that I'm

1433
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,655
Emotionally delivering this information to you

1434
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,447
So different presentation Style

1435
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:38,847
But it is

1436
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,431
But this one is this one's broke

1437
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:47,807
It's for the kids

1438
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:54,207
I was at the when she spoke for 11 minutes to symbolize 11 years

1439
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,743
Until the planets dead unless

1440
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:59,327
Legislate storms in weather

1441
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:06,751
6 hours earlier in the day said she needs to do something f****** challenge

1442
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:10,335
Slater

1443
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:18,271
The message coming from someone who accompanied his parents to a Diane

1444
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:21,343
Proof that the Iraq War when I was a younger guy

1445
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:28,255
You know argument that that's going to traumatize and scare these opposite

1446
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:34,655
Like I was younger V Zombie the Iraq War I was like 19 or 20 at the

1447
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,031
I didn't have any kind of

1448
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,567
Feeling of it is like

1449
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:51,551
So Terror inducing in my own life that I can't suction it was like this is an expression of how severe this

1450
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,343
Reality is that we are

1451
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
Against

1452
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,415
So I don't know

1453
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,975
I don't I don't I don't find it to be compelling

1454
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:03,327
That was an old man assuming the children don't have cognitive abilities

1455
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,607
You got it yeah

1456
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:08,959
Children

1457
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,519
Cuz it's different it's Greta was five

1458
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,920
Caressed

1459
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,760
I will I will save it

1460
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,040
We do not

1461
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,088
And neither does anybody else

1462
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,880
And if anybody has

1463
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,928
Mark Marino anywhere near the

1464
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,696
It is

1465
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,720
Completely invalid

1466
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,488
Invalidated

1467
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:33,792
This one

1468
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,072
Distance from

1469
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,096
Something that Greta said

1470
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,376
Which I find

1471
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,400
Incredibly helpful

1472
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,704
And I will see how it goes

1473
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,264
You said you hear us

1474
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,312
That you understand the urgency

1475
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,384
No matter how sad

1476
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,712
I do not want to believe that

1477
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,040
Because if you really understood the situation

1478
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,112
I'm still kept on saying

1479
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,904
Evil

1480
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,952
In fact I refuse to believe

1481
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,000
Sure

1482
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,536
She refuses to believe

1483
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:07,840
But they are evil but I will tell you something

1484
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,376
Mark Marino is

1485
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,400
F****** evil

1486
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:15,008
She wasn't talking to Mark Moreno

1487
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:18,592
I disagree with her on

1488
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:24,992
About or to him in this regard as well

1489
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,552
I am also disagree with

1490
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:33,696
Are you suggesting I'm not 100% sure where I land on that but I respect your opinion

1491
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,744
I'm on the fence a little bit

1492
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:40,352
In terms of that Call of Duty all the world leaders evil

1493
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:52,128
AOL

1494
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:55,200
Consider for a lot of world leaders that I don't I don't know where their head

1495
01:21:55,968 --> 01:22:00,832
I will tell you that their heads are not

1496
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,368
Most recent IP

1497
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,512
Because

1498
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,608
Very long

1499
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,376
People didn't actually

1500
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,168
All of the

1501
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,192
All of the articles

1502
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
Stuff I read about it

1503
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:17,984
Play problems

1504
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:20,800
The guardian or anything

1505
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,848
They were all

1506
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,152
Kind of in this Middle Ground

1507
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,200
And this is something

1508
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,016
To be very very

1509
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:34,880
You know that I have said to you many times in the past where

1510
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,416
I suspect

1511
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,184
That's

1512
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,208
Scientist

1513
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,744
Have always been climate scientist

1514
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,792
Is the specialty of always been downplaying the

1515
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
Actual

1516
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,328
Severity of the

1517
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:50,240
Forever

1518
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:54,080
Incessantly

1519
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,944
Yeah I thought that was something that

1520
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,064
From a study by

1521
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
2013

1522
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,416
Quotes

1523
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,952
Over the past two decades

1524
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,232
Two decades

1525
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,536
Skeptics of the reality and significance of

1526
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:14,816
Anthropogenic climate

1527
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,608
Frequently accused

1528
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
Alarmism

1529
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,448
Of over interpreting or overreact

1530
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,728
New evidence

1531
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,288
However

1532
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,568
The available evidence

1533
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,616
And suggest that scientists have in fact

1534
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:28,896
Conservative

1535
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,432
Protection

1536
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,576
Knox

1537
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,648
Cautious

1538
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,208
There is even a term that

1539
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,024
Call it airing on the side of

1540
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
Drama

1541
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,888
Right but I still your conjecture

1542
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:56,544
Thunder playing

1543
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,152
Manipulating but I honestly don't approve

1544
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,200
The stuff that you always help me

1545
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:06,272
Low balling

1546
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:11,136
The conservative estimates are different than

1547
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:14,720
But be under playing the severity

1548
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:17,536
I don't I don't think

1549
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,584
I still don't think that matches with

1550
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,120
Your suspicions

1551
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,936
Well let's go vote of estimates versus

1552
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,728
Extreme estimates

1553
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,288
Iru I mean I understand

1554
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:29,824
Okay

1555
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,688
What I'm what I'm more talking about is the way that they present

1556
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:37,760
The data

1557
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,296
Because

1558
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,832
Here is the

1559
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,880
Here's some of the data in the eyepiece

1560
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:44,928
This report

1561
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,768
And this is all Based on data that goes up

1562
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,792
220 50

1563
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,840
It does not include 26

1564
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,680
Obviously you can't put your

1565
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,240
In the report

1566
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,312
Our best-case scenario from the Paris

1567
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,360
You keep warming 21-point

1568
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,128
5 degrees

1569
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,688
And the report says

1570
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,224
No matter what

1571
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,040
If we even if we reach

1572
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,832
1.5 degrees C

1573
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,600
Is as a

1574
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,136
Hazard

1575
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,464
Steve warm water

1576
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,232
Coral

1577
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,280
It's just gone

1578
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,608
There's nothing we can do unless we go well below

1579
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:25,888
1.5

1580
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:29,472
That is not something that was in any of the reports

1581
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,288
Any of the articles I read none of them said

1582
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,848
No matter what we're losing Coral

1583
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,368
Amazing

1584
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,392
Beautiful

1585
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,464
Exactly right

1586
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,512
All of this stuff

1587
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,072
Now what it doesn't include

1588
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,864
Like I said the pass

1589
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,656
Three or four years

1590
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,448
One of the issue

1591
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,568
They have a couple different projects

1592
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,336
Is going on

1593
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,456
They have the ones where we

1594
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,528
And stay below 1.5

1595
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,088
Very very

1596
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:20,160
They are the ones who don't do anything

1597
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,232
They just measure what it would be like

1598
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,512
We stayed at the same

1599
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,328
What they don't have

1600
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,864
What it would be like

1601
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,656
Continue sucking up

1602
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,424
More

1603
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:34,496
They couldn't imagine a scenario

1604
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:37,056
Not only did we not just

1605
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,080
Stay the same

1606
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,944
Bright like Alex advocate

1607
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:51,392
This this idea that idea of like 11 years we have 11 years from now

1608
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:54,720
To adjust our actions and all that

1609
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:58,560
Not act

1610
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,376
We don't have 11 years

1611
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:04,448
What because it's from the date of the end of 2015

1612
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:11,104
So whatever we be talkin about we should have been talking about in 2015 where has this been 3 years 4 years

1613
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:11,872
Since then

1614
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,200
But

1615
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,760
That number is not as as of

1616
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,808
It is a g

1617
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,624
Write two years

1618
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,904
Active damage

1619
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,976
Doesn't take us from 11 years left 29 years

1620
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:31,072
I can't tell you I even then the projections aren't like

1621
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,864
This is exactly accurate

1622
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,424
Right it's like the 538 election Bridge

1623
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:40,032
Where it's like 75

1624
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:40,800
Percent chance that

1625
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,360
Republicans

1626
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:48,480
The same thing is true with climate refer

1627
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,040
They can say

1628
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,344
What they're telling us

1629
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:56,928
There's a 60% chance that we have 11 years

1630
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,952
To do all of

1631
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,744
Yeah they don't say

1632
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,120
There's a 40% chance we're already past but there is a significant

1633
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,400
That were already past

1634
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:08,704
And there's nothing that can be done

1635
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,728
To keep us below one

1636
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,008
To keep us at one point

1637
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:13,568
So

1638
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,408
Really

1639
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,944
A frustrating

1640
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:20,992
Text

1641
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,808
This is a f******

1642
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,832
Seriously

1643
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,624
Dangerous and scary report

1644
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:29,440
And it is amazing to me that it went

1645
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,208
Spying like

1646
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,256
One day there was a new cycle of this

1647
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,024
This report that

1648
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,816
It is

1649
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:35,584
Amazing

1650
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,400
What are the

1651
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,704
What are the things that I love in the report

1652
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
About

1653
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,496
Governor

1654
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,568
And how they're going to act on

1655
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,408
This

1656
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,736
There is no single climate governance

1657
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,016
Panacea for the ocean

1658
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,368
Empirical evidence on which governments

1659
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,160
Arrangement

1660
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:00,928
Which contacts

1661
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,696
Still Limited

1662
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,232
Good governor

1663
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,768
Scare quotes

1664
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,072
Norm's indicate the importance of

1665
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,376
Deliberate

1666
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,400
Reflective hoodie

1667
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,168
Responsiveness

1668
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:11,936
Social learning

1669
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,472
The co-production of knowledge

1670
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,496
And respect

1671
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,520
Ethnic and culture

1672
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,080
And the reason I like that

1673
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,360
In there is

1674
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,384
Does that mean

1675
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:24,736
They have some Eco fascist that they were talking to

1676
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:25,760
What

1677
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:26,784
Instead

1678
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,832
We had one guy do every

1679
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:32,416
And they're like

1680
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:36,256
There's some people who would read that ipcc report and go like

1681
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,816
Democracy is a failed us

1682
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,096
Baxter

1683
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,168
So they specifically went out of their way to be like

1684
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:49,312
We don't want anybody I know you might think it's a good idea and you're like

1685
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:52,640
These sorts of things could be very

1686
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:56,224
Dangerously used under the

1687
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,504
The wrong

1688
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Absolutely

1689
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,856
Absolutely

1690
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,904
Here's another

1691
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:04,928
Great pizza

1692
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:06,976
Today

1693
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,768
Just today

1694
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,560
September or October 3rd

1695
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:13,376
You got a report was really

1696
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:15,168
From the guardian

1697
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,448
Trump's attack

1698
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,240
Science are at 8

1699
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,264
Crisis points

1700
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,080
Deny climate science

1701
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:25,152
EPA from presenting research on

1702
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,200
He's barred the Nash

1703
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:27,968
Hill Park Service

1704
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:30,784
Proposal

1705
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,624
And he's actively published a misleading environmental review

1706
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,416
To allow mining in

1707
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:41,024
They have anybody

1708
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,048
Who speaks out

1709
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,096
Or points out how much

1710
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:46,144
B******* science

1711
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,448
But the thing that

1712
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:50,752
Weird to me or not weird but

1713
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,824
The Department of Agriculture actually moved

1714
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:54,848
Acrostic

1715
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:55,616
Country

1716
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,408
When they published

1717
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,432
Analysis of how

1718
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,456
Fox farmers

1719
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,248
Under Trump's proposal

1720
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,040
The interior

1721
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,320
Reassigned a climate

1722
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:06,624
Counting roll

1723
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,416
After you just pointed out

1724
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,952
That climate change will be back

1725
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,512
And just for the win

1726
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,328
They suppress the report showing

1727
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:17,632
Toxic substances several States lottery

1728
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,728
Absolutely suck you up at far

1729
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,776
Far lower levels

1730
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,592
They actively abstract

1731
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,408
Yeah little bit as a f*** you up

1732
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:35,040
Basically and this has been done by all of the everybody

1733
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,064
G w

1734
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,088
Rhw

1735
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,672
Absolutely

1736
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:42,720
Devastation

1737
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,536
Guys like Mark Moran

1738
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,328
Sucking

1739
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,096
Make everything

1740
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:48,864
Thanks so much

1741
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,400
They facilitate all the

1742
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:53,216
You never ever need to listen to

1743
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,520
If his name comes up

1744
01:31:56,288 --> 01:32:01,664
Just f****** go away it's really your thesis.

1745
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,688
Ever again

1746
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:08,064
If we're going to do a reverse knowledge fight we talk about the same guy over and over

1747
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:12,672
If I'm going to do it I'm going to talk about a guy we never speak

1748
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:15,488
Okay and I think Mark can explain

1749
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,304
Don't understand how people can fall

1750
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,328
Bass

1751
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,632
Rhetoric nonsense

1752
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:30,080
Yeah you hear that that's exact phenomenon from all these people so often is like expressing exact

1753
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:33,408
This b*******

1754
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,736
Salsa from 2014

1755
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,064
Well that's a bummer

1756
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,136
I don't know I mean

1757
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:49,792
Brandon sucks

1758
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:56,192
I don't know this subject matter nearly as well as you do it you know you're very busy

1759
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:59,520
Singularly focused on in the same way that I am like

1760
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:05,408
I don't know anti-communist propaganda so it's a little overwhelming

1761
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:09,504
And I hope to have a lot of

1762
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,952
Not geared to respond to things

1763
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,536
It's a challenge but it's

1764
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,304
Good job

1765
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:25,632
You as well

1766
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:30,240
No I went into this big Mark Marino Stockton now I am

1767
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:33,312
Come out similar thing

1768
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,896
You really

1769
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:42,528
F****** hero

1770
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,832
Absolutely

1771
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:49,440
I know this was a little bit of a depressing ending

1772
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:54,560
A little bit it's a little bit of a bummer and I don't want to leave people with like a sensitive glue

1773
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,096
You know

1774
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,936
You might have

1775
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:08,128
No it's not it's not a little bit because

1776
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:10,432
People like Mark Marino attack

1777
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:15,040
Greta you know that

1778
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,832
The reason isn't

1779
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:20,160
It doesn't work because there are so many solutions

1780
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,256
I worried that the way you frame

1781
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:29,376
Does lead to anxiety because of the

1782
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:34,240
That the climate scientist from the ipcc report

1783
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:38,592
They're under playing the reality of this underplaying the severity of it

1784
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:44,992
It does lead to possibility that the conclusion is there is nothing that can be done

1785
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:50,880
Sort of a fatalistic we're f*** no matter what we do kind of stay

1786
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:57,024
And I know that that's not your message and I know that that's not what you believe we should do anything cuz we're already f*****

1787
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:59,584
To come away from

1788
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:05,728
If you're not super clear get that impression I never want to give that message

1789
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:08,544
Because even if that's true I don't like

1790
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,128
That perception were true

1791
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:14,688
It's irresponsible thing to

1792
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,528
Here is here is why

1793
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,624
Did that and it's mainly because

1794
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,904
Severe mental health

1795
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:24,672
Separate

1796
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,440
That was there

1797
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,464
Which stated

1798
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,768
The more people know about it

1799
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,072
The more they understand what it is

1800
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:35,680
The more likely they are to accept government

1801
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,448
To make me action

1802
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:45,408
Protest just need to protest

1803
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:51,552
I'm out of office and get new people into a responsive and understands the situation

1804
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:54,624
I think there's four

1805
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:58,720
People about reality and

1806
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:02,560
You know pollution and its effects

1807
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:09,216
Bratwurst

1808
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:16,896
Yeah cause aspect that we should do

1809
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:22,784
That people being wore read up on

1810
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,880
Lead people to what that Mental Health Report is talking about

1811
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:28,160
That is

1812
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,976
Realizing the government needs to do more

1813
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:38,400
Everything is way under selling it

1814
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:46,336
I don't think that people to recognizing that the government needs to do more

1815
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,384
Regulation is necessary

1816
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:51,456
That could probably lead to people having a crippling

1817
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:54,016
Inability to act

1818
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:57,600
You're doing that

1819
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,880
Part of that

1820
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:01,952
While I do agree that it is important to stress to

1821
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,744
Folks that this is not

1822
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:07,072
Business as usual there is a crisis going on

1823
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,912
I think

1824
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,448
Viewing it in a

1825
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:18,592
No matter what happens we're f*** I think it's detrimental and it doesn't leave

1826
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,360
To the effect

1827
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,152
But that Mental Health Report

1828
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:26,784
I just want to I want to fight back against any kind of

1829
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,088
Gloom

1830
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:32,928
I thought I might even be feeling a tiny bit towards the end

1831
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,280
I suppose I suppose the main thing that I

1832
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,864
I suppose the main thing that I want

1833
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,424
Is for people to realize

1834
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,448
Is that this is not

1835
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,520
This is not a future

1836
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:48,800
This is

1837
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,824
Serious

1838
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,128
Right now right

1839
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:56,224
That's why I get so angry when I read an article

1840
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:57,760
Whatever

1841
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,904
As I know this is

1842
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:04,672
Now

1843
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:06,464
This is we got

1844
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,232
Do that

1845
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,512
We got a

1846
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,680
Well we need to get people to

1847
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,216
Direct action and

1848
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,800
If we don't do this by 12 years from now

1849
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:21,824
Going to be really trouble

1850
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:25,408
If we don't do this you know and then

1851
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:28,224
Where the

1852
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,528
That's pretty soon that's in your lifetime

1853
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
I mean

1854
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:38,976
Chicken Little linguine

1855
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:39,744
This guy is

1856
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:46,400
I get you anything there's a balancing act to it which is one of the most difficult things about it because

1857
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,680
There is the immediate

1858
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:53,568
Especially when you consider the experience of like the people in India

1859
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:56,384
Or the people in places that are experiencing drought

1860
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,944
For the people of the sea ice

1861
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:05,344
It is an immediate thing for a lot of people and we are slightly privilege

1862
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,648
Position that we can look at it abstract

1863
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:11,744
Cutting through that to make it an immediate

1864
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
Issue

1865
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,792
Is important

1866
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,608
At the same time

1867
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,936
Finding a way to do without

1868
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:22,752
The fatalistic Doom

1869
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:31,200
The part that threatening about people like Greta these other younger

1870
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:34,528
Climate activists as I think they're effectively able to do that

1871
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:38,368
They're effectively able to walk that balance of

1872
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,696
This is severely important right now

1873
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:43,744
And this is what we need to do right now

1874
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,280
Without

1875
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:49,632
Falling into traps of hopelessness and Gloom

1876
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:57,568
Little England is not necessary to make something immediate

1877
01:39:59,360 --> 01:39:59,872
I mean

1878
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:03,200
I suppose you also

1879
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,736
The people who are

1880
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,552
You know that always that gets

1881
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,624
What do clapping

1882
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,464
Not understand

1883
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,536
No like there's 100 reasons

1884
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:21,888
Wasn't like the whole audience claps

1885
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:28,032
People who were

1886
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,080
With her in her group

1887
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:36,480
You know that you don't know who was classified into it a lot of different

1888
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:41,600
Scenario it's delusional people don't understand

1889
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:43,648
Cheering section who was along for

1890
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,416
The speech

1891
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,464
There's a lot of

1892
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,000
I don't know

1893
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,304
There's a lot of assumptions that could be made

1894
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,888
IHOP

1895
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,680
It's just so

1896
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:59,520
And you're absolutely right that she can thread the needle

1897
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:01,568
Again

1898
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,336
There's a reason

1899
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,384
Absolutely

1900
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,432
Play that's what makes her so threatening

1901
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,456
Because if it was me

1902
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:12,576
Effective messenger for this

1903
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,624
Probably

1904
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,232
Well I mean on a grander stage I would have gotten to tell them

1905
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,768
That they're big dumb dumb

1906
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:27,424
And that would have been very satisfied that is true when you get to town

1907
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:33,312
United Nations ready to cut the US stick off or something

1908
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:40,992
So I mean I guess I think

1909
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:41,760
You know

1910
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:45,088
Just have to you have to treat it like

1911
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,112
Like you're saying

1912
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:49,184
Immediate right now kind of situation

1913
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:52,768
We also have to look at actionable items you have to look at

1914
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,048
Productive

1915
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,328
Solutions

1916
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,888
As opposed to coming to

1917
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,960
Ideas that there's nothing to do

1918
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:03,264
I agree with you it's such a balance

1919
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:08,896
I can see that that is important

1920
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:09,920
That balance

1921
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,344
But I do not know what the

1922
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,672
To

1923
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:23,488
Mark Moreno

1924
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:26,048
Never use single-use

1925
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:26,816
Utensils

1926
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:32,448
Ever

1927
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:37,568
A long way

1928
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:40,128
Because single-use utensils are one of the hugest

1929
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,688
Largest contributor

1930
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:44,480
Factors to all of the plastic

1931
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,504
Pollution

1932
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:52,160
And all you have to do right now is never use that f****** through trying to put those good Americans at the sports Factory

1933
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,184
Out of a job

1934
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,976
Bring the sparks in

1935
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:55,744
Justice

1936
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,280
Spike that piece of s***

1937
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:07,776
Fatalistic

1938
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
Spite

1939
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,848
Against

1940
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,872
Perfectly

1941
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:12,896
Bring your own Utah

1942
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,176
I mean it

1943
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,480
So

1944
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:23,392
I think we have a website

1945
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:36,704
I suppose that makes me

1946
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,496
What am I

1947
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:42,592
Dgx-500 I'll tell you who I am

1948
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:45,408
That's who I am

1949
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:47,968
Holding

1950
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,600
