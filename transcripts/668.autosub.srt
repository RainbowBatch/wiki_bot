1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,048
Joseline and talk a little bit about

6
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
DeAndre Jordan

7
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
What's up

8
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
My brakes

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Rare

10
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
This was one of your bright spots

11
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,408
Where's that I actually end up taking somebody's

12
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
A something but

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,784
Watch the bit of Taskmaster

14
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,696
Freddy can't make it much of a better show than that really can't be sidekick

15
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,256
Just pretty fun and 5

16
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
Comedians

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
You're forced to do random

18
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Bizarre

19
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
Tiffany

20
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
Requiring tap

21
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
Very much so

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,848
Activity is pointless scores

23
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,688
It was hard for me to conceptualize when you were describing it

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,504
The way you described as I kind of sounds interesting but I couldn't

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,320
Put the pieces together

26
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
It's

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
It's very good

28
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
Very entertaining

29
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Addictive

30
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
But I also don't think

31
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
You could ever work

32
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
Isn't America

33
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
Gunshow

34
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
Like I don't I think

35
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
It has to be a British

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
I'm telling you right now

37
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,728
It is you and I who can run American Taskmaster the end that's it

38
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
But then it would you be

39
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,592
Great should I be great

40
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,920
Both have to find a weird way to be both add each other aggressive

41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:31,552
Right I don't know I think difficult

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Conceivably

43
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,440
But he's also the second banana so that's me

44
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
So it's like

45
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Butt stuff

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,768
Greg Davies

47
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
Giant loud angry piece of s***

48
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,264
Condescension

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Yeah

50
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,128
I think that's the main problem why this couldn't be an American show

51
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:02,272
The sensibility of it is really tough to translate

52
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
They tried and they they tried and Alex Horne told the story that they tried to one cut it down to a half hour

53
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
Irish Oso

54
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
Already it is over

55
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,008
First thing he said was like well when we tried to bring it over they wanted to make it a half hour show

56
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:28,896
And I stopped reading cuz it's like no you already lost then you didn't do it you did a bad job

57
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,480
Part of part of the charm of it is the feeling of

58
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,880
How long is a met these people do things

59
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
Two or three months

60
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
What's your we didn't talk about it

61
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:59,104
But on the day of our last recording our brains right eyebrows Serenity High

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
Thursday

63
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
April

64
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,808
Okay baby

65
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
Ohtani

66
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
Four innings

67
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
2/3 pics

68
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,791
9 strikeouts Man 9 strikeout not bad

69
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,167
That's pretty good a stout

70
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
Hasn't hasn't hit a Dinger yet but it's coming you don't need to hit one open again

71
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,151
That's great I'm happy for you I know that this is you were

72
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:38,015
Tengo it was possibility of it not happening it was a

73
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Get to watch a lot of

74
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Gamers

75
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
199 thousand

76
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
View

77
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:52,095
How many episodes

78
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:56,191
We are going to talk about present a business or about April 8th

79
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
2022

80
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,823
But also before we do that we have to check in with a little Special Report Alex put out from

81
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,919
Connecticut where he was visiting to do his deposition

82
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
That sounds about right

83
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
Let's say hello doesn't do wasps

84
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,719
The First AME from Fort Meade Maryland thank you so much you are now policy wonk

85
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:25,119
Daybreak's all the time back when I would stay home from school

86
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
Northern Exposure

87
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
Text Scott Lively but not that

88
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
Scott Lively much better Scott Lively

89
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,615
Even if being better than that Scott Lively is not much of an accomplishment

90
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
Thank you so much

91
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
I'm a policy wonk

92
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,575
I'm confused as to who the top Scott Lively in this situation is but I'm grateful to both there's a hierarchy

93
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,207
Next congratulations on your free bottle of wine thank you so much

94
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,023
Thank you so much

95
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Schmidt

96
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,375
This is technically a birthday shout-out.

97
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,959
Next

98
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,287
Marriage is a false

99
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
I'm a policy wonk

100
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,383
Thank you very much in a lot of

101
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,711
People like it

102
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,551
So thank you so much

103
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,855
It's time to pay

104
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
I have

105
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
Risen above

106
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
Miami star

107
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,887
A list for me

108
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
And then we're going

109
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
To come back

110
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
And I'm going to start the show over

111
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
F*** you

112
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
F*** you

113
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,503
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

114
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295
F*** you and your new world order

115
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
And f*** the horse you rode in on

116
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
And all your s***

117
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
Maybe today

118
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

119
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
I'll walk out of here tomorrow

120
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
And you never see me again

121
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Really what I want to do

122
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
I never want to come back

123
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
Back here again

124
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
Apologized

125
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
To the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

126
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,103
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

127
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
I'll be better tomorrow

128
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
He's never better tomorrow

129
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
It's bad

130
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,551
For quite a while

131
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,111
Alex had been dodging his deposition

132
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,695
Connecticut's Sandy Hook case

133
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
And I've come up with

134
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,303
Fun excuses like doctor marbles looked at me and was shocked

135
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
I was sick

136
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
He looked at me and I was like at your right

137
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
I can't go to that deposition

138
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,007
Yeah a lot of those sort of like when I would take a charley horse

139
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
To get out of PE kind of kind of business

140
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:47,967
59 fly and So eventually Alex's hit with these these escalating penalties

141
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
$25,000 a day

142
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,319
Until you went inside for his deposition

143
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
I went to Connecticut

144
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
It did not fly so Alex himself did he must

145
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
Connecticut

146
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,791
So he did that was out at the studio for a lot of

147
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
The past weekend

148
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Now so we don't have a whole lot

149
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
To go over chair

150
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
In his absence

151
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
But while he was in Connecticut

152
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,543
He might have made a critical error

153
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
And that is he recorded a video of himself

154
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,967
Talking about the deposition no no no no

155
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,343
Possibly open up the window for his deposition to become Publix at he's making

156
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
Public statements about it

157
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,183
Real disaster

158
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,535
Couple of out-of-context drop

159
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
UPS from Las Vegas

160
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
Dreamy creamy

161
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Gross

162
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:48,127
Listen to that

163
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
Because it's dirty

164
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,759
Here's the other one maybe this'll likely clean the taste out your mouth

165
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
Am I on the air

166
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
Hello

167
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,207
Okay that's better

168
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
That's better

169
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,727
This will not be the new Breaking.

170
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,871
Here is the beginning of Alex's conversation about

171
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
Is that position

172
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
From his trip to kinetic

173
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,503
Alex Jones here on April 5th

174
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
2022

175
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
Connecticut

176
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
Yesterday afternoon

177
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
Hearing Connecticut

178
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Costco

179
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
It was just Macs

180
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Level like a hallucination

181
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,567
They start out with demonizing

182
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
Global government

183
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Just last week

184
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,015
The Davis Group Matt announced the world government planetary control

185
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Are we ready

186
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Absolute tyranny

187
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:14,911
Is someone

188
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
So yeah we got to already

189
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:22,335
Talking about stuff that happened in the deposition presumably at least according to Ali

190
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,687
You have his version of things that they demonized

191
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
For believing in a new world order

192
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
And I need a place that clip

193
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
Doesn't say what he says

194
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Says

195
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
This is just a levisa

196
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
I mean

197
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
I think

198
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
What he's

199
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,303
Cuz I feel like the point that I'm supposed to take away from that is that

200
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,191
It is so ridiculous for the lawyers to vilify Alex Jones for believing in a new world cover

201
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Right right

202
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
And then he plays the clip of the

203
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,919
Theoretical new world government in in question but the person is just saying are we ready for

204
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
New State of Affairs in the world

205
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,647
Not so much are we ready for the Illuminati to ascend into their demonic Foreman

206
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
Bleed all our children

207
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:16,351
Editing in the reality that exposes why Alex

208
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Being made fun of

209
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
4

210
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,543
Shirley begin a new world government because it's such a small clip the appearance could be made that like haha I actually am right

211
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
I took fun

212
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,151
Possible anyway so Alex Alex's like these people

213
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,039
Lawyers questioning me about the new world order they are just like the media back in the day pretending

214
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
That this stuff wasn't real

215
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
Watching this unfold

216
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
And I'm just realizing they're like

217
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
20 years ago

218
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
When 60 minutes

219
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
There's no Global government there's no transhumanism

220
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,727
There's no plans for any of this

221
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
They're going to outlaw

222
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,663
Questioning big events like wmds in Iraq

223
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Or

224
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,527
Jussie Smollett

225
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,879
What should I do

226
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
Like script

227
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,839
Weapons of mass destruction in Iraq

228
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,423
And jussie Smollett are the things that Alex will say

229
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
I would

230
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
Say that I have some doubts

231
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
Smollett was a major world events

232
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
I would even go so far as to say

233
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
Strongly the opposite is true

234
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Right

235
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,599
I think I think that Alex just had such a really difficult time

236
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
Rationalizing his action

237
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
That he's needed to come up with short

238
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
And this is what he's come up with

239
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,303
Every time

240
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Yeah I mean

241
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,495
Don't you ever stop and think man if all of my here's my examples I've got one

242
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
Wmds

243
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,847
Total Knockout absolute slam dunk

244
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
Sure government lied

245
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Flies

246
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,247
Worlds at stake amazing important

247
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Got that one

248
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,927
Example number to jussie Smollett I think I don't have a good argument.

249
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
Drop yeah

250
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
Alex I will try to discredit

251
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
Is a little bit introspect

252
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,887
You are about to his behavior

253
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
But here's the big takeaway

254
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Years before I was sued

255
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,015
This is all about them being holier-than-thou

256
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
They're the Arbiters of Truth and Dare the Democrats

257
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
They're the ones that love you and Alex

258
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
Challenges the devil

259
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Consciously

260
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
Literally

261
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Those are not

262
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:03,007
Algos wmds jussie Smollett it goes on and on Alex's Sandy Hook

263
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,055
The cases are to distract from

264
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
Judith Miller's reporting

265
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,967
You got it

266
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:17,343
Okay and then when people have Judas Village report

267
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
I think

268
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
This is soft

269
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
Azumanga

270
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
Well it is nice

271
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,655
Picked up some of my criticisms might be a little harsher than his own self

272
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Criticism

273
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,543
I'm also the last animedia are not the Arbiters of Truth

274
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
He's on the wrong side of it

275
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Anyway

276
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,991
The problem for the New World Order is the everyone's waking up

277
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
To stop people from waking up

278
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Bye

279
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,927
Suing Alex again is that it yeah I guess okay

280
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,767
Crazy as a Publix basically totally woken up

281
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Around the world

282
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
They're doing

283
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
Is reversing that

284
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:07,519
But they picked these weird Mirotic subject like January 6th or Alex Jones Sandy Hook

285
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
And they just obsessed like a religion

286
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
Everywhere I Go

287
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,015
You're shaking hands

288
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,319
But a lot of more mad at me Lego hey

289
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,975
And expose don't even get our Law Firm

290
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
That the world has moved on

291
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,095
From their BS and yeah do I make mistakes

292
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
I don't lie on purpose

293
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Like

294
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
The corporate media does on record

295
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,335
The people in their Ivory Towers do realize the people have moved on from their BS

296
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Right but that's

297
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,967
The thought that Alex has after saying that a lot of the people that he meets

298
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
Are like hey man why does

299
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,831
Stop saying it's a deal goes fake absolutely

300
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,927
Yes but those are the people who have moved on from the BS

301
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
Why would they move on from

302
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Wait

303
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,535
How can I move on from the BS

304
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,119
Isn't really at the end of the day saying that he still think Sandy Hook was staged

305
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,935
I think in a very roundabout way

306
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:13,055
Directional take we've we've gotten to his

307
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,639
The BS newbie like being mad at Alex

308
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,711
For questioning it and have you quotes

309
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
The Yankees

310
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
Yeah that seems ill-advised

311
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,415
Norm is standing right next to him

312
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
Good job

313
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,767
ABS Alex declares himself the you-know-what The Rock

314
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
He's a people

315
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,191
I was also going to go with the Michael Bay movie

316
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:47,615
The rock is the people's champ

317
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,175
Hey change the people's elbow to the corporate elbow

318
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
No one liked it

319
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
The difference

320
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
And so I am

321
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
The populist champion

322
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,951
Cuz I'm not perfect but mean well

323
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,559
People love me and because I admit I'm wrong sometimes people love me but I'm high

324
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
I'm not trying a lot of pee

325
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,423
People on purpose and when I'm wrong I will admit it

326
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
C-3PO

327
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
Will never admit they're wrong

328
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:21,407
So Alex never lies on purpose and never realize it all lies about something or get something

329
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Personally like

330
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
Thirty seconds later he says this

331
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,063
Associated Press reported that I wrote a book called

332
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
Nobody died at Sandy Hook

333
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,023
When you bring up these Warriors

334
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
They're part of the established

335
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
Alarm

336
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
Lying about that

337
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,335
And has been for quite a while

338
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,199
Lawyers on ladders and stuff they have

339
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:01,599
He has every reason to know that the AP didn't publish that headline and him asking them for a retraction is impossible

340
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
It wasn't publication that they put out

341
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Yasso

342
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
He knows that this is wrong

343
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:12,095
Based on everything he said about this he has every reason to know that it's wrong

344
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,679
And therefore he has to be actively lying about this intentionally

345
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,263
I don't know I feel like he needs to make a retraction

346
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
Yeah I think it's I think it's best

347
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
Pitch at this point is

348
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,687
At a fundamental level cannot tell the

349
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Prince between

350
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Reality in

351
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
In falsehood

352
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,063
Cuz I just don't know what the difference between truth and fiction

353
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,159
Right when I say I'm not trying to lie on purpose

354
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,719
You can't help but believe me because f***

355
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,767
Anything Could Be True in my brain

356
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
If if

357
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,423
Know the difference between reality and falsehood and was like

358
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:54,591
I'm telling you the truth 100% but also I don't know if that actually laugh

359
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,151
Dangerous

360
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,807
So you might recall that in the lead-up to Russia invading Ukraine

361
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Interesting perspective

362
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,903
She was great in that Ukraine was

363
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Waiting for it

364
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Thought that

365
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
You can find no fault

366
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
Most honest man is ever

367
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
So there was also a bit of

368
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
Issue with the state department

369
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
Coming out and saying that Russia had planned

370
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,775
To use false-flag

371
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Texas pre-tax

372
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,871
I to initiate

373
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:34,783
Your call Alex's perspective on that the government should

374
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,927
Call something a false flag no history of bright

375
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
I'm the devil I'm Satan

376
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
Narrative

377
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
I'm not the only one questioning now

378
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
The state department

379
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,471
5 weeks ago

380
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,991
And they said you or Alex Jones for saying Russia make steaks

381
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551
Of course government

382
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
Cool flags

383
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
Alex Jones

384
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:28,799
Okay cuz it's kind of complicated cuz I guess the official narrative

385
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,895
Name of the Russian invasion

386
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
Justify starting a war

387
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,783
That's wild because like you recalled Alex was one of the people who was criticizing the State Farm

388
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,439
Or something

389
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
Also it's not

390
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,791
Questioning things that the problem it's a declaring something

391
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
With no evidence

392
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,983
It's right about the state department

393
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Evidence

394
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,311
It's a it's a sort of slippery

395
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,615
Kind of thing to try and get ahold of

396
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
The dangerous precedent

397
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
And

398
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
Applies Alex as well

399
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,807
Criticism equally applies in both

400
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Direct

401
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
In this case

402
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:20,768
It seems like they were working on solid intelligence where is Alex just called everything that's inconvenient

403
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,840
I think so they can profit off so very different

404
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,936
Do you think it's possible to adequately explain to him

405
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,472
The difference between a quest

406
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Should like

407
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,544
Is something that the government said true

408
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,104
And a declarative statement like

409
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,920
I know beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt

410
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:43,808
That the government is murdering your children right now and you should go start a fire and responses

411
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,600
Now you got to be impossible

412
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,464
Love if the state department representative just came out it was like

413
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,536
I'm just questioning things

414
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,800
Also I want to take a little moment to bask in the ways we can say that Russia has ended

415
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:11,200
Hesitated Ukraine has it I don't know has it you f****** tell me you trust this music

416
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,552
Trust me I don't want you you don't trust you

417
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:25,280
Sake throw to smoke bobbed out screaming jumping

418
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Smollett

419
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,400
Disappearing into the date it's so let's let's take a moment really relish

420
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:35,776
Some of the ways that Alex has been so wrong about the situation in Ukraine

421
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,336
1 Selinsky was a double agent

422
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,128
That sad narrative is falling apart

423
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,272
There's going to be no resistance since Ukraine's government has been paid off it's just going to be no problem

424
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
Waltz right through the keys

425
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,368
The war's going to be over in 48 hours

426
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:55,488
Before The Invasion Alex at Boone just wanted to have open trade with Ukraine

427
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,888
5 Alex

428
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,704
That was just what I came up with on the top

429
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
My head feels like he's been

430
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
Very very

431
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
Polly Ave, clearing about

432
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
See the thing is evolving the situation at least

433
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Tumi

434
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:20,320
Is that I feel like there is one way to tie this all together all of his pre Russia invasion and

435
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:25,952
Post Russian invasion together and put that all together which is that zelinski double-crossed

436
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
Yes

437
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,864
He forgot he had the plan he did the whole thing he got elected to the leader of Ukraine

438
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
And when it was all about

439
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,448
To go right hahaha

440
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
Surprised I actually like Ukraine

441
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,544
I was fooling you I'm an actor

442
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,640
And then the whole thing could work

443
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
I have another way

444
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Salep

445
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:53,600
Nothing outside Alex's head actually exist

446
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Real

447
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
Haha

448
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,952
Claims that he was correct

449
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
About

450
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
The lead-up to Russia invading

451
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
I have some issues.

452
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,104
And that's why they're so pissed and so freaked out

453
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,200
Write 95 96 97 Priscilla time

454
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,040
I bet you do

455
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
But this isn't true

456
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,672
Gave his speech

457
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,512
That would be the eventual justification for The Invasion

458
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
I've never heard of modern world leader be this honest

459
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
We came in herds Ukrainian

460
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,544
And linen David all the way to begin with it's always

461
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Your son

462
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Balls cut off cuz

463
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,136
Cuz she's going to put your kids

464
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
With adults

465
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
Because

466
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:13,984
He wants to go back to Russia being Russian things were part of Russia we part about she doesn't want the other parts that weren't part of

467
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,312
Caesar the things that are Caesar's

468
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,408
You're not over there in Russia or not

469
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,320
Later he said that he just wants to economic relations opened up with the Ukraine

470
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,368
It's really

471
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:35,232
Ukraine's fault for being so belligerent isn't their desire to not be taking over

472
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Was

473
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,840
In any way saying that there was going to be an invasion it was

474
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,376
Solely and in

475
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
Higher leaf

476
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,448
About Janice kinloch

477
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,008
That was the only thing that he was

478
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:53,152
Because otherwise he would have been saying that Putin was about to engage in a depression

479
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:57,248
Other event / and that's not something that he would

480
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
I have sat

481
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,856
He's a complete liar trying to rewrite what he said

482
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
So fucken

483
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
Also

484
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
F*** Norm

485
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:12,608
What you doing in this video confused as to why he's there at all it's to try

486
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,912
To get Alex and more trouble prop like

487
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,752
Before you dinners going to spend about 5-10 minutes

488
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,800
Take your time

489
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,848
And where this is all going north

490
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,944
It was a long and difficult day we appeared for the deposition

491
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
9:30

492
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
5:45

493
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,856
Under court order we have to give to complete days we took a brief lunch break

494
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,648
In the afternoon

495
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
We're at 1 in the morning 1 in the afternoon

496
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
Great job.

497
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Questions

498
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,792
As many of them

499
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,840
About Sandy Hook as I would have expected

500
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,936
I'm there were questions about events unrelated to Sandy Hook

501
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
And it struck me as abroad

502
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
Wholesale attack on mr. Jones

503
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
Infowars

504
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,104
Questioning of narrative

505
00:26:55,616 --> 00:27:01,760
It struck me that the attack here was not on behalf of the parents of Sandy Hook but on behalf of people fart

506
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Are different

507
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,136
Ubuntu not not sued in the case I heard questions about people who

508
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,464
Reporter Dan batondy of former reporter

509
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,096
Who asked questions of public officials who mr. Jones was asked repeatedly what it was appropriate for him to ask those questions

510
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,376
Those officials never

511
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,984
I can explain this to Norman he knows exactly why those questions were asked

512
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,360
It was because Alex would send a Tandy out to places like Boston

513
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:32,736
The Marathon bombing and he would go and harass people and make us

514
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,296
Cena press conferences so Alex will get more ratings

515
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,600
And then afterwards

516
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,136
Alex sent him to Newtown

517
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,208
Where he went and harassed people with the Wolfgang

518
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
How big

519
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:48,608
And so the premise of is it appropriate these things that he did is to establish that Alex

520
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,448
Knew damn well the kind of behavior that a doggy engages in

521
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
I am still was

522
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,872
Open to and excited to have him go cover Sandy Hook related issue

523
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:04,480
So that's that's that's why North

524
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
Box

525
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:15,488
You know exactly why these questions are happening you're trying to create this

526
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
This

527
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
Fictitious premise about the question

528
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
Turning those going on to make Alex look like more of

529
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
Like A persecuted victim yeah I mean that's that's

530
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,008
Boring that's really that's really bad

531
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,664
I think it doesn't have much to work with probably it's true that's true

532
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,712
Alex keeps yelling Jessie Smollett

533
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,504
That is that is a good boy

534
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
Not a good boy. A lot of

535
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:45,440
Raw material after a 10-hour deposition

536
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,512
Your Norm pad if you were there the whole f****** time

537
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,864
You're here with Alex to bring your big guns about what it is they're doing wrong and you're like

538
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,240
They seem to ask questions about dhanbad on DL person 100% relevant to the questions that we were talking about

539
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,824
Who harassed people in Newtown

540
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:08,480
Cool weird it's not it's like he wasn't even at Sandy Hook on the deck no that's okay

541
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,808
So Norm has a little bit of a performer

542
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,880
Review for Alex about his his deposition

543
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
Marcellus wasn't perfect today but it didn't

544
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,256
Punjabi showed far more patience than I would have or perhaps

545
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,328
Could have been from time-to-time tempers flared in the room

546
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,168
A in general I thought Alex was

547
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Patient

548
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,752
Was as direct as could be

549
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
In the face of

550
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Repetitive and sometimes

551
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
Sneering and mocking question

552
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,712
We have another full day ahead tomorrow and I'm going to work both going to need a good night rest

553
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,272
And hopefully we can wrap this deposition up

554
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
This is probably

555
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
Deeply

556
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,368
Deeply irresponsible and inappropriate

557
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:51,744
The characterizing the opposing counsel is sneering and mocking question

558
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
The

559
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,888
This kind of stuff is is trying to create a story about the deposition

560
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,192
That is inappropriate if it's

561
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
Not public information

562
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
If this is

563
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,336
There's an expectation of confidentiality surrounding this

564
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,616
This is just

565
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,200
Flagrantly abusive that confidentiality

566
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
Yeah I mean

567
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,296
The other side can't talk about it now you're doing a shoot promo

568
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,952
You're over there they're f****** this is professional wrestling they're turning a was supposed to be out actually

569
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
Off-screen conflict

570
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,888
Into a foreground drama more appropriately would be there going into business for themselves

571
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:35,520
Scaccia would be more than they have this expectation of confidentiality that

572
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,824
Exist within the case

573
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,968
And then instead of agreeing to that they go ahead and play their own game expensive

574
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:51,904
Just start beating the s*** out of

575
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,720
Probably going to have some coffee

576
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,768
I would assume I would hope so

577
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Sonor medicine predict

578
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,608
About the song Kiss this trial

579
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,680
Trial is set to take place this summer

580
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,240
And it's looking to me and I'd wanted

581
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
Chrissy theorist

582
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
This might be the trial

583
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
Century

584
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,664
As2

585
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
I'm at 2

586
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,808
Right of ordinary people to raise questions and draw unpopular conclusion

587
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,368
It appears to me that the Sandy Hook families

588
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:27,232
Have decided together with the New York Times and Elizabeth Williamson formerly the times editorial board

589
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,280
This is a trial not about damage

590
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
Sandy Hook

591
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,120
But what they perceive to be damage to the American Republic

592
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,936
And they do mr. Jones and Infowars

593
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,216
Something I can do with cancer

594
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,264
A cancer eating away at the truth

595
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
What they're missing is that we've lost

596
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,944
That's what makes Alex Jones industry

597
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:51,040
Yes it is what makes Alex popular

598
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
Created this

599
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:56,672
False reality that they insulate people within and scare people

600
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,000
About the external world in the people who

601
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
Believe and what they

602
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,816
Turbo fictional reality

603
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,608
Popular

604
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,192
You already lost

605
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:19,456
Put the system on trial

606
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Ridiculous

607
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:25,856
What is going to be the Scopes Monkey Trial that's what we're going to do this is comical

608
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,648
Comically delusional

609
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,256
So Alex brings up a jussie Smollett again

610
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
Dammit a lot

611
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Always

612
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,144
Shocking revelation

613
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,960
Most the time we're right about stuff

614
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,800
I almost didn't come out and say that I thought jussie Smollett stage thing

615
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
It didn't sound right

616
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,920
Whole story

617
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:01,184
But that's the difference I'm not mad

618
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,744
You ordered that a good price to pay

619
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:10,400
So the fact that Alex is angry almost didn't call jussie Smollett a false flag should give some indication of how arbitrary is

620
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
Birds are for disseminating information

621
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,592
He'll just say whatever he feels and presented as fact I may or may not end up being accurate but if it does it

622
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Coincidence

623
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,896
It's random

624
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,224
Accidental that he may get some

625
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,272
Things that heat instinctually thinks

626
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,088
Are are the reason

627
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
I remember this I was listening

628
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,440
The reason that Alex thought it was a false flag

629
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,744
Is because it was a racially motivated crime

630
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:40,864
That was being alive. Nothing to do with there was no other necessary

631
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,448
Am I guess I'm sort of the knee-jerk defense of the idea that it was Trump

632
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
Supporters who were

633
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,824
Riley alleged perpetrator

634
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:58,528
Also an important fact is conveniently ignoring here is that Madeleine Albright absolutely apologize for that

635
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,808
Comment that you made about sanction

636
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:04,160
In effect she did correct herself which Alex's pretending she didn't in order

637
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,608
It's fair to critique Madeleine Albright and you probably should harshly but this line of attack Alex

638
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
Is making his dishonest and self-serving

639
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,752
He just pretends that two people who have made statements and things that were

640
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,800
Inaccurate or offensive

641
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
I have not come out

642
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,128
Hey look that was that was f***** up

643
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
It bums me out

644
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,248
Because it almost

645
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,088
For an instant in your head you can see things going differently we're like

646
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
The jussie Smollett thing happening

647
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
Was that

648
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
Blast

649
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,488
That one lasso like I'm going to

650
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,024
My last nickel

651
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,560
On this

652
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,144
99 black I'm going to put my last nickel on nine black

653
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,544
And then it comes up and he's like s*** I was going to stop calling thing false-flag if this wanted turned out to not be a false flag

654
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,104
Every time I want out

655
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,432
Put me back in

656
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:04,832
January 6th false flag

657
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,880
Baby rattles off

658
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
That's not go well in courtroom no

659
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:15,840
What's the antifa

660
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:23,520
All was gay actors in the right rally is already much

661
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:28,896
Actors running around pretending to be

662
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:35,296
It seems like those would be very obvious one since they were Oklahoma City

663
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,368
Use those

664
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,720
Very very weird

665
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:49,376
So anyway Alex gets into more details that are probably inappropriate for him to be talking about about something that's presumably

666
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
Confidential

667
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
They worship her

668
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,216
Well look at me

669
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,992
Shatter Me.

670
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,368
Your dad says he was a combat Vietnam he was never there

671
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,416
Toys for Tots program

672
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,208
Special

673
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
To sit there

674
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,264
Brian Williams son I'm at Center Blumenthal son

675
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
Yeah so this probably isn't good

676
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,432
I wouldn't do that I wouldn't do that

677
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
I would have

678
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,480
Push them out of

679
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:42,880
View of the camera or broken the camera has thrown it against the wall

680
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:49,280
Hey going at a river

681
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:54,144
I have to advise you not post that video Alex just seems like it

682
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
It's really untoward

683
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:00,544
LOL it's lies Alex is your future bankruptcy lawyer I would recommend that you

684
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,848
So obviously

685
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
Of course

686
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
You know where this is heading

687
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
Of these

688
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
People his insane

689
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,136
Thanks for your prayers

690
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,904
Ford Fusion

691
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,976
Supporting infowarsstore.com

692
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,048
This fight is your fight this fight is my fight we're together

693
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,680
Bugging Infowars store

694
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,496
That's obviously

695
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:35,616
Norm has ever he's known Alex for years he has every reason to know that that's where this is going

696
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:40,480
That's the final thought is going to be about how like we can only do this because you're bored

697
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
We got so many shirts

698
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
It's so many

699
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
70000

700
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,416
Probably deeply and ethical

701
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
For him to participate in this

702
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:54,304
That's what I said about him being on air when Alex put the million-dollar bounty on

703
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
Chris Matthews

704
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:58,656
I would have thought they would have got him in trouble

705
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
But apparently

706
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,752
Being around for an active

707
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
Participant in things

708
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:08,128
Super f***** out doesn't get you disbarred

709
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,784
Yeah there is a little bit of a teams like the legal profession is a lot more fun

710
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:21,440
You know we got to stop Alex from doing this stuff and then like the lawyers who did the Alex SOB like a

711
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
You guys

712
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Don't do that

713
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,768
Next week

714
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,352
Come on get out of here let's go

715
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,424
So

716
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
On the evening of the seven

717
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
Some news broke

718
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
About

719
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,336
Some allegations

720
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,664
Text Maybe funny

721
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,064
Some places we can talk about that probably a bit more in the future but at this point

722
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,624
These are claims that are being made

723
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,720
Do you know that's on the night of the 7th this stuff starting to percolate

724
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,768
Alex comes in on the 8th

725
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
He's finally back

726
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
Ryan Connecticut

727
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
It's coming in hot

728
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,376
Cuba coming

729
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
He's more exhaust

730
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
While I was in

731
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
3 days

732
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
Suppose you're there

733
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
Total 4 days

734
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
Menopause 2 days

735
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
Get up here

736
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,512
Probably exhausted particularly at

737
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,608
Getting very loud in my bastic

738
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
That's really a k

739
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Exhausted

740
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,216
And I am

741
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:46,432
As they say ignorance is bliss in the beginning of knowledge

742
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
One of the 20th century and a joke

743
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
Bless

744
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,464
The beginning of knowledge

745
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Great sorrow

746
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
But also

747
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
Decency in Civilization

748
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
Everything we need

749
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
He had to resist saying power

750
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,104
Spider-Man

751
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,896
It was close

752
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,968
Now you know with great power

753
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:25,088
With response

754
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
You're just right there

755
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,672
If you have the means

756
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,464
Then

757
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,744
It's still there

758
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,560
Yes Alex's real is real tired

759
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:41,216
I agree with pretending to be passionate about things is a coping mechanism

760
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:46,336
But it's usually a coping mechanism for him being ill-prepared to do the show and not knowing anything about the topic

761
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Pixies cover

762
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,128
Usually that's

763
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:52,992
What the he's covering up but I mean the coping mechanism is still useful even if it's

764
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Spread

765
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,880
Most of the time I do this cuz I don't know anything because I'm an idiot

766
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,440
Now I'm doing it because I'm very tired

767
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:09,120
Like if you're bald maybe you wear a hat to cover up his book but it also gives you a little bit of sun per tag for your eyes

768
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,168
Same thing

769
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,192
Good stuff

770
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,240
The world's being destroyed

771
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,568
We are about to see the world we've known asteroid

772
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
Natachee's bill

773
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,712
System design

774
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
Asteroid human

775
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
It's made me into God

776
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Okay

777
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
It's very sad

778
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Spray paint

779
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
The spirit of evil

780
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,816
Spreading it's black

781
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,840
Wings Over the Earth

782
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Longstocking

783
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
Our children's

784
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
Take a nap

785
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
Sprewell

786
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
Good is not the only thing in the universe

787
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
Happening

788
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,247
And his windows good spirits do not stand up

789
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
Fight

790
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,319
Anderson's that innocence is destroyed

791
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Children

792
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,791
Rambling about this kind of s*** is also a coping mechanism

793
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:14,655
Is a little bit less entertaining and Littlest bombastic but it's the same thing

794
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:19,519
Grab a John Keats book off of the goddamn shelf if you're going to keep on this s***

795
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,823
Well what is beauty Dan

796
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
Beauty is truth

797
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,127
Atrocious

798
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:30,783
Event for a beautiful war is what John Keats was all about his power and power is responsibility

799
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,135
So good I left swipe

800
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,159
So

801
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,975
I just bought Rambo again for you

802
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
Seeds

803
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,871
When Jesus was at the Garden

804
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
70

805
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
What

806
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
Smelling at all

807
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
He wept

808
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,975
Jen said please take

809
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,679
Because only by knowing

810
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
In

811
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
Through

812
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,495
Beyond

813
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,543
Find archery place in.

814
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
Only by this test

815
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,663
And you will all be

816
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
Christ was

817
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,223
But you

818
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,367
Your soul is so beautiful

819
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,607
Your glory and your bike

820
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,631
Like the Green Goblin

821
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
The Creator

822
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
Spell

823
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
Candles and

824
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Created what

825
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
You are your mother's womb

826
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
Like Wednesday

827
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:11,647
No it's an explosion

828
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,207
The devil wants to eat you or something

829
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,511
Yeah I think that this is

830
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,815
Kind of fine as

831
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,095
Bland

832
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,887
Preaching

833
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:26,495
But yeah it's a it's the show that Alex is pretending he's doing not

834
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:33,151
Well I mean I will say that yesterday my partner and I were driving but she likes to listen to NPR

835
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,199
And we we had

836
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,735
Turn it off at one point because

837
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
Coming up next

838
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,807
What is the difference

839
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
Twin soil

840
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
And dirt

841
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,743
Next on Science Friday event guy risdall comes to know what the devil hates us Mark of God

842
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:53,119
I would prefer that

843
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,935
Sorry I'm br

844
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:01,311
I think fresh air would be so much better if it was just all ranting about the devil

845
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,591
Better than

846
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
What is the difference

847
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,639
Between soil

848
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,431
And honestly I would fight back

849
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,991
Incredibly, and probably informational

850
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:16,415
So I'm Alex transphobia going on

851
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,231
More colors than others

852
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,559
Here is just an interesting incidents of him making stuff up

853
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
Disappeared

854
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Woman A year had

855
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,703
If you thought she was a man

856
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,847
100012 years old

857
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
So cool

858
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:46,367
Alright first of all Angelina Jolie got a mastectomy because she gave the screaming.

859
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,903
Called brca1

860
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,695
Which dramatically increase the risk of

861
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
Developing breasts

862
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:57,631
In the general population the risk for women is about 12% of having breast cancer but if you have that Gene the risk goes up to 60 per

863
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,447
Her decision to get this procedure done prophylactic

864
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
Stickley was aching

865
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:05,823
Completely appropriate medical decision has nothing to do with any of the issues I was trying to cover

866
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,127
Second altitude making up all this

867
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:15,039
There are likely over 100,000 mastectomies performed every year in the country but the vast majority are related

868
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,575
The cancer or cancer prevention

869
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,903
Also the there's the issue that mastectomies are

870
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,791
The same thing is Top surgery in this gets a little bit murky and trying to parse out some of these details

871
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,631
Also no one would do Top surgery on a 12 year old

872
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,215
Better not appropriate given the

873
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,031
The standards of carrot that because this now

874
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:41,151
It would require is a comically evil villain that that's like stuff which Alex could only imagine

875
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
To do something insane

876
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,503
Yeah it would be it would not be appropriate at age

877
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,135
I was just making s*** up to freak out as listeners and make them hate trans people even more but it is interesting

878
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,927
Please bring up trans men

879
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,487
That's not something he usually even

880
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
Yeah

881
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,631
All of his fear narratives around to Dick being cut off

882
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,911
Well that's what I

883
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,959
That's what he tries to

884
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,799
Also all kinds of sphere around transport

885
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:15,199
No bathroom type legislation and note

886
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,759
All of his narratives that really struck me as strange

887
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,807
That he's talking about transmitted

888
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,111
Yeah it's just weird

889
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
It's very we

890
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
I don't know

891
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
Why why were they such big

892
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,559
What are you doing get a job

893
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
Not sure

894
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,143
The big news story about the pole

895
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,703
About Biden voters

896
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,799
Western Journal

897
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,127
70% of Voters would have

898
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,967
About the stories covered

899
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,503
And censured by the media

900
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
Hunter Biden

901
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
Peter Rabbit

902
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
Talking about

903
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,231
Head of Chinese intelligence

904
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:07,167
He's worth 57 billion dollars missing and he's disappeared

905
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,919
That's where we are

906
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,455
Skip character work

907
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,759
Where where are we

908
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,063
That's where we are

909
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:30,719
So this is actually a pole of the media Research Center which is not a reputable

910
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,743
Organization

911
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:38,143
There are right-wing entity that's largely funded by billionaires like the Mercers and big corporations like Exxon

912
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:44,031
Was reported by NewsBusters which is a Blog that's run by the media Research Center

913
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:50,175
This blog post wasn't recovered by the Western journal and then that's Now with Alex is ripping off of for Azadi

914
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:54,783
Seems weird that Alex wouldn't just look into where the pool came from and reported directly

915
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,135
Just skimmed headlines it's someone else printed out for him and putting the big stacky

916
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:06,047
Anyway some of the stories that they asked in this pole like the presence of the poll was if you'd known about these stories would it have

917
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,607
Change your vote

918
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,143
Question voting for Biden

919
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,471
You're really stupid headline have you seen Flashdance

920
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,871
There was once covered like Hunter Biden's laptop Scandal which Alex's characterizing in his typical restrain

921
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
Train fashion

922
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,711
But also want the stories that they asked about was quote

923
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,759
Harris most leftist senator

924
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,831
So do I

925
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:35,231
A lot of folks who aren't thrilled with vines performance so far as a whole

926
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
I think that's fair

927
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,071
I don't necessarily mean that they would all wished they had

928
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:45,471
Had voted for Trump though which is with his NewsBusters article is arguing really seems like they're missing a lot of the context

929
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,031
Lied about all this stuff

930
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:54,431
Then drop would have gotten all the vote obviously which I guess is the next Retreat after you

931
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,991
Sail with the Vietnamese North Vietnamese boat

932
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:03,391
What's with all the Audits and all that kind of chips

933
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,975
I guess we're not really going to be able to convince

934
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Anybody the

935
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,071
Did actually win the election

936
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,119
We play a game

937
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:16,447
Exactly yeah yeah yep now I mean

938
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,263
We wouldn't want to do that in the other direction as well though

939
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:22,079
Like let's not relive gave any other

940
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,639
Elections what they're like this.

941
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,431
Say in like 2016 like

942
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,967
If you knew this about Trump

943
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,271
Would you have voted for you one of those

944
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:36,671
Let's not do 12 goes back like a 2000 election to re-vote for

945
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,463
All of it

946
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,279
Do we have to try and figure out how history would have gone

947
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:45,119
Might as well

948
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:49,471
Compares his enemies to characters in a specific

949
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,519
Pig movie

950
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:58,175
I'd like you to try and guess what he is and what the characters are

951
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,967
3 question 30 will answer

952
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,015
Alright genre of movie

953
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,039
Cartoon

954
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
Cartoon alright

955
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,367
Decade

956
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,415
What decade was the movie made in

957
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,695
Food Nelly

958
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:17,119
I can say with confidence that was the last 20 years has probably in the

959
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Thousands to 2,000

960
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,191
Sometimes I don't know exact release date

961
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,495
Alright this kind of Blends into all right

962
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,287
I'm going to go and

963
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:28,127
This could because I'm way off on the date really want to say Finding Nemo

964
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,687
What were the characters

965
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,527
I don't know which one

966
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,343
Dory Ellen

967
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,183
You are incorrect

968
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,719
You're not going to just get put

969
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,583
Oh no no no no you're going to

970
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,119
The inside of a

971
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,143
Federal Prison

972
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,263
Criticized

973
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,359
Do they said in A Bug's Life

974
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,711
Call Suter Farms realizing

975
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,575
Grasshopper grasshopper why'd you just attacked and beat up that

976
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
One little

977
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,903
You didn't follow your orders you just ignoring

978
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,975
Because because if you let one ant stand up

979
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:15,999
They might

980
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,839
And there goes our way of life

981
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,863
Bug's Life

982
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:21,887
Wow

983
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,679
He took Alex

984
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
I mean what it's been

985
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,751
20 years

986
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,311
Something like that I'm like that that was Dave Foley

987
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:34,431
That was Dave Foley starring in A Bug's Life

988
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:41,855
Yep so Alex

989
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,439
Playing that clip from Buchheit later

990
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,791
I guess I don't remember like it

991
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,399
Movie

992
00:52:56,447 --> 00:53:01,311
There is a little bit of a response to the stories about

993
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:04,127
The claims that he may be moving money around

994
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,199
But he is also lying about what the story is

995
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,271
Why don't the Democrats care

996
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:12,063
It was a town hall article last

997
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
Monday

998
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
Monday

999
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:23,071
What the Democrats are trying to implode themselves

1000
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,631
It's like they're trying to destroy themselves

1001
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,703
Mission is to destroy America

1002
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,519
Any free systems are the demolition operative

1003
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,079
In this economic cultural spiritual

1004
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,615
Biological chemical War

1005
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,367
Because they want to get rid of people because I like to kill people

1006
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,647
Because they're bad

1007
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,423
Happening here around the world that's what happen

1008
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
When good people do nothing

1009
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,359
Disinfo articles

1010
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
A lot of fat

1011
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,407
Fake news out there

1012
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,967
Infowars is swimming

1013
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:18,367
And money money that's leaving our pool very quickly

1014
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,903
Yeah

1015
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,463
Think they at more accurately said

1016
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,535
If these stories are to be understood as

1017
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,351
And I bet they're being reported in like raw story

1018
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:32,959
It's swimming in money and more that the pool is being great

1019
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,239
As you are you're saying

1020
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:41,407
A bunny might be

1021
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:47,551
But other people don't know where those pools hidden pools

1022
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,087
True

1023
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,647
Articles

1024
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
A lot of fake

1025
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
News out there

1026
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,511
Infowars has swimming in money

1027
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
And

1028
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,191
Imports is not want to have layoffs

1029
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,727
I personally

1030
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,263
Bought an expensive nice house

1031
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
4 years ago

1032
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
That's

1033
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,735
What we do

1034
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,599
That's your that's your best bet

1035
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,415
Couple million the bank

1036
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
Maximum

1037
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,231
Troll stuff

1038
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,815
I personally have exhausted my phone

1039
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,119
Which is fine I don't care

1040
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,751
We really need your support

1041
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,287
Plus we got great products show

1042
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
Play The Weeknd

1043
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,639
It is the part two of the

1044
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,711
Founding member

1045
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
Coins

1046
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:54,879
Please be by my overpriced coin amazing from high ridiculously backed up novelty

1047
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
Coin

1048
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,975
Obviously it's pretty predictable

1049
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:05,375
Anytime any kind of story like this comes out that's kind of threatening to Alex is going to use it as a fundraising opportunity

1050
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:12,543
Do they found out that I've been stealing money from them my people will love to give me money for that

1051
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,591
Interesting

1052
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,895
It's an interesting strategy

1053
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,479
Spearly offensives

1054
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,503
This is a

1055
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,135
Skip ahead a little bit

1056
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:30,207
But you're a Alex discusses

1057
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,487
Just some

1058
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,255
Some shity

1059
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,279
Gitty perspective

1060
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,071
Here's Jim stocking

1061
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,423
Does gender affirming healthcare for transgender

1062
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,727
Is the best practice

1063
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,823
The potentially life-saving care that's what they're all saying

1064
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,383
Commit suicide if you don't

1065
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Bojangles off

1066
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,735
Think about that

1067
00:56:54,271 --> 00:57:00,159
Transgenders have the highest level of suicide and lowest life receive anybody in the world because they've been

1068
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,143
People

1069
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,799
That's her free will just

1070
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,591
From the children

1071
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
Okay

1072
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,175
So I mean obviously

1073
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,247
He's putting forth his s***

1074
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,575
And not backed up by anything other than his own bigotry

1075
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:32,927
Who is essentially just like

1076
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:33,951
Yeah

1077
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:38,047
If your if you are a very important you cannot exist in society

1078
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,583
You can't exist

1079
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
In public

1080
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
Take care of you can't

1081
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,471
Away from the children

1082
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,519
What is

1083
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,823
Then what what is that entail

1084
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,895
How far does that go cuz it's not just like okay

1085
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,919
You can't be a teacher

1086
00:57:54,687 --> 00:58:00,063
No no it'll be the idea of you needs to be away from my children which means it can't be on TV

1087
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:07,231
Read about it being a public position where maybe you achieve something that's irrelevant to the news their child might learn about

1088
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:13,631
They were to say oh this person was the first trans person to become president that would be here in my life

1089
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,655
Is VRBO

1090
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,935
Now probably

1091
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,471
Can't go to a church

1092
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,775
No cuz you probably be around children

1093
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:24,127
No know what you would have to do is go to a place where they were only other trans people

1094
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,687
People who also couldn't be part of society

1095
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,735
And they would have to be kept there because

1096
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,759
Ghetto people want to

1097
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,575
Be part of society you would have to have some sort of

1098
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,623
Thing to keep them all in one

1099
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:41,279
Obviously these kind of social stigmatization Czar the things that Alex wishes

1100
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:44,351
To see put in place for the effect

1101
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,399
Essentially eliminating trans

1102
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,935
Distance Society

1103
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:52,799
Whether it be through silence or by

1104
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,639
And that framing

1105
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,919
List

1106
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
I don't care what you

1107
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,247
Because

1108
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,551
And I met and that's fine

1109
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,599
And it's not me trying to hurt you

1110
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,903
The globalists are trying to exterminate

1111
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,671
Trans people

1112
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,439
Write those

1113
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,463
Globalists are you

1114
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,559
I just don't want you to anywhere near my children or you the existing

1115
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:17,887
Interview to be something they know about or for you to continuous

1116
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,215
Net effect

1117
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,287
Asian that

1118
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,079
To increase

1119
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:29,151
Is the kind of pressure

1120
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:29,919
That

1121
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,455
Drives people

1122
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,735
Go to

1123
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,015
Suicide

1124
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,039
He'll just

1125
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:39,647
Not recognize and wrestle with the with that his merry way being

1126
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,439
Yeah I mean you know just

1127
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,279
Holding a club hitting somebody saying

1128
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
Thank God it's me hitting you

1129
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:51,935
Those imaginary demons above my head May really be making weird Club

1130
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,775
Yep so Alex complains about how

1131
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
The

1132
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:00,383
The elites they aren't wearing masks but they're making everybody else we're math

1133
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,199
Little late on this blippi

1134
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:15,231
You're an elite and I mostly only playing this as a way of

1135
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:21,375
Proving that I'm a witch that will pay off on a later at the house

1136
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,167
Their servants and butlers

1137
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,727
Minions are I mean this is

1138
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,495
Colt

1139
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,543
Your face

1140
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
Like

1141
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,663
All that famous book by George Orwell Animal Farm

1142
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,711
At first the pigs

1143
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,551
Tarantula farm animals too rebellious to humans

1144
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,623
Sitting Elite

1145
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,903
Aristocrats

1146
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,207
Four legs good two legs bad

1147
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,535
But then once the pigs take over they say well

1148
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,095
Tulane

1149
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,655
Good four legs good and then later

1150
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,447
They say actually four legs bad

1151
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,031
Who likes good because the pigs start walking upright

1152
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:02,847
Michelle

1153
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,919
She works like you

1154
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,479
You do all this but we don't

1155
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:11,551
Subway close to Animal Farm

1156
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,343
But also not applicable

1157
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,367
No

1158
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:18,463
But Alex has talked about the plot of Animal Farm that will be important

1159
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,487
Later

1160
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:25,119
Alex gives himself a little bit of a review of his own performance

1161
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
Today

1162
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:32,287
I'm doing okay in the first hour

1163
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,055
And 12 minutes

1164
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,687
How do you know it's 30%

1165
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,991
When the calls

1166
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
Very import

1167
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,551
Question

1168
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,671
Central

1169
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,535
Everyone even even New York Times

1170
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
Big question

1171
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,727
How old hurts are Democrats

1172
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
Woodbine

1173
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,591
Eeyore lower percent poll

1174
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:10,431
The lowest many president ever even in establecer polls that sample

1175
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,271
How on Earth

1176
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,415
What even major blue states are going Republican

1177
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,207
Hoping you just end this nightmare of

1178
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,559
Prices and open borders and collapsing country in Warren

1179
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,631
An answer is

1180
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,847
Get ready for that narrative to recycle and we'll do this game again

1181
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:47,551
Opening Salvo of Lake are ready no matter what if any anything

1182
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:51,647
Monday you know it's a ceremonial.

1183
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,183
Deeply annoying back to work

1184
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:57,023
I would guess that maybe Alex has covered 30% of the news

1185
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,071
I mean

1186
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,655
It's it is arbitrary how much news he has to cover

1187
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,983
Yeah you haven't covered s*** but it could be 30%.

1188
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:12,383
No I think what we need is a progress bar that should be on the heads-up display of his show

1189
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:15,199
I would I would find it

1190
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:21,855
Slowly increasing the Brevard Zoo hours

1191
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:25,439
So you're done with the news that's your dessert

1192
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:30,815
You got to do your job and do a lot of a lot of safety

1193
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:37,215
I think it would make the show a lot more interesting though cuz then there's the tension

1194
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,495
Water heater

1195
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:45,151
That is like that turns it into an almost like 1940s boy story like that

1196
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,967
The guy takes about his school and they're all of the butt

1197
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,247
Title situation is like

1198
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:53,343
If we finish playing baseball he's going to tell us the story but I think it would

1199
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,647
Crippled the ratings of the early

1200
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,671
That part of the show

1201
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:03,071
No one wants to hear him cover news about the devil all the time

1202
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,447
So Alex

1203
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
Some calls

1204
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,775
The show is called

1205
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,567
And lot of them are

1206
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,127
Pointless and I don't care about them

1207
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,431
So we don't actually have that much

1208
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,967
Leftover show

1209
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:24,575
Check in on

1210
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
Is

1211
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,135
What's to know like a look

1212
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
No

1213
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:33,791
That the globalists are going to destroy their to take down the internet they're going to take down all means of communication

1214
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,071
So what do we do

1215
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,607
What would you do

1216
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,167
Chip repair

1217
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:43,007
To prepare for that I think I would maybe do two things

1218
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:46,335
Skyward bolster my defenses

1219
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:52,223
I really focus on hiring people away who have the capability inability to protect me

1220
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,039
Okay that's two things already

1221
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,063
I would

1222
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,599
Try and

1223
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:00,415
Junction off a portion of the internet just for me

1224
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:06,815
And I would take it so that they could destroy the rest of the internet but I would have my own personal you want to still Mall network of tubes

1225
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:10,911
Yes I would want my own Al Gore Network

1226
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:17,311
That I have for myself well I guess that would solve the problem of the communication this color as a slightly different take

1227
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,103
I wanted to pick your brain

1228
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,639
What do we do

1229
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
I mean

1230
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,479
We know they're going to turn the lights out we know they're going to turn the internet off

1231
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,503
Delaet's

1232
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,551
Let's think about it now and compare

1233
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,111
Right now how do I react how do we

1234
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:34,207
The Davis Group

1235
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,767
Borrow release is a war

1236
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,559
An economically collapse

1237
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,887
Civilization

1238
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
Nevada

1239
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,775
Organize

1240
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,847
And there's a realize what's happened

1241
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,127
Are the pipeline

1242
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,151
During a shutdown

1243
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,967
To get the most of America

1244
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:59,807
Is someone self-sufficient other than areas in California

1245
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,855
Connecticut if you places

1246
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,927
Most of America

1247
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:05,951
To make us

1248
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,743
Dependent when they go for the jugular

1249
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:12,095
We know that they'll just leave their lines open

1250
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,911
Their media Outlets know what they want us to hear

1251
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:18,239
Essential weird non-essential

1252
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,079
Buying printing presses

1253
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
That's where we're going

1254
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:30,527
You are smart. You're thinking about what to do once they hit us for that and I really should be doing so that planning

1255
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,343
But

1256
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,511
Did you tell them we partially back them off at least

1257
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:43,327
Take the pressure off

1258
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,911
We were about to pull in Italy

1259
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Exact

1260
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,543
What exactly

1261
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,847
Were there

1262
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,127
What

1263
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,943
They were going to get us to not have to wear masks

1264
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,735
Okay

1265
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:03,807
The government did that I don't think it was a response to

1266
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,599
That's because they didn't want us to take power

1267
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
Okay

1268
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,207
I don't think anything really

1269
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,511
We don't have to wear masks right now do we

1270
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
Well

1271
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,815
She's not in prison

1272
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:18,911
You don't know that there is not ones last time you saw him in public

1273
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:25,311
Declaration that the vaccines are

1274
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,639
Bio weapon in Spanish

1275
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:35,039
If you want to declare small victories that people have gotten tired of being careful

1276
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,391
They've given up on run

1277
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:45,023
Hire Society wants to claim congratulations

1278
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,047
You didn't do s***

1279
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:50,143
It turns out we know it takes exactly two-and-a-half years of being a complete

1280
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
F****** prick

1281
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:57,055
To get an entire Society to finally quit a a billion people to die our country

1282
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,615
Play yeah also interesting

1283
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:04,991
The places that Alex has deemed not able to be self-sufficient where New York LAN

1284
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,271
Connecticut

1285
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,087
So weird little bitter

1286
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,879
Better

1287
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
I would like

1288
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,231
Everybody who really thinks that they are part of

1289
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,255
Majority

1290
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,047
Of America that is self-sufficient

1291
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,119
Really struggle with what the word selves

1292
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:21,887
Sufficient mean

1293
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,167
You know

1294
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,727
Yeah cuz I think when people say things like

1295
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,007
I'm very self-sufficient

1296
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,543
I do not think they understand what that is

1297
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,311
No

1298
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,591
It's a challenge

1299
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,639
There's a lot of things that you

1300
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:35,455
You take for granted that are part of living in

1301
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,991
Society

1302
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,527
Like I am

1303
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,087
So far here's how unselfish

1304
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,623
Self-sufficient

1305
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,695
Before I wake up every morning

1306
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:51,839
Are not well right when I wake up every morning I have to take pills otherwise I might go crazy

1307
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:54,911
Sure everyone will be in very big trouble

1308
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,703
Yeah I'm not self-sufficient

1309
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,007
At all and it's not like you could

1310
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:03,615
Plant those pills

1311
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,383
Right

1312
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:10,271
Anime think about all the people who you know might have conditions that are chronic and you know

1313
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:13,599
Even take take

1314
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,367
Other

1315
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,439
Other conditions on the other there are tons and tons of people who

1316
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,231
That's not even a realistic

1317
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
Possibility

1318
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,303
I might even be on that like

1319
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,351
I mean sure

1320
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,399
You grow food baby right

1321
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,679
Do you grow enough

1322
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:34,335
Do you grow a varied enough type of food year after year are you driving the soil

1323
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,103
Nutrients

1324
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,407
What's the difference between dirt and soil

1325
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:45,343
Although I do love this guy's plan of getting printed breath

1326
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,623
The way their brains work

1327
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:50,207
Does have a very Taskmaster as quality to it or you're like

1328
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:52,511
That is not the solution I would have gone with sir

1329
01:09:54,815 --> 01:10:00,959
Absolutely because you can't really print off memes

1330
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,983
On a

1331
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,055
You have to build

1332
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,335
Tire pressure

1333
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,151
Arthur meme

1334
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,943
Play just be making your own that beach house

1335
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,759
Because you're not going to have a 3D printer

1336
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
Palomino

1337
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,551
You're not going to

1338
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,831
How are you going to get the printer

1339
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,391
But I mean it's going to be like

1340
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,183
What do you mean well who's going to make the printing

1341
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,279
We have to get it before the whole thing goes down that's why you talking about preparation

1342
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,839
Should I have a printing press in my house now

1343
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,399
Yes yes

1344
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:33,215
Horde printing presses

1345
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,567
Another think it's important the printing press is

1346
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,871
It's only as valuable as what you're

1347
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,687
Sure

1348
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,479
Talk to

1349
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,247
Make a

1350
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,295
Cutting of the Bible in order to

1351
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:52,159
Lego removable block but that's still a ton of work I mean

1352
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,183
You know

1353
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:59,071
Everybody thought those Gutenberg Bibles where we're all hard to make or whatever and then they lasted so long I figure it'll be that

1354
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:04,959
So another caller calls in and Alex pretends to know what he's talking about

1355
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,495
Sleepwalking

1356
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,055
Call Alex

1357
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,895
You ever heard of a guy called that goes by the name

1358
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
Pharma

1359
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:18,015
I have heard of that mine

1360
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,319
He's laying out

1361
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,135
He warned they would use the Caravan

1362
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,927
Isaiah

1363
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:26,975
And the preacher

1364
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,511
Martial law

1365
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,351
They're going after that cut things is bird flu

1366
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,399
And they're going around killing

1367
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,447
Millions

1368
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,567
He's coming

1369
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
Furious

1370
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,663
They're doing it

1371
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:46,943
What

1372
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,015
Supply

1373
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:56,415
So Alex pretended to know rice a charmer is

1374
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:03,327
Bird flu

1375
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:09,727
I'm not sure what the exact numbers are but yeah there's some bird populations that have been

1376
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,287
Affected they believe that

1377
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:16,383
A lot of it is being transmitted by some wild Raptors

1378
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,175
Not the kind

1379
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,527
That looks fly over like a chicken

1380
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,903
Check into be like Planet happen

1381
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,999
Operating Theory

1382
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:35,839
Big an issue is this guy's presenting but it is something to keep an eye on

1383
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,887
I would ever put the larger picture is out with

1384
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,703
Pretending that he knows of this guy's talking about and he has no idea

1385
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:43,263
That's a metaphor for Infowars

1386
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:49,151
You know the Raptor that flies over and s**** on a bunch of chickens and then they have disease

1387
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,431
That makes perfect

1388
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,479
I mean look

1389
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,295
Why not

1390
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:00,927
Alex says that he's got a guest coming on and I got really interested right away

1391
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,999
Elizabeth

1392
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:08,607
And Lorenzo and John I'll get you all but I got a special guest pop it into like a

1393
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,143
Go back to your phone calls

1394
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,679
This is a

1395
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,727
A few days ago

1396
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:20,127
Describe losing leg

1397
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:28,063
Talk about this cuz we can talk about the statistics Alden the

1398
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,135
What happened is very very

1399
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,927
Alot of people personally

1400
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,719
But didn't listen to

1401
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,999
Very serious blood clots

1402
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,047
It sounded I we talkin to him

1403
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,583
You like what the statistics

1404
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:45,983
Call Jay but they don't make the point that you want to make so talk about anecdotal cases and freak people out

1405
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:51,359
Strange story for Alex cover because it kind of muddles the narratives about vaccines

1406
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:58,015
He's made such a huge deal out of how he thinks it's the MRNA in the vaccines that makes them really dangerous and how

1407
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,575
That's that's what makes it an experimental gene therapy

1408
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,647
That's the appeal that it has 22

1409
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:08,255
Created like a mysterious unknown that Alex's used to spread doubt and fear

1410
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,279
For his audience

1411
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:15,167
This is why he always talks about Pfizer in moderna but almost never brings up Johnson & Johnson

1412
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,239
Because J&J isn't an mRNA

1413
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,287
So it's not as easy to scare the audience

1414
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,079
This is a regular old X

1415
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:25,151
The audience is more used to exist

1416
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:31,807
AstraZeneca is also not an mRNA vaccine but it's also not available in the United States

1417
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,111
A decent chance that the audience doesn't know that

1418
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:38,207
Alex doesn't even actually know that

1419
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,815
I'm kind of disappointed

1420
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:51,263
I was pretty excited to hear like how Alex was going to handle this weather he was going to

1421
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,055
It's not

1422
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:58,687
MRNA vaccine we never find out

1423
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,247
Seems like

1424
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:05,343
F****** Matrix is way out of a bullet on that one yeah possibly

1425
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:09,695
Matrix himself out of the way of a non mRNA vaccine heading right for them

1426
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,071
No it's not a collar I just thought that this was

1427
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,351
Pretty funny

1428
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,679
Pretty pretty indicative of like

1429
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,751
I mean this is Saved by the Bell s*** okay

1430
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,287
Regarding Trump

1431
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,359
I've seen the footage of him

1432
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,895
Shaking hands with claws swab

1433
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:32,479
I've seen the footage of him on stage with Bill O'Reilly overly bragging

1434
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:36,575
Taking responsibility for the MRNA gene therapy

1435
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,647
It's so good that he's been jammed that he's been boosted

1436
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,183
Then I seen the crowd

1437
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,791
The crowd how they booed him and he kind of mock them saying all that she's too small 9 of minority

1438
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,071
Here's my question Alex

1439
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,351
Trump

1440
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,631
Is re-elected

1441
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,959
What are his main priorities going to be enemies

1442
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,287
Ask you straight out to we trust him or struggle globalist

1443
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
I want to know

1444
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,615
You know we should have a whole call-in show

1445
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,503
Commercial

1446
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,271
Free calls

1447
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:12,671
According to the world gold Council

1448
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:18,815
Pretty sweet

1449
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:24,703
That is if we do a show about calls that are as good as that

1450
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:29,567
Is Trump a globalist let me tell you

1451
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:35,967
Here's this idea for calling show that I've been talking about for years and

1452
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:42,367
I do not want to answer if stuff is globalist

1453
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,951
I don't really want to take responsibility for a later day out

1454
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:49,023
Commercial

1455
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,839
Episode

1456
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:58,239
Not a lot of that much meat on the bone but you know I wanted to check in with him

1457
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:04,127
I'm on the present-day breaking

1458
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:08,223
I am so I wanted to see if there was a robust response

1459
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
Clearly there was

1460
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,831
