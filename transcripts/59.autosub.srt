Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,848
A couple dudes like sit around and drink novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,384
And his effect on the world

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,176
Today

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,272
Salted caramel mocha

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,296
A company that

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
No but

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:30,720
A company that may or may not have been involved in a scandal

9
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,256
Starbucks

10
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,680
Known for making some weird that store available products

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,520
And this one is it was Mark limited edition that means I got to give it a try

12
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
Do the honors

13
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,384
SAU

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,432
Tastes amazing

15
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
It's a cake

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
Supposed to

17
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,600
Drake we had last week

18
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
Which was

19
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
Edible drink

20
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,696
Picture editor

21
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,536
Wondered what it's like to

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
She would drink

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,120
Give it a go I don't anymore

24
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,520
So I don't know much

25
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
Very refined our dynamic

26
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
We're going to be the 2015 president

27
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
I should tell you

28
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,296
That Alex Jones

29
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
On today's show

30
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,136
This is recording this on Thursday

31
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
On the 29th

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,536
Who speculated that the globalist the kidnapping children

33
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,096
I'm sending them to be slaves on a Mars colony

34
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
Okay well one

35
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
That's the

36
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,776
My bad

37
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,080
Terraforming it and then there's children

38
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Terraforming

39
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Yeah

40
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Pro Bowl

41
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
Well in terms of

42
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Like

43
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,064
The present and how violent it's getting in terms of Alex's rhetoric in his tone

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
This is very well

45
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
This kind of stuff is at least like it's Philly

46
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,304
I said they're going like

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
Oh you motherfukers watch Alex I think Alex got to come

48
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,192
Insulting credit on that thing

49
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,008
Liberals are coming for you

50
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
Bully just keeps calling

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
2

52
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,432
That's so scary

53
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
So also the other thing

54
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
Not American you might be thinking there a Mars colony that these children are going

55
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
Right

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,512
He's on Alex Jones Show

57
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,792
He has some

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,376
Supposed military history so you know he knows things

59
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,936
Sure here's how I know he's in Val

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,264
Not in the same conversation where you talkin about

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
Otis Mars colony

62
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,616
He also talked about how did he die

63
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
He's pedophile globalist

64
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,992
I have to terrify the children to Adrenaline eyes their blood

65
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,576
Adrenochrome narrative

66
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
Such b*******

67
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
I don't know

68
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,512
I do it's cuz you have to get whack your locker or else you don't get attention

69
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
You don't mean like they're hit up after this point was like

70
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
Buck

71
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,912
I do like the next I'd like their move

72
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
Is there

73
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,240
They're doing monsters.inc basic

74
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
What is like

75
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,336
The global is if they are terrifying the

76
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,992
Maybe they discovered that they could get even more adrenochrome

77
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:38,624
Yeah right before the show started its very hard to make a comedy

78
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,952
Before we get to Today Show in earnest

79
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,072

In a monthly donation

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
Format

86
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Songs from now and

87
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
We will have

88
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:09,344
Cindy's sitting on falling apart

89
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,024
Do jumping the time machines

90
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
Nope on our last the show

91
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,287
Last time we were back in 2015

92
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,335
We ended on August 16th

93
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
Alex

94
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,783
Hit heard Donald Trump

95
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,087
I mean

96
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,415
Maybe Trump is the guy we need

97
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
Because I speculated to you two things

98
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
Yeah I made a bold prediction

99
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
The first

100
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
Was that this was not a full payment

101
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
This was just a warming

102
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,447
Of sorts and Alex was not on board with

103
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
Prediction that I made

104
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,079
Was that Larry Nichols was right around the corner

105
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
Okay I will tell you this

106
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
On August 17th

107
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:11,551
Larry Nichols comes back the next day right around the corner

108
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
Dammit

109
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,439
Larry Nichols Rock in Elizabeth

110
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,023
I'm not going to play any of Larry Nichols parts

111
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
From the August 17th show but I will tell you

112
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
But he provides evidence

113
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,447
That the clintons killed Evans

114
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,007
We need to call and ask about that

115
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
He provided a memo

116
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,407
State troopers

117
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
I don't know also could be

118
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Alex is like how did you get that document

119
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
Cuz I got stolen

120
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
Just covering up for your

121
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
Your secret

122
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
Agent sources

123
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
That's right

124
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
Nah I'll be honest

125
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,823
Things just show up in my mailbox

126
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,039
Are your f****** home address on Alex Jones Show who knows how

127
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
How many radio shows that you're on

128
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,439
Soliciting money for your medical bills which would be covered under Obamacare

129
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:28,607
Join the winning

130
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
We're all going to die

131
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,471
Very bad time this Thursday

132
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,775
Talks about is how he thinks

133
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
Clinton

134
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,687
Hillary's private server he thinks Obama setting her up

135
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,551
All right that's not a narrative I've ever heard

136
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
The most in

137
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
Intriguing narrative

138
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,463
Both because Larry Nichols believes that Obama wants to become the last

139
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,863
President because when you're the last president you become and if

140
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
He will immediately turn the United States

141
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
Leader of Islam worldwide

142
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,895
It's okay needs to get the clintons out-of-the-way right there the only Force

143
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
Powerful enough to take him down

144
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,991
And stop his islamification

145
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
Playing

146
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
So he's got to make this server should happen

147
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
In order to set up Hillary take her down

148
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,951
Then there's nothing stopping him from okay

149
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
Here's my counter

150
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
I agree with the premise

151
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
Set up Hillary Clinton

152
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,239
Revenge on America

153
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,543
Has been

154
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
Treated worse

155
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,103
Yeah

156
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,199
And now it's time you know what

157
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
I'm f****** out of here

158
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Done with you

159
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
Guess what

160
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,111
Welcome to Trump now you finally appreciate me

161
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:02,047
Have a hot plate of trump an a****** how good is Obamacare

162
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
Declarative

163
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
Trump

164
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,871
Is Obama's Revenge it follows like human nature but at the same time Obama's not nearly that petty

165
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Well

166
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,711
Did you did you read the

167
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Story Wright

168
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
Maybe Obama could have revealed all the info

169
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
He already knew

170
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,135
Maybe he could have told us maybe

171
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
What happened

172
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,559
I feel like that comes into legality though I'm not entirely sure about all the Dynamics

173
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,887
Be that as it may

174
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
Eddie

175
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,031
It's all over

176
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,383
The fuk on the Larry Nichols was coming

177
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
On this episode

178
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,271
No but I'm right all the time

179
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
But also I'm right about the other thing I suggest

180
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,415
Here's where Alex's hit is that at

181
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,719
Thea on August 17th 2015

182
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
As it relates to Trump

183
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,703
And say that he's an operative completely

184
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,799
And now I moved from 50-50 on trauma

185
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
260 40

186
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
What is that mean

187
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Because what he's doing

188
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
Hurting the established

189
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:34,207
The imaginary team in my head that I'm again

190
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
Hillary

191
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
Peach Paul Watson did last week

192
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
His perspective

193
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
At the bottom of the hour

194
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,407
But then I'm going to go over why Trump may be good

195
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
I'm not endorsing Donald Trump

196
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,855
Okay alright

197
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
Ultimate

198
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,071
I'm going to wait until he sells people out

199
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
Nauseous myself

200
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,543
I'm going to make sure he's politically and financially punished

201
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
I'm going to hold you to that

202
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,527
Beyond Trump

203
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
So Alex is right

204
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
First off

205
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Jon Lovitz

206
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
This is the ultimate

207
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Credit

208
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
That's just that

209
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,535
Is that all you have

210
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,935
2nd Peter 3

211
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,775
Except your hand on the cake bottle

212
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
I took it

213
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,127
This is real this is Revenge

214
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,783
This is Revenge for the replica visit

215
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Fireworks

216
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
Alright go ahead

217
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
He's going to wait and

218
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
Salespeople out

219
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
What is that

220
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,559
How can't but how can you be 6044 Trump and still be like

221
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
Yeah he's going to tell everybody out

222
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,799
At this point it's really talks about like 2 months later

223
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
So let me know

224
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
His numbers

225
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:33,503
His loyalties are meaningless

226
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
Yeah yeah for sure

227
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,343
And Elsa as the course of this episode goes

228
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,695
Speculation that a lot of this was about Hillary's probably true

229
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,815
But I found a new leader in the clubhouse of what's going on

230
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,167
Obama know Larry Nichols is not correct

231
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,079
What are the news stories he wants to cover is about how there's a sorority

232
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
They made an adverb

233
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
He's already done

234
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
Very

235
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,271
There's a sorority that made an ad you have no idea how dumb

236
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,927
And the reason is because it's an all white commercial

237
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,023
It's all white people in this roraty

238
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
Is it all white people in a very

239
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
We love all white p

240
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,263
Sorority that's like let me be clear I didn't watch the video

241
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,311
But let's get Alex Jones and take on it

242
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
Racially home

243
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,271
Homogeneous also I want to give one little bit of a warning

244
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,599
There is a jump cut in the middle of this audio clip

245
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,951
It's the first time there ever will be one of those on this podcast

246
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
Is it the last time

247
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:53,631
As well not maybe not I'm not sure but I did that because you talked about the video into chunk

248
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,703
And in between was a two-minute commercial for prostate guard

249
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
So the commercial

250
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
And just put the two pieces back

251
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
She just love the

252
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,639
Position of

253
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,991
Sorority girls taking making a video and then

254
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
I do like that

255
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Sometimes

256
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
Isaac Prosper guard everyday

257
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,447
Why are you taking all your pills you're riding your braids out also there was that report that came out about how

258
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
Gwyneth Paltrow's goop

259
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
Blog recommend

260
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:38,175
All these three ladies bikes

261
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
I was reading through the article that had all the comparison of her product her like a hippie bougie product

262
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Versus Alex

263
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
Forest Products

264
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
And how they're all pretty much the same

265
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
And one

266
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Something that I didn't realize is

267
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
The the iodine

268
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
The amount

269
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
B in the pills

270
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
But Alex cell

271
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
Is substantially over

272
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,823
The recommended amount that you should yeah

273
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
Covid-19 everyday you are

274
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Weigh against doctor's orders

275
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
I think it's like

276
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
700 micrograms

277
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
More than what doctors recommend is he

278
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Feeling

279
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
For what

280
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
So taking that much iodine could actually be dangerous

281
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,231
Yeah that everyday plus processor guard

282
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Goof

283
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,583
Super female vitality

284
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
What else does

285
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
God dammit

286
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
Selenium

287
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,263
Boat field

288
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
Leave him what he says

289
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
He's taking

290
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
Subway

291
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
It's gross

292
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,551
I wonder if you can afford it.

293
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:54,207
Bars

294
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,791
Boston

295
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,991
Alex Jones

296
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,103
Because he's supposed to give you any other people don't want to work with them that's racist

297
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,991
So that's where the that's where the jump-cut is

298
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
One of the things that Alex

299
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,855
Is doing is really unfair

300
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,159
Thing where they grow up in a certain

301
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
Segregated culture

302
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,279
Segregated

303
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
That's not a good argument

304
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:10,495
For anything but it's also not applicable really to like sororities and fraternities and stuff like that

305
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
Regulator

306
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
You know organization

307
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,383
Like Greek life organizations and if you have

308
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Abe

309
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
No black

310
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
People

311
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Fraternity

312
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
That's a systematic

313
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
Problem has nothing to do with

314
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
I gravitate towards other people of my race

315
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,695
Institution

316
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,767
It's very much impossible to prove or disprove

317
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,607
Unless you go undercover it's just like the

318
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
The movie Soul Man

319
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
No I mean just like the housing

320
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,567
So the people who are working for a regulatory agency

321
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
They'll have a wipe

322
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,919
People are are white woman black woman

323
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
Both go try to rent the same

324
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
And they consistently find that

325
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Black women are quoted

326
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Much higher rent

327
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
They're systematically discriminate

328
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
So you can't prove that this

329
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
So sorority

330
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Doing this because of this

331
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
Video

332
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
But also

333
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
You know

334
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,143
It's not necessary it's not necessarily that they're not doing it

335
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
Either

336
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Distended

337
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
An undercover college student

338
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Need to be like

339
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,359
Sorority

340
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
Skin color

341
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
I don't know

342
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,695
I don't know how to unpack the idea that there are like

343
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Fraternity

344
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
And things like that

345
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
Because those do exist

346
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,399
Really see that big of a problem with it somehow

347
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
But all white

348
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
Fraternities and sororities

349
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
Dulce like a problem

350
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
Why is that

351
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,359
Well because you're awake

352
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
Here's one of my big

353
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,223
Issues that's why I just answered my own question.

354
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,807
Am I happy

355
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
Exclusionary history

356
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,303
Alright it wasn't done by these other disenfranchised

357
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,887
It is a problem and when they have groups

358
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,703
That are inclusionary to themselves

359
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
As a support

360
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,799
System seems like we have to

361
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Unite to fight back

362
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
Cuz they if we don't then they're going to pick

363
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,735
Pick us off one by one or less fight each other

364
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:34,111
That yet again what is my route

365
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,695
It's like we're not allowed in there space

366
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Right

367
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Right

368
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,119
I think that might be more why it doesn't really

369
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
Well I think

370
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
I think

371
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
It is

372
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
I think you're right

373
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,823
My thoughts on it

374
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
Built around

375
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
I think

376
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,199
The way that Chicago is so segregated

377
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,527
Like I think one of the biggest issues is that

378
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,623
If we're this segregated it is very much

379
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
You're not

380
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,207
You're still treating people as the other

381
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,815
Like one of the big things that they did change things for

382
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,911
Alabama immediately following the Civil War is once you have a generation

383
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
Kids that are fully

384
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
Aggregated

385
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Earnout

386
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,751
Fully integrated

387
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
They don't fear black people

388
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,639
It is very much and inclusionary thing

389
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,199
Everybody gets pissed off whenever you try and do it

390
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
But I think integration

391
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Even if it's forced

392
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
Integration

393
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
Ultimately wind up being a much

394
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Situation for

395
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
For everyone

396
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,439
Forced integration is a bad way to put it

397
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,511
It's almost like his

398
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,583
What will it be

399
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
I think it's a better way to phrase it would be like

400
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
Immersion therapy

401
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
For people who are afraid

402
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
Just desegregation like

403
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,847
What was the school system of other than Force

404
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
Integration

405
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
Call desegregate

406
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,479
Which is still inaccurate

407
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
Moniker but

408
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
I think

409
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
Again I'm always

410
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,231
Frustrating tights Alex's.

411
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,559
So Alex is not done talking about these sororities

412
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,655
And his video weird spin

413
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,551
Why are you so racist

414
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,647
Hispanic

415
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
Races races races

416
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,815
Does it get more indicative of white privilege

417
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
That that

418
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:58,239
Can I join your family Barbecue can you think of any situation where

419
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:04,639
Alright

420
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,199
The most glaring example of white privilege

421
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:16,416
Dude we're just trying or maybe there are four super inclusive this is a big argument that white supremacist

422
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:21,536
Make about the idea of diversity actually being code for like white genocide

423
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:30,240
There's these all-white organization but you never say that you need diversity in

424
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
All black organization

425
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
And some stuff like

426
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
Which again

427
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
It's a

428
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
It's the

429
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,432
Between the oppressor and oppressed

430
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,088
Currently the future as well

431
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Because it doesn't look like

432
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,720
Sounds like you're gonna be wrong.

433
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,048
Not really

434
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,144
Yeah tell me what's wrong

435
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,264
The only thing about this

436
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,568
It's a bunch of really good looking women

437
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,176
And as we know modern feminist for whatever reason I have their initial studies

438
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
Are three times fatter

439
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:18,880
And tell women what to do

440
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:24,000
Lesbian

441
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,304
Are lesbians who just won a pimp

442
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,216
Sarcastic

443
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:39,616
Some of the dog ugly women short haircut

444
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:44,736
Juan girlfriend you know he's got her nails done just right

445
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:49,856
Police report

446
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:54,720
I mean

447
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
Girlfriend looks like

448
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
Next week Playboy

449
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,432
Also

450
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Horse

451
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
So that was some nuance

452
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
You are so mad

453
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,256
You threw down your pain in the middle of that

454
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,424
There's no way that it see that's that's

455
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
The problem like

456
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,728
Anytime there's a

457
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
There's like a fictional meeting

458
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,848
Between me and Alex Jones in my mind Alex

459
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
Said something like that

460
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
And I just

461
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
Begin to break down and

462
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,832
Scream. Like you're you're a mean guy just like yelling directly into his

463
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:58,976
Space for an hour uninterrupted screaming

464
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,280
It's going to

465
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,864
It's going to get so much worse

466
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,728
Hypothetical framework of this meeting you're going to have with Alex

467
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,544
UPS

468
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
Okay

469
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
And of course

470
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,944
I would say the only person

471
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
Could mediate

472
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
Between the two of us

473
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
Who sabotage

474
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,672

00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
Let me ask you a question

488
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,552
How do you feel about all white sororities

489
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,712
Do you know your drink is espresso

00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Yeah

495
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,272

503
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
And then I left this in

504
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Mostly be

505
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
Because

506
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,600

This next clip demonstrates some of them

509
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,544
That they are the men now

510
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808

511
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:37,184
Country girls

What's FairPoint

535
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
Also whenever you have strong arm leaders

00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,512
Women who work whenever that make sense

00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,840
About ladies who lunch

566
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776

00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:52,256
He says that the economy is definitely going to collapse by the end of the year

572
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:56,864
Daiso by gold or implied because the last episode maybe Max

573
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,192
Maybe one of our own cryptocurrency

574
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,848
So now we come to

575
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,920
I think it's still available yeah

576
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
Jordans

577
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,504
Go to August 18th

578
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,296
And I will take up the rest of our show

579
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,392
That anytime 1 episode in the investor

580
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
Takes up the rest of our show.

581
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
Something big happened

582
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:28,864
Do you remember couple episodes back Alex Jones got a call from a literal White

583
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
Yes

584
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,960
Told him you need to have David do conure

585
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
F*** he has David

586
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080
He has David Duke Show

587
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,640
You Daddy hours

588
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,456
Most of the show me listen to

589
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
Former Grand

590
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
Former

591
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Who can prove

592
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,856
He actually has some negative things to say about the clan

593
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
Weirdly

594
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
Yeah

595
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Control

596
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,000
Like the administrative services

597
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:02,400
No it's more like being Grand Dragon because it's more like I was one of the good ones

598
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
When I got out

599
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
Right whatever

600
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
Yeah I know

601
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
David Duke

602
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Is

603
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,896
Resoundingly a horrible horrible human being

604
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,224
I don't need to go into detail on it

605
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,040
And I don't want to repeat a lot of what he says

606
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
On my shelf

607
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Cuz we have control over

608
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,440
The show I'm not I've cut out most of the

609
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,512
Flaming bigotry that comes out of his mouth

610
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,840
But I've left in some stuff that is important for our investor

611
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
Because

612
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,704
This interview does not go how Alex Jones wants it

613
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
Okay

614
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
We've established in the past

615
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
The terrible interview

616
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
Heath

617
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,664
But he's bringing David Duke on to the show

618
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
It's going to be a

619
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,712
I got you

620
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,016
I'm going to ask him about abortion

621
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:54,624
Planned Parenthood is genocide I'm going to bring up all my narratives

622
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,232
And he's not going to have an answer and then David Duke is going to be humiliated on my show

623
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
Goes very different

624
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
This is an astronaut all over it

625
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
It's way worse

626
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
Except instead of somebody

627
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
He's gone into space

628
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
Pale blue dot

629
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
At the world

630
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,640
Instead it's somebody who

631
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
Russell's underneath

632
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
Rocks

633
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
Caterpillar

634
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
Poisoning

635
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,600
Millipede

636
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
Which one is the most

637
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
Either

638
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
Chimera of them

639
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,960
I'm not going to like I said if you want to know more

640
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
Look up on your own you can find some

641
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,056
Some really f****** horrible things he's red

642
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:49,152
You can find him being very supportive of the Nazi party

643
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,944
In America you can find

644
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,784
Any always counted it behind I'm just trying to protect my own

645
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
That sort of thing

646
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
Which is dicey

647
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
But

648
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,672
Before we get into the interview

649
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
Here is

650
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
What

651
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
Alex Jones

652
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Didn't do his research

653
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,912
And he doesn't know how much he agrees with David Duke

654
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:11,936
Corsola

655
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,520
So all he knows is this guy used to be in the KKK

656
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
He pushes race

657
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
Politics

658
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,408
Soleil

659
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,736
You're like a white version of these minority groups

660
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,760
But I hate

661
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,808
You're like Barraza

662
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
Which he thinks is a

663
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,672
He's like you're like

664
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,232
Farrakhan but for white people

665
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,768
That's his promise

666
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
But he doesn't realize

667
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
Is the David Duke

668
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,168
For all the horribleness of him

669
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,216
He is way smarter than Alex

670
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
I believe

671
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
Basically

672
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,384
Except she says

673
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
Instead of globulin

674
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
And there's a reason for that

675
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:00,320
Alex Alex's entire philosophy is built around

676
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
This

677
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
Build up

678
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,440
Brahma Italy late 1800's on

679
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:09,280
From the time of the protocols of the Elders of Zion

680
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:13,376
You get through to the creation of the Federal Reserve

681
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,424
Stuff is the foundational aspects

682
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,496
This massive Jewish conspiracy

683
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,056
Are controlling everything

684
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Designer

685
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
And what have you

686
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
Which is what globalism is

687
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,688
Fear of globalist

688
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Is that

689
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
So

690
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
Di-dong

691
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,600
Comes out thinking he's proved

692
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
He's not eraser

693
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
Yeah

694
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Turns out

695
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,440
He proved that

696
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
He is a race

697
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,816
No the same time believing that he still proving

698
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,632
No I don't I don't think you have it quite right

699
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,424
What I think more happened

700
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,984
Alex is caught off guard

701
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,032
Having to agree

702
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,336
David Duke says

703
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
And all you have to go back on

704
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
Is

705
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,944
You're obsessed with Jews

706
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,248
And not much

707
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
So Alex gets

708
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,368
Basically on his own

709
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,184
Like an out-and-out white nationalist

710
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
And I think

711
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,488
That this

712
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
Is demonstrative of the future

713
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Alex Jones

714
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,096
Ba like this week is hell

715
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
He starts to see

716
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,680
Some of like

717
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,104
And then also

718
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
David Duke

719
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,224
Uses a number of arguments that Alex Jones ends up event

720
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,576
So in the same way that Alex Jones would take information

721
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
An integrated into his theories

722
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,464
I can see at least three or four points in this interview

723
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,280
That he worked David Dukes

724
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
MN Within

725
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,120
Episodes that I've heard in the future event

726
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,424
Alex just mirrors at identically

727
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
But he says global

728
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Like I said

729
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:03,456
I tried to cut out as much of just the out-and-out hatred is possible to we don't need to sit through that

730
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
Is that all you have to

731
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
And make

732
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
And make

733
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Out-and-out big

734
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
More acceptable is

735
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
Change

736
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
So Jordan

737
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,560
Further Ado let's dive into this interview with David Duke here's how it starts

738
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,144
Ask you so much for joining us today

739
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:28,288
Well I hope so

740
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,104
A real discussion about some of the basic issues because

741
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,944
I would like to get down to the bottom today about who

742
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,480
Country

743
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,808
The world that is truly as you say

744
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,904
Their nana play of all mankind and I think

745
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,744
Even said this as well in the first part of the show

746
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,144
You said they want to in some ways go against European people because they want to control the West End

747
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
The power

748
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
Of the West

749
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,240
And I think that's why

750
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,544
In the Middle East Billy Wars for Israel

751
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,848
And Wars for the globalist up hours

752
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,408
But I'm not I'm not

753
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,968
A carbon copy our mirror image

754
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
Sharpton

755
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,296
The truth is that

756
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
There is

757
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,112
Racism

758
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,416
Ben dominates America supremacism

759
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,792
Racism

760
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
Against the European American

761
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,656
And as far as Eugenics to respond

762
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,192
Limiting births

763
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,520
Throat population explosion black people have

764
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,568
How much higher birth rates and white

765
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:37,152
Mexicans have a much higher birth rates and even African American

766
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:42,528
European Americans have about a 1.6 Birthright which means a quarter of our people

767
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:48,928
Every generation of population explosion the world

768
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
A statistic

769
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:54,304
Showing that in Africa by 2050 Bill be one point

770
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,424
NFL most entirely because the massive Birthright so

771
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,824
I don't believe that worked all day because of Africa

772
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,616
Are African Americans or whatever

773
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,432
The truth is that the only

774
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,272
Nation

775
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,368
No

776
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,184
Amazon

777
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,464
United States

778
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:27,072
Canada Australia every European nation today is under attack

779
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
Just

780
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,496
Not careful with his language

781
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,336
That he's making the same point

782
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,408
The globalists are attacking

783
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,712
All these European white Nations

784
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
With emigra

785
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
To listen to one

786
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,392
I did not sign on to listen

787
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:57,536
To Alex Jones's agree with each other it's really important

788
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
I know it

789
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,352
I know that

790
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,400
No one wants to listen to David Duke

791
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
In terms of where we end up

792
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,056
This is crucial if you are still mad

793
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
Okay

794
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,480
The control the West

795
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,880
The goddamn f***

796
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:27,488
European Americans of the mean is

797
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,256
Europe

798
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
In North America

799
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,840
And what you really mean is

800
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
North America

801
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,680
And what you really mean is the United States

802
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,240
And then what you really really mean

803
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
F****** white

804
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
People

805
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:45,152
Everywhere close enough to wipe so visually pass

806
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,296
Intellectual bigotry of a David Duke

807
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Now he's

808
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,184
Less careful with his language than Alex in the sense that he

809
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Is

810
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,768
Out in front about it that he thinks that

811
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
He's

812
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,216
Alex fears those sorts of things

813
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
But it's a little bit more couched in his language

814
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
But I you know

815
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
David Duke

816
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,176
Wouldn't be as dumb to say

817
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
White

818
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,248
Behind

819
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
You can hide behind

820
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,344
Can't really hide behind White

821
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:29,952
There's way more you got to be worried about what we were angles of attack

822
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
I'm fine

823
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
You know what

824
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
David Duke

825
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
Play well every

826
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
Immigrant

827
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,544
Has patented has anything

828
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,824
You no longer get to you

829
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
So that's

830
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
Better route

831
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,832
That's the one blog that if I was

832
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,392
If I was any kind of King

833
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
Of any sort

834
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:05,024
And I hope you guys all eventually elect me to be the autocratic

835
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,168
My one law is if you think

836
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,472
That it's white people you only get to use

837
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
I think it's very reasonable rule

838
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,104
We we proved everything that

839
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,384
Everything

840
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
You use

841
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
Like pretty much all

842
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,856
David Duke

843
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,904
Likes to pretend that he's real smart

844
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,696
I've got a lot of sources for things

845
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,536
One of the first sources that he cites

846
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,608
About his daughter

847
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,168
Jewish Supremacy Over America

848
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
Infowars article

849
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
No it's even worse than that

850
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,592
And then I'll explain what the source is

851
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,640
How

852
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:57,247
It's not european-american Christians my friend

853
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,903
Largest Hollywood Studios of movies and television are all Jewish

854
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
Control I can give you the name

855
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,791
Demographic hear of a Jewish pendants like at the Los Angeles time

856
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,327
Who is

857
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,143
Where he boasted you totally run Hollywood

858
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,983
In any article he list all the leaders of the Hollywood Networks

859
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,031
Any sense is insulted when people

860
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,871
Try to argue Irene even

861
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:29,247
He's proud of and he goes on to say I don't care people think we're running the Federal Reserve

862
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,807
International banking Wall Street

863
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:36,671
The media and government all I care is we keep on running them

864
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
That's pretty bad

865
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,255
You know what happens in the middle of it

866
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,071
They flash up on screen the graphic

867
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
That that you send along

868
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
Do you know Joel Olsteen

869
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,055
Logan Everest in Huber Heights

870
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,639
Yeah

871
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
Pundit

872
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,967
Like a boy

873
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:06,367
If you're taking that a Joel Stein article as your proof that like

874
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
You got a problem that's not good

875
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:12,511
That's like taking a dingleberry column

876
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
More or less

877
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
That's what you did

878
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,863
Yeah

879
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:23,519
Your f****** hero give you some medication about the level of thoroughness he does in terms of

880
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,079
You know verifying is sources figuring out

881
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,103
Making sure he knows it

882
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,407
Exactly what he's talking about when he wants to make

883
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:33,247
Claims on a radio show listen to buy millions of 80th

884
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,271
And here's another

885
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,599
When we're running low on food

886
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
We

887
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,903
Eating

888
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,439
For Irish babe

889
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,119
Small group

890
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,799
Right

891
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,079
That

892
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
That's just a fact

893
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,431
AAA

894
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,991
Has a sort of problematic history

895
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,295
He's written some things that are pretty f***** up

896
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,575
But

897
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,903
All in all at least especially at this point in his career

898
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,927
He's a humorous

899
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,463
U b

900
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,815
Make some bad points at some point time

901
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,607
And it's

902
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,423
He clearly just picked up like

903
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,191
Some quotes

904
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
Amazon

905
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,983
Bruce Almighty

906
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,567
Like that needs to be said

907
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,103
But

908
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,175
They going to do a little

909
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
Humor

910
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
I don't know

911
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,503
I think I think the West

912
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
The British

913
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,367
But they're right

914
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,927
List all of a sudden

915
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:51,327
It's like a violent language

916
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
The espresso

917
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,887
Yeah so in this mix

918
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,191
Single-payer healthcare

919
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,751
And I don't want the Jews to have it

920
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
What's wrong

921
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,663
Ava Progressive David socialist

922
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,671
In the first clip of David Duchovny played

923
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,231
You could hear that he

924
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,279
Agreed with Alex in terms of

925
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,559
Immigration stuff

926
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,351
He agreed

927
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
In terms of their being

928
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,167
The globalist force

929
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:27,935
But they were up a

930
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:33,823
Slickly threw it in there as like a

931
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,103
The globalist

932
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,479
Globalist first as like a little

933
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,807
Candy and stick for Alex Jones

934
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:54,303
There's a large that's that I think David Duke is trying to get Alex to recognize that they agree on

935
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,607
But in the next clip

936
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
Is another indication of

937
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
True things

938
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:10,687
Well I don't know if I can trust him because he's been involved with the zionists and he's one of these guys in the Republican debate we got to control me

939
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,991
Even Fox News is like

940
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:17,087
Controlled opposition Orwell was so great about that in Orwell

941
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,647
Talked about the controlled opposition and it is great

942
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,719
But he talks about the converter opposition for some reason

943
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:28,095
Name the controlled opposition Emmanuel golsteyn using to Jewish name

944
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:32,191
And I think that the Jewish extremists can set up a controlled opposition

945
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,263
And if you saw the debate it was like of ambush

946
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,615
And I got against Donald Trump and was because he was talking about the fact

947
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:46,271
That European Americans are losing the right the people who built this great country gave us the foundation

948
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
Sins of our Bill of Rights

949
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,599
Only thing they believed about it being replaced

950
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,927
And here's the problem I'm again I believe

951
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:56,511
And having a kind nations were all people supporting all people

952
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:02,655
I am at 4 instead of expectation give example the media so powerful they can just make me

953
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
I've never

954
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,495
Ever been a white supremacist

955
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:12,639
I believe in equal rights for all people I've always stated that position even back in my clan days I was a young man

956
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,199
Boy that's a tough

957
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,271
Even back in McLamb days

958
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:24,671
Kill the Jews

959
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:30,559
Need to kill him equally but you know what like all people should be treated equally

960
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,703
Macon in my young wild clam days

961
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:40,543
Cuz he wasn't an entry-level member of the clan

962
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,383
G Dragon which is already the dumbest thing that you heard

963
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,711
Slater

964
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
But

965
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,551
He doesn't he can't play that game that's not fair

966
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Alex

967
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
Thing of like

968
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
I'm referencing movies

969
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,303
Referencing Orwell

970
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,839
Did Rude Jude the Jews

971
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:11,775
Yeah it's a Jewish name

972
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,335
Gordon pieces of Alex's at least his current

973
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,127
Framework and I think they're

974
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
Piano pieces

975
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
That are intrinsic to him

976
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,735
The day Breon

977
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,551
Distrust of the media that the media is full of s***

978
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,831
And the Trump

979
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,623
Can't really trust him because

980
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:30,207
He's been involved with Zionist

981
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,743
Oryza

982
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,279
Alex

983
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,327
Framework you've been involved with the globalist

984
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,119
It's exactly the same thing

985
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,423
Right this is this is a meeting of the minds

986
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,031
Two men who agree with each other but don't want to agree with each other

987
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
Does Alex

988
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Admit

989
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,895
He agrees with David Duke on just about anything

990
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,687
He is now

991
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711
With David Duke

992
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,527
Agrees with Alex

993
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,063
He has to

994
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:56,831
Give up

995
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,111
The pretense

996
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,439
We have to give up what makes him what made him famous which is

997
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,719
Being as I stop by

998
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
You know what I mean

999
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:08,607
Dallas cuz that's surrender

1000
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,447
What is philosophy

1001
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,263
I think a lot of him

1002
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
Bring

1003
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:16,799
Alex to

1004
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,847
Yeah that's what I say

1005
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
Men trying to disagree with

1006
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,711
One man

1007
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,503
Trying so hard

1008
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,039
To not be racist

1009
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
Given

1010
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,671
Given today

1011
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:38,815
Come on buddy

1012
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:44,703
I am and I ain't

1013
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,519
880 wildlife

1014
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:53,663
This is a damning portrait of Alex Jones is a human

1015
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,431
Defiant

1016
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,479
Himself a little bit later and he tries to

1017
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,295
Put up some sort of a resistance to

1018
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
David Dukes

1019
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,879
You know what

1020
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
Here's the thing

1021
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,487
I don't know if it's wrong to have David Duke on your

1022
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,023
I don't know about

1023
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,863
I don't want to I don't want to stay I think it's everyone's right to choose

1024
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,679
What guests you will have and will not have on your show

1025
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,239
I will say that it's wrong that Alex

1026
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
David Duke

1027
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,567
Savory things on his show

1028
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
Already did on challenge

1029
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,431
Cuz the only real rebuke that I get

1030
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,199
Is

1031
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:32,063
It's all with you that sort of thing

1032
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:35,903
That's it there's no like real pressing back in terms of

1033
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
Like

1034
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,975
What do you want

1035
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
He said

1036
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,959
I just I just get bogged out I think I think

1037
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,983
It is very much

1038
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
Just like

1039
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,543
The the all white

1040
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,311
Sorority versus

1041
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
The All Blacks

1042
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,895
Anytime a white purse

1043
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,455
Referring to all white

1044
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,271
People immediately immediately like

1045
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,807
Oh you think we're all going to kill so

1046
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,975
Yeah everytime black people refer to every black person

1047
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,999
As we it's always

1048
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
2 things of solid

1049
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,607
White people refer to Olive White

1050
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
People is waiting

1051
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,399
It's always a vial

1052
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,983
It's always we're under attack

1053
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,823
Need to fight back and the reason that you and I might be more

1054
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,151
A verse that is that there's an implied lumping us

1055
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:37,343
How to push back a little bit and one of the only things that he keeps doing

1056
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,391
Is he keeps trying to get

1057
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
David Duke

1058
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,207
To say something about Hitler

1059
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,023
He keeps

1060
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:51,423
Alright

1061
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,007
Hitler

1062
00:51:55,263 --> 00:52:00,895
What is your view

1063
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:06,527
I have

1064
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,575
A lot of German writings as well

1065
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,903
I mean the Nazis really weird death called

1066
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,975
They really were all sorts of weird ceremonial Magic

1067
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:21,375
Call Todd

1068
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,215
Where is Hitler

1069
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,239
MetroWest

1070
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,735
They double-crossed

1071
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:44,927
Give me see again the West England British intelligence along with

1072
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,279
What setting things up I mean take Prescott Bush

1073
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:57,727
Butler I mean there's all that other stuff going on

1074
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,751
I think this is

1075
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:05,151
I'm sorry but I believe that the information you have there is false and maybe it's planted by the people is just business

1076
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:09,503
That is no evidence at all

1077
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:14,623
Western Nations supported the rise of Hitler rrna

1078
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
Gentile

1079
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:19,487
Establishment in America magazine

1080
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,047
Yeah that's that's a little wild

1081
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,607
I love it I love it

1082
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
Alex's

1083
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,911
Main issue with Hitler

1084
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
Is that

1085
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,727
They were a weird death cause

1086
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,079
By then and then again

1087
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,127
What's the who's the West now

1088
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,295
Of course

1089
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
It's hooked up

1090
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,695
But yours is even more f***** up if that clip first of all Alex's

1091
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,583
Wanted

1092
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
Rule the world

1093
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,399
On the other side was like

1094
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:06,335
Alex is trying to bait David Duke into getting into how he doesn't believe in gas

1095
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,871
Chambers and stuff like that

1096
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:13,759
And that was the that was the thought I was I was thinking he was about to say

1097
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,551
The truth is

1098
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,855
There were no Jews killed in the hallway

1099
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:24,255
David Duke that in a conversation

1100
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,535
Games are not going to work

1101
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,839
But here's the other thing as transparent

1102
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:33,727
And it might just might just be because we have listened to so much of him and we have like a familiarity

1103
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,775
If David Duke is such a monster

1104
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,799
But there's a

1105
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,591
You kind of pulling for Alec

1106
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,199
Don't

1107
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,223
Don't make me say that

1108
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:54,207
How its breakthrough your condition a breakthrough your programming a good rooting for Alex

1109
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,255
You hope what you hope is going to happen

1110
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:59,327
Is it Alex Jones is going to come face-to-face with David

1111
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,375
Who sang the exact same ship that

1112
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,911
He says but about

1113
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,679
Hayden juice

1114
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,519
Alex knows that hating Jews is dumb and based on

1115
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Bigotry

1116
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,335
Itsuki will you hope

1117
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
Hope

1118
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,431
Then he will see this be like oh no everything I think is wrong

1119
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
Oh my God

1120
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
I've been wrong the whole time

1121
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:23,135
Have I been like him oh my God I would go for this interview is

1122
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,159
Is Alex gets

1123
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,511
That's all I really want I want Alex to genuinely

1124
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
Angry and be

1125
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:33,887
You learned you can choose for no reason

1126
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
I don't

1127
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
He's not going to

1128
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,751
He's he's already 20 years

1129
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
Spoiler alert

1130
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:43,615
Now neither of us get our wish

1131
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,383
Be angry

1132
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,919
Alex

1133
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,247
Well I think Alex

1134
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:53,599
Tries to get a little bit crafty and it doesn't really work I'll explain that later

1135
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,159
Should not Alex did not try and rely on

1136
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
His craftiness

1137
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
So

1138
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:01,535
Stick with his bread-and-butter which is screaming like a loon

1139
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,095
Explain why in a minute

1140
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,631
But

1141
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,191
Alex is against

1142
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,239
This idea that Jews control every

1143
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,055
Videos for the idea that globalist

1144
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:13,823
Control every

1145
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,127
Naturally

1146
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,175
Don't be a contradiction inherent there

1147
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
In this next

1148
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,391
Really trying to have sophisticated

1149
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,207
David isn't sophisticated

1150
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,023
I've just heard all this over and over again

1151
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,071
And I've also experienced

1152
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:40,447
Nation group

1153
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,495
They give

1154
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:45,055
Just like super powers

1155
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:54,015
Sky

1156
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,063
Mama

1157
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
So yeah he's an idiot

1158
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:03,999
He doesn't realize that he's using the exact same thing you the packing to build up his globalist

1159
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,047
He's trapped

1160
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,095
You should never have agreed to do this interview

1161
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,143
Imagine

1162
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,935
Here's a Here's a thought

1163
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,727
We take

1164
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,751
Get transcript of this

1165
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,311
And we just transpose

1166
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
Globalist

1167
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,871
Oh man

1168
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,407
And then we transpose

1169
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
The same

1170
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,503
No it wouldn't be because

1171
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,671
And I think most of

1172
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,695
The facts

1173
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,975
Seaside sarbak

1174
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,535
But he has a lot more information

1175
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
Ben Alex

1176
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,607
Okay he comes in with names

1177
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:44,191
He comes in with actual pieces of tidbits

1178
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:46,495
Worry about

1179
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,335
Next clip

1180
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,431
Did we do a good enough job of explaining that I was an idiot

1181
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,223
Attacking

1182
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
People who think

1183
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,527
Tablets run the world

1184
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,599
The fact that he said

1185
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,391
You ascribe superpowers

1186
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,927
To whomever it is you think

1187
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,695
Think of the anime

1188
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,839
You just want to shake

1189
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,399
I'll remind you that

1190
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,935
In 2017

1191
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,215
He allowed someone

1192
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:20,031
Pretty much on challenged on his show to say that the globalist

1193
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,823
Hoverboards colony

1194
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,871
Those are kidnapping children to take

1195
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
Godlike powers

1196
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,943
So

1197
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,711
You dumb

1198
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,735
You real dumb

1199
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,783
So I told you that Alex cooked

1200
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
Start yelling at

1201
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,367
They have

1202
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,671
Clearly setup parameters

1203
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,951
For this conversation

1204
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,767
Alex Jones made a lot of

1205
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:43,583
Concessions to David Duke to have him come on the show

1206
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
He said

1207
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:47,679
Early in the interview I didn't I don't have the clip of it

1208
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,703
But he says

1209
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,519
You agreed to come on the show if I'd be nice

1210
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:55,103
And it's very clear that David Duke made

1211
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:55,871
Time

1212
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,663
Limit thing

1213
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,991
Like I'll speak 45 minutes then you speak 45

1214
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,295
And the reason this is clear

1215
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,087
Is because they bicker about it

1216
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:08,415
At least 12 times throughout the interview

1217
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:13,279
Comment about how I kinda need my time

1218
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,071
There's like I'm giving you your time

1219
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,375
They end up fighting

1220
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,191
Throughout the entire two hours

1221
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,263
Mostly about time

1222
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:27,871
I did not have time to get all of the clips cuz I'm telling you it's

1223
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
Like

1224
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:29,919
12

1225
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,455
Isolated like

1226
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,343
Here is an example of that

1227
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,415
Them arguing about the time

1228
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,207
Who's talking

1229
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,255
And then Alex

1230
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,327
A question that he thinks of the gotcha question

1231
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,607
About abortion

1232
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,399
And Planned Parenthood

1233
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,263
Not he just doesn't realize everything he's doing

1234
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,543
Is what he does

1235
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,335
And is helping David Duke

1236
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,687
Listen to the way the davidiuk answers this question

1237
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,967
Realize that

1238
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,503
Is the worst

1239
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,063
He's the worst he's the literal

1240
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
Worst

1241
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:13,695
And then he didn't answer the question for 10 minutes

1242
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,231
I want you to answer this question

1243
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,215
He's going on so how do you square up

1244
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,751
Behind the scenes

1245
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,287
The Democratic Party

1246
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,199
She loves him

1247
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:37,247
They don't accept them love you

1248
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,831
There's something else going on here is what I'm getting at

1249
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,975
I'm glad you're giving me 10 minutes

1250
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:53,631
I got your whatever

1251
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:05,151
We can go into that's all I think I'll go to the end of the program the next hour or two because you're right this I feel like the only way I can

1252
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,711
You really get a clear exposition of all my position

1253
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:11,295
But his issue about that experts off

1254
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:15,903
The KKK was not the author of any sort of Planned Parenthood

1255
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:22,303
But I did and I was in the house represent by the way let me make something really clear to you so there's no misunderstanding

1256
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,631
Spoken and completely opposed

1257
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,911
To abortion

1258
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:31,263
I also put my money where my mouth is and the House of Representative

1259
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,359
I voted for the strongest anti-abortion laws has ever been passed

1260
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:39,455
Legislative States of America

1261
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,271
So it's really clear when I stand

1262
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:46,879
You just forced himself into a situation where he had to compliment David Duke

1263
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,183
Of course Alex is so bad at this

1264
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:54,047
Why didn't you do any research I bet you didn't even know David was in the House of Representative

1265
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,071
I didn't know David

1266
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:58,655
House of represent

1267
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,703
PPL Electric

1268
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,495
Yeah

1269
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,847
To the house of

1270
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,663
At a certain point in American history

1271
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,223
Wow

1272
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:15,295
I mean it doesn't seem like too far of

1273
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,623
Longshot for the future it's almost like you have to

1274
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,415
To go back as far as

1275
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,951
Now

1276
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:26,047
To get another former KKK member inside the house of

1277
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,655
Maybe noted

1278
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
Justin anti-semite

1279
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,703
Jeff

1280
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,495
Who is in the Senate

1281
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,311
And is now

1282
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:41,151
Wikipedia list David Dukes political affiliation is

1283
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,199
American Nazi party before night

1284
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,223
Scene 75

1285
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,039
I don't know if that's true maybe that's not

1286
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,063
Not fair I don't know

1287
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
President

1288
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,183
Didn't work out

1289
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:04,447
Riveting stuff here reading the Wikipedia article

1290
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:08,799
A special election for a seat in the Louisiana house

1291
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,591
House Representatives

1292
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,615
Representing

1293
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,407
Louisiana in 1989

1294
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,199
That's the

1295
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,991
Even though especially

1296
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,015
Still real

1297
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,551
Locked up

1298
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,599
I can't imagine

1299
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,903
Fukka I can't imagine it was long

1300
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
Like I said

1301
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,511
The two men

1302
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,047
I bicker a whole bunch

1303
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,839
Yeah About Time stuff

1304
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,631
This clip

1305
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,655
That was

1306
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Sol pass

1307
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:41,055
Progressive that was amazing

1308
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,103
That was I want to make a 94 cut

1309
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
That was like

1310
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,175
I remember

1311
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,991
I remember I the God camp

1312
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
What I was

1313
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,295
14 for about a month

1314
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,087
And that was

1315
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:53,855
Every

1316
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,135
Single

1317
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
Dorm

1318
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
After like

1319
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,463
Day 4

1320
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,279
Just like you know it's no big deal

1321
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,327
Stop leaving your

1322
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,655
In the shower but that's

1323
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Like

1324
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,983
Those are those are 12

1325
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,031
Starbucks

1326
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,823
We'll wait for this next week

1327
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,359
What you even

1328
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:21,503
Doesn't really take care of the people to die and don't they are never able to reproduce or whatever

1329
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:24,063
Give me my 10 minutes please

1330
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:32,767
David talk about birth rate

1331
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:39,167
Please bear Alex's interjecting trying to be helpful f*** you give me like that

1332
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,103
Here's one where they're bickering more about time

1333
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,383
Do we have

1334
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,663
It really affair

1335
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,991
Playing field in this country when the same media

1336
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:59,391
That promotes the Jewish state of Israel is doing everything they can to destroy European Americans

1337
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:03,743
Majority and and really preserving our European

1338
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:07,071
Earlier

1339
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,031
Do some stuff like that

1340
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,359
Criticized

1341
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,455
Implying I'm not letting you talk more than I have

1342
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,479
Dish hour

1343
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:28,831
Unless you count the ads is my time

1344
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,903
Ion radio show

1345
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:46,751
O'Reilly for sure

1346
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,799
I would just talk more than other shows

1347
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:55,199
I might say something I don't want to be polished

1348
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:55,967
Polish

1349
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,271
I love it

1350
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
I love it

1351
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Why do you say

1352
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,207
Because why

1353
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,023
Food you say what you want

1354
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,047
PR spin

1355
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,631
Just masking the white elements of it

1356
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,495
White right

1357
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,055
White

1358
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,615
You know what it is you get to

1359
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,663
F****** quote Orwell

1360
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,687
And not

1361
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,223
Get new speaker

1362
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,415
The main part is making language mean f***

1363
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,231
Nothing that's just part of it

1364
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,047
The trick that Orwell was really talking

1365
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:42,815
About there

1366
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,095
Is that what language has

1367
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
Meaning

1368
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,911
You can say whatever you want

1369
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,679
True

1370
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,215
You can say whatever you want and people

1371
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:52,031
Believe there's no there's no like

1372
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,567
Like this

1373
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,615
TV

1374
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Boxers

1375
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,431
So it's going to cover more peep

1376
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,247
Say that

1377
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:05,343
God is my my role model

1378
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,135
How is it

1379
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,415
How is it that

1380
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,719
Media critics

1381
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,279
Stupid

1382
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,815
Geared towards letting me

1383
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
F******

1384
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:23,775
People being lied to

1385
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:27,103
Is lying to an audience

1386
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,455
That I really dislike about that clip

1387
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:37,599
What I don't dislike is them being petty as f*** about time

1388
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,159
Is awful is the David Duke one of the

1389
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,463
The point that he's trying to make is that white

1390
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,511
Will no longer be a majority

1391
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,303
And that's really scary

1392
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
And here's an idea

1393
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,375
That

1394
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,655
White people

1395
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:53,215
Art supposed to be the majority

1396
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,007
In our home country

1397
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,543
Warhol

1398
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,127
European Americans

1399
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
Our home

1400
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:06,783
Country songs about tons of countries in Europe even say about Alexa

1401
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:10,111
Various other countries that have

1402
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,135
Germanic

1403
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,207
Alright hubby how about Africa

1404
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
This is their home

1405
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,535
Its own country

1406
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,215
If I'm to be a majority

1407
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,239
I mean

1408
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:29,311
Charmin The Wonder of America really it

1409
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,383
Never should be a majority

1410
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,455
Should be everyone is a minority

1411
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,759
We're all cool with it

1412
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,527
Kind of the

1413
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,319
Big

1414
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
Course

1415
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,719
Why do you think

1416
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,047
Like because of the Jewish plot

1417
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,327
Right

1418
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:52,863
Are you solo

1419
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,143
Afraid of not being them

1420
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:54,911
Majority anymore

1421
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,727
Cuz I think he thinks that once we become them

1422
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,751
My minority

1423
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:06,431
Maybe the real fear of whiteness is we're going to get with

1424
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
Coming to us

1425
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,503
That's not true

1426
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,039
I think that

1427
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:14,367
No but I think that's us projecting our minds into

1428
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,903
I think

1429
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
To be the subconscious

1430
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:21,279
I would argue that maybe it's not fear that motivates primarily it

1431
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,839
We need the majority so we can kick their ass

1432
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,607
In case we need

1433
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:30,495
I think they might have a more proactive angry approach to it where is Jose

1434
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,055
We did a lot of bad s*** in the past

1435
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,199
Totally afraid

1436
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,735
Yeah absolutely

1437
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:43,039
It has to it has to be

1438
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:43,807
That like their hats

1439
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,575
To be a

1440
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
Awareness

1441
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,647
Because why else would you insist

1442
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
Endless

1443
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,719
That white people have never done anything

1444
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,511
And that racism is

1445
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,535
Curaleaf

1446
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,815
Function

1447
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,631
The Jews controlling plot

1448
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399
To do all of this

1449
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:02,495
People have done wrong things in the past

1450
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,519
But

1451
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,287
The white people

1452
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:06,335
Have done wrong things are dead

1453
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,359
No

1454
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:10,431
No they were gentiles

1455
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,967
With the Jewish power

1456
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,503
Do you mean like globalist

1457
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,271
Collaborator

1458
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,575
I would be I guess so

1459
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,111
Yeah it's absolutely

1460
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,903
But that's but there has to be

1461
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,719
Knowledge which is why they insist

1462
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,279
Endlessly that there is an

1463
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,911
Rite Aid losing the majority

1464
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,959
Purely because

1465
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
They think violence

1466
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,775
Is going to be visiting

1467
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,591
And that means that they think it's Revenge

1468
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,895
And that means that if it's Revenge

1469
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,687
They are aware

1470
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:49,087
That their s*** to be revenged upon

1471
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
To feel guilt

1472
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,415
Five people expressing their life

1473
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,439
Exactly

1474
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:57,535
Yeah I don't want to hear black people stand up for themselves making me feel guilty

1475
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,071
I don't want games

1476
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Public

1477
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,631
Make me feel guilty and weird

1478
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,655
That's

1479
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,423
Just

1480
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,727
Guilt because of an awareness of

1481
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,751
That's wrong

1482
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,799
This exploit Jordan

1483
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,127
Conflicted feelings about this

1484
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:12,895
Text clip

1485
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,919
And here's why

1486
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:19,295
I don't think that it's ever necessarily wrong to be rude to David Duke

1487
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
But Alex Jones

1488
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,855
Was pretty rude

1489
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,879
In this next clip

1490
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,671
And I think it's inappropriate

1491
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:27,487
No punch Richard Spencer punched David Duke

1492
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,071
I think it's wrong because of the host

1493
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:31,839
Guest

1494
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,607
Dynamic

1495
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,935
You know even if it's David

1496
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:40,543
He's still a guest on your show deserve this kind of rudeness

1497
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,615
Based on how he's treated Alex in the interview

1498
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,663
Here is

1499
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,943
Here is the game here

1500
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,503
I'm going to listen to the level of rudeness

1501
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,295
Measure it against

1502
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,319
What I think would pop

1503
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,647
My level of rudeness

1504
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:18,175
You f******

1505
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:27,391
Other issues you want to cover where you think the world's going economy but

1506
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,951
Explain to me seriously

1507
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:34,303
Goblin Cyclops stuff come from

1508
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:37,375
You are goblins Cyclops Dragon

1509
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:40,191
Never was a goblin never was a cyclops

1510
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,727
I think that's a little rude

1511
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,775
What are you f******

1512
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:50,175
What are you f****** because of the names of cake

1513
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
Take a position

1514
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:55,295
Do you know that was the point of the Superman radio serial in the 50

1515
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:00,415
I would like him to his f******

1516
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
Face

1517
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:06,303
I get that I believe though the grand

1518
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,375
I was not your scales

1519
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:15,007
Did you have those surgically implanted

1520
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,311
Is your belly the weak spot

1521
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:23,711
Should I if I were to shoot an arrow into going by first of all

1522
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,247
Let's start at the beginning

1523
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:28,063
What type of dragon would you consider yourself to

1524
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,855
Are we talkin about

1525
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:36,255
Lord of the Rings you're about your about to learn about fire breath

1526
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,327
Please dragon or a Chinese dragon

1527
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,399
Are we talkin about a gargoyle

1528
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,167
Situation

1529
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,495
G Dragon

1530
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,287
What type of dragon are you

1531
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:51,615
Honestly I think that's less rude

1532
01:13:55,455 --> 01:14:01,087
I mean look I'm not that he deserves better treatment

1533
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:05,695
If you have someone on your show that you've clearly made confession

1534
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,231
Sims 4 like he's clearly

1535
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:10,047
Been like okay you get 5 minutes I get 5 minutes

1536
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,583
We'll set an arrangement that

1537
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,607
You clearly unpleasant

1538
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,887
Come to me as a broadcaster

1539
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:16,447
Because I want you on my show that badly

1540
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,519
It seems like the wrong kind of thing to do to

1541
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,055
Ynobe reductive

1542
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,591
And insulting about

1543
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:27,199
Write something I've already talked about this a little bit I cut it out

1544
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,991
He talked about how like

1545
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,551
Yeah I was in the KKK when I was younger

1546
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,367
And I realize that the organization I couldn't

1547
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,647
Control the actions of

1548
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,439
All the other members of it

1549
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:42,303
So I decided to go and do something that I could be in complete control of

1550
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,863
The idea that you're like lynching

1551
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,911
Which is great

1552
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:50,495
I'm glad you were gone you pull up my computer

1553
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,543
David Duke

1554
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,567
I'm going to show you

1555
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:54,847
22RE

1556
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,895
Scale of how

1557
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,199
And it would

1558
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,479
Surely be

1559
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,015
Black cock

1560
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
Tire inner

1561
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,951
We agree to this

1562
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:15,583
Before he was a grand drag on

1563
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:19,167
And he was a rapper from the Roughriders crew

1564
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:23,263
Much forgotten rapper

1565
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,079
Second row Brady Dragon songs

1566
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:26,847
Duke

1567
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,871
Richard David

1568
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,663
Do you know if x

1569
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,735
X is going to be the ticket

1570
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
Custard

1571
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:34,783
First

1572
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,063
You stop

1573
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,343
I need drop

1574
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,463
Oh

1575
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,999
No

1576
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,279
It's a Ruff Ryders

1577
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,631
This next clip

1578
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
Video guide

1579
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:53,983
We've been talking a lot a bit about

1580
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,031
Various things that are clear

1581
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,311
Points of agreement

1582
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:02,943
Between Alex Jones and David Duke and here comes another one

1583
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,271
Americans always respected and loved Robert Ealy

1584
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:12,671
Today he's been called The Traitor he wasn't a traitor he's a traitor than Thomas Jefferson was a traitor George Washington was a traitor

1585
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:19,071
Any attack on Southern Heritage will be nothing more than an attack on entire European Heritage cuz now there

1586
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:21,119
Play talks about taking down statue

1587
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,423
Thomas Jefferson

1588
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:28,543
They talked about taking George Washington's name off Public Schools they did that

1589
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:34,943
New Orleans saying he was unworthy because he had slaves will half of the great Heroes of the entire third

1590
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:41,343
World order slaveholders including an awful lot of Jewish Heroes for slaveholders is read about Jewish history

1591
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:47,743
Brittany apocracy is unbelievable in this country

1592
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:57,471
So there is some more bickering about time there again

1593
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:04,127
Go f*** yourself there's a really funny point when they're about to go

1594
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
Go to calls

1595
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:11,295
And David and

1596
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:15,391
We're just going to talk I don't I don't care

1597
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:18,975
Have you

1598
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,279
But because

1599
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
Lick right there

1600
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,631
That fits perfectly into Alex's and Tire

1601
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,935
They're trying to ban the Confederate flag

1602
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,959
The Confederacy

1603
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,751
Was actually not that bad

1604
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:33,311
The Civil War about slavery narrative

1605
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,359
Write a match up perfectly on that

1606
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:40,735
Is getting incredibly flustered by the like

1607
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:42,527
S***

1608
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,831
This guy has more information than me

1609
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,367
You sound smarter than me

1610
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,927
He's way more put-together than me

1611
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,207
He

1612
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:56,607
Dancing circles around me making the same arguments as me but just

1613
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,887
Saying that it's Jews

1614
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,471
I don't really have a good argument to come back against that

1615
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,007
I do

1616
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,543
Me personally

1617
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,079
Damn I do

1618
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,919
I would never activate David Duke so

1619
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,199
Never never

1620
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,527
Show him cut for

1621
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:19,391
About drywall

1622
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,671
How

1623
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:23,487
This is this is something I'm becoming more and more

1624
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,071
The worst thing that the North

1625
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,351
Dad was

1626
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,375
Go to war with

1627
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,447
If they just let them secede

1628
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,495
It would have been a failed state

1629
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:39,359
Yeah probably the problem is of course

1630
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,127
Slavery first

1631
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,175
So

1632
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:42,943
True

1633
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,223
I don't know but this

1634
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,247
That

1635
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,015
Robert

1636
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,063
American Hero

1637
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,087
Is so

1638
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,111
F****** stupid

1639
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:54,463
Well today

1640
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,767
No one in the Civil War

1641
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,047
Wasn't America

1642
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:02,143
There were no heroes in a war

1643
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,679
The most Americans die

1644
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,983
That's not a hero Scituate

1645
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,263
No

1646
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,543
I would agree with that

1647
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,871
Yeah I don't know but it wasn't

1648
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
Raggedy

1649
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,967
That was the f******

1650
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,247
Iliad all over it

1651
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,783
There's no there's no

1652
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
Good team

1653
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:25,695
Pretty cool

1654
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:28,767
School director some good dudes

1655
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:31,071
Among the Greeks

1656
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:36,959
Hector was a pretty awesome dude you just happen to be on the side of Troy

1657
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,775
They were there at the whim of the Gods

1658
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:46,175
And forced to fight each other in a war that neither really wanted to be fighting but had to

1659
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,991
The globalist forced us into the Civil War

1660
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
Quite frankly

1661
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:53,599
Consider the possibility that there are

1662
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,159
That the Greek pantheon still

1663
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,207
What is the Greek

1664
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,743
Nailed it

1665
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,023
I thought about it

1666
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:08,703
I made it would make sense just using us for

1667
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,471
Entertainment

1668
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,031
Back to me makes the most sense

1669
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,311
The gods are immortal

1670
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,616
What would you do if you are immortal

1671
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,664
Layla

1672
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
Ford

1673
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:21,504
Right

1674
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,832
That was the Greek pantheon they were just f****** board and they made

1675
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,880
They make people fight for their immune

1676
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:29,952
Like that's the only thing that makes sense of the world we live in

1677
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:33,792
Subway situation where God knows everything

1678
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,560
Sing it is everywhere

1679
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:35,584
Controlling every

1680
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,888
Makes it seem like there's one dude

1681
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,656
Who is Jeff Dunham

1682
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,680
Biggest f******

1683
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,960
Yeah

1684
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,008
If you're dealing with the Gods

1685
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
It's just like

1686
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,568
They got nothing else

1687
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,872
To do

1688
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,920
They're human characteristics

1689
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,016
I don't think we can get to the bottom of that

1690
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,600
Let's get to the bottom of this

1691
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,904
I am putting out about

1692
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,952
$10,000

1693
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,256
If you have any information I'd

1694
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:08,352
Give us a picture Idaho

1695
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,168
Gmail

1696
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,288
It'll be a picture of cat

1697
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,104
Clip

1698
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,152
Alex is trying to rebuff

1699
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,176
The idea that

1700
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,712
Jewish Supremacy

1701
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,760
That is a problem with the world

1702
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,136
Sprite brings up

1703
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,928
John P Waldron

1704
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,696
The book

1705
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,256
Ketoscience that we discussed our past episode

1706
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:40,608
He brings it up to lie about how it's about putting stuff in the water

1707
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,912
Amy wants to ask David Duke

1708
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,960
Are these Jews

1709
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,728
Those people were white

1710
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,264
So here is that

1711
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:53,152
It's it's fine David people can go to davidduke.com

1712
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,016
Most of the other people of your ilk

1713
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:03,136
Really trying to understand your worldview on things

1714
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:06,464
Where you see things going before we go any further

1715
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,400
Major League

1716
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,592
White House science our population resources environment

1717
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,480
And reduce IQ

1718
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:39,488
Because that's not what they talk about in the book we went over there and I cut it out cuz it's

1719
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,048
Long but David Dukes respond to

1720
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,120
Disrespected

1721
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,936
Just those words

1722
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:54,592
He should have looked at whether or not they were just having a very simple response will do do cuz like the air licks those are

1723
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,896
Well I don't know about John holdren

1724
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,688
I am so at that point

1725
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,784
Because Alex doesn't rebut it or have any information

1726
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:08,672
That's the fact that stands on the show is losing every single point

1727
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,464
That is being like

1728
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,232
Keeps

1729
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,536
Giving softball serve

1730
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,072
Thinking he's spiking

1731
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,656
He's doing a terrible job

1732
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,424
And letting

1733
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,960
Basically

1734
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,496
A white supremacist

1735
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:28,128
Anti-semite convert people who listen to Alex Jones through his caused

1736
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,408
What is f******

1737
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,200
Dismissive

1738
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Yeah but

1739
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,760
But the dismissiveness

1740
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,784
Was because

1741
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,600
You can see it in his face there's a lot of visual stuff in the

1742
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
He's defeated

1743
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,416
Alex Jones is like

1744
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,000
All right you can see he's just like

1745
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:47,328
I know he knows what's happening as it's happening

1746
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:50,144
Because earlier in the in the episode

1747
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,472
David Duke said I'll stay I'll stay with you for an hour

1748
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,568
Alex kick him off the air without being like

1749
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:00,640
I do I want out of this

1750
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,920
So he's stuck

1751
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:02,688
Yeah

1752
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,968
It's it's insane

1753
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:07,040
The only way the only way Alex wins is if he gets

1754
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,064
Really really ain't

1755
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,344
Kicks

1756
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,880
Eddie can't do that

1757
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:11,904
Because

1758
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,488
Argument

1759
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:19,584
So here's Alex's summation of the interview so far

1760
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:20,864
Maybe like

1761
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,424
The reason he is such a bad interviewer

1762
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
Because

1763
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,496
If you come on his show

1764
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:29,824
No no. Stop.

1765
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,896
That's what I'm saying if you come up

1766
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,712
I got this

1767
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:42,112
I don't need to do any research

1768
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:44,672
Yeah we're used to being attacked

1769
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,464
For everything he says

1770
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:48,768
I'm so wow he's wrong

1771
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,048
Citing things like

1772
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,096
Joel Stein

1773
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,376
I think it's serious

1774
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,656
Call Miss brat

1775
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,704
Using that as a kind of like

1776
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,240
Example

1777
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,264
This kind of thing Seaside

1778
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,056
He still has information

1779
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,592
He still has like

1780
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,872
I can

1781
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,664
Defend myself against attack

1782
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,944
I'm I'm ready

1783
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:09,504
Is really funny

1784
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,832
Because Alex sums up how he feels about the interview so far

1785
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,672
News on the phone

1786
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:21,024
But Alex Jones uses an expression I use very frequently

1787
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:31,008
Myself I just don't want to get stuck

1788
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,312
Thought-provoking

1789
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:35,360
Discussion and debate with you

1790
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,152
Ask you this question

1791
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,200
Pushing out in the future

1792
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:43,296
Where do you see the world in 20 years

1793
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,648
These forces you say that are running things are successful

1794
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:50,464
Versus the type of world that you

1795
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,024
As a leader

1796
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,816
Would like to see because

1797
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,912
It's true that what they call Angie

1798
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,192
So there's a real

1799
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
F****** help

1800
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:07,360
Well that's that that's one thing that's really important first what is called semitism

1801
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,128
Slightly just

1802
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,664
But then second

1803
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,688
Keno's

1804
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,992
But there is a rising tide

1805
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:16,064
Of white supremacy and anti-semitism

1806
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,344
Babies growing in the world

1807
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,624
He can't say Niger

1808
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:22,720
Everything way that we found that clip where he talks about knowing the Trump

1809
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,768
Is Mob connected in 2015

1810
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,560
Now we have evidence of 2015

1811
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,096
Aaliyah wear

1812
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,632
That there is a growth

1813
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,680
The community

1814
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,960
Even though he

1815
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,496
Sister

1816
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,264
The races

1817
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,800
Is still Direct

1818
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
Well

1819
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,896
He would maybe say that

1820
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:47,296
I mean it's a false flag

1821
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:50,112
Semitism is just ask

1822
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:50,880
Dividing us

1823
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:56,000
Bigotry is really just a really

1824
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:59,840
Sponson white people foolishly falling for globalist

1825
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,144
Call stupid

1826
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,168
But God.

1827
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:06,496
A really every single time someone asked me how something's going

1828
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:11,872
That's literally might dismissive answer when I don't want to talk about stuff

1829
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:18,272
I would not

1830
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,672
Very much

1831
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,464
Little general

1832
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,232
Superman

1833
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,608
I wouldn't even give you a 37

1834
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:36,704
Grade might get a non complete didn't finish the assignment

1835
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,520
Also in his next life like I've been saying

1836
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,288
They are

1837
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:42,592
Very similar in terms of philosophy

1838
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,896
David Duke is going to see some stuff

1839
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:48,480
And really just imagine that you think

1840
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,784
I think it makes things

1841
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,552
Pretty clear

1842
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:56,416
The real problem we have is not Isis threat me when you can have the Isis threat

1843
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:58,720
Accept the fact that organized Jews

1844
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:03,840
Appointment for the propaganda and the direct organizations and troll the critical

1845
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,120
Clinical process

1846
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:09,472
That literally opened our borders how much does that sound like Alex

1847
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,288
Like especially that last part

1848
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,312
Yep that's

1849
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,616
Literally stuff that he would say

1850
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,896
The globalist

1851
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:19,200
I've opened our borders they left us open to attack

1852
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:22,784
Isis isn't really a problem is the globalist to promise to us

1853
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,344
Literally the same s*** he says

1854
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,624
It's not

1855
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:28,928
Man

1856
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,720
Really

1857
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:33,536
A lot how do you hate

1858
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:38,400
What like I love it I love that life together is like

1859
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,168
Love you

1860
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,728
Yeah

1861
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,264
For all the time

1862
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,080
Yeah history has shown that might need to help each other

1863
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:50,944
I want to make clear is the David Duke tries to also play this game where he's like

1864
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:56,832
But they just propaganda and all Jewish organization

1865
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:59,136
Arduous supremacist organization

1866
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,696
All the banks are run by Jewish supremacist

1867
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:09,632
Essentially it comes down to every liberal-leaning organization has Jewish Supremacy at its core

1868
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,936
Which is what Alex would say about globalist

1869
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:14,752
All liberal organizations are basically just

1870
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,032
I didn't know

1871
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,104
Try my best

1872
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,896
To avoid

1873
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:21,920
These people

1874
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,200
Very hard

1875
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,480
Because

1876
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,248
Perhaps

1877
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,528
The response that

1878
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,296
You guys have seen

1879
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:32,672
Yeah you're fluctuating between extreme anger and just staring at me

1880
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:37,792
No you're not getting

1881
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,376
Alright

1882
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,704
Oh man

1883
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
How can you say

1884
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,312
I don't know

1885
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,592
I've never

1886
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,360
Everett

1887
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,128
Experience

1888
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,176
Even

1889
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,456
Rid

1890
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,296
Jewish supremacist

1891
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,576
Things

1892
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,368
Did the imagination

1893
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,648
F****** ass

1894
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:08,000
Well I think asked as he denied the Holocaust

1895
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,024
That's cuz it seems like he's

1896
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,680
Seems like he's in the intellectual

1897
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,216
Holocaust denial tip

1898
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,776
Like there were no gas Chambers

1899
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,824
Not 6 million were killed

1900
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,896
And why do we talk about all the other people who were killed

1901
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:25,920
That sort of

1902
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,456
That's sort of his cam

1903
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:31,296
It's called denial but it's not like it didn't happen

1904
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:36,672
Like what it like like 80 million Russians

1905
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:40,256
Hitler was bad but why do we got to talk about the Jews all the time

1906
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,560
No proof of those gas Chambers

1907
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,584
Mom

1908
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,608
Unfuk

1909
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,144
Yeah

1910
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:50,496
I think

1911
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,824
That you grow up in a very bad environment

1912
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,920
When you're 18

1913
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:02,272
Joining the clam if you're in a situation where joining the

1914
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,040
The clan

1915
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,856
Is a possibility viable

1916
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:08,928
That means you're not in a great place to begin with

1917
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,696
So

1918
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,256
That sort of environment breeds

1919
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,024
Ascertain

1920
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,304
Type of mindset

1921
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,888
And then I would say that although David Duke is high-functioning

1922
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,448
He's still not really all that smart

1923
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,312
And in the same way that Alex doesn't understand things

1924
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:28,640
Textbook is advocating for putting stuff in the water

1925
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:33,760
David Duke is probably read a bunch of History than thought that there was something nefarious in it when there wasn't

1926
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,040
So I think it's

1927
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:37,600
Probably a combination of those things

1928
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,136
Terrifying

1929
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:39,904
Argument

1930
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:40,672
That

1931
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:41,952
That product

1932
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,720
Have your

1933
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,280
They're like

1934
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
Terrifying

1935
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,584
Because that

1936
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,632
Forces you to look at yourself

1937
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:56,800
What would I do there but the grace of God would that could that be

1938
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,104
So much as I can

1939
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,456
I think I have a better case for saying that I would be against

1940
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,248
Because I already grew up in a cult

1941
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:08,320
Right

1942
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,856
Already got out of that one

1943
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:10,880
But

1944
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,464
Could be

1945
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:15,744
F******

1946
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,512
Anyone

1947
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,792
Separate

1948
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,072
Because they're not going to be

1949
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:27,008
Nobody can make the Aldridge end up in some sort of militant black nationalist group

1950
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,312
There are certainly those groups out there

1951
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:33,664
I don't know I would rather join

1952
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,944
I think

1953
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,224
That

1954
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,296
882 complicated

1955
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,088
Equation

1956
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:43,648
Cuz I don't think anything is strictly

1957
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,184
Environment

1958
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,768
You can just be born David Duke

1959
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,816
You can be born with the potential to

1960
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,584
David Duke

1961
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,864
The surroundings

1962
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,888
Could lead to a date

1963
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,680
What time you got to

1964
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:58,496
You got to do a lot of that work on your own

1965
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,312
Yeah a certain kind of

1966
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,592
Crafty

1967
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:04,896
Yeah as opposed to any kind of a

1968
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,432
Intelligence

1969
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,200
It is

1970
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,248
Base cunning

1971
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:12,320
It'll be fascinating to me because I would never do this

1972
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:15,136
I'm not going to

1973
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,672
Yep

1974
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,952
No

1975
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,768
People donated to the show

1976
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:23,328
I would never do this so don't even suggest it

1977
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:25,376
Okay has his own radio

1978
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,984
If we listen to it as much as we listen to Alex

1979
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:32,032
We would find that

1980
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,312
As a ten-year-old

1981
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:37,920
He was trapped under a house inhaling termite fumes

1982
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:42,528
I guarantee if he's as Lucid as language on his radio show

1983
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,624
It makes everything make sense

1984
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:50,208
I think there's probably something like that he had some sort of

1985
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:53,280
Play frankly

1986
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,048
Can I go on

1987
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,328
Like not David Duke

1988
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,352
I could listen to him

1989
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,376
4

1990
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,656
More than I already have

1991
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:00,960
Now that I think about it

1992
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:09,152
This close to quitting the show in the middle of this only got a little bit left to go then we'll never have to deal with him ever again

1993
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,688
Alright

1994
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
Yeah

1995
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,224
Look

1996
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:19,648
Alex Burton set up Alex bring that up in his responses

1997
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,184
Choosing my name was my parents

1998
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:23,488
Change it

1999
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,256
You f******

2000
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,792
Garbage

2001
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,328
Pile of s***

2002
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,096
David

2003
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:33,984
But I'm still lost and thought about what we would do if Alex

2004
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,288
Come down

2005
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:41,408
They're still years of his show we can go through so no loss for

2006
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:45,504
Continue reviewing

2007
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,552
I give it a big

2008
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,000
Clip

2009
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:57,792
Alex Jones

2010
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,072
It says something that I

2011
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,096
Very strongly

2012
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:00,864
Disagree with

2013
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:15,200
Celebrity

2014
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:16,224
More modern

2015
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,320
Nope

2016
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:23,648
Is

2017
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:24,928
Bizarre

2018
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,256
Flaming Lee corrupted

2019
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,680
Jim Jones cult

2020
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:41,312
So I just opened but I want to butt in here because Alex is very wrong

2021
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,016
And if he wants to make the argument that by far the number one perpetrator of Terror

2022
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:56,672
PC stuff is a problem and like you were saying about the

2023
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:03,584
Interesting argument to be had there but Alex's examples that brings up her always lie

2024
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,144
And this one is that same lie about

2025
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,960
You can't say boy or girl you have to say Purple Penguin

2026
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:15,104
This is the story out of Nebraska there was a gorgon

2027
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,128
Justed

2028
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:16,896
The teachers

2029
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:23,296
But if you're going to be arbitrarily calling groups of children gender

2030
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,832
Because you never know you could have

2031
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,600
Send somebody

2032
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,624
It doesn't say

2033
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:30,464
Presented like they're outlawing boys and girls

2034
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,512
That's not the truth of it at all

2035
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,792
So he's basing

2036
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:34,816
His

2037
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:38,144
Letting white fascist groups off the hook

2038
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,984
Because how much scarier PC culture is on lies

2039
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,520
About this ascent

2040
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,800
Of PC culture

2041
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,336
Stupid

2042
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,872
And other dangerous

2043
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,504
And more arrogant

2044
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:56,320
Left finally reaches

2045
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,368
Clare gold

2046
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,488
Huh

2047
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,288
That's the

2048
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,360
I'm sitting here talking to surreal

2049
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:30,112
And you know why it's giving him a headache

2050
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:30,880
He's

2051
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,648
But he's f*****

2052
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,672
Yeah

2053
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,464
He can see it

2054
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,024
He's giving a he's getting a headache because he's like

2055
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:38,816
Goddamn

2056
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,448
Bore base cutting

2057
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:50,336
That was I think that right there

2058
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,896
Is very least

2059
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:53,920
Heard up

2060
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,968
What

2061
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:56,992
What do you mean

2062
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,528
That idea of

2063
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,832
People are talking about who owns

2064
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,368
Or who run

2065
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,904
As opposed to

2066
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,208
Yeah

2067
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:07,488
To me is that

2068
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,536
Especially at this

2069
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,304
Time that work

2070
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
Covering this

2071
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:13,632
That to me is like the moment

2072
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,400
Trump starts

2073
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,448
We're going to take the country

2074
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,776
Yeah that is

2075
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:22,336
Together they could be it could be

2076
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:26,176
Cuz we're really seems like it would be a strong

2077
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:26,944
Motivator

2078
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:30,016
So you brought up political correct

2079
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,552
I didn't Alex did

2080
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,600
I mean in the context of Orwell

2081
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,624
Whether or not

2082
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
Arguments

2083
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
And I would ask

2084
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,768
Okay I think

2085
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,304
One of the big things that

2086
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,072
Michael correctness

2087
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,608
Is

2088
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,376
Trying

2089
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,400
Accurately

2090
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:47,936
What a word mean

2091
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,240
Like because of that

2092
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,520
Additional,

2093
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:53,824
Like train

2094
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,104
Like

2095
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,896
What your what Your

2096
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:58,944
Granny

2097
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,992
Is if you are a

2098
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,016
Good person

2099
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,160
Yeah or if you're just like

2100
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:13,280
Person who's using the word without malice

2101
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,304
Lycon

2102
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,328
Brightright

2103
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,632
Means

2104
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
This purse

2105
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,168
Right

2106
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,704
But if you are

2107
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,728
One of them

2108
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:22,496
Men

2109
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:23,776
Who have

2110
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,800
Really really

2111
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,128
You use the word tree

2112
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,920
And to you yes

2113
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,944
It means

2114
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:31,968
Transgender

2115
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,504
Bright

2116
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,272
Is

2117
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:37,600
Victor big human

2118
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,368
Inhuman

2119
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,952
About political correct

2120
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,512
You're really just adding

2121
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,536
The connotation

2122
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,560
To the word

2123
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,960
I don't disagree with that at all

2124
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,728
Yeah

2125
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:54,496
But I think

2126
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,264
V

2127
01:39:57,056 --> 01:40:02,176
I was the way I was approaching it is more the idea of what the other side would say

2128
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:06,784
I like the premise of the other side

2129
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,064
When I say there's a

2130
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,088
Discussion to be had

2131
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,880
I'm more memes that like

2132
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:12,416
That's something I've endured

2133
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:19,328
Oh yeah if the communication idea if there were someone trying to make

2134
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,096
Said argument

2135
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,888
We could have that conversation

2136
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:25,216
I wouldn't agree with them but I am not going to be like

2137
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:26,240
F*** you you're an idiot

2138
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:29,312
Everything like that

2139
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,080
Strongly

2140
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:32,384
I talked to Alex I wouldn't

2141
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:39,040
Record it secretly played on the last about how much of an idiot

2142
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,320
Impersonal

2143
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:44,416
I don't know I don't know if I have

2144
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,464
If I genuinely have the balls

2145
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:51,072
To do what I say I would do probably not not a chance

2146
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,120
I don't know man

2147
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,656
I'm very angry

2148
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:57,472
Worked up into a frenzy probably

2149
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:00,288
Do you not know how easy that is

2150
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:03,872
I've noticed

2151
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:08,224
But there's such a low bar to frenzy and then also a low bar

2152
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,992
To get away

2153
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:14,880
3 G of coffee and a little bit of credit

2154
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,672
I'm so this next clip

2155
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:22,048
Godot frostguard

2156
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,608
It was next clip David Duke

2157
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,704
Very literally makes an argument that Alex will use in the future

2158
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,984
And it is

2159
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,800
Just another complete mirroring of the two men

2160
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:39,200
Americans and Canadians in European Europeans are literally being Jen

2161
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,480
Genocide the real threat

2162
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:43,552
Yellow people to Chinese people

2163
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:49,184
Vance 1.3 billion of endoscopy 1.3 billion African this more than European

2164
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,720
In the world while Europe

2165
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:53,280
America and white countries are banded clock

2166
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:56,352
And I'm telling you that it's not supremacist mm

2167
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,144
It's not racism and hatred

2168
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,936
To defend yourself from predators

2169
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:04,288
And as you said earlier in the show if a tribe is being attacked by another tribe

2170
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,568
And I try wants to

2171
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:09,408
All the women kill the kids take over

2172
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:11,200
Put them into slavery whatever

2173
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:17,600
That tribe has a moral right to defend themselves and that's what I'm talkin about here are people

2174
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:21,952
Are facing real genocide replacing loss of her own country

2175
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:25,024
And most Americans most Americans watching this

2176
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,584
Broadcast right now I'm absolutely sure you can have two

2177
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:33,728
Figure out whether you agree or not before Father's is being totally write it out

2178
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:37,312
You know that we're losing our heritage our values our traditions

2179
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,360
You going to the store to go into the

2180
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:45,760
A communities of our society you don't even look like you belong anymore you go in with spares of hatred against you

2181
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:49,088
Maybe you'll get stairs of hatred because you're a very famous bigot

2182
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,136
Maybe publicly

2183
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:53,952
People look at you with hatred cuz of the things you said

2184
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,976
Antibodies

2185
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:59,584
Alex right there

2186
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,704
European

2187
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,496
He's just said why

2188
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:08,032
The argument about

2189
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:08,800
Tribes

2190
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,848
And like of a neighboring tribe is

2191
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,128
Coming in you got to kill him

2192
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:14,944
He's made that argument very literally

2193
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:20,320
And then all the stuff about the cut this country is not like our forefathers country

2194
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,112
It's not our heritage

2195
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:24,928
Alex uses terms like Birthright

2196
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,208
And Providence

2197
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:30,048
I'm stuff like that and it did just synonymous

2198
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:32,352
It's they're making the same point

2199
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,888
The same vision

2200
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,424
The same arguments

2201
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,752
With the only caveat between them being

2202
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:40,800
What do we call the bad guy

2203
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,848
It's it's so

2204
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,640
It's so amazing

2205
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,176
This idea that

2206
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,224
Own

2207
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,504
Americas Value

2208
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:52,832
Like that's that's what I see so often

2209
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:53,600
With all of these

2210
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,136
It's always

2211
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:56,928
It's not our values

2212
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,464
The America

2213
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,232
Cuz value

2214
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,768
Which is such a lie

2215
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,072
Rick

2216
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,352
And that's that's

2217
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,144
To me that is

2218
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,680
The that is America

2219
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:09,728
Regardless of our history

2220
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,776
Which has been

2221
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,056
Nightmare

2222
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,592
It's trouble

2223
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,896
The values

2224
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,176
Were there from the

2225
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:20,992
That that value

2226
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,040
Even if it was not a

2227
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:23,808
Applied

2228
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:26,368
Which it most certainly was not

2229
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:29,440
But that I value of all men are created

2230
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:31,744
Americas Value

2231
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,888
Government

2232
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,936
Life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

2233
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:41,216
Do all those things

2234
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:43,264
Are really great idea

2235
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:44,800
That

2236
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,080
That's the value

2237
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
Yeah

2238
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:48,640
How many people have

2239
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,432
That's America

2240
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:52,480
Has been for so long that Kai

2241
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,760
Kind of Beacon of like

2242
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:56,064
I'm going to go to America

2243
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,368
Because I've been a pretzel

2244
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,648
Yeah cuz

2245
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,416
I think

2246
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:02,976
America is where I finally am go

2247
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,280
Because of that ballet

2248
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,328
Yeah

2249
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:09,376
Our heritage is

2250
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,912
F*** over everybody

2251
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:14,496
But the idea

2252
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,032
Control our values

2253
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:20,128
Talk about the ownership of that space

2254
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,176
As they say in the business world

2255
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,480
It's really f***** up

2256
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,784
I am I mean by this point

2257
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,088
Alex is headache is probably getting worse

2258
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,904
Are you going to see him just being flustered and being like

2259
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,440
I do

2260
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:37,792
I do recognize those words I think I'm going to stay in the future

2261
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,840
Yep

2262
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,632
What you talking about I hate the way you say it

2263
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:42,912
But I love I love what you

2264
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:49,312
I will probably just know that I agree with anything you say I will say right but I will

2265
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,616
Stay warm

2266
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:56,992
Now you need to put down for this one because Alex asked

2267
01:45:57,248 --> 01:46:02,112
David Duke straight up with the world be a better place without Jews

2268
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,136
Do not play the

2269
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,672
It's

2270
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:18,752
Every society

2271
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:24,384
I think I think absolutely these problems wouldn't be here except for the fact that because they existed

2272
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:30,784
Because we let them take over but they didn't do it openly didn't say look we're Jews and we're going to control your Society

2273
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,064
Deceit

2274
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:35,904
And even an intelligent man if he thumbies puts poison in his food

2275
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,720
He can be killed and that's exactly what they did with us

2276
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:39,488
That's terrible

2277
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,512
That is just

2278
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:41,280
Terrible

2279
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,840
Absurd that Alex

2280
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:44,864
Who's letting him say these the

2281
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:45,888
Michelle

2282
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:49,984
I'm going to go pick my backup now

2283
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:52,544
Sorry

2284
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:54,592
Oh boy

2285
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:58,176
Silent treatment

2286
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:58,944
I'm trying

2287
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:03,552
Yeah that's crazy

2288
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:08,160
Advocating for killing all Jews or anything like that

2289
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:12,512
Do you think that are they all

2290
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,536
Jews are

2291
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,072
Aaron Trickster

2292
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,216
That money lenders

2293
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:26,336
Implied inside that statement that he's making

2294
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:31,200
There is a sense of inevitability that they will try and lie to us

2295
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:31,968
To take over

2296
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,248
I'm so

2297
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,784
Even though he's saying

2298
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:35,808
I'm not

2299
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:39,392
A better place if Jews weren't around

2300
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:41,696
I'm playing that inevitably they're going to get sneaky

2301
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:43,488
And so yeah obviously

2302
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:45,024
They shouldn't be around yeah

2303
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:49,376
And that's really really really bad and the fact that Alex

2304
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,144
Shining

2305
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,936
Beacons of nevermind

2306
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:57,568
Has ever lied and colluded with a

2307
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:58,592
The foreign power

2308
01:47:59,104 --> 01:47:59,616
To take over

2309
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,664
Yikes they're taking over our

2310
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,944
News breaking

2311
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,248
Probably as we record this podcast

2312
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:06,528
I'm so

2313
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:07,808
The thing is like Alex

2314
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:11,904
Like I said earlier I'm not sure if it's wrong to have David Duke on your show

2315
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:12,928
I don't know

2316
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:16,000
It is very wrong to allow him to say stuff like that

2317
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:16,768
I'm knocked out

2318
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,816
And not be competent

2319
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:20,096
In your rebuttal

2320
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:20,864
And Alex

2321
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,632
Is not

2322
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:23,168
Is absolutely not

2323
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:26,752
He allows David Luke to get away with saying these things

2324
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:27,776
And

2325
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,336
If you want any kind of estimation

2326
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,896
How bad Alex is losing

2327
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:34,432
Listen to this

2328
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:35,712
They end up taking calls

2329
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:37,504
This is the first caller

2330
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,528
The calls in

2331
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:41,600
Is defending himself a little bit

2332
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,392
Remember you take the first

2333
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,160
Call

2334
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,184
I am

2335
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:46,976
Missy

2336
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,024
I don't think

2337
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:53,888
I've never said we should go out and start killing black people or anything like that like they should have inside of them instead

2338
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,936
Sebastian's not really

2339
01:48:56,192 --> 01:49:02,336
Louis Farrakhan

2340
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:08,736
He said something I agree and I agree with any black person that wants to preserve their own heavy I will come on overdrive I'm going to spend

2341
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,784
Whatever time we have a lot more to discuss.

2342
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:17,184
Let's do it I'm ready to go

2343
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,960
Via Skype you're on the

2344
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:36,384
Hi Walter Williamston conversation and dialogue between e26 and fascinated

2345
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:38,432
In the past year

2346
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:43,296
Illegal immigrants

2347
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:49,696
Miracles this year said that Germany population of 89th and take on 400,000 people from North Africa

2348
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:54,048
In the middle because I'm wondering what the doctor thinks about this

2349
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:58,400
I would love to hear his opinion about letting recruiting and lastly

2350
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,936
Alex I love you man

2351
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:01,472
I listen to everyday

2352
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:08,640
What's the time in half you been super politically correct

2353
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:11,200
So I just want to say that

2354
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:11,968
Read

2355
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:15,552
I appreciate Alex Jones having having me on

2356
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:18,112
And and I I really do and it was

2357
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:19,904
It's a courageous act on his farm

2358
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:22,464
The Power Balance is entirely flipped

2359
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,280
Yep. Callers are turning on him

2360
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,584
Because

2361
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,632
He had a good outing outside

2362
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:32,192
Supremacy will Alex can't defend

2363
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:38,592
But he can't stand up in this argument because it's abundantly clear that the only line of

2364
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:40,128
Demarcation between them

2365
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:40,896
Is

2366
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:41,664
That

2367
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:44,224
David Duke is willing

2368
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,504
You to say what you mean

2369
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,784
And Alex is

2370
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:53,952
Alex Alex still has to apply it to caught up in dog language

2371
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,232
Bring his peace

2372
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:57,792
And I don't know maybe it is maybe it's not

2373
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,192
They are well

2374
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,472
You can see it with

2375
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:08,288
With f****** Trump the real supporters

2376
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,312
AR

2377
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:10,592
Out now

2378
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:13,664
I want you to say white people are better

2379
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:20,064
Campaign they won't stay radical Islamic Terror

2380
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:22,880
Right

2381
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:25,952
But you know that's not that being politically correct

2382
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:26,720
Didn't say anything

2383
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:28,000
Errors

2384
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,048
You know

2385
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:32,864
People who we've murdered their families

2386
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:38,240
Slipped and

2387
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:43,360
The caller the way he presents things first of all that becomes Alex Jones is is like

2388
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:45,664
It didn't straight mirror of his narrative

2389
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,224
That all of these invading immigrants are taking

2390
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:51,552
Places in our in our civilizations they shouldn't have

2391
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:53,088
It's the caller is

2392
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,880
Mirroring and

2393
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:58,208
I had a Alex's narrative a little bit

2394
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:00,000
David is so

2395
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,816
Yeah he's so like

2396
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:09,472
Listen I'm so grateful to Alex I am so happy that Alex

2397
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:13,056
What do they take him out

2398
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,848
I'm glad Alex let me

2399
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:17,152
Come on and show and beat him like a b****

2400
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:23,552
Yeah I've completely destroyed you on your own showed a nice pat on the back

2401
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:25,088
I don't have any more clips

2402
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:27,136
What happened because it's a mess

2403
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:28,160
But

2404
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:28,928
Alex

2405
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:30,720
Tries a different approach

2406
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,256
Because

2407
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:33,792
He

2408
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,072
Has failed

2409
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,096
Though

2410
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:39,424
He has a Jewish employee

2411
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,008
No

2412
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:50,176
She brings him out employees

2413
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:52,992
I think Alex think

2414
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:55,552
David Duke is literally afraid of Jews

2415
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:58,880
Because he brings them out to make some points about Jekyll Island

2416
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:01,440
And about the the Federal Reserve Bank

2417
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:04,768
I'm stuff like that the big point that he tries to make is that like

2418
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,840
Not all the people who met at Jekyll Island were Jews

2419
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:12,192
People who ran all the big six Banks weren't necessarily all Jews

2420
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,728
And it's not

2421
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:15,264
Successful line of argument

2422
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,080
You can see that Alex is like I can't win this

2423
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:20,384
I'm going to bring in hired help

2424
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,432
Yeah and so he tries to get

2425
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:28,064
He brings in yet another unprepared person actually does a better job at least saying

2426
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:31,648
But he still ends up looking like a

2427
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,952
Cuz you can't you can't

2428
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:35,232
Spar with David Duke

2429
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:36,512
Come out looking good

2430
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,536
It's not it doesn't work

2431
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:38,560
He brings you down

2432
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:39,840
Whatever level you been

2433
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:44,192
And if you already agree in principle with the things he's

2434
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:46,496
You can't win it all and I don't want to win

2435
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:48,544
So how is

2436
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,336
So that's one of the things

2437
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:51,616
I

2438
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:52,640
I think about

2439
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:53,920
When we talked about life

2440
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,456
Jakari Jackson or this guy

2441
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,992
Like how do

2442
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:57,760
Do you not

2443
01:53:58,784 --> 01:53:59,296
Get

2444
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,320
That he

2445
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,088
Is a Mastiff

2446
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:02,624
The biggest like is it just

2447
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,928
Like is it a gig is it just like

2448
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:07,232
Is it like a pterodactyl in

2449
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:11,840
It's all living like what it what is that

2450
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:15,424
I think a part of it might be pretty strong contract

2451
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,984
I think you might sign a two-year contract just

2452
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,288
Nothing like that that's very difficult to get out of

2453
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,336
I think also people

2454
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:23,360
I noticed

2455
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:25,152
The trend of very young people

2456
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:29,504
Is like a early twenties when he started

2457
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:33,856
Lee Ann McAdoo can't be much older than that when she started

2458
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,136
RAB do

2459
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:37,696
Actually Radu looks much younger than he is he was in

2460
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:38,464
Is 30s

2461
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:39,488
David nights

2462
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:41,536
Just an idiot Jakari Jackson

2463
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:43,072
With under 30

2464
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:44,608
I think

2465
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:48,448
People think that there's an opportunity to be had here and we're doing journalism

2466
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,752
Play sign a contract get in

2467
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:52,288
Realize f*** this is

2468
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:56,128
Completely ruin my chances there's no way I could get a job anywhere else

2469
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:58,688
And maybe they just assimilate a little bit

2470
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:04,320
You know how whenever you're at a job that you're doing and there's a lot of negative things about it just kind of acclimate to it

2471
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:05,856
You're like

2472
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:12,256
Look what the bird until you start to like blind yourself to all the s*** that you don't like right

2473
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,048
Just filter it out

2474
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:16,352
Or Hugo native I think some people

2475
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,912
Start to I mean Alex is for all

2476
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,192
His problems

2477
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,216
But your money

2478
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:22,752
He is pretty

2479
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:25,056
He is funny sometimes

2480
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:28,896
And I bet off air heat there's moments when he's pretty nice

2481
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:31,712
If you're young journalist

2482
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:33,248
Aspiring journalist

2483
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,808
It probably would feel pretty good to have

2484
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:37,088
His approval

2485
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,112
Maybe

2486
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:43,744
My theory is a media operation

2487
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,792
You can't create something like that

2488
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:48,096
Without having some sort of charismatic

2489
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:52,448
Pole with people

2490
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,216
Well

2491
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,264
Immediately following the crash

2492
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,544
In 2000

2493
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:57,824
As we all know

2494
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:59,104
Is very tough

2495
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,128
For young people to

2496
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:01,408
Sure

2497
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,944
And I mean

2498
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:05,248
Fresh out of college you got a lot of college

2499
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:06,016
Toothpaste

2500
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:08,064
See this Infowars gig you don't really know

2501
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:10,112
About me like a man

2502
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,392
I got to get work

2503
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:12,928
This is Oprah

2504
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:14,976
Corset

2505
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:19,328
But you're also both are discounting the fact that a lot of people

2506
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,096
Do believe

2507
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,376
Alex

2508
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,168
And don't think that it's bigger

2509
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:27,776
Because he pays lip service to we all bleed red blood

2510
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,848
But that's not taking into account how

2511
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,128
His action

2512
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,408
Are very different

2513
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,432
Covers

2514
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:38,016
Like if there was

2515
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:40,576
Criticism of an all black sorority

2516
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:42,880
He never would have said the sort of stuff that he

2517
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:45,440
He wouldn't care that wouldn't be on his radar

2518
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:47,744
He's talked about it cuz it's defending

2519
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:51,328
That's perfectly at encapsulation of

2520
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:53,120
How has coverage work

2521
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:56,448
But if you're already on board with the infowar

2522
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,728
You might not see that

2523
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:59,264
You might just be like

2524
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,336
Another story about the Liberals run-amok

2525
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,384
Maybe you can check yourself

2526
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:05,664
Maybe

2527
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:09,248
I like how plenty of people trick themselves into

2528
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,272
Believing that the merchant

2529
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,344
Sure

2530
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:15,904
Or the Bible

2531
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:17,440
Never rest

2532
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:19,232
Parts of it are pretty bad

2533
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:31,008
Great books like I said

2534
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:31,776
Makes a big L

2535
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:32,800
In terms of this interview

2536
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:35,360
Better

2537
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,384
But

2538
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:39,712
I started listening to the episode on August 19th

2539
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,248
Does the next day

2540
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:43,296
Post game

2541
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:45,600
Where are you trying to save a little bit of

2542
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,648
And here is

2543
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,696
Alex describing what happened

2544
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:50,976
On the 18th

2545
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:52,512
By David

2546
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:55,840
Hillary Clinton first

2547
01:57:56,096 --> 01:58:00,448
But getting back to David, show for 2 hours

2548
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,008
Less than 2 hours

2549
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,544
Yesterday and

2550
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:09,664
I wanted to have a serious discussion

2551
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:13,760
You can't come on if I was civil and polite nice

2552
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,184
I want to get Eman

2553
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:24,768
Illustrate is lessons

2554
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:26,560
Then what match yellow Raza

2555
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:28,352
Racist black groups are saying

2556
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:30,400
Northwood

2557
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:40,384
It doesn't inside even just that sentence

2558
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:46,528
Not as race

2559
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,576
Racist

2560
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:50,368
Aren't as bad as their race

2561
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,904
Including

2562
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:54,720
But you said larraza in there

2563
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,256
Actively advik

2564
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,792
Perkasie group for Hispanic

2565
01:58:58,048 --> 01:59:01,376
Populations are not a hate group

2566
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:02,656
They are not a race

2567
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:05,216
This group at all they provide Legal Services

2568
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:07,520
Ford

2569
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:09,056
A disenfranchised population

2570
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:11,616
Them in

2571
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,408
With the likes of David Duke

2572
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,944
Is also very white

2573
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,736
You betcha so anyway

2574
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:23,392
Respect

2575
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:27,488
What I came away with this

2576
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:30,560
Disingenuous

2577
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:32,864
What came away with was

2578
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,144
I'm terrible at dinner

2579
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,960
Making points

2580
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:39,776
Okay so he says that no no

2581
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:41,056
I almost did it

2582
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:42,848
During the breaks out there

2583
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,408
When he wasn't on area look like

2584
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:48,224
And it really was creeping me out

2585
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:52,064
Little Angel Eyes sweetie face

2586
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,600
The dude

2587
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,416
Help everybody

2588
01:59:56,672 --> 02:00:02,816
Are you cutting me short

2589
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:06,144
And I'm not going to answer your questions are on the spinner

2590
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:09,472
Pedophile

2591
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:15,616
Looking

2592
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:17,408
He wasn't playing mr. coetzee

2593
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:22,016
Talking to some business people

2594
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:24,320
I'm going to get into it last night

2595
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:31,232
Oh yeah David

2596
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:36,352
There's more than meets the eye with David

2597
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:37,888
Oh really

2598
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,680
What is it the

2599
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:46,080
What do sweetie I is that enough real bad

2600
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:46,848
Is

2601
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,896
Has business interests in Austin

2602
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,296
And even if the end of there that indicates

2603
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:57,088
Like a very

2604
02:00:57,856 --> 02:01:00,928
Unprepared Alex Jones interview

2605
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:04,256
If you didn't realize that David Duke was very successful

2606
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:05,792
What does he know

2607
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:08,608
That he knows he was a member of the KKK

2608
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:10,144
Wizards are funny

2609
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,192
Right that's about it extra

2610
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,984
I'm because Alex

2611
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:16,544
Dumb people

2612
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,336
He allowed David Duke to be on

2613
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:22,432
Lose an argument with him which only makes

2614
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:24,224
And his listeners got

2615
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:24,992
Mad at

2616
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:27,296
For not agreeing with

2617
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:30,880
If you were taking the temperature like

2618
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:32,928
Interview it

2619
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,512
You know you do wrestlers do

2620
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,792
They come out and they take

2621
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:38,816
Take a survey

2622
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:40,608
Of the audience

2623
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:46,496
Wrestlers do they come out like back in the NWO days is going to do like

2624
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:47,776
Scott Hall would come out

2625
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:51,360
How many people here love the NWO

2626
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:54,944
I meant you could get a sense of what kind of crowd you were in front of

2627
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,480
Is there people who were like

2628
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:58,016
Cheering for the bad guys

2629
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,040
And that sort of thing

2630
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:01,088
If you take a poll

2631
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:03,904
Basically or take a survey from that

2632
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,184
Episode

2633
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:08,256
The only answer that you can really draw is

2634
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:09,280
Pretty much

2635
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:15,424
I don't have the other Clips but the other callers were fairly similar

2636
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:19,008
Like they were mostly you to agree about everything

2637
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:23,616
I hate to see people in the alternative Patriot movement

2638
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:26,944
About everything and disagree about a little bit

2639
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:29,760
Not getting along so if you take that as

2640
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:30,784
The survey

2641
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:31,552
The audience

2642
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:34,624
Like David Duke more than they like Alex absolutely

2643
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,904
Butchers real bad

2644
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:40,512
But they would do probably doesn't talk about chimeras a bunch

2645
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:41,536
So Alex

2646
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:42,816
Keeps his opposition

2647
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,888
I don't know

2648
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,656
That's

2649
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:48,192
That's a powerful man

2650
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:49,728
White supremacist

2651
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:51,776
Sarah Haider

2652
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:54,080
Done make him president

2653
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:57,920
Why I insisted that we go over there

2654
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:01,248
Even though I knew it was going to be bad and you were going to

2655
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:02,272
And I'm sorry

2656
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:04,320
The reason is

2657
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,112
I think

2658
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:07,136
That

2659
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:09,440
I don't know I don't know how to put this exactly

2660
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:10,976
At the beginning

2661
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:13,024
The 7th

2662
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:17,120
Alex is still on the I don't really trust Trump

2663
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:18,656
Even though

2664
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:20,960
He is now attacking the clintons and that's great

2665
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:22,240
He's still

2666
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:24,288
Literally saying I don't endorse

2667
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:29,152
He's still there

2668
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:33,248
He has an interview where he gets cucked out on his own show by David Duke

2669
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:35,808
And he's forced to I'm telling you

2670
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:36,576
Don't watch it

2671
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:38,112
Cuz it's really long

2672
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:40,928
And David Duke says even worse things than we played here

2673
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:45,536
But if you do watch it and you can watch Alex Jones's face

2674
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:47,584
He's having a miserable time

2675
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,608
Because he's faced

2676
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:50,400
Too Faced with the reality of his beliefs

2677
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:54,752
And whether he realizes that or not he internalized something

2678
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:59,616
David Duke was one of the first people that came out and really supported Trump

2679
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,408
I think that there is a

2680
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:02,944
Conscious thing that happens

2681
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:03,968
Possibly

2682
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:06,784
That wants David Duke starts advocating for Trump

2683
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,552
And

2684
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:08,576
Using a lot of

2685
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:11,648
The same arguments that he makes on Alex's show

2686
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:15,488
That we live in doing this episode to support his belief in Trump

2687
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,280
Something resonates without

2688
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:21,376
Yeah do you not think it's more likely that it's

2689
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:22,144
The fact that he

2690
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:22,912
His listeners

2691
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:25,472
Steamed Berry

2692
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,240
David Duke

2693
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:28,032
Maybe that forces Alec

2694
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:28,800
62

2695
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:30,336
Move further to the right

2696
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:32,896
It's possible but if I were Alex

2697
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:35,200
By the way I do mean right

2698
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:36,224
In saying that

2699
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:37,504
When you get further right

2700
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,272
You're a white

2701
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:42,368
Yeah really far right are there

2702
02:04:42,624 --> 02:04:44,416
The farther right Hugo

2703
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:45,184
Eurowise

2704
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:48,768
No

2705
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:50,560
Here's what is i r Alex

2706
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:55,168
I would rationalize the callers Away by saying

2707
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:58,752
They knew he was going to be on my show that jam my lines or something like

2708
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:03,360
It's pretty simple to to rationalize that

2709
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:05,664
I mean I know he couldn't rationalize

2710
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:07,456
If he were explaining it

2711
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:09,248
You know that

2712
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:13,088
But I genuinely

2713
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:14,880
Just in the same way that

2714
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:16,416
His sources are caller

2715
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:18,208
Yeah I think he's pushed

2716
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:18,976
Buy collars

2717
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:24,096
I think whenever a caller comes in buying the goddamn pills

2718
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:26,656
He's a big dumb idiot

2719
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:27,680
True like

2720
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:30,496
Whenever I'm Taylor

2721
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,032
Whatever color says

2722
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:33,824
You've been very politically

2723
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:35,616
Alex

2724
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:41,248
Yeah I love you but you politically correct

2725
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:42,528
That because you just

2726
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,552
Accused Alex

2727
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:44,320
Something

2728
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:45,088
He hates more than

2729
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:49,696
Amman

2730
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:50,720
That he's

2731
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:51,488
Not

2732
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:52,256
Politically

2733
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:58,400
Right but I think that's a way that he can get through that and gets around that it's the next day on the 19th him saying

2734
02:05:58,656 --> 02:06:00,704
Kind of being a f******

2735
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,728
Weirdo

2736
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:03,520
He's creepy and he scares me

2737
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:07,616
Brett so he can be like he was being manipulative and I was creeped out

2738
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:12,736
Again

2739
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:15,040
Talking about what he's talking about on his

2740
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:17,600
Fright about Alex

2741
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:20,416
Who's running his

2742
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:23,232
But I still think that he could feel that

2743
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:25,792
Like I think you could feel the

2744
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,888
I got it back by making fun of Duke the next day

2745
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:30,656
Okay

2746
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:33,984
I think so but I'm not sure I do understand what you're saying

2747
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:35,520
And you may be right

2748
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:37,568
I don't know

2749
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,336
That hurt you

2750
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:39,872
Poseidon

2751
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:40,896
Alright

2752
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:45,760
You win 10

2753
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:46,784
I don't know man

2754
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:54,976
And when we started this investigation I certainly did not expect that we would run into a f****** to our interview with David Duke

2755
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:58,048
Is not what I was expecting to

2756
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:02,400
Discuss but I really wanted to do this and get it out this week

2757
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:05,216
Yeah because this is been impeding my investigation

2758
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:08,288
I really have to yell at you

2759
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,312
No

2760
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:15,968
I knew that this was a hurdle we were going to have to get over it was stopping me from

2761
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:18,528
Being able to enjoy whatever happened

2762
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,320
So f***** up

2763
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:22,624
It's so f***** up

2764
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,416
Anybody with any insight

2765
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:26,208
In Alex's position

2766
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:28,256
Listening to David Duke

2767
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:31,072
Say the exact same things that he believes

2768
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:32,608
But stay

2769
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,144
Jews instead of globalist

2770
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:35,424
Would have a crepe

2771
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:36,960
Or

2772
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:38,496
Would expect

2773
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:40,800
And have a good argument to rebut the fee

2774
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:45,408
Be closer to the prior than the latter

2775
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:47,456
But he's not really doing either

2776
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:51,040
Cuz he doesn't give up on the globalist narratively f****** know that

2777
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:54,368
He didn't defend himself well

2778
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:55,136
Right

2779
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:56,928
Question

2780
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,720
That I'm I'm

2781
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:00,512
Because David Duke

2782
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:01,280
Has been on

2783
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:06,144
Yeah he's been interviewed plenty of time O'Reilly

2784
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,424
At 5 and

2785
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:09,472
Even if you are pushing

2786
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:11,520
Like

2787
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:13,312
What what is better

2788
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:14,336
Is it

2789
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:17,152
Is it a don't feed the trolls approach where it's like

2790
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:18,944
Just don't have them on your f***

2791
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,504
I think so

2792
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,040
Like even if you

2793
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:24,832
Go line-by-line

2794
02:08:25,344 --> 02:08:27,648
You fuking idiot this is why you're dumb

2795
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,744
This is every single thing that

2796
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,024
Not only debunked

2797
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:33,792
But can

2798
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:36,608
Condemns and destroys all of your

2799
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:37,632
And

2800
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:38,912
On top of that

2801
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:39,936
Your

2802
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:40,704
Personally

2803
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,984
A bad

2804
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:43,520
And I mean that

2805
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:44,544
In the sense that

2806
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,312
You are

2807
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:47,360
Evil you are immoral

2808
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:48,128
You are

2809
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:48,896
Dammit

2810
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:51,712
And hurting other human being

2811
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:54,272
Exactly

2812
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:59,392
From this episode

2813
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,416
Giving his

2814
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:01,184
Thought

2815
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:01,952
A

2816
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:06,560
I think I've January my response to

2817
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:08,096
The Megyn Kelly Alex Jones

2818
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:11,936
Before we were doing that in our preview episode

2819
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:13,728
I was kind of on the side of like

2820
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:15,776
Well maybe it is a good idea

2821
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:17,568
It's a kind of shed some light on this

2822
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:20,384
And let everybody in the world know

2823
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,408
Look at this

2824
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:23,200
Idiot this is the avatar

2825
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,224
Star of the alt-right

2826
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:25,760
This bubbling

2827
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:28,064
Mereba leaving months

2828
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,112
Easter seal

2829
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:31,648
Hate the real face

2830
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:34,976
Behind all of these people that we are afraid of be

2831
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:35,744
Because their violin

2832
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:37,792
Stupid

2833
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:38,560
There there

2834
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:39,328
You're f******

2835
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:42,400
That

2836
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:44,704
They're just petulant children

2837
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:46,496
That we should just f***

2838
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:54,176
We looked at the Meg

2839
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:55,456
Kelly interview

2840
02:09:56,480 --> 02:10:01,088
Yeah but I think that not giving a platform is the best thing to

2841
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:03,392
To do probably because

2842
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:07,744
I was reading an article about this and it made a really good point

2843
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:08,512
And

2844
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:10,816
It's essentially a situation where

2845
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,376
Respectable people

2846
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:15,424
People with

2847
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:16,960
Journalistic ethics

2848
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:19,520
Are not prepared to deal with people like this

2849
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:21,824
Because they don't have rules

2850
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:24,128
Any rules

2851
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:25,920
Ratso

2852
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:30,016
Megyn Kelly comes and it talks to Alex Jones revamp

2853
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:31,808
She didn't

2854
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,088
Expected he would

2855
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:36,416
Turn it into a whole Narrative of his own

2856
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:39,488
She didn't expect that he would Bluff that he taped the whole thing

2857
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,024
And start lying about it

2858
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,304
You know it

2859
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,072
You like

2860
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:46,912
Alex Jones didn't care about the interview itself

2861
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:48,192
Like we've speculated

2862
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:49,984
There's something on that tape you was worried about

2863
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:52,288
Yeah but he didn't care about the interview

2864
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:56,128
As much as he cared about these the interview was done allowed him

2865
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:56,896
To create

2866
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:58,688
A giant narrative Arc

2867
02:10:59,200 --> 02:10:59,712
And

2868
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:01,504
Megyn Kelly was making a story

2869
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,040
Alex Jones was making

2870
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:07,904
Story was making hay out of that

2871
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,208
Of course Megyn Kelly got 10 minutes

2872
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:11,232
That were pathetic

2873
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:13,280
Nobody wanted

2874
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:17,632
The funniest home videos

2875
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:19,936
Whereas Alex.

2876
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:21,728
Weeks upon weeks

2877
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:22,752
Program

2878
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:26,080
Lyrics to pain weeks at Fordham Court

2879
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:28,896
Mainstream media's full show

2880
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,432
Alex

2881
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:31,712
Definitely one that one

2882
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:35,040
Alex defeated Megan in the way that

2883
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:39,392
David Duke defeated Alex

2884
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:41,952
I think they probably have comprable audiences

2885
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:42,976
David Duke and Alex

2886
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:49,376
There's probably a very interesting very circular Venn diagram of that

2887
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:55,776
Jakari Jackson is the only one outside of the bed.

2888
02:11:56,032 --> 02:12:01,152
So I don't know I don't know if it is a thing were denying him a platform is really irrelevant

2889
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:01,920
Concern

2890
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:06,528
But I think that the more the better thing that I would say about it the more accurate

2891
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:08,064
Is

2892
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:10,368
If you let him on your show

2893
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:13,952
You stand a chance of losing to him

2894
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,488
And then

2895
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:16,768
You've lost

2896
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,888
Cuz I know that I could

2897
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:24,192
I think I could conceivably make better points

2898
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:24,960
David Duke

2899
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:26,240
Yeah I think I could

2900
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:29,568
I would never debate him I would never talk to him

2901
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:32,896
Be in the same reason I would never have a serious debate with Alex Jones

2902
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:34,176
Cuz they're both slippery

2903
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:36,224
They're both due to lie about

2904
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:39,808
And if someone if you're in a debate with someone and you have a bunch

2905
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:41,344
Back view of your argument

2906
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:44,160
And they throw out some historical fact

2907
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:45,184
That's really

2908
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:48,768
Skewer and probably alive that you just haven't looked

2909
02:12:49,024 --> 02:12:50,816
And make a huge deal out of it

2910
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:54,144
Do you might end up appearing to lose a debate

2911
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:54,912
You just

2912
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:58,752
David Live Well I mean look at the

2913
02:12:59,008 --> 02:13:00,032
Mediate covers truck

2914
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:05,664
Like they're unprepared for somebody who doesn't live even Within

2915
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:07,968
Doesn't give a second

2916
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:08,992
Society

2917
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:11,296
They can't deal with a president

2918
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:12,064
Tuesday

2919
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,600
Intrude like they've been

2920
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:15,136
Trained to respect

2921
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:15,904
The office

2922
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:18,464
And they can't deal with somebody who

2923
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:20,256
Couldn't give less of a s*** about the

2924
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:23,584
About you

2925
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,120
You doesn't care about the

2926
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:26,144
Truth

2927
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:26,912
F******

2928
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:29,984
Care they don't get that so to them

2929
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:32,544
Okay our job is to cover

2930
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:33,312
The Press

2931
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:36,896
Wooden reality if you're dealing with somebody like that

2932
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:38,432
Your only real job

2933
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:39,712
Fox them

2934
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:41,504
Force them

2935
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,040
To abide by your rules

2936
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:45,088
Can't understand

2937
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:51,744
Right I think there's a chance that you know David Duke wasn't forceful about it but I think that's what he

2938
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,048
He did a little bit on this episode

2939
02:13:54,304 --> 02:13:55,328
Are any any

2940
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:58,400
Aware and decently smart

2941
02:13:58,656 --> 02:13:59,168
Observer

2942
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:00,448
Would see that

2943
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:03,264
See Alex Jones essentially

2944
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:04,544
Having to admit

2945
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,336
But his beliefs have roots in it

2946
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:10,688
And we've said hola

2947
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:13,760
So here's my thought

2948
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:17,088
Blind-spot

2949
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:18,880
Can closing work

2950
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:21,184
That's all right.

2951
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:22,720
Here is my plan

2952
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:24,512
If I am

2953
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:26,304
If I'm in control of the media

2954
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:28,096
Here's what we do

2955
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:33,472
All of this s*** that Trump is doing like we're not allowing cameras into the depressed free

2956
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:34,240
Taking all of that

2957
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,544
Stop covering Trump

2958
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,312
.

2959
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:39,104
No tweet

2960
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:39,872
No nothing

2961
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:41,408
You only talk

2962
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,688
To the Senate

2963
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:44,736
And the house of

2964
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:46,016
About the healthcare

2965
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,296
What's about

2966
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:48,320
That's all you do

2967
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:50,112
How long before Trump

2968
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:51,136
Explode

2969
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:55,232
He has to have attention pretty quick

2970
02:14:57,024 --> 02:15:01,632
Yeah and he would end that would be only move that's your only

2971
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:04,960
But you're only plan of attack against people

2972
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:06,496
Who cannot help

2973
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:08,032
Cannot be

2974
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:09,312
Held within those bow

2975
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:11,360
Your only plan of attack

2976
02:15:11,616 --> 02:15:13,664
Is 2 take away the one thing that they care

2977
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:15,456
And that is

2978
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:17,760
Attention Trump it's just that

2979
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:18,784
So what about Alec

2980
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:21,600
How do you take away what Alex wants

2981
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:22,624
OU

2982
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,744
Or you just can't

2983
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,072
Recently tweet at him is that him and Gwyneth Paltrow agree about supper

2984
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:33,120
Yeah maybe

2985
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:39,520
Hey Alex you know what you're selling your selling your selling poop yeah you're selling like mungias or what

2986
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:45,152
You're a trendy

2987
