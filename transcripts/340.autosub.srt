1
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:23,296
I'm sweating

2
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:29,696
College B

3
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:36,096
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
MoneyGram

5
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
Alex

6
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,136
College.com

7
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
A little bit about

8
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,864
Alex Jones

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
What up

10
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
What is the worst

11
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,568
I don't know

12
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,592
Anything like that but like

13
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
Did you have a high school guidance counselor

14
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Some terrible advice

15
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,272
I don't know if it comes to my mind the most here is

16
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,184
Don't give me that gave me the

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
How to replace the back

18
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,536
Stupid

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,864
Nothing comes to mind is like you think about parents

20
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:47,008
I guess this isn't too much advice

21
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Bad move

22
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
From from the like a good source of

23
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,688
Afraid of thunderstorms

24
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
When I was a wee boy

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,088
We moved to Missouri when I was

26
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
News 10

27
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
Thunderstorms

28
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,976
The boy had no idea what they were

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,072
Yeah there aren't

30
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
I've never seen one in the four years that I was there

31
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
And from what I know of Missouri and there are these things called tornadoes

32
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,688
Thunderstorm

33
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:32,320
Right it's so like I have this built up in my head that if there's a thunderstorm

34
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,720
Enter my mind tornadoes are almost identical to hurricanes

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
So I had to

36
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
Careful Terabithia read them when they were thunderstorm

37
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
And so I was a old

38
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
And I was scared in bed during a thunderstorm

39
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
And

40
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
I called out for my dad

41
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
In the middle of the night

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,432
He comes into my room and

43
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,992
Then don't worry the worst is over

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,368
And then as soon as he says the worst is over this

45
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,768
Would lightning outside the window

46
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
Basically

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
Loudest

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
Yeah yeah

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
As soon as the Thunder claps

50
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Subsided

51
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,224
The Lights Went Out in the house

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,296
Tornado siren

53
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,368
Hilarious

54
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
My dumbass.

55
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,960
It's a good gamble to say the worst is over your right

56
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:05,248
He was way off

57
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,583
Very funny

58
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,983
And other tornado warning about it now but I know more about Alex

59
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,567
Tell me about Alex

60
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
A unique episode 2

61
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
How to present to the people

62
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,759
Last episode

63
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
Getting a bit into

64
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
PVP

65
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:45,183
I have done quite a bit of digging around trying to find some information on this

66
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,095
And come away from it as confused as I was when I started

67
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Harry's

68
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Steve Perry is

69
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:01,055
Not the same a different fairy will come up in this episode

70
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,383
There is a Seafarer that I will mention later

71
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
That is super bizarre

72
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:12,831
How great I feel about people who signed up and are supporting the show

73
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,671
Do I sharpen my skills on a tornado fields

74
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695

Okay

00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,903
Or TJ Lavin host of the real world

94
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
I show that I no longer watch but long

95
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023

96
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
Yeah

97
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
Then finally likes

98
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Epoch

99
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
Thank you so much you are now

100
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,727
I'm a policy wonk

101
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,031
Absolutely

102
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Something is that a name

103
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
It's like policy wonk but inverted

104
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:46,271
Wow wow

105
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
Poke

106
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
History all the time

107
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,839
Do you like sports or website now.

108
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Here Comes

109
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
What's in front of us today

110
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,127
Is a profoundly complicated episode of this podcast

111
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,783
As we dig through past of Alex Jones Show in 2013 to learn more about how he ended up believing that no children died it's

112
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
We found it speeds

113
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
Pieczenik is absolutely the first person

114
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,183
To make that argument on are in a way that Alex

115
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Considers

116
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
He thinks about it

117
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Even says that it's blowing his mind

118
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Hearing Steve

119
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Pertronix

120
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Of course

121
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
We've encountered Steve many times in the past

122
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
On Alex's show

123
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,239
And we've delighted and how he and Alex

124
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,567
As they did and I watched episode of our podcast

125
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
That's where Alex cult

126
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,663
Who's in the middle of trying to survive hurricane Irma

127
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,527
Alex wanted to talk about how Trump was being surrounded by globalist and he was under attack

128
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,855
But Steve wasn't having any of it cuz he had water coming in

129
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
And here is a little taste of

130
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,743
Call house arrest like Rapunzel

131
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:09,215
You don't need the president on house arrest punzel

132
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,759
He can do what he does but I am you to judge the Republic

133
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,599
Because I don't like many other people and like many others

134
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,415
Wait for dinner order maintain the Republic

135
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,559
Weather Trump is here

136
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,631
The Republic

137
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
15 years of level of selling out the country and

138
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Trouble

139
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:56,319
Of course not

140
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
I told you that

141
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:03,487
The system that was put in by the EU

142
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:16,287
I was I was

143
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,615
Natalia brilliant

144
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
In the real world

145
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
In the real world

146
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,975
2 days before

147
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:40,607
Yourself

148
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:45,727
Favorite quotes of all time

149
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
This which is just

150
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,079
Spectacular

151
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:55,199
Just sick of the bulshit

152
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
Respect

153
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
I find it

154
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,159
Endlessly hilarious that

155
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,999
One Clip that is so integral to our entire show

156
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
Was part of a lost episode from 2 years

157
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,775
Have to resort to this episode that could be

158
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
The moments like that are really fun

159
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
Jordans

160
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,407
There's a relationship with Alex that most guests

161
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Don't

162
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Alex

163
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Really nice

164
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
Or at least he did for a very long time

165
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,623
Steve was a former State Department official an expert in psychological warfare

166
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,207
Proximity to Alexandra's professed respect for Alex's work

167
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Made him invaluable

168
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
In terms of making Alex appear

169
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Credible

170
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
There's no way they didn't understand that dynamic

171
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,215
So you can just yell at Alex a little bit here and there which is always so much fun

172
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,311
It upsets the normal Power Dynamic of the show where in Alex is the

173
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,847
King of all that he surveys

174
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
The other side effect of this

175
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,247
Is that Steve was pretty much able to say anything on Alex's show

176
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,551
And Alex had to treat it like a serious

177
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Worth considering

178
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:09,439
Like all the time who can forget when

179
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,911
Donnybrook

180
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,751
Sandy Hook and Miss Parkland false flag

181
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,335
And what you looking at

182
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,991
Vestiges of the press trying to be relevant

183
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,951
So park Mendoza

184
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Alex is smart

185
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
To be like

186
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
How many false Flags

187
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
How long are we going to

188
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
Keep calling me

189
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
It's getting thin

190
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
Steve went on

191
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
Straight up the Las Vegas shooting

192
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,967
Let's go straight to the shooting in Vegas

193
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:10,367
Number one why I can't get on the internet the reason is very simple I'm being here

194
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
The reason why you hearing me now it's another person bumps part of 9/11

195
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
Call Inspira sleep everything you said David

196
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,911
The same thing I said with him twenty-four hours of 9/11

197
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,775
My CIA operatives admitted that they did it I have the names of the people involved

198
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
Bush Cheney

199
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
Troodon

200
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
Giuliani

201
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:39,039
The Mossad operatives to blow up the building and then Conde and as well as

202
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
Going down

203
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
This is what happened

204
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
So what we happening

205
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,975
What's happening now is anyways Sandy Hook false flag

206
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
San Bernardino false flag

207
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,839
Yesterday in

208
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:57,983
End in Las Vegas a complete false flag

209
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,311
You could hear the same setup as we had in Sandy Hook

210
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:06,943
The Narrative is so predictable that no one was killed there was no shooting

211
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,527
And in fact what happened in the giveaway was this was the greatest

212
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,623
Killing Emmett Idaho kind of America that's distinctive Trump

213
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
He has to have the most in the bed

214
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
Sad artist that Trump Bell Angeles

215
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,095
System and co-opted by the Department of Health

216
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,959
CIA and FBI what we need to do an Americanized Amman

217
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,287
The indictment of President indictment of officials

218
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,359
I don't know if it'll happen but this is enough

219
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
Reasons to start a revolution

220
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,063
So we got to do you say Las Vegas Noah

221
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
How to say if David Knight wear any

222
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Good as a host

223
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,951
Have you tried turning it off and on

224
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
Hit the switch on the back

225
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Turning it off and

226
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,631
But David has ever called his response was

227
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
Yes but Sandy Hook definitely Texas

228
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
16 election

229
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
Steve

230
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,919
Claimed that he created Bernie Sanders as a psyop

231
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,575
Well Hillary's in a very serious problem and once again I want to thank you already asking you what we did wasn't

232
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
Back to do a psyops

233
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Hillary

234
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,951
Which was ineffective create Bernie Sanders

235
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
Bring Em Out

236
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,791
Co-op Drake streamlab

237
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Samantha bring biting in

238
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:34,239
The Coop to middle and then two breakup and fractionate her system

239
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,311
You know what we got to eat created Bernie Sanders

240
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Bloomington

241
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
Doesn't know that

242
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Leo zagami

243
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
He's working at cross-purposes Leo zagami information

244
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,375
To hear a guy who claims to have committed 911

245
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:08,031
Baillios job together

246
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,079
Things are turning off phones to this

247
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,175
In Florida

248
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:21,087
So we have created

249
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Incredible thing

250
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Who could forget

251
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
About how also

252
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,743
He created

253
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
Can enlisted him to run for president

254
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,631
Your take on Donald Trump

255
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:40,031
Thank you very much the truth of the matter is this is one of the most that one of the most phenomenal American

256
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,151
I've ever seen in the one we were waiting for Alex I thank you and I thank the audience

257
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:50,527
I backed the so-called alternative media which really became the mainstream media

258
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:56,671
Reality is Trump have been monitoring this mainstream media for a long time I knew it he knew it

259
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,767
Many of us had known that and Anna Paquin

260
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
For the next president

261
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,703
Basically ran with it and this is the true expression of the mineral majority

262
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,751
And the fact that we are so tired

263
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,103
The people who committed the crime at 9:11 that once Trump gets in my

264
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Stationary

265
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
Many of them will be arrested

266
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,503
So what we have is him pitching this narrative to Alex

267
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,319
He was part of a group of Heroes

268
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,367
Who enlisted Trump to run as president is

269
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,487
The counter coup against Hillary Clinton of Court trying to pull off her own intro.

270
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,583
Narratives that Steve was promoting on Alex Jones Show in late 2015

271
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
Seeing as we've

272
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,911
Saw enter 2015 coverage

273
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,007
They're shockingly similar to the things

274
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,103
You know the idea of looking to arrest all these people after Trump gets in

275
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:52,735
Goodguys Heroes intelligence services that are working to install

276
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,063
I do not already become a okay

277
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
No

278
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,671
I'm not trying to say that Steve is cute

279
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,767
But I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the people who are running that scam

280
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,327
At least in part

281
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
Inspired by narrative

282
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Persuade

283
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
To support Trump

284
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
With all against so many little elements

285
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Are very similar

286
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,383
Maybe that's something for another episode of didn't want to get into it

287
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,735
That would be something we should leave to the guys over at qanon anonymous

288
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,807
My favorite ever convince

289
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Salix

290
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,391
And that is the idea that Steve does psyops

291
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,695
But he isn't doing them against

292
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
Be good and Noble people who listen

293
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
We had

294
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,471
A lot of folks here because of the position

295
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
You should trust me

296
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
I don't

297
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,895
But look at what he's told us over the years

298
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,671
George W Bush's involved in 911 in Uno

299
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071
Advising them to run Jeb Bush

300
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,655
Just set Jeb Bush up so they can

301
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,263
Please clap

302
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:24,639
And he's not doing it to this broadcast

303
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
B+

304
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,735
Patriotic

305
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,927
Level

306
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
But

307
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,255
What he's saying is true and has been listened to

308
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,607
Tennis broadcast is a format for that to happen

309
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
That's very sad

310
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
Yeah that's not good

311
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
It's always real sad

312
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,287
I'm so looking over the period of time that we have various stretches

313
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,615
Is the time it's hard not to get the impression that a lot of

314
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
Gotten

315
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,687
And that have gotten them in the most trouble

316
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Trace back to school

317
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:06,111
Steve earliest appearances on Alex's show claiming the 9/11 was a false flag

318
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
Create the legitimate

319
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,999
Analysis content it wouldn't have been there without a purported expert Insider back

320
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
I can come up

321
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,095
Without being on the Vanguard of the 9/11 conspiracy movement

322
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
Never been in the position to

323
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
Become what he later became

324
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,007
At least some of that credit for elevating Alex above the level of

325
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,311
Just another weirdo yelling about s***

326
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
Was getting Steve pieczenik

327
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,895
To say on-air that 9/11 was fake

328
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
In 2000

329
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,479
That is a massively important

330
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Piece of Alex's

331
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
Projector

332
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Unfortunately

333
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
Their relationship soured in 2017

334
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,439
Ultimately breaching its breaking point on October 5th

335
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,791
Want to call her ask Alex his thoughts about the Las Vegas shooting

336
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
Didn't happen

337
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
They well

338
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,447
I mean according to Steve Burton

339
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,055
Caller and here is Desert

340
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
Response

341
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
Call Brenda Georgia

342
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
And talk to Paul

343
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,199
Thanks for calling around here worldwide

344
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,623
I just want to bring up a point

345
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
That came on yesterday on

346
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,023
David Knight show inside this whole thing didn't happen

347
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Are you aware of that

348
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
Yeah I think it's Preposterous I watch the wrong foot

349
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:38,271
It was almost like a distant formation campaign is he still working for the CIA I mean this whole thing

350
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
Deep state

351
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
Do to provoke a response

352
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
Middle America

353
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,535
Turn on Schaefer said

354
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
Just like Colonel shavers

355
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,423
The target is the motive and the top psychiatrist everybody else of course

356
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,471
So Alex

357
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Steven 27

358
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,847
Emptiness is working for the CIA

359
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:09,247
And he promised me

360
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
Turns out

361
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,647
Turtles of ambiguity

362
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,256
Videos of Sandy Hook actually happened

363
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
Alex wants to believe that Bernie was a biopic

364
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Against Hillary

365
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
Because that seems fun

366
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,472
Auntie wants to believe that it's good guy Patriots pies

367
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,776
Install Trump as president

368
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,640
Las Vegas

369
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
That's just

370
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Too much

371
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,272
Alex is already starting at that point to get blowback about his Sandy Hook coverage

372
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,064
And if you said that this shooting didn't happen

373
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
He had every reason to know that he was

374
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,696
Tacitly telling his audience that a number of people were crisis

375
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
That Route 91 Harvest Festival

376
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,816
Count of over 20,000

377
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
On the day of the shooting

378
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
That's a ridiculous amount of people

379
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,168
Encourage your audience

380
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
Potentially harass

381
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,824
Plus there's a high likelihood that there were multiple Alex Jones listeners at that Country Music Festival

382
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
So Alex would want to alienate them

383
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
Some sort of

384
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,480
I don't know what you even call it but like you would be disrespecting

385
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,784
Brick turning

386
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
Yeah yeah yeah

387
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
I don't know removing the whip

388
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,648
To put it in Breck

389
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
But

390
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:30,656
And so Alex would probably running a Alex and his audience

391
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,776
Of course that raises the question of what else was Steve manipulating Alex about

392
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,080
It would be terribly naive to imagine

393
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
Steve was straight-up with Alex about everything

394
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,968
Extended 2017 just decided start

395
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:50,368
Oculist

396
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,768
That's the worst example is a little bit above

397
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
He's more of a special attraction

398
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
She's just big

399
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
It is not good guy bad guy

400
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
Gigantic

401
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,800
Brick wall

402
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,920
Look at all the available information

403
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
We're going to discuss

404
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
If you're looking for definite answers

405
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
I don't know too many of those

406
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:24,416
Steve is way too complicated guy with way too long of a trail for me to ever pretend that I can

407
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,000
Definitively tell you what he's up to or why he does what he does

408
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
I can't help you

409
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,072
It's confusing

410
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
I don't know what he

411
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
You know it the thing about his

412
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Argument for why

413
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
Somehow it is

414
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
It's literally the only

415
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,640
Impossible arguments that could

416
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
See the most Plaza

417
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
Well

418
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,320
Trump's crazy he wants the biggest and bag biggest of everything

419
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,880
So if he was going to orchestrate

420
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,888
Well it's a big is a piece of relatable like psychology of what we know of his narcissism

421
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,936
But it relies on

422
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
Just the weakest Foundation

423
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
Because

424
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,360
He's trying to get you to buy into the narcissism angle and then

425
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,176
Not not realize it what else you're

426
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,992
Buying with it

427
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
All I can do

428
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
Through what's known about

429
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,208
And see if it matches the character that we've come to know

430
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
The wacky

431
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,048
Frankie Gaston Alex's Joe doesn't like Batman

432
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
So

433
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Let's jump in Jordan

434
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
That was my

435
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
Introduction

436
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,520
December 7th 1943

437
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,896
The second anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor

438
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
I'm not sure

439
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
Hayward Baker

440
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:58,624
Sure I guess everything is f****** face

441
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Gone

442
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,440
He was born in Havana Cuba

443
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,048
The Jewish Refugee parents who'd left their homes and you're up as World War

444
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
Kick him out

445
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,984
Right

446
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,592
Grants for some years then made the other way to New York City when he was 8 years old

447
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,176
According to his bio Steve went to Cornell and received his bachelor's

448
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,480
Degree in pre-med in Psychology in 19

449
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Before

450
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,088
Then proceeded to get his medical degree at Cornell as well

451
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,744
You went on to do his residency at Harvard Medical School and simultaneously pursued a PhD in international relations

452
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
At MIT

453
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
Okay

454
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,584
This timeline as always

455
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
Confused me a little

456
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,144
If you assumed

457
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
He finished his undergrad work in 19

458
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
64

459
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,008
Tell me a sumption would be that he

460
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,592
Probably complete his MD at Cornell probably in nineteen

461
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
68

462
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,968
Generally just four years of med school

463
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,504
General you need at least

464
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
To complete

465
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
3 years of

466
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
Before you're eligible for a medical life

467
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
But that's at the low end of

468
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
The Spectrum

469
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:08,768
So the earliest possible time I could see him finishing up his Harvard rotation nineteen

470
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
21

471
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:14,656
That seems almost impossible though considering

472
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
Be at MIT

473
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
Don't be almost

474
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
Human workload

475
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
No

476
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,432
Possible

477
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
Possible

478
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,504
Pretty high standard

479
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
All the laws

480
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,840
IMDb

481
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
PHD programs

482
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
Can take between

483
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
28 years.

484
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:54,080
Complete couldn't be with Steve

485
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,920
International psych Warfare program

486
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,528
R160 to me as kind of

487
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Fishy

488
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,368
Is it Steve entered the state department in 1974

489
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,744
And it seems unlikely that he would have been able to complete all of that coursework and residency in the time

490
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
For that

491
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,328
It's not impossible but if you did pull that off

492
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
He's basically super

493
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
When you add the Steve

494
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:23,520
Also claims to reach the rank of 06 in military become almost

495
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
Possible to imagine

496
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,872
Like generally takes twenty years of endless

497
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
Meant to reach the rank of OC

498
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
They're definitely variables that can make me

499
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,528
Things go quicker or slower but from everything I've read 20

500
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,832
Seems like a pretty average tenure of someone when they reached

501
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
A track

502
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,928
Listed on his 18th birthday

503
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
You have to redo that rank

504
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,512
Quicker than average

505
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,424
In order to reach that rank

506
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,824
MD and PhD from multiple University

507
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,920
Speed record

508
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
Is either

509
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
A liar

510
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
The most

511
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,296
Brilliant

512
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,344
Like I have to keep stressing

513
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm not

514
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:16,256
13 years

515
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,584
All the information that's available about this stuff comes directly from

516
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
No idea how much of it

517
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Believe

518
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,240
If any of it could be substantiated I will gladly tip my hat to hizon

519
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,592
Impressive early career but for now I view it with a healthy level of Sceptre

520
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
Battlefield promotion

521
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
What do you mean

522
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,320
He was in action

523
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:45,696
I don't think you can get all the way up there.

524
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
There is a

525
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,536
Consideration to of like if you're a doctor

526
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:54,912
And you join apparently you can skip a rancor to help

527
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Steve

528
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,240
Describes his earlier years

529
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,264
Tala

530
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
And this part of his

531
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,848
Career when he made his first appearance on Alex's

532
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
To show it to thousand

533
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
2

534
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,944
Quote I was a very young 06

535
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:13,088
I then went on to my training and Psychiatry at the same time at Harvard

536
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,648
At the same time I got my PhD from MIT

537
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,928
International relations

538
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,232
That makes things a little more

539
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,144
Because Steve is clearly saying that you reach 06 at the age of 32

540
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,680
PHD programs

541
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,776
Got his undergrad work and MD Cornell out-of-the-way

542
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,360
Beginning the second part of his doctoral track

543
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
832

544
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
Unfortunately

545
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:44,320
That means that he would have to be at the state department while he's a resident at Harvard and studying at MIT

546
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,392
Because he would have been 32 in 1974

547
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,696
The savior he supposed to have joined up with the state

548
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,488
Alright

549
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Just

550
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,608
Absolutely

551
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,400
He was just a consultant

552
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
Secretariat

553
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,104
Department

554
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,664
Completed his residency and got a PhD

555
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,992
If you believe his version of the story based on the age

556
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,296
He clearly is saying

557
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,928
What's up

558
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,024
Automatically start of hire at

559
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
The state

560
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,912
Then deputy

561
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Consultant

562
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:36,544
Yeah I don't know I don't know

563
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,104
Consideration

564
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,248
Nearly even on my radar

565
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,296
I'm tired but

566
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
I stress

567
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
This is all part

568
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
Certainly

569
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,208
But if I find hard to believe

570
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,512
Something feels off

571
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:01,376
I'd be happy to Steve would be willing to produce his Collegiate transcripts and service record

572
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:06,496
For having probably one of the most impressive Scholastic and Military careers

573
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
Absolute

574
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,360
I would imagine I achieve these things

575
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,176
I would f****** publish all of my s***

576
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,760
Yeah I would I be like oh yeah oh yeah

577
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,832
Here's a terramite degrees here's all the

578
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,416
The classes absolutely

579
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,048
Would be a relative

580
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Lifetime

581
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,424
It's not just the fact that he hasn't published his transcript

582
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:42,080
Means that they are not real they know like that that would be kind of faulty of me to accuse

583
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
Psychologically

584
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,408
I would do that

585
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
What's a good student

586
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
If you read any bio

587
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,184
What are the things that you notice is that they're all pretty much

588
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,024
Pretty much the same lines they all copy and paste

589
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,096
A lot of the stuff that you find biking is Wikipedia page

590
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
Taken directly from his bio

591
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
Which he has on his website

592
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
Which I don't recommend people go to cuz

593
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
If you Google it

594
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
It gives you a warning this site might be hacked of course of course of course

595
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,712
Do all of this without going to his website

596
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,760
Dennis Martin

597
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,088
But you'll find if you look at all this bios

598
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,880
He has been credited with devising

599
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
Successful negotiating strategies and tactics

600
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,232
Used in several high-profile hop

601
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Situation

602
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Including the night

603
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
76

604
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,120
TWA flight 355 hostage situation

605
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
And the 19

606
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
77 kidnapping

607
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
The stone of sniper

608
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,824
So these are

609
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
He created subtract

610
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Right

611
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:55,040
Gotcha now he was only a consultant at the state department before 1976

612
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
55

613
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,112
355

614
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,648
Situation

615
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
So I guess in that time to years

616
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Divisive

617
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,304
Yeah no that one's that one

618
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
Has anybody written

619
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,400
Well actually obviously

620
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
Nobody is written

621
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:11,936
The biography of

622
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:19,360
Not that I am aware of no

623
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
Murphy you would just be reading

624
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Get to me

625
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:27,040
Questioning everything yeah

626
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,600
This might be as close as we're going to get to a biography

627
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,696
Lying about the the

628
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
He's credited with device

629
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
If that gets in his bio

630
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,888
And that's taken directly from an article in the LA Times

631
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
Written by Robert

632
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
Heat off

633
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,728
Top doesn't say who credited

634
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
Did Steve as creating these things

635
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:52,384
And if you read the article Stevens the only source cited and the only person quoted about any

636
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
This seems important

637
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,504
Because the articles about Steve's involvement in the dissociation

638
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
Free kidnap Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro

639
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,392
And I know in that article he is not being entirely honest

640
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
What about the situation

641
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,440
That he was involved it

642
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
I'll get you later

643
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:11,072
But it's the only source in that article

644
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
To some extent

645
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
Makes me question if

646
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
That's where all the things

647
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,264
Site his bio are site that

648
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Jailhouse Inn

649
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,456
You're getting paid a lot of money to save

650
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
This guy didn't murder

651
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
I don't know

652
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,832
Self-aggrandizing

653
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:38,464
I look at it more is the same way that Alex pays people to write articles that have been report

654
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,048
Reporter is clearly talking to

655
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
Steve

656
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:48,960
Steve tells him things in this article in the LA times and then Steve uses blurbs from it for his bio

657
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,520
It's nothing that I say

658
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,200
Roberts wrote articles by Steve

659
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
That are the primary source

660
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
Purses for almost every element of Steve

661
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
Eve's Bayou

662
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,856
There are other elements but they also come from other articles that

663
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,904
Yeah

664
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
It's a good thing

665
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Robert

666
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:21,728
Too obvious is completely unrelated a year prior to him writing these two articles

667
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,056
Steve pieczenik Robert top was the Moscow bureau chief

668
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
For the LA Times

669
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,688
And he was detained by the KGB on suspicion of being a spy

670
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,320
Completely unrelated

671
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,392
If I wanted to make a conspiracy out of this

672
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:43,232
Seems like literally everything every part of

673
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
Steve's life

674
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
Is somewhat

675
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Like there's

676
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
Some elements of life

677
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,912
F*** is actually going on

678
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:54,240
I don't know as much as it is like

679
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,032
Maybe pretend like intentionally

680
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
Cloudy

681
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,896
Restart to look at the specific

682
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,712
That are mentioned as the ones that relied on Steve strategy

683
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,272
Hey consider them from a hostage negotiation

684
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,040
Standpoint

685
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:12,672
First there's a case of the hijacking of TWA flight 355 back on September 10th 1970

686
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:17,792
The plane taking off at LaGuardia side passengers claimed to have a bomb hijack this

687
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,424
The bomb was fake and hijacking was mostly in extreme by Croatian Rebel

688
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
Receipt

689
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
Engine for their cause of gaining independence from Yugoslavia

690
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,312
That was also

691
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
Sponsored by Coca-Cola

692
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
So that was a big

693
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:37,760
Big promotional thing

694
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,600
They had no bomb and this wasn't a normal terrorists hijacking

695
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,928
A man who was on the plane related experience to the Atlantic

696
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,232
Quotes

697
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,536
We are going to pass out papers for you to read

698
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Read them please

699
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
You should not worry

700
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,632
We have no intention of killing anybody

701
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,704
All we want is for our declaration to be published in the American News

702
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
Papers

703
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
We're not asked

704
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
A difficult thing

705
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,104
We want the world to recognize the Injustice is against our people

706
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
The people of Croatia

707
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,968
After that he said the mood became almost social on the plane

708
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,248
Even with the hijack

709
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,296
He describes it as friendly

710
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:15,392
At a certain point a passenger's engaged with one of the hijackers in a conversation

711
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,208
And argues with him about their political beliefs

712
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,744
Which is crazy

713
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Fun

714
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,608
It's insane that is a picture that's painted by this guy in the Atlantic

715
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,960
That's crazy terrifying but at the same time all so surreal.

716
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,264
You know the first-person account of people there

717
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,568
Feels

718
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,640
Like friendly ish

719
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,200
Why is it

720
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,760
Pretty much convinced you probably going to die

721
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,344
Whiplash

722
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,928
We say we're hijacking this playing and then giving you homework

723
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
You be like Jesus

724
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
Love you frustrating

725
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
You know you're up there

726
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
Terrifying

727
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,776
At one of the stops the hijackers decided to let 30 people

728
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:09,152
They're 25 children and elderly and infirm people that they released and then they asked the rest of

729
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,712
The people if any of them thought they should be allowed to leave

730
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
Because of an illness

731
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,016
Or another problem

732
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,088
They let one woman go because she was on her way to get married

733
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,952
Many passengers began to identify with the hijackers which many people have pointed out as a

734
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
The classic case of Stockholm Syndrome

735
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
Named after Stockholm Europe

736
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,352
It is a discussion of other hostage situation

737
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,192
Steve has said a good policy is quote no Ransom note

738
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
Confessions no negotiation

739
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,544
Which is exactly the opposite of what resolved

740
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
The TWA

741
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
355

742
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Situation

743
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,688
Everyone after they got exactly what they wanted

744
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,992
Namely people publishing their political message

745
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,832
The strategy employed

746
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:53,440
Beliefs nor does it match the techniques used in situations he's been directly involved in

747
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,256
And yet every single bio credits his Innovations

748
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
For resolving this

749
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,864
I'm getting never specify what Innovations they mean

750
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,400
Confined very curious

751
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
Giveaway

752
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,008
There's stuff in the pay

753
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,360
That was a pretty bro

754
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,712
It does seem so far that the strategies we talked about 4

755
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
Hostage

756
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
Have not been very

757
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,112
You know I'm saying not really

758
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,136
If you can call that is

759
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,816
I don't know Universal strategy

760
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
That's a good

761
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,912
He decided to

762
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
Situation

763
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
It's a good open

764
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
Bargaining

765
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,032
You show strength

766
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
Apps

767
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
Say that a good strategy

768
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,968
It's your willingness to negotiate because that buys you time

769
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,296
And that offers the possibility that the people who

770
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
Just might screw up

771
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
Escalade

772
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:59,744
Would you consider the second

773
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,792
Steve's methods are said to a result

774
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,888
That's the December 1977 kidnapping of achileas

775
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,168
Cipriano

776
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
The son of the president

777
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Cypress

778
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,288
The kidnappers demanded the release of 25 prisoners

779
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,616
They didn't go they wanted they were going to send the president to Sun

780
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,920
Ultimately negotiation

781
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,480
A prisoner

782
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,784
Like 225 a task for

783
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,832
But them go Shooters did make concession

784
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,904
The kidnappers were allowed safe passage out of the country

785
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
In exchange for a Killian

786
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,304
These are situations are completely different approaches were taken too hot

787
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
Did you negotiate

788
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,120
And neither of the match with the way that

789
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
Operate

790
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
Based on its

791
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,240
Senses we definitely know about that he was directly involved in

792
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
It's it isn't like

793
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,920
Like hostages were never taken before 1974 when Steve supposedly after the department

794
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
He's credited with

795
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,528
Designing the methods used to resolve

796
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,808
Actually result

797
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Pretty standard

798
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,112
That long predates

799
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
8 Steves involvement is at

800
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
His employment

801
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
I don't know what it is

802
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,024
Without anybody ever given more

803
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,352
I don't know what they're talkin about

804
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Seemed to make sense

805
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
Just from

806
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
Perspective

807
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
Okay

808
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,752
New Theory

809
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
New Theory

810
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
Steve pieczenik

811
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
Is d.b. Cooper

812
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,176
Any got hired by the state department

813
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,456
In a cat

814
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,296
You can kind of scenario like the only way to catch

815
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
He's with the hijack

816
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,368
You know I'm saying

817
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,952
I like that and then you can make up.

818
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,512
Hijacking one though

819
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
You just got up for it

820
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,424
Instances of real-life

821
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
But I can confirm

822
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,008
Steve was definitely at least somewhat involved

823
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Great

824
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:56,735
No you're thinking you're looking up that means I know that most of them people.

825
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,759
I don't know that

826
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,879
Isn't a great strategy

827
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
Playing

828
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
Hijacking

829
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
Concocted

830
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,303
Leave a real bomb in New York

831
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
Stop.

832
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,751
At least one person

833
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
T.i. Steve also is

834
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
Been involved in

835
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
Disco people

836
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,455
One of these situations was the March 9th

837
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,479
77 Hosta

838
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,759
Situation in Washington

839
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,575
A group of hanafi Muslims

840
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
A radical group

841
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,903
It's splintered away from the Nation of Islam

842
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,695
Took over three buildings in

843
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,279
The b'nai b'rith center the Islamic Center of Washington in

844
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,351
The leader of the group come on Scala

845
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,887
Made a number of Demands

846
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,471
Four of his children have been murdered in 19/7

847
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,311
33 and he was demanding that the men who who are incarcerated for that crime

848
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,359
As well as the murderer of Malcolm X

849
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,895
Text be handed over to them so they can

850
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
I could deal with that

851
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,503
Guys

852
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,063
I don't know if you want to be living out some

853
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:08,415
Deadwood s*** right there like where the Bob bring out the

854
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,695
Converter

855
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,631
No.

856
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,447
However some of the other demands were met

857
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:26,335
41 Carlos wanted

858
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,383
Stemming from his disruption of the trial of

859
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,919
The Killers he wanted hand it over

860
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
Further he want it

861
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
You want

862
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,599
750

863
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:44,255
Okay sure you get it further he wanted the upcoming premiere of the film Muhammad messenger of God cancer

864
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
Snctm

865
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Sacrilegious

866
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,375
Write any one of the new Star Wars movie

867
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,983
In Jeffrey David Simon

868
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,055
The book the terrorist America's experience of terrorism

869
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,335
The Avengers discuss

870
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,151
And according to his quotes

871
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,455
The incident was finally resolved with the assistance

872
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
Three Muslim diplomat

873
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,551
The ambassadors of Pakistan or Ron and

874
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
Who met with Carlos

875
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,879
And other hanafi leaders

876
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
For more than 3 hours

877
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
From the Koran

878
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,487
Appealing to their conscious

879
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
Wow

880
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Fat

881
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
As

882
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,607
0 Seafood

883
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,007
Well apparently told Alex about the incident and it's 2002

884
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,591
Entirely

885
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,127
You could get that impression

886
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
I'm not entirely sure

887
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,479
I'ma go like Alex

888
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,247
Fair

889
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,831
He describes his involvement

890
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,623
2002 debut

891
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
Appearance

892
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
Infowars

893
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:49,535
Rebuilding your held hostage by fundamentalist group called the hanafi Muslims

894
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,839
Any New Year's being manipulated

895
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:56,703
The FBI called me in and use I use the Quran to Take Over Control

896
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,031
And eventually he couldn't help but follow the orders that we gave him

897
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,055
And he eventually release

898
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
The hostages

899
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,847
It was because

900
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,967
Steve use the Quran

901
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Obviously

902
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
Magic

903
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
Thread

904
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,367
Wrote their names

905
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
To a pillow on

906
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,183
Absolute

907
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,975
This seems like a slightly different

908
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
Different version

909
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,023
The stories

910
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
The account

911
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
But I can find elsewhere

912
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,863
Does diplomat

913
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:30,751
Cereal

914
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,799
Appeal to their content

915
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
Because I can't escape the

916
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
The fact that I'm March 13th 19

917
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,223
77 article

918
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,551
In the Eugene Register-Guard does seem to confirm that

919
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,343
Was involved in a response

920
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,903
You would quote

921
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,719
And quote working side-by-side with police

922
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
Chief Maurice

923
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,255
Cullinane

924
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,071
At the same time Jeffrey David Simon

925
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
Book doesn't mention

926
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
But it does say quote

927
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,191
Also joining the negotiations

928
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:06,079
Were Us attorney for the District of Columbia oral silbert and Deputy attorney-general designee Peter Flaherty

929
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,919
The book even quotes police chief Maurice cullinane

930
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
And there's no mention

931
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,783
He mentions the head of the FBI and attorney-general being

932
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
Command Post

933
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:19,135
But everything we can learn about Steve's involvement comes from his own mouth

934
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,463
Either through his telling of the story or quotes he's provided to newspaper

935
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
I don't

936
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
But if you got

937
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
Deputies attorney attorney

938
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,703
Deputy Attorney General

939
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
Deputies

940
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,311
I'm not sure where the plan goes

941
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
And

942
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,639
SPI

943
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,431
And then you've got all these other guys

944
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Even if

945
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
He's

946
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,903
Medical doctor or International

947
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
He's still not top build

948
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:01,887
It has fever running the show and he was the one using the Quran to Rihanna

949
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
Sincerely

950
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,519
I'm not entirely sure I don't

951
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
Discount take away from

952
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,615
Like he was there and involved

953
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
Buy it

954
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,175
I don't know I think it might be

955
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,967
Specifically told all of these

956
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,295
Don't snitch

957
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
I don't know

958
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,903
What it looks like to me is

959
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Hap's

960
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
Exaggerate

961
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
Of his involved

962
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
It feels like a

963
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,815
High likelihood

964
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,887
Resign from the state

965
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,679
Department on November 7th

966
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
19 seven

967
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:40,031
Because he was upset with the handling of the Iranian hostage

968
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,615
I'm out of here

969
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
He wasn't happy that he

970
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,943
He wasn't called into resolve

971
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
The situation

972
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:54,111
Reporter Georgia Operation Center on my own after 72-hour

973
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:00,511
Does Huey have a guy who's revolutionize the entire world

974
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,535
Negotiation

975
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,327
Call Dan whenever there's a big crisis

976
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
Unfolding

977
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,655
Who's considered a genius and high-pressure situations

978
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:10,751
And no one calls him what it the big game is starting here with this a roni and Hast

979
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Did situation

980
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,543
That just doesn't

981
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
Track

982
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:18,431
If the people in the state department knew that they had the king of Hostage negotiators at their disposal

983
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,479
There's literally no reason they wouldn't use

984
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
What a potential

985
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,527
Closest hostel

986
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,807
Situation breaks out

987
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,647
I'm guessing Alex might want to write this off as the state department

988
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,927
Secretly not wanting to cry

989
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Has to be diffuse

990
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
So they keep Steve away

991
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,767
From it knowing that you

992
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,303
Beauty easily be able to set things

993
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
Straight

994
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,143
Amor real world explanation baby that they did

995
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,471
And that maybe that has something to do

996
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
With his most recent at that point

997
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,799
High-profile job

998
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,127
One of the few things we absolutely know Steve was involved

999
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,431
And that is the Boch negotiations

1000
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,735
To free the kidnapped Italian Prime Minister

1001
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,759
Aldo Moro

1002
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,575
This is one of the document

1003
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,367
Two pieces of Steve history

1004
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
Ray's okay

1005
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,207
It's legitimately

1006
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
Jim sain

1007
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
I can't wait

1008
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,303
A 19-7

1009
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:12,447
Compromise

1010
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,519
Where are they

1011
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,567
Where they would share governmental power

1012
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,591
They were going to call

1013
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,383
The Three-Fifths Compromise cuz it makes

1014
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
Santana

1015
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,991
Situation but then they heard about ours and they were like

1016
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,039
It was revolutionary stuff like it was

1017
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,599
One of the first times that communist

1018
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,135
Parties

1019
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
Involved

1020
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
The government

1021
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,791
Coincidentally

1022
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,071
The day Morrow was kidnapped

1023
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,351
He was on his way to Parlin

1024
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:43,167
Historic first voting

1025
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,447
Christian democrats

1026
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
And the Communist Party

1027
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,031
The kidnapping severely hurt the communist

1028
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,823
And put this attempt operation

1029
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:50,847
Completely honest

1030
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,175
Morrow has been kidnapped by terrorists on March 6th

1031
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
1970s

1032
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:00,831
He was ultimately held for 55 days during which time the red brigades gave him a criminal trial

1033
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,367
Found guilty

1034
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,647
Because on May 9th

1035
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
His body was found in the

1036
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
A car

1037
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,511
And everybody who is that

1038
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,535
That I can fly in

1039
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,327
Specifically points out

1040
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,375
That the car that you was found in was

1041
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,679
Equidistant from the Communist Party

1042
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
Christian Democrat headquarters

1043
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:25,407
I bet you see that written all over the place

1044
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,687
I don't know if it

1045
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
It's true but

1046
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,015
I don't know

1047
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,599
Every single

1048
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,879
Report

1049
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,463
For three weeks during this.

1050
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,255
D-Patrick was secretly working

1051
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,303
And meeting with the Italian authorities

1052
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Intelligence

1053
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:46,399
Helping craft a strategy to negotiate the release of Aldo Moro

1054
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,447
What if we said no

1055
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,495
However in April

1056
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,287
Steve left Italy and gave up

1057
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,847
Haven't decided that Morrow was the victim of a set-up

1058
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:58,943
If there wasn't anything and anyone in the government that he could really even truck

1059
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,271
Quote given the deployment of paramilitary forces

1060
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,855
Cuz I found it increasingly difficult to believe that they could not find

1061
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,135
That they had no clues

1062
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
Fallout

1063
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,439
I realize that the whole situation

1064
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
Was compromised

1065
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,095
What I suspected that was why I left early was that they didn't really care to pull Morrow out alive

1066
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,911
This is one version of the story that he's told

1067
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,239
He's just a good guy trying to get the job done but everyone else

1068
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
They were a bunch

1069
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
That's not

1070
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,503
Does he still work at the state department

1071
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:37,855
There's no indication that I have that

1072
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
I just think

1073
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Baby things

1074
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,695
Didn't go as well

1075
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Yeah

1076
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,047
Story about his involvement in the morrow Affair has changed a bit over the

1077
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,119
In 2008 a documentary was released

1078
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,167
Called the last days of Aldo Moro

1079
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,519
In the film Steve admits that the decision was made to let Morrow die

1080
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
And it made in the kidnappers

1081
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,103
The killing him was the only solution available

1082
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,431
The decision was made in the 4th week of the kidnap

1083
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
Boro's letters

1084
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,735
Became more desperate

1085
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,295
He was about to reveal States

1086
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,087
Hey

1087
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:15,999
That's that's allowed to write letters back

1088
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,023
Government

1089
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
And what have you

1090
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:22,399
And they were getting the tone.

1091
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679
So so

1092
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,239
And this is not backed up

1093
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
Correct

1094
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,055
Maldives

1095
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,383
Steve saying that the Italian government was literally like

1096
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Let's let him die

1097
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,199
You looking at me with

1098
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,735
Very pregnant eyes

1099
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,039
Well many people don't believe

1100
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,831
Which I think is a pretty healthy

1101
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:49,791
In 2014 the international business times reported the prosecutors in Rome said there's a Siri there's serious evidence

1102
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,071
Adjusting Steve pieczenik

1103
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,887
A former state department international crisis manager

1104
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,935
Participated in the murder that shocked

1105
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,775
Considering he more or less admitted as much on tapes

1106
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
6 years prior I don't think that's

1107
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,847
2 shocking over-report

1108
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:06,943
Both Steve and Italian interior Minister Francesca

1109
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,223
Costa Rica

1110
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,271
Have admitted that they released

1111
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
Allstate

1112
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,575
Attributed to the kidnap

1113
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,623
Known as Communication number 7

1114
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,927
Which Morrow was dead

1115
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,207
Though he was still alive

1116
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:18,975
In captivity

1117
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,279
Steve admitted that they did this to Gabe's

1118
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,583
The public reaction to news of morose

1119
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,375
As well as to send a message

1120
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:28,703
Switch to the red brigades care whether I lived or died

1121
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,823
Up

1122
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,151
No you can't do that

1123
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,087
So he

1124
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
Literally just

1125
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,903
It sent this message

1126
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,487
Of just like we are going to be out in front of the story

1127
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,047
We're saying he's dead so you have the option

1128
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,351
Killing him making him

1129
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
The f******

1130
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,167
Jesus those are your options

1131
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,471
And Steve

1132
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,007
This was Steve

1133
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:10,175
Hey well we don't know if it's

1134
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,455
Steve

1135
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,735
Relishing

1136
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,759
As a good idea

1137
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,575
So so this is this was not known

1138
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,695
Article comes from

1139
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:28,351
Involves the Aldo Moro kidnapping it's not public

1140
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,887
Different version of the events

1141
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,911
What happened

1142
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
So

1143
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,495
So other people are like

1144
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,079
International business times

1145
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:44,479
Later later this information came out and both of them have admitted that they

1146
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
Communication

1147
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,319
Richard part of trying to manipulate the

1148
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,671
Which probably led them to not believe that

1149
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
They had

1150
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,463
A bargaining chip

1151
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:00,095
Speaking about the red brigades trap

1152
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:03,679
We're the only thing they could do eventually was kill Aldo Moro

1153
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
Steve little

1154
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,031
Haha

1155
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,615
Steve literally says this through a psychological operation

1156
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
Asiop

1157
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,199
Steve goal was not to free Aldo Moro

1158
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:15,967
Is Goldust

1159
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
Power structure

1160
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,879
He worked to get Morrow killed

1161
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,927
Premium wouldn't be advantageous

1162
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,511
Morose letters indicated a feeling of being betrayed by his associates

1163
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,583
And they worried that if you made it out alive he would use their inaction to

1164
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,119
To save

1165
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,215
Simultaneously

1166
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,495
They couldn't take the risk

1167
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,543
Of the red brigades not killing Morrow

1168
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,335
Because if they kept him alive long enough

1169
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
Well

1170
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:47,967
His animosity toward the people who are not rescuing them could grow to the point where he might leak in

1171
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
Information of the red Brigade

1172
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,527
Hurt them politically

1173
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
Wait because you get like this

1174
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,879
Stockholm Syndrome

1175
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:55,903
Okay

1176
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,671
We're the Bad

1177
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
Seletsky

1178
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,583
I don't know I don't know I don't know how to describe it but I don't know if that's far off

1179
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,119
In order to

1180
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,143
Status quo

1181
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,167
To paraphrase

1182
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,959
Aldo Moro head

1183
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:15,871
In that documentary the last days of Aldo Moro the filmmakers talk to a couple of former members of the red

1184
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
Brigade

1185
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:21,503
Here's an excerpt of that documentary where they discuss the interrogations of Morrow which is a twerp

1186
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,527
Presents for

1187
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,855
The first voice you hear is a woman named Adriana Ferran

1188
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,439
And the second is a guy named Murray

1189
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,231
Active members

1190
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:31,999
Of the red Brigade

1191
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Still

1192
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:36,095
And meanwhile held any style in the vmsr Cheney

1193
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,423
The hostages interrogated Everyday by the red Brigade kidnap

1194
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:43,519
Convinced that the country is politically and economically enslaved

1195
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:47,615
The attempt to make him confess to Lynx exist between Italian state

1196
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,151
American National company

1197
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,855
The comrades who interrogated moral

1198
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:02,207
We're expecting him to confirm what they had imagined about the Italian today

1199
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:09,631
Existed and imperialist Multinational state

1200
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:14,751
Behind

1201
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,359
How you check daily quests

1202
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,431
Indecent

1203
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:27,039
Tomorrow talk to that reality is much more complex

1204
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,831
How to easy to decipher

1205
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,695
Multiple meno

1206
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,023
Vichy France

1207
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,303
They were being cute

1208
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,911
Companion Care

1209
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:48,543
They said the motor was deliberately not answering your questions

1210
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,359
Trying to waste your time

1211
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,199
Trying to gain some time

1212
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,527
Moreta.

1213
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,831
Our leader mobile.

1214
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,391
Couldn't get more 02 giveaway

1215
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,159
They have tomorrow

1216
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
According to him

1217
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,023
Models answers were partly true

1218
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,559
But only partially

1219
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,679
The reality was much more complex

1220
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,263
But for a brigade members incomprehensible

1221
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:24,127
Reality is much more simple

1222
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,663
There were causes

1223
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,455
Send a text

1224
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,527
Complexity the complex

1225
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063
Overlapping

1226
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,599
The contradictions

1227
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,647
We couldn't understand all that

1228
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,415
Jordan 8

1229
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:40,767
After a few days the interrogation stopped

1230
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,791
For himself

1231
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,351
You didn't seek to convince.

1232
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
Because he understood

1233
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:48,703
Did we want to kill him

1234
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:53,311
He knew that his negotiating partner was now the state

1235
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,615
And no longer the red Brigade

1236
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
So

1237
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,455
Who do these red Brigade peoples.

1238
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:06,623
Militant anti-government Rebels who believe in a one world government who refuse to accept

1239
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:11,743
I don't know cuz it sounds like a guy with your podcast about

1240
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,023
Yeah I was

1241
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,559
I was just hearing that.

1242
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,095
Just make it like it's not

1243
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
That's the way of it

1244
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,143
Do not try and

1245
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
Unexplained

1246
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,703
Situation

1247
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,727
2 people who are alive

1248
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,031
How is everything we want

1249
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,847
Do not tell us the truth

1250
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,871
Yeah

1251
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:32,991
Confirm confirm for us all of our paranoid fantasies by the world

1252
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,319
That are based on oversimplifications in black and white

1253
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,111
It's not like that you got under

1254
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
XYZ

1255
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:45,279
Call God

1256
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:54,751
Petersburg times from April 21st 1978

1257
00:59:55,007 --> 01:00:00,895
Situation worked out well I can't borrow myself because the government didn't have to resort to extreme actions

1258
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,431
Which is a thought would threaten

1259
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,967
The credibility and viability of

1260
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,271
Of course like I said

1261
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,807
In 1978 when he

1262
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,087
He's talking to this newspaper

1263
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,367
He was pretending

1264
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,671
He and Christina had sent out fake

1265
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,207
Communication numbers

1266
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:21,119
Man that's f***** up supposed to happen in real life like that's a Bourne Identity

1267
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,143
Movie plot right

1268
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,935
Stupid

1269
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,775
From a larger Force

1270
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,543
Perspective

1271
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,335
Valdemoro probably wasn't

1272
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,639
If you're a hostage negotiator

1273
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:36,991
And you're dealing your Sentinel by the state department at Jimmy Carter's behalf

1274
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,039
To go and try and resolve

1275
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:43,903
Situation where a head of state of an Allied country has been kidnapped by rebels

1276
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,767
Yeah you don't necessarily want to come out of that with a dead prime minister in the trunk of a car

1277
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,815
It's not a great thing

1278
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,607
So my feeling on it

1279
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,631
It is possible

1280
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,423
The Deep

1281
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
Punted on this

1282
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,471
Just screwed up

1283
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,751
Yeah and then

1284
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,567
Wasn't involved in the Iranian hostage crisis

1285
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,591
Because

1286
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,895
He had just been coming off this terrible

1287
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:10,527
Minister got assassinated

1288
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,087
Jimmy Carter is like hey

1289
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,623
Let's go save

1290
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,183
It let's send some people to help save the prime minister

1291
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,231
At Super chaneques like

1292
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:19,999
Okay I'm going to go

1293
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:24,607
No no you don't understand

1294
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,911
We want to go save his life

1295
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,935
Vaginas

1296
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:33,823
Really loudly right now did I say that

1297
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,967
Steve has a lot of quotes also from his past about like being a rogue and stuff like that until like

1298
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,271
Did

1299
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,367
I got a f****** crazy idea here at me of this work

1300
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,463
What what is but he's like a punk

1301
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,487
Hostage

1302
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:55,327
What are cool and underground than negotiating

1303
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:59,935
The opposite of what you're supposed

1304
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,471
Talking about his life

1305
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,287
What if we asked you to kill him

1306
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,055
Yeah

1307
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:08,127
The other big piece of Steve's resume

1308
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,919
That's always comes up

1309
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,455
Is the Camp David Accords

1310
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,015
He is always cited as being

1311
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,807
Involved in the Camp David Accords

1312
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,623
Which took place in September 1970

1313
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:22,975
Jimmy Carter brought Israeli Prime Minister Menachem bagin and Egypt

1314
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,767
President Anwar Sadat

1315
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
Card card

1316
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
What if we

1317
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:36,287
Without exception is repeated quote instrumental

1318
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,591
And that's interesting

1319
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,639
It seems entirely likely that

1320
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,199
It was there at the time

1321
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:46,527
It's in between the moro Affair and his resignation in 90

1322
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:50,623
279 as a state department

1323
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,439
The problem comes in when you try to Define what the word

1324
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
Instrumental

1325
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:58,047
Because no Source I can find that doesn't traced directly back to

1326
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,887
Credited with being instrumental in the Accords

1327
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,167
The door behind him when he

1328
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,703
Left the room in the doors are locked from the

1329
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:11,103
The outside able to leave without.

1330
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,455
Like a lot of the sources on the Camp David Accords

1331
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:22,111
Primary goal is not letting him leave without you

1332
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
Instrumental

1333
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,927
I'm not saying you wasn't there

1334
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,951
I'm perfectly willing

1335
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,975
To believe that he was

1336
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,279
But I don't know if I trust his depiction of

1337
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,327
Every other source I can find

1338
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,863
Things to put far more

1339
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,911
Sessanta big new brzezinski's involve

1340
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,751
He's a major player in negotiation

1341
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,823
Even down to that famous picture of him playing chess

1342
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,103
Against Menachem bagin

1343
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,431
Yeah one of one of those people is historical

1344
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,199
Figure

1345
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,991
The other one

1346
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,271
Is the big new Brazil

1347
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,575
Who even knows who that f****** guy is

1348
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,855
Sure

1349
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,879
Yeah man

1350
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:58,719
Cbp's in there right it seems strange

1351
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,511
Did Steve did all this stuff

1352
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,535
When

1353
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,583
Everybody else agrees that it

1354
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,471
I don't know though it could be a grand conspiracy to Moline Steve can make sure that he is

1355
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,751
His brand of roguish

1356
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:14,335
Hostage negotiation never takes over I don't know

1357
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:18,175
Only thing that I could say is that

1358
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:23,807
Obviously the guy at that you know if you're in a

1359
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,343
Chris Arreola

1360
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,111
Something along those

1361
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Sure

1362
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
Generally

1363
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,463
Speaking

1364
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,767
And the the face gets all the

1365
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,703
Usually those guys are not listening to

1366
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,727
Steve pieczenik

1367
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
Deputy assistant

1368
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,543
Through the secretary

1369
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,223
Under the various

1370
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:55,551
Assistant secretaries of State there a lot of those

1371
01:04:55,807 --> 01:05:01,951
And so like yeah it's either cool position to be in and I've never knock somebody for reaching that level of a

1372
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,767
Achievement but it's also easy to

1373
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,839
Say that you're doing a lot more than you are

1374
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,399
Incredibly difficult

1375
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,703
Definitely wasn't a position

1376
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,727
From night

1377
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:16,031
1874 when he was a consultant

1378
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,311
The 1976

1379
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,103
When he became a deputy assist

1380
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,127
Secretary of State

1381
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,199
Do 1979 when he quit over there on up

1382
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,759
I know that to be true

1383
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,527
From

1384
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,807
Contemporary report

1385
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:28,831
From

1386
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:32,671
Definitive things you can trace down he was in that role

1387
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,743
According to Steve when he's on Alex's show

1388
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,023
According to his bio

1389
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,071
He took a little time off

1390
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,887
And then returned and served under Reagan and

1391
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
Bush Senior

1392
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
Gotcha

1393
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,959
Is bio

1394
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,239
Orchestrated 9/11

1395
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,519
Resume

1396
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,823
His bio consistently says that

1397
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,151
You worked under four or five Administration

1398
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:56,735
If they don't really get the story straight

1399
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,503
No

1400
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,599
Okay that's an issue

1401
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,927
There's an inconsistency of whether it's four or five Administration

1402
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,487
Maybe they're just not taking into account Ford

1403
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:10,047
I have no idea what

1404
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,839
The situation is but there's a lack of

1405
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,119
Clarity there

1406
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,447
We will get into the early 80s

1407
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,007
After the Iranian hostage crisis

1408
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,543
And Steve's resignation

1409
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,359
Department

1410
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:26,943
CBS and ABC talking to a number of newspapers also

1411
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,015
He's offering his expert opinion on how things are going with us

1412
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,671
In all instances he's credited as a psychiatrist Hellboy

1413
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:40,511
In all of these appearances all of these times he's in the newspapers

1414
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,047
He's credited as a psychiatrist

1415
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,839
And former member of the

1416
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
Then

1417
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
On February 17th

1418
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
1981

1419
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,519
Steve formally accuses the state department

1420
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,311
The attack

1421
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,615
Vic killed US ambassador to Afghanistan

1422
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,639
Adolph dubs

1423
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,967
Kidnapped by militants

1424
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,759
And as The Story Goes

1425
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
The US

1426
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,807
Patience and negotiation

1427
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,391
Whereas the Afghanistan government took a more rash Prout

1428
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,671
And attacks the militant

1429
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,207
Would you like to the ambassadors

1430
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,511
There was tremendous Fallout 4

1431
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
Incident

1432
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,071
As the US began to

1433
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
Drastically

1434
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,655
Got back for it

1435
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:24,031
Steve claims he was in the room when permission was given for the Afghan forces

1436
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
Has to attack

1437
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,847
But no evidence has ever been produced

1438
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,871
Tobacco claim

1439
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,943
He said he knows the name of the official gave permission

1440
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,247
Official

1441
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:39,647
Because he doesn't want the case to become an indictment of just one person but the focus the attention on the US anti-terrorist

1442
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:44,255
This is shockingly similar to what he told Alex Jones about 911

1443
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:48,863
Thing he knows the names of generals who were involved in the false flag but wouldn't reveal them

1444
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:53,215
Seems like a pattern yeah I would also Point YouTube

1445
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,519
Supervisor

1446
01:07:55,775 --> 01:08:00,895
A mighty but unfortunately

1447
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:04,223
According to the United press

1448
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:04,991
An article

1449
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,319
Spokesman William dice

1450
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:12,415
Said officials involved

1451
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,231
Officials involved in the dubs kidnapping head

1452
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,023
Consulted and Communications logs

1453
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,791
Review

1454
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,863
And then he said the allegations by pechenik

1455
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,911
All concerned stress

1456
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,935
The need for restraint

1457
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,983
As well as

1458
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:30,335
It strains credulity for me to imagine that

1459
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,407
Steve pieczenik could be involved in the bungled morrow negotiate

1460
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:36,223
Quit over not being involved in the Iranian hostage

1461
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:36,991
Crisis

1462
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,295
Then take to the media to accuse the state

1463
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:41,599
Being complicit in the murder of an ambassador

1464
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,135
Then get his job back at

1465
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,183
That feels

1466
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,743
It feels like this kind of attack

1467
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,791
Making public accusations like this

1468
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:56,191
Will probably disqualify someone from getting a sensitive job back

1469
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,263
State Department jobs

1470
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:05,919
I think you'll be even more disqualify

1471
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,223
How to run disinformation campaign

1472
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,247
On your own

1473
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,551
I guess that would be

1474
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,599
That'll be an interesting

1475
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:19,999
Freelance resume act like

1476
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,279
Do people play video games

1477
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:27,935
Last Starfighter

1478
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,959
His way to the secret

1479
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,239
I don't know about that

1480
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,567
I mean I don't know about that

1481
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:40,223
In articles in the New York Times from 1980 to 1985

1482
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,015
Has consistently credited

1483
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,551
As a former member of

1484
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,599
The state department

1485
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:51,487
Under Reagan and Bush Senior

1486
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,047
There's no indication from contemporary sources

1487
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:58,655
Betty ever worked in the government in official capacity passed his resignation in 90

1488
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
279

1489
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
And that wouldn't

1490
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,751
Make total sense based on his behavior in his action

1491
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
Who is involved in wedding

1492
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,383
Department stuff

1493
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,199
And I don't give a good goddamn

1494
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:17,599
How good Steve is at his job and publicly in newspapers and media accuses us of

1495
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:20,671
What can I give a murder of an ambassador

1496
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,975
That he's not getting credentials again

1497
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,255
Yeah

1498
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,559
Yeah cuz he would have mean

1499
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,095
Was still in the

1500
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
Maybe

1501
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
2

1502
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:35,263
To your insulation of information

1503
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:41,151
If you shown himself willing so yeah like if this is true this is disqualifying

1504
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:46,271
But I'm sure that in real life

1505
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
The state

1506
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:51,647
Mandela effect

1507
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:58,047
Define resources on whether or not he was a joke

1508
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Fights

1509
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,399
It's weird quick question

1510
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,447
Why are so many people

1511
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,471
Quoting him

1512
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,519
Articles

1513
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,919
I think so

1514
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,967
Seems to have a tendency

1515
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,527
Need to have someone who's this go to purse

1516
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,319
Right right right

1517
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:23,391
Talk for a minute there's a couple articles

1518
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,671
Nike printed about Steve

1519
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,207
And then that Georgiana

1520
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,231
Gayer

1521
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:30,559
She seems to be someone who Steve went to over and over and over

1522
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:35,679
She's like wrote stuff about how he's a brilliant mind

1523
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,495
I don't know if there's anything suspicious

1524
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,775
Just about anybody

1525
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,543
People likes

1526
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,615
Steve like to have a reliable

1527
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
Place where they can

1528
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,151
Can funnel

1529
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:48,479
And get positive number these stories are written

1530
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,807
Every reason

1531
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,831
To go to a cop

1532
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,879
Like in the late 70s

1533
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,159
There's every reason

1534
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,207
To treat him like somebody who

1535
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:01,535
Like he's a rising star it Department

1536
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,815
He's involved

1537
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,631
Electric standoff

1538
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,679
You could paint that is like a Big Sur

1539
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,543
So I see the process being like

1540
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,823
Obviously

1541
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,871
But as time goes on

1542
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
I think there's much less

1543
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,431
Useful idiot

1544
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,503
In a certain until Alex comes along

1545
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
Idiot

1546
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:28,671
Useful of all seem to fit the pattern that he has of a couple of these journalists

1547
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,487
Goes back to the well with

1548
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,535
Ulta

1549
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:37,887
That helps

1550
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,727
Realities of him

1551
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,751
Trying to go back to

1552
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,775
To the state department

1553
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,567
Or whatever I have no idea

1554
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,383
And honestly it would be impossible for me to ever really get to

1555
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:52,223
These are secretive and clandestine Waters after all

1556
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,319
So how would it be there but everything I could bring to the table by saying like

1557
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,111
Steve is working for the government

1558
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:07,071
Address anything like that existence of space

1559
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:14,239
But I can't tell you for all the sources that are available from the late 70s to early 90s bread

1560
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,031
Until 1979

1561
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,847
Accredited In Articles as a current deputy

1562
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
Secretary of

1563
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:20,895
And after

1564
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,431
Easy privately

1565
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
Psychiatrist

1566
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,735
Who used to work in Fab

1567
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:31,135
Until I see some proof to the contrary there's no reason for me to believe he was ever in the game past 19-7

1568
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,439
Everything else could easily

1569
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,207
Just be

1570
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,767
Him doing his own thing

1571
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,583
To go from

1572
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,863
Negotiating

1573
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,399
The murder of a

1574
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,959
To your own

1575
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
Private

1576
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
Psychiatric

1577
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,311
Would that be so weird to

1578
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,103
Difference in

1579
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,127
In status

1580
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,919
Stature

1581
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,455
Do you still like

1582
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,991
That really really big

1583
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:03,647
Pretty well respected in our culture well-respected most of them

1584
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,671
I've never killed a prime

1585
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,719
It's true it's true

1586
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,279
Clear

1587
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:15,679
Kill the Prime Minister kill

1588
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,727
Percent not handled in a way that was appropriate

1589
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,799
We get the 2,000

1590
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,359
Two and Steve pieczenik makes his first appearance

1591
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,383
On the Alex Jones Show

1592
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,919
On April 24th

1593
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,943
2002

1594
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,527
Audio of that first interview

1595
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,575
At the fantastic

1596
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,599
Fascinating.

1597
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,647
From the very beginning

1598
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,695
Steve with playing to Alex's narcy

1599
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Listen to this

1600
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,535
Exchange

1601
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
His credentials

1602
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:43,839
Alex

1603
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,119
We're talking

1604
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,399
Dr. Steve pieczenik

1605
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:49,215
And he's worked at the highest levels of psychological operations

1606
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,495
44 Administration

1607
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:53,311
You're talking about controlling Paradigm paradigm

1608
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,127
Well

1609
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:00,735
I've never used that word Paradigm but you clearly you must be a professor Alex

1610
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,015
Is that

1611
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:02,783
Rice

1612
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,087
That's flattery

1613
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,623
It's a lie

1614
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:10,463
In a March 12th 1977 article in the Saint Petersburg Times

1615
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,511
Discussing the b'nai b'rith

1616
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,303
Standoff

1617
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:20,959
This was a paradigm of unusual

1618
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:25,823
Stop it

1619
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,359
That is petty

1620
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:33,759
We already saw that he was lying as f****** teeth off I mean

1621
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,879
That is but maybe it's instinct

1622
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,927
Or maybe Steve did his homework

1623
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,279
Exactly how to ingratiate himself

1624
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:49,887
Alex brings up the Council of foreign relations

1625
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
And it really

1626
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
Skeptical way

1627
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:56,543
And Steve reassures him that the CFR is basically a rotary club

1628
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:01,919
And he's also a member of the NRA so what do you think about that I'm a member of that

1629
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:06,015
Minutes into the interview Alex's saying s*** like

1630
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:10,367
Doctors info Warriors and for administration

1631
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:13,951
Classic much of the policy the last 20 years

1632
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,999
And I'm so honored to have you on the show tonight

1633
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
So much

1634
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:23,167
Everything I know about Alex

1635
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,447
Harley against the policy

1636
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:26,495
He's received the previous 20 to 30 years

1637
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,775
And yet he is

1638
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,543
.

1639
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,823
Praising The Man He's

1640
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,871
He's credited with crashing those policies

1641
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,407
That makes no sense

1642
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,223
Hearing about the

1643
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,247
Previous journalist

1644
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
Writing

1645
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,551
Looking to see

1646
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,831
For blurbs

1647
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
Makes way more sense

1648
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,391
You would be as

1649
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,415
Is Polished in good

1650
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
Like he's already

1651
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,791
He's already home. His bulge

1652
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,839
For almost 20 years

1653
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:55,423
Get out like he's been gone to a lie at higher level

1654
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,983
Absolutely

1655
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,031
Working out at open mics

1656
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:03,103
He's been working out at those guys one-nighters

1657
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,431
Comes along he's at the height of his

1658
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,991
Easy rum

1659
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,807
Especially for someone who has

1660
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,831
Like the appearance of the

1661
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,647
Super elevator

1662
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,207
Comedy on State

1663
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:22,047
Hey

1664
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:27,423
Appearances on Alex's show particularly 2011 2012 time

1665
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
Time frame

1666
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:30,239
He took particular that President Obama

1667
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,031
He called him a sociopath

1668
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,311
Unfit to be in office

1669
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:39,455
I didn't fairness to Steve he'd also said some pretty horrible things about George h.w. Bush while Bush was still in office

1670
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,015
Clinically depressed

1671
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,319
And obviously in the midst of a serious identity

1672
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,647
Eddievr even further fairness

1673
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:52,255
He complained to the LA Times about how people were lazy

1674
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,303
And psychoanalyzing President Carter

1675
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:59,935
I personally feel it's unethical to write psychohistory about a president while he's still in office

1676
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:03,775
These studies adequately into a

1677
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,591
What's the president wears

1678
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,383
I guess he changed his mind.

1679
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,991
The time that I imagine that

1680
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,783
Hwn Obama neither

1681
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,063
We're very open

1682
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
His resume

1683
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,183
I found some interesting

1684
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,207
Think things and that is

1685
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,791
Respectable

1686
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:29,119
Let's say

1687
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:34,495
International Affair context intelligence

1688
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,799
Okay

1689
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:39,615
V-eats published two articles are very short

1690
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:41,151
In the American intelligence

1691
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:48,319
What is called is called Putin KGB forever

1692
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:51,135
Which is really funny because

1693
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:54,975
Pretty profound in 2016

1694
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:59,327
But he wrote another article in volume 22 of the American intelligence

1695
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,095
Fitzgerald's

1696
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,887
It's called Amanda

1697
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,959
In which he argues that the national security info

1698
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:09,311
Structure in America

1699
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,591
By gathering human

1700
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,359
Intelligence

1701
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,431
He describes a bit of the complaints that he has like

1702
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:19,295
Unfortunately effective integration of Civilian military intelligence

1703
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,087
Counterintelligence of psyops

1704
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,111
Absent

1705
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,903
From the government for well over a decade

1706
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:27,999
This is like to a serious inability to predict human behavior and prevent evolve

1707
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:28,767
Crisis

1708
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,535
Crises

1709
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:33,119
This is a strange position for Steve to have

1710
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
When compared to

1711
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,655
The position

1712
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,423
Who takes on Alex

1713
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,191
The show

1714
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,983
In one of his appearances on the show

1715
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,775
Steve literally tells Alex quote

1716
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:45,151
It has to do with the famous technique in Warfare that we call the stand-down false-flag deception in denial

1717
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:50,271
It was done during Pearl Harbor

1718
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,551
Alex

1719
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,599
Explain it to you yesterday was done by Hitler

1720
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:59,999
It was done by LBJ during the war in Vietnam where we had the Gulf of Tonkin and he claimed we had a false flag operation we had to shoot the

1721
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,279
Vietnamese cuz they shot it off

1722
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,559
That was wrong

1723
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,839
Many men died for the

1724
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,191
Very against false flag

1725
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,751
Deception psyops counterintelligence

1726
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,031
When he's talking to Allie

1727
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:15,360
One of these writing in the American intelligence Journal

1728
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,128
He seems to be

1729
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,152
Throw those things

1730
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,176
And save the people

1731
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,224
Gone for a well over a decade

1732
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,504
In the United States

1733
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,832
He sounds

1734
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,112
Like a light

1735
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,672
Contradict

1736
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,952
He doesn't sound like

1737
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,232
He's being honest with

1738
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,024
I don't know f******

1739
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:37,888
Suggestions for how to resolve the problem

1740
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,680
Limited use of humor

1741
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,728
Is the co-op open source

1742
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,752
Predictive intelligence

1743
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,592
Which is to say that he was interested in taking already public information

1744
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,872
And using it for intelligence

1745
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,640
Gallery

1746
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:52,992
What is the culture of intelligence

1747
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:58,112
Community where 90% of what's required for operations already exists an open-source event

1748
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,392
Is newspapers magazines

1749
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,464
TV radio and most importantly the internet

1750
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,792
As usual American entrepreneurs have anticipated this

1751
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,608
Is intelligence Kanojo accordingly have developed

1752
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:13,472
Extremely capable software for catalog

1753
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,240
Behavior

1754
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,776
Greater cooperation

1755
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:19,104
In between the business community and the intelligence Community is imperative

1756
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:23,712
Decreed f****** Cambridge analytica what the f*** is wrong with this guy

1757
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,736
Finishing the quote

1758
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,040
Kudos to the CIA and defense

1759
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:30,112
Department for having already created joint ventures with

1760
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,648
Information Technology start

1761
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,184
God dammit

1762
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
That's amazing

1763
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
Wow

1764
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,256
That's

1765
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:42,912
Very much against what Alex believes kudos

1766
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:46,240
Angling for a Mastiff

1767
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,032
Surveillance state

1768
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:54,176
Utilizing already public information to control and manipulate the population

1769
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,552
By the way Alex I'm against the globalist

1770
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:02,624
Did you say well

1771
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,952
Kudos to everybody else

1772
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:09,792
And this wasn't a stray idea 2004

1773
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:15,168
In 2001 he was the CEO of a consulting firm called strategic intelligence

1774
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:21,056
And in his capacity as profiled in November 32001 Post in the National Defense magazine

1775
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,104
Arguing that the intelligence-gathering

1776
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,384
Should be outsourced

1777
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,408
To the private sector

1778
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:32,320
It's very strange for me than all the times I've heard Stephen Alex's show

1779
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:35,392
Confirm those advocating for the creation of private spy business

1780
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:39,744
And advocating for spying cooperation between the government and Tech startups

1781
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:43,584
It really seems like that's something Alex would be massively against

1782
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:54,080
Going back eight poll box advocating for

1783
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,176
In his

1784
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:00,224
If I were

1785
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,248
I suppose

1786
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,784
Looking at it from his

1787
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,344
In that kind of

1788
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
Field

1789
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,392
That would be something that

1790
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,184
That you say to a higher up

1791
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,232
B y World maybe like

1792
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,512
Genius

1793
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,560
So that's a good idea

1794
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:15,584
From his

1795
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,400
His world

1796
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,168
Perspective on it

1797
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:22,496
Praise for that

1798
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,520
As a position

1799
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:25,824
Certain circles

1800
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,896
Alex

1801
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:33,248
This big point where I don't know what the fuc

1802
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:37,088
He's going on about it would be

1803
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,880
Irresponsible and Adeline

1804
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:42,464
Of course I can't tell you why what you saying in this

1805
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
The journal

1806
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,536
Doesn't seem to match at all

1807
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,096
With what Alex believes or what

1808
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:48,864
What's to believe

1809
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,400
Because he was like

1810
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,008
Oh oh so I run a intelligence

1811
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:59,360
Consulting business is to create a private spy company

1812
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:03,712
Like I don't imagine Alex going along with 1,000

1813
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,992
No don't

1814
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:09,088
Part of his Consulting

1815
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,880
Creating private spy age

1816
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:13,696
Agencies I'm going on your show Alex it ordered

1817
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,976
F*** it

1818
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,280
This dude

1819
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:19,840
Consulting business

1820
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:20,864
This was

1821
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,912
It was much more than just

1822
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,936
I don't

1823
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:27,264
Have any reason to believe that it was a massive Outlet

1824
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,800
Or any

1825
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,568
Is attack

1826
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,944
So one of the other

1827
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,712
Huge beasts

1828
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,064
Association

1829
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,648
Course it is Vios.

1830
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:46,208
His writing career is generally encapsulated

1831
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,232
Ghost wrote books

1832
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,072
It interview with Alex Jones

1833
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,632
The story has gone so far as to be that's

1834
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:54,656
Himself

1835
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,704
Is the inspiration for Jack Ryan

1836
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:59,008
Which

1837
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:00,800
What

1838
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,592
Steve

1839
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:07,200
What is marketing

1840
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,040
No

1841
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:14,368
ZabaSearch

1842
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:17,952
So he told Alex or Alex multiple times

1843
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,976
Steve never corrected him

1844
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:28,192
He's both Sean Connery

1845
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,752
Did I get one wrong there

1846
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:34,080
I don't know movie

1847
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
Sean Connery

1848
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:39,712
My bad

1849
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,760
The great Russian accent

1850
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:49,184
Radius in a very long time I don't care about them at all and I just

1851
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,976
Types of

1852
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,768
Amazon Prime

1853
01:25:56,352 --> 01:26:00,960
Attempt at a fake version of

1854
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,520
Isabel Amazon Prime

1855
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:07,872
Washington Post in 1995

1856
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:11,456
I don't know if he's a model for Jack Ryan but we're Buddies

1857
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,480
It's that simple

1858
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,808
Contradict

1859
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,856
The inspiration

1860
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,392
Right

1861
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,928
Probably leave one

1862
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,952
One to assume that

1863
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,608
Orbit of

1864
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:31,424
Insinuated himself into

1865
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:35,776
Circle

1866
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,544
Cooking interest

1867
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:40,384
But if you were hanging out with him he would tell amazing

1868
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:46,784
Story of reality

1869
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,576
Slightly more real than

1870
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,344
Regalo Burleson

1871
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:54,208
It's literally impossible

1872
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:54,976
Coy about

1873
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:58,560
It's literally impossible for Jack Ryan

1874
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,840
Eva

1875
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,376
Steve's own words

1876
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:05,472
In 1995 Stephen Clancy co-produced

1877
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,496
TV miniseries

1878
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:09,312
Let's start the great Harry Hamlin and Wilford Brimley

1879
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,128
Oedipus peace about it in the Washington Post

1880
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,664
Steve explains how he met

1881
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:14,688
Tom Clancy

1882
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,784
He recalled a book fair

1883
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,064
Happened by nav

1884
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:20,832
22 Prescott

1885
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:25,440
Quote book with a submarine on the cover and Page through it

1886
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:30,560
Based on his experience as a negotiator pieczenik thought the author display great Insight on the Soviet

1887
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,608
And the submarine stuff was fantastic

1888
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,144
He pointed out the book

1889
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,984
The book was The Hunt for Red October

1890
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,800
Steve had no idea who Tom Clancy was

1891
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:44,640
Clancy had already created Jack Ryan published

1892
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,664
Probably the most

1893
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,688
Defining book about it

1894
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,224
One of the most popular

1895
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:53,344
The books that Steve was involved in with Tom Clancy where the books in the

1896
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,880
Center and net force

1897
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,416
Sure

1898
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:03,328
1995 and net force in 1990

1899
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:07,680
Where is the character Jack Ryan October

1900
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:11,264
Annabelle the focus of six books by the time either of these spin-off series

1901
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:15,872
Creative partners

1902
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,176
These two men

1903
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:24,064
Stevens Hardware the creators of the series but they didn't write any of the books in the op-center or no

1904
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,832
Net force

1905
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:28,160
Frozen wrote most of the Ops

1906
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,184
Center books

1907
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,720
Steve Perry

1908
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,744
Not the guy from Journey

1909
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,536
Wrote the net force one

1910
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,328
They called the books

1911
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,864
Tom Clancy's op Center

1912
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,656
Tom Clancy's net force

1913
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:41,728
Don't those people would just assume that Matt Clancy had written them

1914
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,568
As opposed to just signifying say exist in what I'm going to call the extended

1915
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,336
Clancy verse

1916
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,248
What is books

1917
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,064
I'm not sure I tried

1918
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,392
Millions of dollars

1919
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,952
Spin-off series paperback

1920
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:06,816
He's got to get something at an airport

1921
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:10,144
Unfortunately Jordan all good things have to come to an end

1922
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,728
And the same is true for Steven Tom friendship and their business partner

1923
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:17,056
In 1999 Tom Clancy got a divorce

1924
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:23,200
And in the 2005 settlement his ex-wife got control over Jack Ryan limited partner

1925
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,736
The Entity

1926
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,040
Use the published books written by other people

1927
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:33,440
Jack Ryan limited partnership was in a joint venture with S&R literary incorporate

1928
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,976
And that's beyond feisty

1929
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,536
With Clancy's ex-wife taking

1930
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,328
In control of Jack Ryan

1931
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,608
He was now in business with

1932
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,888
Tom's ex-wife

1933
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,656
Or

1934
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,680
Steve without event

1935
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:44,704
Right

1936
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:50,336
In January 2004, declared his decision that he no longer

1937
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,104
Beyond these books

1938
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,128
But he didn't write

1939
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:56,736
His ex-wife thought this was a breach of his fight dude

1940
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,784
Fiduciary

1941
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,344
Severely impact the value of this

1942
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:04,160
Right of course

1943
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,440
As did the Appeals

1944
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:08,000
He couldn't take his name off these books

1945
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,536
Nightmare

1946
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:14,656
Copyright violation

1947
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,680
His own songs

1948
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:20,288
Whatever it was it's like

1949
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,824
In good faith

1950
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,896
You made it totally fine for someone else to write books

1951
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:30,528
With your name on them now

1952
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:37,440
Also in the divorce it came out that the reason for the separation was that Wanda discovered the Clancy had cheated on her with a woman

1953
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208
Nickname

1954
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,424
Classic Steve pieczenik insert into

1955
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,960
Very strange.

1956
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,520
You divorced him when she found out that his friend

1957
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:58,176
I was not

1958
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,712
You know what everybody got to go back

1959
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:06,112
Offensive story behind that I've just knocking I don't want to do it

1960
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:12,512
These books

1961
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,792
Are Jack Ryan Limited

1962
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,584
Steve sided with the King

1963
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,608
And testified against

1964
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,376
Clancy

1965
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:21,216
Alleging that his motivation to take his name off the books was to hurt King Financial

1966
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,288
From everything I can tell there's no reason to give

1967
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,336
Steve any elevated status

1968
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:27,104
With Tom Clancy

1969
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,968
Or anything like that he's not.

1970
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,248
Forgot

1971
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:37,856
I'm pretty sure Steve spawn some great Yarns

1972
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:41,952
Do you know anything about the op-center or net force books

1973
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,512
One of them

1974
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,376
Maybe

1975
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:53,984
Where in the middle is place we got to get stuff done

1976
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,032
Net force is about

1977
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,056
Illegal Fisheries

1978
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,080
Really

1979
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,712
I do like it I know the names of like for Tom Clancy books and

1980
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:08,320
Things to do with Steve at all none of the books that you know

1981
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,856
Have anything to do with

1982
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:12,928
Isaac

1983
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:14,720
An international Spy book

1984
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,512
About fishery violation

1985
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,376
But it might interest you to know that

1986
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:28,288
Career as well

1987
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:31,104
In 1989 came out with blood

1988
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,920
Maximum vigilance was published in 1990

1989
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:35,712
Text Pacifica

1990
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:36,992
In 1995

1991
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:39,040
These books as quote

1992
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:39,808
Bad

1993
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:42,112
And caught having no literary value

1994
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:46,464
But these are just the reviews of random people online so maybe they're very Brookside

1995
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:50,304
Now something I find interesting is how closely some of these books

1996
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:52,096
To match up with Alex Jones

1997
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:57,216
Some of them have been inspired to believe

1998
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,496
Based on Steve

1999
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:02,080
Princeton's blood he is about an evil cabal

2000
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:08,480
Conspiracy to create a mutated by even more transmittable

2001
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,784
Scary

2002
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,600
Virus

2003
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:15,136
Controlled-release

2004
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:18,464
Palisades do psychiatry

2005
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,232
Nefariously

2006
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,024
Pax Pacifica involves

2007
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,120
Conspiracies and power struggles in China that Ripple over it to the United States

2008
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:28,192
All these vaguely intersect with major Alec

2009
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:28,960
Narrative

2010
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:32,288
Set Steve's 1992 book maximum vigilance

2011
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,568
Is perhaps the best

2012
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,104
Example of his literature having

2013
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,384
Strange parallels

2014
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,152
But the things that

2015
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:37,920
He's pulled out

2016
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:45,600
The central conflict in that book is about how is fictional eyes version of President Bush was crazy and needed to be removed from office

2017
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,880
It's using the 25th Amendment

2018
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,416
Interesting Lee

2019
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,464
Around the time of the book's release

2020
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:56,096
Went around

2021
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,680
Accusing George h.w. Bush

2022
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,704
Being crazy

2023
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,776
50.

2024
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,312
You would have used it as a platform

2025
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,848
I want to spread the bushes crazy

2026
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:07,872
For sure

2027
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,152
These comments got him into

2028
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:13,504
Some trouble and he was reprimanded by the American Medical Association which ultimately led to him

2029
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,088
Leaving the American Medical Association

2030
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,648
He said the Bush was clinically depressed

2031
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,696
And obviously in the midst of a serious

2032
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,536
No one else was putting forth these sorts of accusations are gossip

2033
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:30,400
And it's super relevant to point out that there was a little boy

2034
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:33,728
Similarity between the book he was selling at the time

2035
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,776
And the portrait of reality he was president

2036
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,360
Unsurprisingly the heroes maximum vigilant

2037
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,384
Does quotes

2038
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,152
Clark

2039
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,432
I want to spell a name for you

2040
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
DDS

2041
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,248
Vix

2042
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,272
Easyacc

2043
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,648
Probably an anagram for something

2044
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:57,792
This guy is a crisis manager

2045
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:01,888
P6 who works his way through layers of Deceit betrayal torture and assassination

2046
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,424
Multiple

2047
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,448
Conspiracies a foot

2048
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,008
Don't know why anyone

2049
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:09,568
With that

2050
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,104
Has no literary

2051
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:14,432
Steve Howey

2052
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:18,272
Self into his work

2053
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,576
He's a patriot

2054
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,368
Good for him

2055
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,720
In the book Clark

2056
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,256
Clearly fictionalized version

2057
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:32,864
Discovers that the president who's clearly a stand-in for President Bush

2058
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,888
Has Marfan

2059
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:36,192
That's the condition

2060
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:40,544
Dzx Clark need to get him out of office

2061
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,336
That book came out 1990

2062
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,664
When Steve started coming on Alex Jones Show

2063
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,456
What do wavy compressed Alex

2064
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,016
Was arguing that Osama Bin Laden had died back

2065
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:50,784
2000

2066
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,320
Aaliyah died of Marfan

2067
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,648
Marfan syndrome is something that would have been almost

2068
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
The death sentence

2069
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,440
In the. Of time that

2070
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,720
Steve was coming up in the world

2071
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:03,072
In the fifties and sixties the prognosis for someone with Marfan would not be good

2072
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:07,168
Death from cardiovascular complications often would happen by the time

2073
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:07,936
The patient was in

2074
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,008
However modern medical science is

2075
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,032
Big breakthrough

2076
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,104
For the most part it's a relatively manageable

2077
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:20,224
We predicted lifespan for people with Marfan syndrome general population

2078
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,528
So I don't message

2079
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,552
Sara Lee

2080
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:27,904
With the thing that I think is that Steve knows of this thing

2081
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,952
The most people don't know anything about

2082
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,232
And it's a great thing

2083
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:33,536
Throw in as a creative device

2084
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,816
Especially

2085
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:38,912
Book maximum as a plot device

2086
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:39,936
And now he's

2087
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:42,496
Clearly repurposed it as a plot device

2088
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:44,032
To help convince Alex

2089
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:49,664
B 911 right

2090
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:51,968
And that's exactly what you would want

2091
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,504
To tell Alec

2092
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:54,784
Some disease

2093
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:55,808
That

2094
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,088
Has never heard of

2095
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,624
It's so rare

2096
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,464
Nobody listen cuz I was going to follow up on

2097
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:05,280
And Alex is going to pretend like he already knew all

2098
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,584
I'm an expert

2099
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:13,984
Supercalifragilistic

2100
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,520
70s

2101
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,056
It seems interesting

2102
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,336
To meet at this fairly

2103
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,360
Your condition

2104
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,152
Is used as a plot device

2105
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:24,992
In both his book and in telling Alex

2106
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:27,552
Now there's a

2107
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:28,832
I don't I don't

2108
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:30,880
Pretend to me that it definitively means

2109
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,184
It also seems like maybe a pack

2110
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:34,720
I don't know

2111
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,280
Yeah like who Rodger Stone blames why

2112
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,816
When he needs to get out of

2113
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,584
Time travel

2114
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,680
The same guys over and over and over

2115
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:44,448
Socratica

2116
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:47,008
Still is a little bit of

2117
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:47,776
Question

2118
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:52,384
That I have after all of this after looking at all the available evidence of like

2119
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:56,224
It doesn't look like Steve worked at the state department past 1979

2120
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:59,040
Story based on

2121
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,344
The information that you can find make

2122
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,112
Total sense

2123
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,648
But your track through the State Farm

2124
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:04,928
He came in

2125
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,720
He is sort of f***** up

2126
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:10,560
He got mad that he wasn't involved in the Iranian hostage crisis

2127
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:13,120
Be quiet and then creative self mythology around

2128
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:16,448
Himself that some people in the media that really

2129
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:19,008
Certainly helps his path go forward

2130
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:21,056
Sandy Hooks up with Tom Clancy

2131
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,848
After already

2132
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,384
Shirt now.com

2133
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,224
He starts writing

2134
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:28,992
Thrillers

2135
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,784
And they're not getting much tracks

2136
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:34,368
He meets up with Tom Clancy starts working with him

2137
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,648
And then that

2138
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,672
Sort of falls apart

2139
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:41,280
I don't I don't know what his f****** game is without

2140
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:45,888
Like I don't know some people think that upon him

2141
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:52,288
Yeah I'm infiltrating the Patriot community in order to bring them down or something like that and I

2142
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,056
Argument

2143
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:56,384
Completely uncredible

2144
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,944
Before somebody dies

2145
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,480
Sure okay

2146
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:03,552
Show me any evidence is work there

2147
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,600
79

2148
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,392
Can talk

2149
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,000
It's not upon me to do that

2150
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,792
If there was any evidence

2151
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,584
Then you would know that it wasn't

2152
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:16,608
Happening

2153
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,656
That's how you would know

2154
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,704
Because there isn't evidence

2155
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,240
Is why you know he is

2156
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,056
Because if there was evidence

2157
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:32,736
Keep going all right I really don't believe

2158
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:35,296
I don't believe that he's just

2159
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:36,320
Crazy

2160
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,136
Don't get it

2161
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:39,904
Honestly

2162
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,696
REI

2163
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,720
Swear to you this

2164
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,000
This is the number one

2165
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,024
This is the thing that I say

2166
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,048
Most yeah

2167
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:48,096
I think there's a chance

2168
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:50,656
Easy Living

2169
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:55,520
Kill the Prime Minister and then he had to go right back to just

2170
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,848
Now he's

2171
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,128
He's written all these books

2172
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:11,136
Maybe he's is he still practice

2173
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:13,184
Nothing or whatever but he doesn't have the

2174
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:20,864
Livin On The Edge

2175
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,680
I can't prove it obvious

2176
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,240
Is it comes up to support the argument

2177
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,008
But he is look

2178
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,568
Is the fact that he knows a lot

2179
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,592
About the intelligence

2180
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,640
He knows a lot of names

2181
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:33,664
She knows a lot of dates

2182
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,688
He talks like an expert

2183
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:37,248
I believe it's some of this could be explained

2184
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,344
It was accidentally revealed in 2012

2185
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:45,184
In 2012 Wikileaks released a ton of information

2186
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,720
From the intelligence

2187
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:47,744
It's Group Stratford

2188
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:50,048
Included in that dump of

2189
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,328
Was an email chain

2190
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,352
2011

2191
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,120
Where's Steve

2192
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:55,168
Sonic was complaining customer service

2193
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:55,936
Quote

2194
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:58,496
I bought several straps for book several weeks

2195
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,776
Have not received

2196
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,824
Could someone inform me as to what happen

2197
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,664
We learned that Steve is a customers

2198
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,968
Stratford who produces intelligence

2199
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,736
Assessment

2200
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,528
And we also alerts

2201
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,296
Steve's phone number

2202
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,112
And the fact that he uses an AOL email

2203
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:20,256
Would you wouldn't think someone in his position would do particularly when emailing with an intelligent Contracting Company

2204
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:23,840
This weird man this is a guy

2205
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,864
You cannot turn his phone

2206
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:31,776
Sbcglobal.net

2207
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,480
All the book Steve ordered with the works of George freed

2208
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,760
The founder of straps

2209
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:44,576
It is exchange of customer service

2210
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:47,136
Rapper has his Visa number on file

2211
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:50,720
Might be a regular customer and consumer

2212
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:51,488
Of their product

2213
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,536
This impression is strength

2214
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,560
Goodbye another email

2215
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,584
From 2009

2216
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,864
Where Steve is responding

2217
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,448
To a book email

2218
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:04,544
Subscribers and he's responding very sniffling

2219
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:08,640
It appears from his response that and automate

2220
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,944
Getting spam

2221
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:18,880
Also he would like to know why there's another email

2222
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:22,464
2007 include Steve on a list of

2223
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:23,744
The Stratford

2224
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,584
I has him listed as the holder of a life

2225
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,352
Time membership

2226
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:32,960
In 2004 the following email

2227
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:34,752
Happy holidays

2228
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,032
Continue the great job

2229
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,336
Well

2230
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:40,896
Expensive bloated government agency

2231
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,968
I would venture to Guess that someone who reads

2232
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:44,736
The premium Conte

2233
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:46,528
Including the Daily Intelligencer

2234
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:47,808
Produced by

2235
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,088
And release by Stratford

2236
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,392
Pretty regularly

2237
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:54,464
Interact with them to wish them a happy holiday

2238
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,768
I wish for the downfall of government agencies

2239
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,816
Probably person who beat

2240
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,608
Really well-versed

2241
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:01,632
Geopolitics

2242
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,424
Edit teligent stop the Waze

2243
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,192
Steve.

2244
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,776
But it was

2245
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:12,128
Explain how Steve is able to sound like an expert in this field

2246
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,152
When

2247
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,200
Probably hasn't been involved in decades

2248
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,480
He just reads

2249
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,784
A lot of Stratford publication

2250
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:19,808
Who put out

2251
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,832
Intelligent

2252
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,600
Assessment

2253
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,368
Professional

2254
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:26,208
That does explain how he sounds like he does

2255
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,488
Did not realize

2256
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,048
Yep

2257
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,072
Just so you can

2258
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,096
Just get intelligence

2259
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:34,912
You just do

2260
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:35,680
A guy

2261
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,472
How do you say I want

2262
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,240
Some intelligence

2263
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,056
Why would you ever say

2264
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:41,824
Thanks for 1 sec

2265
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,664
Because they're produced by professionals

2266
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:54,368
I don't think it's evaporates off them necessarily cuz I don't think

2267
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,928
Get that

2268
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:01,536
Pretty interesting

2269
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:04,608
Like it it could go a long way as to

2270
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,376
Explaining

2271
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:08,192
Steve's ability to present himself the way he does

2272
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:11,008
Any other way

2273
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,848
It's not like the only documents they've ever released for the

2274
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,664
They're quite a few documents

2275
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,432
They released

2276
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
Involve Steve

2277
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:22,016
Mostly classified cables but state

2278
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:25,600
He's mentioned at that

2279
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:26,880
Who got killed

2280
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,464
Everybody was

2281
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:40,448
Now what's interact

2282
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:47,360
Literally every single classified

2283
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,384
That's been released

2284
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:49,664
That mention Steve

2285
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,248
Comes from the period of 1976 to 1979

2286
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,808
There's nothing that's been released that would tend

2287
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,576
Kate is

2288
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,112
Continued involvement in government

2289
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,392
Pasta point requip

2290
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:01,184
Because the Iran hostage crisis

2291
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:06,816
Every other piece of information that I can find that doesn't traced directly back to

2292
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:10,144
So even though the WikiLeaks

2293
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,032
Steve

2294
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:16,800
Only exist

2295
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,592
In the time frame you would expect

2296
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:24,480
In emails he sent to Stratford as a paying customer of their materials

2297
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,016
That's f****** interest

2298
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,040
That's very

2299
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:30,368
Terry

2300
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,648
Is true but I would say

2301
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,416
Telling

2302
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:35,744
Perhaps

2303
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:41,888
Insurmountable evidence it doesn't prove anything.

2304
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,168
If are working

2305
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:47,776
Is well based on all available information that doesn't Trace back to

2306
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:51,616
Or an article in the paper receive is the primary source of

2307
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,384
Information

2308
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,944
He left the state department in 1979

2309
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,480
Has not worked

2310
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,504
Officially in the government

2311
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,576
I keep

2312
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:01,856
Finding things

2313
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,136
Supreme

2314
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,672
The fact that every

2315
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:08,512
Newspaper article after 1979 refers to him as a former

2316
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,280
State Department

2317
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,584
The fact that these WikiLeaks

2318
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,168
Consistently go straight through with

2319
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:17,216
Tempe Metro to the state department

2320
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:19,008
During that time

2321
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:22,080
It's hard for me to over overcome that

2322
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,616
Like I said

2323
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,152
If there's proof

2324
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:29,504
I'll change my to I can't

2325
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,832
Another email in this transfer Wikileaks collection

2326
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:33,600
Involve Steve

2327
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:39,232
I don't understand what

2328
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:45,888
No I don't know anyway it's a 2008 email from a guy named

2329
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:47,680
Dr. John neustadt

2330
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:50,240
Who is

2331
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:53,824
It is email he mentions that his partner is Steve pieczenik

2332
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,640
Depace over $700 a year for his Stratford

2333
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,944
Dr. newstead

2334
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,968
Steve's romantic partner

2335
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:00,736
Already thanks

2336
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,272
Supplement

2337
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:05,344
Putting together called nutritional biochemistry Incorporated

2338
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:10,720
It's definitely not as wacky an outfit as Alex's supplement line but their overlaps

2339
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:16,608
There's iron supplement sleep aid stimulant free energy supplements and all the stuff you normally

2340
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:21,728
He was definitely involved with this company and was Doctor new sets partner in it at the

2341
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:24,032
Co-founded the business with him

2342
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
2006

2343
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:28,128
You still involved or when that ended

2344
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:30,944
Nutritional biochemistry Incorporated website

2345
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,480
They're about page

2346
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:33,760
Just curious

2347
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:34,784
Either way

2348
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,344
Probably nothing super nefarious

2349
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:41,440
Just another adventure

2350
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:46,304
What it is

2351
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,632
It's just further confirmation that if you scratch the surface a little bit

2352
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:55,776
You always find a pill business with these weirdos every single one of them has some sort of

2353
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,312
Supplement business

2354
01:47:57,568 --> 01:48:01,664
Cooking somewhere easiest to get into

2355
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,688
Get out of

2356
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,456
And

2357
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:04,480
Scam people on

2358
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:07,040
Cuz you can make up whatever it is you want to say about it

2359
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,832
Your confirmation

2360
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,136
Placebo effect

2361
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,160
I give you justice

2362
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,184
To get by on

2363
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,512
There's no regulation of the market whatsoever

2364
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,048
And your

2365
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,608
Basically private labeling everybody else

2366
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:24,448
So you

2367
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:26,752
You get a thing and if you don't like it

2368
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:29,312
You just close it all down and burn it up for insurance

2369
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:30,592
It makes perfect

2370
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:31,616
It works

2371
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,384
Yeah

2372
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,200
So I reached the end of

2373
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:37,760
Where do things I've looked into

2374
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:42,880
Now I intentionally didn't want to explore too much the idea that

2375
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:44,928
Steve counter-coup narrative

2376
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:47,744
And all that stuff is very similar to qanon

2377
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,096
We already gone greatly in-depth podcast

2378
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,120
In convincing Alex

2379
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,656
To sport

2380
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:57,728
It's like that would be rehashing too much territory

2381
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,568
The image

2382
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,592
Swept is like

2383
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,152
We receive a pretty strong and

2384
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,432
Navigation to Steve pieczenik

2385
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,224
Is involved with Alex Jones

2386
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,504
Around

2387
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:11,296
Weird

2388
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,320
I haven't seen

2389
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,344
His involvement

2390
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,368
In convincing Alex

2391
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,392
To support Trump

2392
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:17,952
These are two major decisions

2393
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:18,720
But Alex made

2394
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:20,512
Have negatively affected his

2395
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,816
His career to a point that is almost

2396
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:23,584
Unexpressed

2397
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,864
Oh no they've destroyed

2398
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:26,656
It's been done

2399
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:27,936
Based on

2400
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,216
Is it appears

2401
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:29,984
Based on

2402
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,264
The advice

2403
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,288
And guidance

2404
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,896
Of somebody who when I look at it all the chips are down I would never think of

2405
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:38,432
Is a credible person to talk to

2406
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:40,992
Even if I didn't know any of the stuff

2407
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,272
That I've looked into for this

2408
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:45,600
If you told me a psych Warfare guy wants to talk to me

2409
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:49,184
I promised Warfare on me I would say I pass

2410
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,744
No matter what information

2411
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,024
You can give it to me in writing

2412
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,560
I don't want to talk to me

2413
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:58,656
I do not trust myself not to get completely

2414
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,152
It's like I'm I'm one of those people who just

2415
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:14,528
You know it doesn't happen so

2416
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:22,208
Ono Ono

2417
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:24,768
It turns out those were the words that wake me up

2418
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:30,400
So I don't I don't know like I seen a lot of stuff in a red a bunch

2419
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,168
Stuff for this

2420
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:32,448
Look at a lot of indication

2421
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,984
And to me it's

2422
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:35,520
Like

2423
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:36,800
Thursday

2424
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:39,872
There's a clear picture of what's most likely

2425
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:43,968
But the alternative is also possible just incredibly unlikely

2426
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:46,016
And all the information that is

2427
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:46,784
Definitive that I can

2428
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,552
Confined

2429
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:49,600
10th towards the likely explanation

2430
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:53,696
The dick who record the podcast in his apartment

2431
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:56,512
I am not involved in the halls of government

2432
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:58,048
Or the high levels

2433
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,328
Spy intelligence

2434
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,608
Consulting business

2435
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:02,144
I don't read Stratford

2436
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,168
Stop

2437
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,472
So I have no idea how any of this stuff works

2438
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:11,872
Is it possible there's a world that is completely obscured and all kinds of secrecy is involved

2439
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:15,456
Steve is actually actually was working with Reagan and Bush

2440
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:16,992
I don't know possible

2441
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:19,040
It's possible I can't tell you it's not

2442
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:21,344
I think it is I think it's true

2443
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:24,928
You haven't worked

2444
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:26,976
So you can't

2445
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:28,768
Hey you can't do Steve story

2446
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,048
Steve's

2447
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:30,816
Story

2448
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,584
Through that lens

2449
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:32,608
However

2450
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:33,888
You are

2451
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,680
As am I somebody who

2452
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:36,448
Works from home

2453
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:38,752
Every spend a lot of time

2454
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:39,520
Writing

2455
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,824
And staring at computer screens and a

2456
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:44,128
And you get bored

2457
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,408
You get bored

2458
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:49,248
You & I we do this if we don't do this podcast

2459
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:51,040
Cuz we're bored but this is an outlet

2460
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:57,696
From losing our minds all too often

2461
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,488
What do I do

2462
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:01,024
To get out some of this stress

2463
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:01,792
To get back

2464
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:02,560
To my computer in

2465
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:09,216
I'll go f*** with Alex with Alex for about an hour or so not a lot of work

2466
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,008
I don't know

2467
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:11,776
I'm bored

2468
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:14,592
So after all this examination of reflection

2469
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:18,944
For a bit and I really don't know what to make

2470
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:24,576
I don't know how much of the story is true but I can definitely say it's not entirely

2471
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:25,344
False

2472
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:26,624
There's some truth

2473
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,160
Just some of the things he's saying

2474
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,184
Which is the best

2475
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,464
Exactly

2476
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:32,768
I come away from this with the sense that

2477
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:35,328
Steve is first of all incredibly smart

2478
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,352
And see if they have it

2479
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,888
Singular talent for persuade

2480
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,680
Seems to be able to

2481
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,960
Convince people up there

2482
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,520
Couldn't get his job back

2483
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:46,848
He appears to have exactly the right amount of credentials

2484
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,128
To be able to convince

2485
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:49,920
People who are inclined to believe him

2486
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:51,712
That he had been everywhere

2487
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,736
And he has done everything

2488
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:56,832
I look at all this available evidence about Steve pieczenik

2489
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:59,136
What comes to mind is a line from his 19

2490
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,672
T95 novel blood

2491
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,976
Quote every life is exciting

2492
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,256
Depending on how you

2493
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:12,704
I think

2494
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,496
Podcast

2495
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:16,288
Incredible life for himself

2496
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,824
It's very interesting

2497
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:21,408
And he may have accidentally or intentionally or just

2498
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:27,040
Capriciously torpedoed Alex Jones's life in the process

2499
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:29,600
Almost

2500
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:30,880
One of those like

2501
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:32,416
Hitler did do something

2502
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,184
Sing good in his life

2503
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,464
He killed Hitler

2504
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,304
His life he killed Alex

2505
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,632
His career but also

2506
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:45,728
For the rest of the world at least

2507
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:48,032
At least we know

2508
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:49,824
Well

2509
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,360
So is this a

2510
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:57,248
Play Reflections of Jordan a lot of information I don't know I don't know

2511
01:53:57,504 --> 01:54:00,576
I don't know what case I've proven I don't know

2512
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,880
But what are your thoughts

2513
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,744
I'm always amazed by those

2514
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:08,768
Those guys

2515
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,584
F*** around their way up

2516
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:13,120
Do you know what I mean like

2517
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:15,168
This is a guy who is

2518
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:17,216
Not good at just about any

2519
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:21,824
I don't know that's true

2520
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:23,872
Maybe that's his only

2521
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:27,200
Maybe he's really really bad at everything but

2522
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:28,736
And he is

2523
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:31,040
Skill into a

2524
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:33,088
Weird and interesting in one

2525
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,648
But

2526
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:39,744
Wait on the single line you just read to me from his book

2527
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:47,936
Fun tournament people online sent to aviary

2528
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:51,008
He helps co-create without plan

2529
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:55,616
He was his Mojo Harry Hamlin

2530
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:57,920
You're not going to stick up for Brimley

2531
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:59,712
She's fine he's got that natural money

2532
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:03,552
Biggest thing

2533
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:05,344
In his entire State Department

2534
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,880
Career was

2535
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:11,488
Of the death of a prime minister

2536
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,816
Everybody agree

2537
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:16,096
Really involved with

2538
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:21,728
He quit because people didn't want him around most likely

2539
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:24,800
Indication is that he is anything

2540
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:25,824
He tries to do

2541
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:31,456
Talked his way into buddy might be

2542
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:35,296
Which is the correct we would have together

2543
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,672
Talented

2544
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:44,000
Might be very gifted and understanding how people's brains

2545
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:49,120
Spending aren't involved

2546
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:49,888
Situation

2547
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:54,752
I don't know but like I said I want to be totally clear there is a

2548
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,032
Ratably

2549
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:58,336
Small possibility that a lot of his resume

2550
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,384
Is true and the snow

2551
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,968
The stuff he tells Alex is

2552
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:06,016
Stillborn

2553
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,040
That's one under

2554
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:09,856
Even if his resume is totally true

2555
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,928
There's no way to Las Vegas you didn't happen

2556
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,464
So he's a f****** a

2557
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,304
What a giant

2558
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,072
F****** ass

2559
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:26,240
Burn the world on fire

2560
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:27,776
Burns the world

2561
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,824
It's almost

2562
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:35,968
He's annoyed he has to destroy the world

2563
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:42,368
Consider like his arguments with Alex about manners or how he was mad when Alex was supporting

2564
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,136
Neil Gorsuch

2565
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:45,696
Spring on the Supreme Court

2566
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:48,000
About to

2567
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:52,352
Yeah it's it's fun when you cranky

2568
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,120
It is

2569
01:56:55,424 --> 01:57:01,312
So I don't know your own conclusions about

2570
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,616
This whole matter

2571
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:06,944
I just thought it was important to as were in the 2013

2572
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,736
Damn. Where Steve has appeared

2573
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,272
I think it is

2574
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,832
Essential for us to have a better understanding

2575
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:14,112
Understanding of

2576
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:19,488
When he comes on his like I'm a complete expert and all of these things

2577
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:21,280
What is true about the

2578
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:24,864
We couldn't do that within the span of an episode

2579
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,912
Wasn't fully

2580
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:29,728
No this is great I'm really glad to learn more about

2581
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:31,520
Yeah

2582
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:35,616
What his deal

2583
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:38,944
What is your dream

2584
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,480
Dzx Clark

2585
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:41,504
Subway

2586
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:59,168
That's right where you can find

2587
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,960
Find us on Facebook and

2588
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:02,240
If you would like to download

2589
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:03,776
Go to I-10

2590
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:08,384
Thought you could leave a review

2591
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,920
School aisle

2592
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:10,944
Target hit

2593
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:11,968
Underneath

2594
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:13,504
The small 3

2595
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,040
Restart notebooks do you remember this

2596
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:15,808
The small one

2597
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:17,600
Like a little notebooks about

2598
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,392
Which is why

2599
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:21,184
If you open it up yet

2600
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:25,792
Traded wanted I have wondering if you open it up to
