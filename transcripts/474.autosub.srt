Religious studies professor

And every year he would go to the fbl conference the Society of biblical literature

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,488
And that would often be in foreign countries

42
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,608
Scores and so he would go to be always really exciting when you come back because you have a bag

00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Interesting calling American

53
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
I appreciate that

54

That's very

55
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,040
Seems It's

56
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
A very trivial

57
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Siri trivia

58
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303

00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,447
I don't want you to

61
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,263
I was getting my hair

62
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,359
Starting to YouTube

63
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,039
It was amazing then realized that I never even considered

64
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,087
For it is because where I grew up

65
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:47,487
It was always so associated with with only women

66
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,887
And I examined myself when I see that I'm still carrying those gender bias is even now

67
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:58,751
God dammit

68
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639

Longer

72
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
Especially since you're taking care of it

73
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:39,967
Summer break

74
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Active option

00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Tried to look at

80
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:04,287
Honor YouTube channel

81
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
Naturally sourced

82
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,807
The person

83
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
It was a real disaster

84
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,207
And also I tried to go back to the gym

85
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:27,071
But unfortunately I stay because Jim Bakker

86
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Had a stroke

87
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
And since he's come back

88
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
I don't

89
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
It really is it's kind of hard to watch

90
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
He's not 100% yet

91
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,591
Certainly even if I'm not making

92
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,895
King fun of

93
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
But his health issues

94
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,759
It's still just doesn't it doesn't feel right to be like

95
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,831
You're talking about the end times and then

96
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Been out here

97
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
To figure out what

98
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,071
What to do for a suggestion

99
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
For a date

100
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:06,495
Indeed and you came through

101
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
When you choose random

102
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,175
You have the unfortunate possibility we've already gone over

103
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
After 22

104
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807

106
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,231
Was not random

107
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
I got to say

108
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,607
Maybe

109
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655

110
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423

112
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Was a lot of fun

113
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,335
It was revitalizing

00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,039
Liar and racist

120
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:08,703
Certain obligation to cover his dumbass in the present

121
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,775
A lot of the time

122
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
Just complete

123
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
Lack of creativity Beyond Reason

124

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
But

128
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
It's not

129
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
The same as now

130
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,559
He's not just sitting around yelling about the tickle

131
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,399
Almost not at all talking about how

132
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:43,263

133
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,359

Figured this would be like all right

136
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
This there was a

137
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,087
Every time you forget that he used to try

138
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
A little

139
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Well the president used to dry

140

00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
Every 4th year Meats

197
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
States on the East Coast

198
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
The first time

199
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
They are meeting

200
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
In Europe

201
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
On the fourth year and that's obviously because you're up

202
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
Crisis

203
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
Tottering on the edge of

204
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,959
What great news

205
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:09,759
Alex

206
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,743
Alex is correct about the 2016

207
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
It didn't start until June 9th but

208
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,095
He doesn't the location corrects of good for him

209
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
Past that the rest of the stuff you saying is

210
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Pure b*******

211
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
I want to search that they hold the meeting in the United States every four years but because you're a busy in a crisis of world government

212
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,175
Decided to forego their four-year cycle tradition

213
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,575
For the first time he said that that makes no sense what is this the f******

214
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,135
Olympics how get the s*** out of here what are you talk

215
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,791
This this is where it becomes just way too clear that even close to an expert

216
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,423
Papa guy on because there is no for your cycle and Bilderberg location history

217
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:05,311
For years prior I'm 2012 Bilderberg did meet the United States in Chantilly Virginia

218
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
4 years before that

219
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,175
In 2008 they were in the United States as well

220
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,783
The problem is the two data points don't prove a consistent pattern

221
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,903
Princeton's four years before this in 2004 Bilderberg wasn't stress Italy

222
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,207
You continue out the four-year cycle

223
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:27,839
Here's where they met in the next year's when if Alex was right they should have all been in the United States

224
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
In 2000

225
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:36,799
In 1996 there were in King City Ontario Canada sister cities with an American Social

226
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,639
Play Silly United States in 1992 they were in a van

227
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479
In France in 1988

228
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,295
In 88 Austria was an American state

229
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
In 1984 it was Sweden in Germany in 1976

230
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,047
Do you have to go back to 1964 to find an exterior metal Edge

231
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,375
For your cycle we're building

232
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,703
Were they actually met in the United States there we go out

233
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,239
Navigate Lovett

234
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Love it

235
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:13,407
I love that kind of nonsense here are the years the Bilderberg has had their meeting in the United States

236
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
1957

237
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
1964

238
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,135
1978 1985

239
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,207
Foresthill 1990 1997

240
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,303
2008-12

241
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
When do we have the 2017

242
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:40,031
Alex is reporting to his audience if there's something weird about this 2016 meeting being held in Germany because based on his

243
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
Fictional expertise

244
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
He should be in the United States

245
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
But naturally must mean that the globalists are in a panic because of Europe which is just another narrative element that out

246
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
There is no for your cycle when the Bilderberg Group meets in the United States

247
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,719
Alex just thinks that because he's a dumb dumb and he makes a lot of assumptions

248
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,535
They were in the United States in 2008

249
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
2012

250
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,191
Therefore it must be the case that they were regular for your cycle so it's weird they're not here in 2016

251
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,335
This is only relevant for one reason and that's because it reveals that Alex doesn't know anything about the Bilderberg Group

252
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,407
Because if he had any kind of deep familiarity with the subject

253
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
You would know this was a pattern and where they meet isn't

254
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,551
Real someone like a big Jim Tucker or Daniel estulin

255
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
Makeup a lot of bulshit

256
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,975
But they wouldn't make a mistake like that easily like wait here's where they were

257
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,047
It doesn't even give a s*** about like anything

258
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,935
I love the swing UCF Ice and you're like well obviously if it was if it was 4 years

259
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
That's almost

260
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,799
The pattern of the scientific method

261
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,639
Forever is how that's how long that's been

262
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
Interest in covering Bilderberg meetings in 2000

263
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:59,647
Maybe he just started

264
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
I don't

265
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,535
That can't possibly be true cuz Bilderberg was a name that rang out

266
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,399
SeaWorld before

267
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,799
And what was that it doesn't care about

268
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,431
You don't need to remember before Obama was President

269
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,247
For they weren't to the United States

270
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
It would be impossible for him

271
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,855
The guy who I'm sure would have been there if it

272
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Very weird

273
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,231
Xenophobic

274
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,263
He's rambling here a little bit about

275
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
In foreign countries

276
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Most

277
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
And take your children

278
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
Articles

279
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
1 Telegraph Avenue

280
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
Not even really from the UK they hardly even

281
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Speak English

282
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
The police

283
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Sweden

284
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
Germany and France

285
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
And in the UK

286
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Also

287
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Muslim

288
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
Speak English they weren't even born

289
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
In the UK

290
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
There now you're in

291
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Disappointed

292
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Most

293
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Of the sea

294
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Security

295
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Airport

296
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Charles de Gaulle Airport

297
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Muslim

298
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
Hardcore

299
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
Kissing Muslims

300
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Women

301
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
And they're running security

302
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
And then upload

303
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
This this line of thinking is consistent

304
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
Without

305
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,615
What is an alarming number of Muslims

306
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
Everywhere for alley

307
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,967
Police chases

308
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,551
Farming for him

309
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,391
He's alarm fire by Muslim women in the pool supply shop

310
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:13,279
Muslim cop would be alarming to him so I don't I don't trust your Calculus here

311
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Yeah yeah

312
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,399
No matter what you know what I'm saying

313
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Way

314
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Last of Us

315
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:25,823
Stupid chore compared to the present

316
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,151
It must be pointed out in stress

317
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,759
I'm not saying

318
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:40,159
I wish I think it's something that we should very much take with us as a reminder

319
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,231
Republicans are acting right now

320
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:48,863
Oh this is something brand-new right now

321
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
Republican Party

322
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,447
Just like Alex it was f****** b****

323
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:57,311
Yeah yeah I think you could get into interesting argument about like

324
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
How much of it is

325
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
Always been there in

326
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Allowed to

327
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,711
Become public and how much is it was

328
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
Maybe something

329
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,087
Denver racism because of

330
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,903
The the ways the Trump

331
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,975
Frames things that Trump

332
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,303
I wonder if Alex doesn't interesting thoughts about this episode

333
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
We'll see you later

334
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,935
Interesting at this point in 2016

335
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Alex

336
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
Honestly this hasn't changed

337
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,543
Alex believes

338
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
Cover news about Infowars

339
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,431
Course whatever Infowars in the news

340
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,759
You don't want to make the story about your

341
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,111
Present today and turns out he also says that

342
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,719
In 2016 when he's getting ready to cover news about himself

343
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
Started about a week ago

344
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
And I never even covered it

345
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Infowars

346
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Real blinds

347
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
That we are the

348
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
Because I

349
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
Want to just be a Gonzo journalist

350
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:13,343
Myself

351
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,720
That's a good belly laugh right now that feels good

352
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,304
Present-day Alex

353
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,704
On and on about his own personal truck love it love it

354
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,008
By the southern district of New York

355
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:36,640
Resolve

356
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Certainly

357
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:44,576
Except for the ways in which it is a Rosetta Stone

358
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Turns out

359
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
So it turns out

360
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,768
Show you how insane 2016

361
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
Incycle was

362
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,096
I didn't remember this happening

363
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,192
Something that should have been disqualified on its face

364
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
Coming up at the bottom of the hour I will see

365
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
A few minutes on this whole

366
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
Klamath Falls

367
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,712
Southern Oregon Northern California

368
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
Contour

369
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
With headlines

370
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
The news

371
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
The last week

372
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
McDonald's

373
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
He has been

374
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
Caught red-handed

375
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,328
Using Infowars material

376
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
That there is a

377
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
That were built

378
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
Why what

379
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,576
Farmers in Northern

380
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,600
California

381
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
Southern

382
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
And

383
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
You could

384
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
Julian Tire

385
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
College education

386
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
On medium

387
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
Medium

388
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
Deception

389
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Gustoff

390
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
He couldn't

391
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,312
So Alex is mad about an article that came out on June 4th in salon

392
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,456
Infowars as a source at a campaign rally in Fresno California

393
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,528
Full disclosure my dad's family is from Fresno

394
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,832
No offense to the good people that happen to live there

395
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
But suck at City

396
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,232
At the rally Trump denied there was actually a drought

397
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
In California

398
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:34,400
The only reason the water was because there was an EPA rule that required

399
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Some of this water

400
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,568
Flushed back into the San Francisco Bay to maintain ecosystem there

401
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
This is true

402
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,432
Water park

403
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,784
But the scale of this water flushing out of clothes

404
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
In a drought

405
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:56,928
According to the salon article the use of water in this way can take up to 800,000

406
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
Acre-feet of water per year

407
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
Which sounds like a

408
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,816
California water system

409
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,400
Managers over 40 million acre-feet of water a year

410
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
Perspective

411
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,776
Nah that's almost like what point 5%

412
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,616
Percentage water

413
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,688
And it's not just flushed out to the Bay for no reason

414
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,088
Part of it is to protect endangered species

415
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,672
Nobody cares but also preserving the waterways around the coast

416
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
Is really important

417
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,816
Because a large part of those cities their economies involved

418
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,936
Yeah around that it's a balancing system resource management

419
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,776
Cycle System that exists

420
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Ecology

421
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,152
Right and so like you can do this whole grandstanding about like this

422
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:55,552
Small amount of water is being rerouted used for Farms that are in need

423
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,672
These ecosystems collapse than these Fisheries die

424
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:05,280
Obama Crosby's Fisheries

425
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:12,960
Alex posted an article on Infowars that was abroad attack on the EPA that oversimplify the issue

426
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,824
Water was a large difference in terms of drought conditions the California was facing

427
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,664
And that it was done just because the Looney left wanted to protect a little fish

428
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,248
This is because the story was never about

429
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
It was about

430
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,672
Pain of the drought being used to fuel the machine that the right-wing needed to attack government regulation

431
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,256
It's unclear if I actually got this news from Infowars

432
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
The article is just Alex

433
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Riposte

434
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Did something

435
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,864
Second article

436
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Psycho-Pass release papers

437
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:46,496
But it's probably safe

438
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
A Dorito

439
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,408
Points

440
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,480
So you can make your own conclusion about where you think you might have

441
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:05,696
Messed up thing that happened everybody knew everybody

442
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:10,816
Everybody f****** new guys we are

443
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
Because of us

444
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Oh man

445
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,264
Brutal episode

446
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,384
Immediately undercut

447
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:34,112
He's complaining about how the family is under attack

448
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Family never exist

449
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
Father

450
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,304
It never really

451
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Existed

452
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
There are you coming out

453
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424
And I was always really a village

454
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Which is true

455
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
That was your other

456
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
What

457
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,784
Watching your kids can't be under front yard or backyard

458
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
Two seats they kill the village

459
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
Artificial

460
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
System

461
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
And then they tell us the state

462
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,536
Good save good save

463
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:19,168
It's more than just a nucleus

464
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,752
Okay

465
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,312
Are the new Village

466
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,384
And then they tell you it's not good to hit your kids

467
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
Yeah

468
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,248
That's a great that's a great trait

469
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,856
They say you can't let your neighbors watch your kids and then they're like don't hit him

470
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,440
What how do you say what everybody knows that the progression

471
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:48,352
Little little bit

472
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,008
I like those moments a lot Alex's brains

473
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
Alex

474
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,736
Is it I would say that the beginning of this episode is largely

475
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,064
Centered around Aslam

476
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,392
There are two driving things that

477
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,440
Make this up

478
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
The Varsity narrative

479
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,768
Of this episode this is not one of the

480
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
This is sort of

481
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
A garnish at the beginning

482
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,888
Then Germany

483
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,752
Alright for now we're still dwelling in the space where Alex's

484
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,104
Wdi text me because they're scared

485
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
Donald Trump's house

486
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
Hey hey

487
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
You're so scared of what we cover

488
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
They're so freaked out

489
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
Dlg

490
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
Sofrito

491
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
Beautiful he's not saying the Deep state

492
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,752
Bednar meme hasn't really taken

493
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,432
Because it back then it was still the regular government

494
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,504
Yeah the government sucking up

495
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,832
She didn't have to create a 28 government

496
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
So

497
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
Alex

498
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,768
And like the hard-hitting news that he covers

499
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
You know

500
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,352
Great I appreciate the pets

501
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
How he has to experience

502
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:30,240
When is take a step back and you considered

503
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
The stories that you're promoted

504
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,592
What are the things that you're taking your time to cover

505
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,920
Just doesn't make sure it doesn't make sense

506
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,712
Stories

507
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
We also have another

508
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
Dot-com right now

509
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Video

510
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
Obese woman

511
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
EBT card

512
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
That's

513
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,144
That's the story you're pushing

514
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,312
Because apparently the local news wherever that was enough

515
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,848
People on site on site

516
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,640
What is they needed the assist

517
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,272
Flabbergasted and up next

518
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,600
Cat learns how to ride a skateboard

519
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,672
I don't

520
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:24,000
Know if that's an important story

521
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,328
To cover it unless all you're trying to do is demonized

522
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,400
People who are dependent on

523
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,472
Program

524
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:39,104
Just a very idea of social welfare

525
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,896
What June sometimes y

526
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,944
16 nothing else was going on

527
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
I'm pretty sure that nobody was even talking about this

528
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
Supreme Court for Auntie

529
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Hey Jordan

530
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:53,184
Not know if it was

531
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
Would not know

532
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:00,864
You know that I was mad about Solange

533
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,912
Route to use in Germany

534
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
Amanda here

535
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:08,032
Is the big hairy p****

536
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
So exciting

537
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,688
Rodger Stone did not

538
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
Tell me

539
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
To the

540
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
VP choice

541
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
Donald Trump is

542
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Ford

543
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Vice president

544
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
But

545
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
He did

546
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
Concur with

547
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
My per

548
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Prediction

549
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
It will be

550
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
At this point

551
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
When the shortlist

552
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
Stone and

553
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
It doesn't talk bad about

554
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
TV in battle

555
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,368
The campaign

556
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
It really is just

557
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Trailmanor

558
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
Right now

559
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
Butler

560
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,704
He goes on television says that he's heading up

561
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
That is not the

562
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
They brought in former

563
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,360
Comp lawyers

564
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
Background check

565
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,968
And research on who Trump

566
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,296
So this is really interesting

567
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,088
Teasing out

568
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,672
Like there's a big scoop here possibly about Trump's VP pick

569
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,488
Because we're in the present

570
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,280
Are the future from this episode

571
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,912
And I was really fascinated

572
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,192
To know

573
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
Does he think it's going to be

574
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,568
Yeah

575
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:51,968
F*** yes this is this is I can't wait to see what the discussion was all about

576
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:58,368
Essentially telling them telling Alex that the actual camp

577
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:04,768
Campaign manager for Trump is just a booking guy is still running

578
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
Different

579
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,448
Yeah alright one is the disappointment I'm about to show

580
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,008
He understands Showmanship

581
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,544
Like he's teasing this

582
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
Latency s***

583
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
About specific

584
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
Until the end

585
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:27,296
Get you interested by this thing may or may not have

586
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,392
Just rambling about it immediately

587
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:37,792
Are you telling me that you're teasing this information

588
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,376
You're not just going to hear the next five minutes being him talking all about it

589
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,960
And then the five minutes after that beating him teasing as if he pretends like

590
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:51,360
He didn't talk about it he doesn't say a name you didn't say anything that would give you any

591
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:56,224
Location of like it's time to pay it off

592
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
This is like Bass

593
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,528
Security light

594
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
How old

595
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
School

596
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Wrestling would be

597
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:06,464
You guys fighting each other you keep them away from each other

598
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,512
You don't give away the fight for free

599
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,584
And I was just giving it away until until

600
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
Well done

601
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,424
Well done the second thing is really interesting to

602
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,472
Deceive that Alex Corey Lewandowski

603
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
Because he hates

604
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,824
All of the people who he perceives to be the media

605
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,128
People keep in trouble way from him

606
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,504
They're the people that should really like me

607
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,320
Pizza bread Pascal

608
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:37,696
It's because they're the people act like you can project

609
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
He is a reject

610
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,328
Want to talk to him

611
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
You can be like oh it's

612
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,400
It's f****** Lewandowski

613
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:51,520
Innocence though maybe in 2016 before Trump actually wins

614
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,104
They probably did have to like keep him away

615
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,640
You know like that

616
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,944
They probably were like

617
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:05,600
No do you have to talk to Alex and Rogers over here in his ear like

618
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,648
Workout Alex

619
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,440
Galaxy

620
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
You'll love it

621
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
It'll be great I'll get you a job there

622
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
Yeah I would say it

623
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:19,168
Probably more likely that they have to do more of it

624
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
For sure

625
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,496
So Alex has

626
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,776
Three names

627
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
But

628
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Corey Lewandowski

629
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,152
Rochester

630
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,688
And then

631
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
No but

632
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,784
Rodger had a pretty severe reaction

633
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,088
Rodger

634
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
And Stone

635
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
Galt

636
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
Such a character

637
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,120
You just said well you should have made it

638
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
Visibly

639
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
And was concerned

640
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
Oh my God

641
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,288
Sir Rodger Gault

642
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:07,040
Switches

643
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:11,136
Did you just say that I might have a pair of Threes go

644
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,816
Rodger Dupree severe reaction to Alex aiono

645
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,936
Radu's in Germany but it turns out he's not alone

646
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,216
We got robbed

647
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,496
Josh Owens

648
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
What's left

649
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,080
For the next 10 days

650
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
Bilderberg kicks off on

651
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
On Thursday

652
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,944
Is there

653
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,040
Really interesting cuz Josh Owens is the guy who is

654
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
Left Infowars

655
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:45,184
And an article for the New York Times magazine about how you regrets working there

656
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:53,120
Regret getting that sweet ass vacation to Germany for 10 f****** days

657
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:58,496
That's not bad as having a great time

658
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:04,896
Yeah it doesn't seem like it would be working text to

659
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,944
Every now and again

660
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,224
Part of your job is to

661
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,600
To say things that aren't true don't even do the job and that's something

662
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:18,720
He even has brought up about how they manufactured

663
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
Situations in order to

664
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,864
Create Optics

665
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,472
He is there I I just think like

666
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:35,872
This will be one of those times where I actually maybe would want to talk to an Infowars but like oh yeah

667
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
So then I realized

668
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:43,808
Still probably couldn't trust that I would ever

669
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,136
Call Debbie Whitlock.

670
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,440
It's 10 days

671
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,792
3 hours

672
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,584
6 hours of b-roll

673
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
And there

674
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
For 10 days

675
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
What else do you have to

676
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:03,264
Not on location in Drive

677
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,824
Sometime

678
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,664
He talks about how he's got this

679
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,504
Video with Rodger coming up later where they talk about the VP

680
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,808
This is pre-recorded

681
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,648
Alex talks about recording

682
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
These segments

683
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,816
Kiko's way out of his way to talk about some personal ship with Rodger

684
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,864
That makes me fairly uncomfortable

685
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,144
And I honestly think

686
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,448
Is maybe an intentional

687
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
To try and humanize somebody

688
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:41,664
Is a f****** scummy weirdo a******

689
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
I was here

690
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Saturday

691
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
3

692
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Different segments

693
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,064
Saturday Sunday

694
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
And then today

695
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,112
On big topic

696
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,672
The real reason he came to town

697
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Was

698
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,768
To discuss baseball

699
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,072
And fill me on a lot of things off

700
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
On the record

701
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
Temporary

702
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
6 months ago

703
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,800
A few months ago and came back

704
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
Boston Texas

705
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,920
Obviously that I got and I can't talk about it

706
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
We were

707
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Talking about

708
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
You got a call from his wife

709
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
And it's nice re-roll mother

710
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
Had to come home from hospital

711
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
And I just

712
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
It looks you going to die any day now but she

713
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,400
Excruciating pain lung cancer

714
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
We're going to

715
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,704
Give her morphine

716
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
She wants it

717
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
And

718
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
You should have seen a minute or two

719
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
And Heat

720
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,272
Got the phone

721
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
My mother while she's all there

722
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,904
Morphine

723
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
Superhot

724
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
Probably.

725
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
Next 48 hours

726
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
I'm going to go finish the prompt

727
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
Speech on Sunday

728
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,304
I'm going to leave early.

729
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
McCloud Sunday morning

730
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
Afternoon

731
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,680
He pulled himself up

732
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,240
Pulling self up

733
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
We came in earshot

734
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Shagman

735
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,312
I went out to lunch

736
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
Talk about his mother

737
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,128
Am I right ladies

738
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:23,296
Why are like this is weird that is weird I would feel because I will Rodger just as a person

739
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
Hey man

740
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,696
Don't talk about my personal s*** like that on your shoe

741
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,720
Yeah

742
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
Talk about

743
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,584
Private I think we've talked about

744
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,984
Hey like without you bring it up first I was going to know.

745
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,848
It's not it's not appropriate this is someone else's business right

746
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:50,176
I'm not a psychopath who doesn't

747
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
Experience emotion

748
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,016
Seems like other human beings

749
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,808
Man way to tell a good story

750
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,088
That makes me look

751
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:03,488
Very good thank you for not sharing the

752
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:08,096
Can I reach through my phone

753
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
And pull the plug on

754
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:15,008
I don't want to speculate about like him being that kind of a crass or like a cold dick but like

755
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
It's

756
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
So

757
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,360
And I don't

758
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,896
Comfortable about that

759
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,432
It's not appropriate

760
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
So anyway

761
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,784
It turns out that they discontinued

762
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,624
And

763
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,328
Text me about 3:15 last night my mom just died

764
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
Thanks pal frog

765
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,424
About time

766
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,960
Woken up

767
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
Hunter classic

768
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:53,663
What is the guy

769
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,039
This is a real story about their interaction

770
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:07,231
No it is just difficult

771
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,535
Like I don't have any problem with the

772
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,839
Story and I I appreciate people

773
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:16,191
Supporting each other have a problem

774
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,983
There's no indication

775
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:24,383
Rogers go ahead and tell my business business on the street

776
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,687
He was actually his source for this

777
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,479
Alex's

778
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:34,879
Bagger keeping other people's personal business office shows good

779
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,463
So sjws are a concern

780
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,047
Jordan 16

781
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:46,399
Interview listen to this clip he's talking about a viral video

782
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,191
They did come out a couple months

783
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Breyer

784
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:55,359
And you'll see how sjw social justice Warrior is really a proxy for Alex

785
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
Text to talk about race

786
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Justice

787
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,479
Warrior model is going

788
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
San Francisco

789
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,343
Few months ago there at the college

790
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903
Young

791
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
Freshman

792
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,023
Hazard

793
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
All the fake

794
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Culture soup

795
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
How's my home

796
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,607
Hollywood even

797
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
With a

798
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,007
Polyps

799
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
Pull up

800
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:25,823
City dialect

801
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
If you're going down

802
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
And the video

803
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
Just says it all

804
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
It's just an excuse

805
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Enas

806
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
Ashley evil

807
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
Mean Thug

808
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:46,815
That was white water rafting

809
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
Just be like

810
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
Alright I know that's a big

811
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,167
That's a big rock

812
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:55,519
Valkyrie

813
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,335
Trendy alright got around that rock

814
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:03,711
There's a viral video 2016 this year college student

815
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:08,319
Francisco's State arguing with

816
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,391
And the woman felt that this was cultural appropriation

817
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:17,279
This is what 100% not a story that needs to be covered by a national Outlet

818
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
Learn how to skateboard

819
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,631
There was a tiny bit of physicality between them but it's

820
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:28,031
Genre of people blocking each other not even close to violence or fighting like Alex's describing

821
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,311
Beat them up

822
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:34,943
This is the kind of discussion that should be allowed to be had

823
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,807
Vulnerability

824
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:43,391
And hopefully they can both Come Away with a better understanding of

825
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,671
Other people's perspective

826
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,255
This is one of the very important things that college environments

827
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Facilitate

828
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
Is people from

829
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Tons of different culture

830
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
Pictures of backgrounds

831
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
Come together

832
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
In one place to learn

833
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,959
That should be an intense

834
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
Broad

835
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,543
And unfortunately that's a process

836
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:05,151
It's not always free of hiccups

837
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,015
I misunderstand

838
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:13,855
And hopefully if in a healthy environment

839
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,159
You can facilitate those sorts

840
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,695
Clashes

841
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,255
If you want to call it

842
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,815
They can lead to growth they can lead to

843
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,631
Something better that's the thing that

844
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,399
Most

845
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,471
White conservatives are afraid of

846
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,847
I left from

847
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,639
Homogeneous place

848
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:42,271
And was suddenly thrust into cultures from everywhere that I've never experienced

849
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,831
And then whatever Anderson

850
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
And my parents alike

851
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,743
I realize this is what I'm talking about

852
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,791
22in extent

853
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,631
Beef environment where people can

854
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
Assess

855
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,727
Their reactions to things that confuse them

856
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,287
4 into them

857
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,567
It is a growing

858
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,967
And this sort of a conversation between someone with dreadlocks

859
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
This is cultural appropriation

860
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:17,855
Is a is a really great example of a conversation that the two of them could have

861
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,975
You'd hope

862
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
Conflict isn't inherently bad

863
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:32,959
So I watched the video and I cannot possibly imagine hosting a new show and picking this was something that I should cover

864
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:37,311
Let alone again months later

865
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,151
Alex

866
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,455
Especially couching is language

867
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,039
There's a proxy for him to talk about that

868
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,671
Adopted all the fake culture superimpose by Hollywood

869
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
Do they meet up

870
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,535
Social justice Warrior inner-city

871
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,119
Black women

872
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
Pork chicken

873
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,447
Who are looking for excuses to be quote

874
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
Nasty evil meme songs

875
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,567
It's pretty broad stop when you really get down to it

876
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,383
Play another video

877
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,735
And that is that I was just reporting on a fake version of what happened

878
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:23,903
According to an article of the Golden Gate Express Wichita long before this episode was recorded So Alex has every reason to be aware of

879
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Scared at all

880
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:28,767
This video did not include the entire exchange between the guy with dreadlocks

881
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:36,447
Woman in the video who I will leave Anonymous out of courtesy claim

882
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,263
Watch Pastor while she was handing out flyers

883
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:44,383
She made a passing joke about his dreadlocks to her friend then the dreadlocks guy called

884
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,199
All of which was not included in the video

885
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:53,855
This sequence of events is verified by multiple other students who were there and saw the entire incident

886
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,903
Captured the second half of their Exchange

887
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,463
This woman

888
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,327
Is it on her way

889
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,351
Because garbage

890
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
Garbage

891
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:14,079
Everywhere was recorded by another student who posted online

892
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
Control black student

893
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,687
Attacking a white guy for having dreadlocks

894
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:24,319
I was reporting on this shoddy framing of this video because that's the story he wants to tell

895
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,391
The stories that centers around the whites

896
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
Innocent

897
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,463
Possibly misled by culture victim

898
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:35,327
In the black student does an out-of-control Thug west of browbeat the white student submission

899
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
It's a fake

900
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
Story

901
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,911
Alex

902
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,471
Because how they feel when they see someone getting

903
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,007
Trouble for saying the n-word

904
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,287
Or they see people's

905
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,871
Suggesting the Confederate flags

906
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:53,759
That feeling is real to them and the edited version of this video provides the story that they need

907
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,575
Do you need to hear that

908
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:01,439
His feelings they have two pics reality reality isn't going to justify my feelings

909
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,767
I will make reality Justified

910
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,119
Months before April

911
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:14,751
Actually March the video came out by April

912
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,287
The write-ups about

913
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,615
Circumstances capture everything

914
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
I mean

915
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
Here we are in June

916
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
Story doesn't rise to the level of Alex

917
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,903
If something's there

918
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,695
Campus Folk

919
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,255
Who are in positions of

920
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,071
Maybe

921
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:45,471
Facilitated conversation between the two of them in a safe environment

922
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,495
You don't need

923
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,775
F****** racist

924
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
Ding dong

925
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,335
Right-wing talk show host

926
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,407
Turning this into some kind of important

927
00:49:53,919 --> 00:50:00,063
Staging ground of a culture War share that Rush Limbaugh needs to be involved in any and all

928
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,463
Disagreements on most college campuses I don't think so

929
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,511
Choose interactions between white students in

930
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,583
Black students it's strange that it snowed only those

931
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,375
Situations but I guess

932
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,215
They are uniquely qualified to mediate those right then

933
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:23,615
Coming from the other direction

934
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:29,503
What is a left-wing version of Alex

935
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,831
The story is

936
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:39,231
Yeah look at this this woman yelling at this guy's house

937
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,583
A nationally syndicated

938
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,167
To be taking on as an issue there's only one thing to say

939
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Which is

940
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
Come on guys what

941
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,263
EXO

942
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,567
So I needed to get worse

943
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:58,431
Spears Alex talking about her friend

944
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,455
You are both

945
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
Weather

946
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
Supremacist

947
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
I don't care

948
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,599
Weather in Salida bring it up

949
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
Call Black

950
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
Getting in the

951
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,887
That white kid

952
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,447
That white nerd

953
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,519
Maybe

954
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
20%

955
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
African

956
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,079
Yikes

957
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:31,967
What race is people when they're not sure of what words they can or cannot say

958
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,807
And so they're like well I'm going to go out of my way to

959
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,111
Almost always are then like

960
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,671
I don't even know if these people are black

961
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,487
Yeah I see that they are not races

962
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,767
Is diet

963
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:51,167
They don't look like to me did you just hold on what you're saying that these people

964
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,703
20% African

965
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,263
So they're not black enough

966
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,823
What percent

967
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,639
Dwight do you think those nerd

968
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,991
How do you define 98%

969
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:11,135
Let's get into your definition I didn't say black because I'm not a racist

970
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:14,207
I just said that 20% of a person is

971
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,839
Interesting relationship with racism at this point

972
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
Is career

973
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,399
Because there's

974
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,983
Still kind of a balancing act that he's trying to put on

975
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,031
Bucky really wet

976
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:28,799
Tea Party

977
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,359
A very racist

978
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,895
Pretend that that's not

979
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,479
He has a real vested interest

980
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,015
Appearing

981
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
He says

982
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,975
Play Frasier

983
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,791
Aries

984
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:54,911
Is though he's like proud of himself for navigating the choppy Waters of race

985
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:01,055
Look at how great I am

986
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,359
Here's another attempt

987
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,919
The media has Party Movement

988
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
That's racist

989
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,015
Anyone promoting free market

990
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:12,063
Wherever You Are

991
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,599
Aldi control

992
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,879
Global of programming

993
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,951
They're telling you your role

994
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,743
Telling you who you are

995
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,327
You're a woman so you support Gloria Steinem

996
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
Your black

997
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
Hispanic

998
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,031
Because Trump pointed out that

999
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,055
Mexico's completely

1000
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,591
Remote control border

1001
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,895
It says it wants to conquer the Southwest

1002
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,991
A bunch of people

1003
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
They're racist

1004
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,575
Absolutely

1005
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,647
What

1006
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Look

1007
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
Nobody

1008
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:56,095
You're just being told there's no other

1009
00:53:56,351 --> 00:54:02,495
There's no way for you to guess

1010
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:08,895
Only 10% what are you going to do leave a party cuz

1011
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:15,295
10% of them are Nazis come on come on that's what happened with Hitler and now

1012
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,879
Weird

1013
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
Defense

1014
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,695
Sigi's engaging in

1015
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
I am not

1016
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,743
Sure

1017
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:30,143
I like I like the idea you could confess to a crime but if you just say it like you're not confessing the cops will be like

1018
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
You got it

1019
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,519
Yeah

1020
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:39,871
I didn't kill him though

1021
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,151
About 10%

1022
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
Racism

1023
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,967
Very high

1024
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:50,367
Very high seems to high positions that you know maybe if those 10% were in positions of power right now

1025
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,391
We could assume that that

1026
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:56,511
That you know they're totally fine with 10% racism

1027
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:00,351
As long as it was also a group that was willing to

1028
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
To discuss

1029
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:06,751
That the sort of unexamined parts of their belief system that includes

1030
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:11,359
If there was a willingness to hear other viewpoints

1031
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:17,759
I think everybody given ourselves we just are not aware of that needs

1032
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,039
He brought to our attention

1033
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,831
It's something very

1034
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,623
Sort of a part of Modern Life

1035
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,207
There's a race politics

1036
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
Texas being played

1037
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,815
It has to do with

1038
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,119
Using minority somehow

1039
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,703
Try before but with white

1040
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,751
It did not work out

1041
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,287
So Alex talked about this a little bit

1042
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,591
These are people that use rice baseball

1043
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,871
4

1044
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,151
In the fifties and six

1045
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
Trying to do it

1046
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,039
Because you're the majority

1047
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,087
How to make an acceleration to gender on that

1048
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,415
Because whites on average will still be

1049
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
Per capita

1050
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
The wealthiest group

1051
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
Because they

1052
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,255
Had the brainchild of

1053
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
They were taught

1054
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,071
Save money

1055
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Now they'll have

1056
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,143
By the political

1057
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,215
They will go into a hardened defense mode

1058
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
And a new

1059
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,519
Shut up

1060
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,311
Over everyone else

1061
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:19,967
Interesting theories also they were taught to save money as an interesting way to say they were allowed to participate

1062
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,391
Writing

1063
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:32,255
To save money the other people weren't allowed to have

1064
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:37,375
So they had a lot more money to save you could like

1065
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,935
There might heal your money fake

1066
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:46,335
Facebook and put it in the bank for you generational wealth in a way

1067
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:51,711
Yourself

1068
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
I think undergirds

1069
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,439
So much more of this than than what people are really talking

1070
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,487
So many of these people

1071
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,511
On the right

1072
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:08,607
Are genuinely I think in favor of of that kind of

1073
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,887
Thunderbird

1074
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,447
Because

1075
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
They think

1076
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,519
If they were in black people's

1077
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,871
They would obviously already have killed everyone in the country

1078
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,943
Because they would never allow themselves to be treated so Tara

1079
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,247
So they assumed they black people

1080
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:31,647
Given the opportunity to put their bootheel on top of them would treat them the exact same way that wifey

1081
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
They think they have it coming

1082
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,487
And that's why they're fighting against

1083
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:42,143
Yeah I think I think that there's something to that mentality so conscious or consciousness

1084
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:48,543
Alarming number of touches on maybe not explicitly

1085
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,591
At that seem does run through something

1086
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,127
Is is conversation about

1087
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,431
You know about the ways in which

1088
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:59,807
If white people become minority they'll be oppressed it does sound a lot

1089
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,879
Like well you're reflecting what

1090
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:06,719
Minority experience in this country

1091
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887
Do you

1092
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,423
That's abuse

1093
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,495
That's that is

1094
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,543
System is coming

1095
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,567
Right

1096
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
This is interest

1097
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,943
This is really interesting the way Alex frames this

1098
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,967
Progression

1099
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
In 26

1100
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,271
Then down the road

1101
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,087
Will be shot

1102
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,367
Down in the Hole

1103
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,767
If you're not signing up

1104
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,791
Newsletter

1105
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
Infowars

1106
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,607
Dot-com newsletter you really need sister

1107
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,751
Sounds does add pivots to his newsletter

1108
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,287
At this point which is fun

1109
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:59,455
Great Notion that he also he also sells his supplements but it is

1110
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
Who played very weird to hear that

1111
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:07,391
But what he's saying is apartheid system becomes into place and then that will collapse

1112
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,975
Apps or that'll ABS Ackley

1113
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,255
Societal collapse

1114
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,607
Societal collapse is coming

1115
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
And we haven't had that apartheid system

1116
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,935
So

1117
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,215
Societal collapse

1118
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,519
Can come from any direction really seems like

1119
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:28,127
Use ability to assess what the global is to do in might be faulty

1120
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,455
Hey because we're all just making this up

1121
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,991
They skipped a step

1122
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,271
What's up what did you need

1123
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,319
You skip the clip before

1124
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,415
I want to try

1125
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,487
Alex talks about he's got robbed

1126
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:46,047
Josh Owens in German

1127
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
The field

1128
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,703
We got robbed

1129
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,727
In

1130
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,007
Germany

1131
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,015
So I listen to that cliff

1132
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,295
I thought it was really

1133
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:10,623
Interesting cuz he's got four people who are on location

1134
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,951
Used to be able to afford to send people all over the world

1135
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,511
Call Dad

1136
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,559
Josh Owens is come out and written

1137
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,839
An article in the New York

1138
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,655
New York Times magazine about how

1139
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:29,055
He regrets working for Infowars she's disappeared

1140
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:34,943
Yeah yeah silence doesn't

1141
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
Me indicates like

1142
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,551
She still looks back fondly

1143
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:43,135
Position is

1144
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:43,903
Gee's Bend

1145
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,927
Very much gone

1146
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:48,255
Joe Biggs

1147
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
I mean he's still

1148
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,887
Sure you still

1149
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,703
In this world but Alex had to let him go

1150
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,495
Three out of the four people

1151
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,055
He has on location are

1152
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,079
Gone

1153
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,615
And that just proves

1154
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:06,687
Rob do is the best employee

1155
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:12,063
Robbie's got blackmail or something

1156
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:12,831
For you

1157
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,623
Guess what I've got robbed

1158
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,695
I don't know what it is but he is yes

1159
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,719
Power

1160
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,279
There

1161
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,095
So Alex has a bare-bones staff

1162
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,727
I am so he wants to really talk about

1163
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
Like really

1164
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
Supporting

1165
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,079
Screw

1166
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
I appreciate it

1167
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,895
Look at it it's great

1168
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
All these gifts

1169
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,687
I think about

1170
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
Reporters whoever

1171
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,527
Somebody on the crew

1172
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,319
And just tell them we know what you think about it

1173
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,111
We love you you can

1174
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:46,879
And hear from us

1175
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
We care about you

1176
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:52,767
Alex you want me to adopt somebody understaffing

1177
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:55,839
Is the Grapevine

1178
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,751
You suck

1179
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:09,407
You're terrible at everything you do your time as the Nightly News

1180
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:15,551
Couldn't even keep a Nightly News show going at Infowars

1181
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
Great deposition

1182
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:21,695
Be a great help with that position as a corporate representative

1183
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:26,559
Maybe one of the worst never say embarrassing to the end

1184
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
Degree

1185
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,143
I don't know probably

1186
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,191
The decent father

1187
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:37,055
Yeah but I don't know come on how else do you stick around for this log

1188
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:43,455
I think you've got black marijuana or something

1189
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,247
Tech Automotive

1190
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,111
I don't know I don't know but I think he's terrible at his job

1191
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,647
USD

1192
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,927
To say we really

1193
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
Think about

1194
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,999
I just adopted a highway

1195
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:01,887
The Highwayman

1196
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,431
So Alex

1197
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,271
Talking about Trump

1198
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,575
But at the same time

1199
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,855
He's not

1200
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,951
As I don't know

1201
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:30,047
No certainly not he's into drop indefinitely

1202
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:30,815
Terminal A

1203
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,679
The Trump hat

1204
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,727
Most powerful weapon

1205
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,031
Donald Trump has it

1206
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,055
Correct

1207
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
His Allegiance speaks

1208
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,919
Just pushing basic common sense

1209
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,735
It's that

1210
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,575
I've seen the raw footage

1211
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,367
Cam

1212
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,695
It's got to be

1213
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,511
Percent of the people going in the door

1214
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
Hispanic

1215
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,095
And

1216
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
It's got to be

1217
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,399
10-20-30

1218
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
Center Bar

1219
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,335
Because

1220
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,615
Is racism narrative

1221
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,895
The thousandth degree

1222
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,687
Quite frankly

1223
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,039
Common sense

1224
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:27,903
People that have it

1225
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,975
Hey I'm scared

1226
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,791
Which I would call racism is just called normal tribal

1227
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,399
That's weird

1228
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,215
Weird

1229
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:47,615
Trump has his disposal

1230
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,455
I don't know if those numbers are good

1231
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,015
I think he was arguing that almost

1232
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:58,111
50% of trump rallies were non-white no more because

1233
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:04,511
60 to 60%

1234
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:12,447
It was a menorah T of white people

1235
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,495
Footage that I've seen

1236
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,031
Beers like it's a lot of weight

1237
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:22,431
I've seen a sea of white but I don't know

1238
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,063
I don't know

1239
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:34,463
I don't know Cal State jerseys you busy taking every individual in rallies and determining

1240
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,791
Whether or not their minority enough for him

1241
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:44,191
People who are not glow on glow racist maybe they're saying some things that are like

1242
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:52,895
Normal tribalism

1243
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:56,991
Spots to be scared of other types of people

1244
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:01,343
Now here is where we get a little bit

1245
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,135
The ideas of trump

1246
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:03,903
Kind of

1247
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,951
A lot of the narratives that

1248
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,487
Ford

1249
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
And

1250
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:13,375
Things in that media ecosystem

1251
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,399
A lot of those things

1252
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,423
Probably

1253
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:18,239
Went out of their way to incite

1254
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:24,895
Some racism exist

1255
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:31,295
They got pushed further over that Alex talks about that he's actually pretty clear do you understand

1256
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,855
Compensated racism as a political

1257
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,879
Tool

1258
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,719
Really

1259
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:39,999
People that have it

1260
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,071
Hey I'm scared

1261
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,143
Which I wouldn't call racism is just called normal tribalism

1262
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,007
Put a little bit of

1263
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,335
Pushing them on their side

1264
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:57,151
I'm not even defending I think you went too far

1265
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,479
Amazing

1266
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,855
In June 2016

1267
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:09,951
Did Trump intentionally push some buttons to Insight

1268
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:15,839
Tribal racist ideas and it's fine because the last does that to fuel

1269
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,863
What Trump

1270
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,143
May have gone

1271
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,447
Kuffar

1272
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:24,287
Alex according to Alex Paragon of non racism

1273
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:27,103
Sure let me know we're not going to go so far as to call him anti

1274
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:31,455
2020 Alex be like Trump is never said anything even close to racist

1275
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,991
Yeah I know

1276
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,551
What is what is

1277
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:40,671
Spend

1278
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:43,999
Years say to me that the left doesn't have any men

1279
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:50,911
Remember things

1280
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,935
Cardan

1281
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,567
This is a guy who thinks

1282
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,383
The Trump is going to lose the reason that I think that is

1283
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,431
Because the way this is going

1284
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,991
It doesn't feel committed

1285
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,807
It doesn't feel like Alex is talking about this

1286
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,855
In in the terms of like

1287
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:15,743
I hope that my career is connected to the

1288
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:19,327
He saying he probably push buttons too hard

1289
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,191
Yeah he did

1290
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,519
He's clearly saying that

1291
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,055
The man cynically

1292
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,079
As an electric

1293
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,127
As an election strategy

1294
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,407
Said very racy

1295
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,199
Things in order to incite

1296
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
Braces

1297
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:36,991
To vote for him

1298
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:41,599
That's not okay under any circumstance

1299
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,623
Apparently it is

1300
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,903
Oh okay nevermind then

1301
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,927
So

1302
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:49,279
You texted me earlier when you were talking about suggestions for the daisy episode

1303
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:55,679
Nixon was a great president who didn't use any racist

1304
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
But it didn't work

1305
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
Can white people do

1306
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:02,335
That was weird that was a really strange text to give the

1307
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,407
And you mentioned John the Revelator

1308
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,991
Artex 16

1309
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:12,063
Yes answer here's where

1310
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:12,831
Comes up

1311
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,951
Depeche Mode has the song making fun of

1312
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,255
He's gone

1313
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
From the Muslim

1314
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,303
Sure

1315
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,839
The Muslims didn't

1316
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,375
Hundred

1317
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:28,703
And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

1318
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,471
Of years

1319
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,055
Think I was 302

1320
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,871
John the Revelator

1321
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
It's just

1322
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,671
I love it

1323
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,983
Couldn't even hardly walk

1324
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,615
Bugs that

1325
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,383
Like

1326
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:15,807
In the same way that talkin about this viral video from San Francisco State has no place on a series shows

1327
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:22,207
I would rather listen to Alex struggle with like I love this

1328
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:24,255
Disagree with the message

1329
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,583
Talk about that more

1330
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
Don't you

1331
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:34,751
Where do you see the law to suck at that all the sudden

1332
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:37,823
You just realize this song is a lie

1333
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,383
Blaspheming John the Revelator

1334
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,175
Straight

1335
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:47,807
But that is a struggle video I would like to hear Alex talk about

1336
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,135
A revelatory for him

1337
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,671
Hardly use the word

1338
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,975
So we get to

1339
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,791
The point when Alex is going to Nail Talk

1340
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,095
To Rob do location

1341
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,631
In Dresden Germany

1342
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,703
Reflecting on how cool it is

1343
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:10,335
He can be at his studio and Austin and talking to somebody is Buddy in Germany

1344
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:16,735
And bacon broadcast that on the radio and cool really cool realized

1345
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,295
The future looks really cool

1346
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:25,695
He's talking about that video because this is the second banana peel

1347
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,303
100 years ago 1000 years ago

1348
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,607
8 / radio show

1349
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,143
Infowars

1350
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
Radiou

1351
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,847
That have the technology

1352
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:43,871
Does ubiquitous

1353
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
And we can meet in Dresden Germany

1354
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,199
Nationalist

1355
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:47,967
Rally

1356
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,271
Where is she

1357
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
Supremacist

1358
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
Lp1

1359
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,879
Your Country Wide Open

1360
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:55,903
People coming in

1361
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,183
Women telling you got to

1362
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,719
Submit to them I don't see any

1363
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,999
Kenny Knox

1364
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:01,791
So that

1365
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,327
Going on flag

1366
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,119
I don't know that's a naughty

1367
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,447
Associated

1368
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:19,967
I've never seen Millie Weaver

1369
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:29,695
Somebody told me in the past

1370
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,231
Lowe's Bowman

1371
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,535
Skylar Grey

1372
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:37,631
That's Westwood joke of the Alex Jones Show would be

1373
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,655
He has sent

1374
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:44,031
He's reported to a nationalist rally in Germany and clearly his vested interest in showing

1375
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:49,663
And it's not

1376
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
Alright

1377
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,015
Just the tone 280

1378
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,551
Cuz you know what he is worried

1379
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,831
He's mad at Rob

1380
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,367
Is that a josh

1381
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,231
Don't you hear it

1382
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:06,047
Except for the skull in Bones flag

1383
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:12,447
Yeah I think I think you're probably right that is a Optics issue

1384
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:16,287
Also might be just

1385
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,335
A sense of like

1386
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,919
But I don't have either a bunch of those skull Flags

1387
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,503
Okay

1388
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:29,343
The presentation is that this isn't some kind of a f*****-up rally

1389
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:34,975
So now we see this flag that could be Nazi

1390
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,279
We have to preemptively explain

1391
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,327
Bobby the FED there to discredit them

1392
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
There's one of those

1393
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:40,863
Flags there

1394
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:42,911
Shutdown

1395
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,495
Probably just

1396
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,543
Who's there

1397
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,335
So Alex is being a little bit

1398
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,103
Dishonest

1399
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,639
When he talks about this rally

1400
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:59,295
According to Joshua well just two days prior to this episode being recorded large Nazi

1401
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,575
Rally in Dortmund

1402
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:06,975
In the Germany

1403
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:10,815
Those groups many of them explicitly neo-nazis

1404
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,631
Which was met by approximately 5,000 counter.

1405
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:17,471
Strader's

1406
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
Little violence

1407
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,847
My current crisis that was happening around this time was in

1408
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:27,711
Inspiring a real surgeon and closely related sensibilities in Europe

1409
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:31,551
Which were being white washed and sanitized by being called National

1410
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,159
It's hard to say what this rally that Rob is at is actually

1411
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:36,927
At this point

1412
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:42,303
This is on Monday and that's Saturday there was a cheetah

1413
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,351
Which is an extreme right-wing group that is a

1414
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,887
Aggressively anti-islam

1415
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,679
An anti-immigrant in character

1416
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:50,751
Paquita is based in Dresden so it seems like

1417
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,543
Probably another one of their Gathering

1418
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:57,663
Which would mean that it's not some cool rally about people who just loved Germany

1419
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:04,575
It seems possible that they would hold rallies as frequently as this because the guardian reported in 2050

1420
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:10,463
Poquito work against what

1421
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,279
As the islamist islamization

1422
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,047
Of Europe

1423
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:20,703
It's hard to say for sure at this point but it will be confirmed later

1424
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:23,519
Go to Germany to whitewash

1425
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
Explicit xenophobic fashion

1426
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,591
Yeah that does sound right

1427
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,383
We're we're in a real molyneux

1428
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,175
Kind of situation

1429
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:32,735
Yeah just change the country

1430
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,783
So Alex's

1431
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:39,903
Did seen this video all around the world

1432
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:46,559
Together it's a create a One World Government

1433
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:49,375
Alex is this video going on Skype

1434
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,679
It turns out

1435
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,727
Another thing that's been consistent

1436
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:54,751
Describe don't work

1437
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,031
Walter Scott

1438
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,223
Before I go any further though

1439
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,503
Obviously

1440
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,783
Expensive to have

1441
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
Joshua

1442
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,367
Who's about to be there

1443
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,135
In Germany

1444
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:17,023
Alex's Tech issues are consistent but you see a very different response.

1445
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,815
He's not angry

1446
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,351
He's not freaking out

1447
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,167
You look all we got Skype issue we lost the connection

1448
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,447
I'll go to a plug

1449
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,519
What time to tell you how much

1450
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,543
Expensive disease

1451
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,823
And you should buy our product

1452
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,895
That seems like a real irrational

1453
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,967
Normal person hosting a

1454
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:40,831
Play a report I'm leaving

1455
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:41,855
Sometimes

1456
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,623
The Skype is

1457
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
It's not like

1458
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,463
Sometimes the Skype

1459
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
Just goes down

1460
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,023
Nobody Cuts you off

1461
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,303
Yeah nobody turns off your

1462
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,423
Sad Rabon

1463
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,519
You talked about house that morning they've been in another city in Germany

1464
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:02,335
They'd interviewed migrant

1465
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,359
Individual

1466
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,175
And to just be

1467
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,295
40000

1468
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,575
Where the hell's about

1469
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,343
11

1470
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,975
Glad

1471
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,255
Exactly

1472
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,791
That's

1473
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,839
Alex's

1474
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:29,983
You know when I suspect that this is a Poquito rally

1475
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,775
You act like that's going to

1476
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:32,799
Probably

1477
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:38,687
I'm just going to go out on a limb and say that name might be a little too long

1478
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,247
You know as far as I'll leave goes

1479
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,039
Sometimes you want to shorten it down

1480
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,087
You notice it in there

1481
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:48,415
You don't want to go with illegal Invader immigrants from

1482
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:54,815
Play 9 hours Pace, Florida

1483
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,583
Yeah

1484
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,375
I think Alex is a little bit

1485
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,727
By the fact that there was this flag

1486
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:06,335
So he really needs to insist that these people are not

1487
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,871
I know

1488
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:11,967
Is it good if they are fascists

1489
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,759
The great so you got

1490
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,831
People state flag

1491
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
How tall woman

1492
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,879
Just calling crossbones

1493
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,439
That could be fast

1494
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,207
Isis related

1495
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,751
Furthermore

1496
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,311
What's the weather

1497
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,615
Why would you say I'm looking for

1498
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:47,551
Alex is a sneaking suspicion it's just a party

1499
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:52,927
Talking about

1500
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:58,047
This is alien there's one over there

1501
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:03,679
So there's a counter-demonstration

1502
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,215
And

1503
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:10,335
Rob's talking about a little bit

1504
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,615
But you could see me

1505
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:17,759
They got the

1506
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,391
Billy Gunn

1507
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,511
Future down the river

1508
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,095
Show more attention to that blonde police office

1509
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
Get out of here

1510
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,239
Alex is a little harder

1511
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:44,639
The kids say Alex's little horny on Main

1512
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,407
Fire

1513
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,599
I saw this and I was like that

1514
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,415
Alex my man that is

1515
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:02,047
Real like that's what I expect from this guy

1516
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:08,703
Get a little bit closer it's not appropriate

1517
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:13,055
Really fired

1518
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,360
Really horny

1519
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,488
Feel free to ask

1520
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,792
See what she say

1521
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,216
This is like

1522
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:44,800
I'm laughing because this is so outrageous

1523
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,408
Beyond Paradise like you can't imagine

1524
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:55,808
Alex is trying to play this game or haha just kidding

1525
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,344
You should be fired

1526
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,928
This is a fireable offense

1527
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:07,584
Crippling problems of the show he has no boss

1528
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,144
Yeah I can't stop laughing because this is

1529
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,168
As if it's not even

1530
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:14,240
This is just such disgusting Behavior

1531
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:17,056
Yeah so disgusting as Beyond

1532
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,848
Does get worse

1533
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,664
Of course because bra bands of talking

1534
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:26,272
Speaks English

1535
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,040
Detox

1536
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,648
He's actually a pretty sensible interview

1537
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,928
Problem

1538
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,512
The huge problem so also I do appreciate this person because

1539
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,304
They do end up confirming

1540
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,376
Are there two counter-protest of Poquito Valley

1541
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,912
So my suspicion is

1542
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,192
Confirmed by this clip

1543
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,216
English

1544
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:45,984
Alright

1545
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,032
Wisconsin

1546
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,056
Why are you here

1547
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,872
Cheetah is

1548
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,224
Teresa

1549
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,952
So

1550
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,512
They suffocated a rally rally

1551
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,072
We're protesting.

1552
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:14,144
We've seen this happen a number of times in the past

1553
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,424
End

1554
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,544
This phenomenon that happens when good enough job

1555
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:24,384
Conversation with this guy

1556
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,176
Obviously leading

1557
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,200
But

1558
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,248
Alex is not satisfied

1559
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,784
He wants him to hit it with

1560
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,088
Gotcha

1561
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,392
Talking over this interview

1562
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,584
What's the weather

1563
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,056
Amira

1564
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
Oh yes

1565
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,528
Great

1566
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,464
So why ask

1567
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,792
Good question when you can just tell them how he's supposed to

1568
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:15,584
Idiots

1569
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,888
So it's the guy has

1570
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:21,216
Responses that don't fit into the Infowars

1571
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:24,544
Which is supposed to be

1572
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
A trap

1573
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,592
Geisinger

1574
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:31,712
There are other cultures that

1575
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:37,600
Support violence spousal violence

1576
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,880
Proprietary

1577
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,952
And it's not

1578
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:42,976
And that's bad

1579
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,000
Because

1580
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:48,096
You don't want to run away from this interview because he can handle your question

1581
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,632
And at the same time

1582
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,912
You don't have any other

1583
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:54,240
Bro

1584
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:57,056
Discount beginner job later over people that work

1585
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:03,712
Bring up the blonde police officer in Pursuit

1586
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,112
I'm still horny for that cop

1587
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,440
All right now I'm graduating

1588
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,720
From just straight

1589
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:16,000
Misogyny

1590
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,280
And just

1591
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,048
F******

1592
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,608
Patriarchal shoving his behavior

1593
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,888
I'm going to wrap

1594
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,656
That up

1595
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,984
And islamophobic bigotry buddy

1596
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,544
Talk to that tell that

1597
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,592
Cops

1598
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:33,408
But she's going to be in Islamic

1599
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,296
It's interesting because Alex is trying to deflect from this interview not going well

1600
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,880
The same time he's sort of shaming Robbin

1601
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,416
Illustrating like

1602
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:49,024
These are the thoughts that I would have

1603
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,816
You're not as good as me

1604
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,680
Yeah and yeah

1605
01:24:56,192 --> 01:25:02,080
Like very alpha alpha

1606
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:05,152
Boy mentioned earlier there's a surprise

1607
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:05,920
Appearance

1608
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:10,016
And here's where that happened

1609
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,296
This almost

1610
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:13,344
Knocked me out of my chair

1611
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,136
That blonde reporter right behind

1612
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:35,104
What is the f****** wrong in fashion

1613
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,920
Stop today I was expecting

1614
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,968
Today I told you before we started

1615
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:44,832
Recorded that I was listening to everything just kept getting weirder

1616
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,368
A blizzard

1617
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:59,168
Lauren Southern

1618
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,776
All right guys

1619
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:10,176
He starts interviewing or I don't think he was relevant

1620
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:15,040
Start having conversation

1621
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,064
And it gets

1622
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,368
Really clear really quick

1623
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,648
First of all that Lauren

1624
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:24,000
Is aggressively islamist

1625
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,792
Feel so left out

1626
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,632
We're having a conversation

1627
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:33,472
Studio

1628
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:39,872
Anti-immigrant Islam Club Points back and forth and Alex's juicer the Ghost Inside

1629
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,896
Studio

1630
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,224
Kind of sad

1631
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,016
Understanding Islam

1632
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,040
Religion

1633
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,064
Do not erase

1634
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,880
And it's the details.

1635
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
Animal

1636
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,512
I don't know about that

1637
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
Nordstrom

1638
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,984
It's just the really

1639
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,776
Quiet the adults are talking

1640
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:13,920
Really weird because you know doesn't have an earpiece so she can't keep

1641
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,968
He's it's like

1642
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:20,320
He's a toddler like jumping up and grabbing robbed has arm sleeve

1643
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,600
Tell her to be racing

1644
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,744
Yeah yeah

1645
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:32,352
Maybe at might have to just be gassy

1646
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,376
Same here but

1647
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:36,448
It partially I'm going to go ahead and decide to report on air

1648
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:38,496
Them

1649
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,264
EXO

1650
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:45,664
Much like a person who's at the party who goes and sits in the corner to talk to Joshua

1651
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,576
I always busted his butt

1652
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,624
And he's gone shehadi there he's got

1653
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,512
Joking were joking

1654
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:04,352
Ask you questions when you been in German 24 hours already

1655
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,144
What do you want to impart

1656
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,168
What have you picked up

1657
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
In day one

1658
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:09,216
Weather 10-day

1659
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:10,752
Operation

1660
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:11,776
Infowars

1661
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,384
Yesterday

1662
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:23,296
So I don't care about his perspective

1663
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,600
Micro-cap particularly because

1664
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:28,416
He has written an article about how it is time

1665
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:30,208
Infowars vase

1666
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,488
Stories

1667
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:34,560
Incites animus towards

1668
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:37,376
Muslim so

1669
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:40,192
Probably this is

1670
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:42,240
Go fuc yourself

1671
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,544
Do the interview wraps up

1672
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:48,128
Alex has a bit of a story

1673
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,944
Infowars

1674
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:55,040
I don't know how to explain this because

1675
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,576
It doesn't really make sense

1676
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:01,184
At this time there's a lot of talk about the wall

1677
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,744
And so they found

1678
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,584
In Germany that they're calling a medieval Trump wall

1679
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:10,400
What's going on

1680
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,448
Upon

1681
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:14,240
Infowars.com medieval

1682
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,776
Wall found in German

1683
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:18,848
Muslim

1684
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
That's what they do

1685
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,272
It's definitely a religion

1686
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,040
Conquest

1687
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,112
This is so it's

1688
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,904
Listen to his mom with workout

1689
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,952
Yes and just like a base

1690
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,232
This level 90

1691
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:38,816
Frills nothing like yeah not hiding behind anything

1692
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,840
Just

1693
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,376
That's what

1694
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,656
They'd

1695
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:46,752
Just wild

1696
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:52,640
But not surprised

1697
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:55,712
It's almost strange to hear it's so targeted now

1698
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,504
In the context

1699
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,112
2020 it seems like all racism is Now shotgun blasting @alex a10e

1700
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,904
I like f****** non-white

1701
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:08,000
Just do the other matter you know but near its focus

1702
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,536
Austin targeted on just

1703
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,584
Soo

1704
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:17,984
Play existence of women

1705
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,264
I'm just like

1706
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,056
This is a dick

1707
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:25,920
I think what it is is that Alex talks about all of these various things

1708
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,736
Trees in different story

1709
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,784
Yeah supposed to 1

1710
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,880
Hayden Summerall

1711
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,512
So Alex is Varsity the big one is

1712
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,048
Talk about Trump's VP

1713
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:45,632
Yes and now that we've gotten robbed in Germany out-of-the-way

1714
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,680
Alex starts

1715
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,704
Teasing

1716
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,240
Gyros

1717
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,776
Never going to premiere

1718
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,592
Trump VP pick

1719
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,736
But you know when I

1720
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,528
Figure something out for myself I figure it out

1721
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,320
Show and it's not 104

1722
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,392
Stone

1723
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,416
Liberty shed

1724
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,440
95%

1725
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,536
95%

1726
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,560
Little birdies

1727
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,864
I love me and 95

1728
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,888
Percent serious

1729
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,704
He's doing it right he's teasing

1730
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,776
He's doing his job

1731
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:25,312
He's giving you a nice little

1732
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,080
Look

1733
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:26,848
I know

1734
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:27,616
Everybody

1735
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:34,272
Lauren Southern was

1736
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,064
Be out of nowhere

1737
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:41,184
Cameo there was a guest that was surprising

1738
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,232
Guest

1739
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,512
That is surprising

1740
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,816
Tucker Carlson

1741
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,096
What the f***

1742
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,144
Yeah

1743
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:57,824
Episode

1744
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:03,456
Yeah earlier times

1745
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
Had some

1746
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,272
Almost adversarial

1747
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:11,648
Hostel

1748
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:16,000
Mainstream conservative

1749
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:19,072
DeBrands at the time

1750
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,120
I know that I

1751
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:24,192
I don't know if the dates on them but I've seen Tucker

1752
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,984
With Alex

1753
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,312
2016 it seems like

1754
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,616
Too late that's shouldn't

1755
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,944
Tucker would have wanted

1756
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,224
To stay away

1757
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,040
Cuz he has

1758
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:41,088
Some sense about him about like

1759
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:42,624
Optics in

1760
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:46,464
Association she is it just me or is it is

1761
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:51,840
Is being on Infowars not just as easy disqualifying now but it wasn't then

1762
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,936
It should have been

1763
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:00,032
2016 first

1764
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:05,664
It turns out that there are some people who flew under the radar

1765
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,224
Tucker I think people just didn't notice

1766
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,760
Yeah

1767
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:16,160
It was just kind of like a what

1768
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:20,512
Compile this is where I

1769
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:24,352
Episode

1770
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,008
Are running into Lauren Southern on the streets

1771
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,080
Crystal racist but

1772
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:37,664
Far

1773
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:44,832
Tucker Carlson showing up this is weird

1774
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,368
Maybe it's just back then

1775
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,904
Stuff used to happen

1776
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,464
I don't think so this is

1777
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,232
Excite

1778
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:57,632
This is the Fast and Furious of Infowars episode

1779
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:03,008
Starpower listening to other eras of his show

1780
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:05,824
This is not how the show used to be all the time

1781
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,664
This is a good episode that ended up randomly getting picked

1782
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,944
It is still like a

1783
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,480
Sweetly different show

1784
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,760
Buried

1785
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,808
So the reason

1786
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,088
Tucker is on

1787
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,624
Is because

1788
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:24,000
He had gone to a conference or Summit of some sort that involved

1789
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,024
People from

1790
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,048
From Facebook

1791
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,608
Glenn Beck was there

1792
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,656
And it turns out

1793
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,192
Going back

1794
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,472
Wasn't

1795
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:34,752
Cool or something

1796
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,824
Just been kicked off something

1797
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,104
Baby serious

1798
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:49,088
It seems like a great time for the two of them to have a conversation

1799
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:54,720
And so because he was at the summit with Mark Zuckerberg

1800
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:57,792
Mark Zuckerberg

1801
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,376
Photos

1802
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,984
He does look like

1803
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,264
Actually

1804
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
Play Nas

1805
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,568
Huarache without in Prosthetics

1806
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,552
He didn't

1807
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,392
Wolf

1808
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:29,280
I think it was a fake life that's hilarious

1809
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:34,400
Is charming enough to

1810
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:39,776
Alex wants to be funny

1811
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:40,800
I know

1812
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:44,896
So they get to talk about Glenn Beck and Mike down for this club cuz this is

1813
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:47,200
Sowa Mesa

1814
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:49,504
I got to say I mean like

1815
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,808
Tucker Carlson is a smart guy

1816
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:55,136
I think he knows the way the wind blows

1817
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:58,976
He's able to with some

1818
01:35:59,232 --> 01:35:59,744
Competent

1819
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,840
Prophetic present himself in Waze

1820
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,864
But he's not an idiot

1821
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,888
East Phoenix

1822
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:06,912
Like three times

1823
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:13,312
Right like he's Crossfire Hotel guide

1824
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,872
Come back enough times to know

1825
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:21,248
Even in those times

1826
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,528
Herrera

1827
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,064
Now

1828
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,344
Fashion era

1829
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:31,744
You just a shitbag the whole time not somebody who is it is like

1830
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,304
Very clearly much more adept

1831
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,264
He's there because

1832
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:51,200
I think that Tucker makes a lot of good boy

1833
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,480
Honest

1834
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:57,600
Can you make so we're not going to get into too much

1835
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,624
Is

1836
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,440
He's not saying Facebook

1837
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:04,512
Twitter and all these companies need to be destroyed

1838
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:09,120
But there are concerns that we should talk about about the ways in which they engaged

1839
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,656
With foreign government

1840
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,192
Sure

1841
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,008
Laws

1842
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:20,384
Better counter to American laws these companies to operate in foreign countries

1843
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,968
They followed the foreign countries

1844
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,784
He's not saying

1845
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,856
That we need to stop all of it across the board

1846
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:36,000
Vic that's not an invalid conversation

1847
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,376
This point that he makes

1848
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:43,168
When talking about Glenn Beck

1849
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,984
A great

1850
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,264
Great point

1851
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,800
And it follows

1852
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,568
Alex

1853
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:54,176
Making not-so-great a point about why he thinks Glenn back is out to get her

1854
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,712
One time I was there too

1855
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:57,504
Do on others

1856
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
Socks

1857
01:37:58,784 --> 01:37:59,296
High-level produce

1858
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,600
Has their own show on Fox

1859
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:02,880
Also produces stuff

1860
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:04,928
Steak with me at lunch

1861
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,768
And I sat there I love you

1862
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,792
And he looks right up

1863
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,352
Climbing the wall

1864
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:14,400
You're about to be

1865
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:19,776
Last year

1866
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,824
What is he carrying us look

1867
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,872
He runs the whole place

1868
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,408
Kicked out

1869
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,176
You crazy

1870
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,200
But

1871
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:32,832
What was your taking one back

1872
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,376
Talented man

1873
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:49,984
But when

1874
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,288
Play is on radio career

1875
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,080
With some sort of religious

1876
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,480
Understand it

1877
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,272
Mystikal

1878
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:10,208
Hey Tucker I got bad news about the guy you're talking to

1879
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,280
Isn't that interesting though

1880
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,304
It's not

1881
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,328
It's not it's

1882
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:17,120
Interest know it's interesting but it's

1883
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,168
Interesting in that cake

1884
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:21,472
The tweet for everything kind of yeah yeah

1885
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,496
Interesting words like

1886
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,544
You know that they know

1887
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:31,968
Beyond out now

1888
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,272
No absolute tomorrow

1889
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:41,696
I love your Evangelical Outreach

1890
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:44,768
He had Tucker on his show is defended

1891
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:56,288
Alright I get what you're saying here too dumb argument

1892
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:02,432
Based on your brand you would need to protect Alex

1893
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,760
It's it that's really interests

1894
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:08,064
Tucker's is coming from places

1895
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,600
Of humility

1896
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:10,624
Humbleness

1897
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:16,768
Modesty this like he's much more talented than I am radios very hard but

1898
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:18,816
It's nuts

1899
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:20,352
When you take your

1900
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:22,656
Radio thing and make it a religion

1901
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,960
He's just

1902
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:26,496
And Alex says

1903
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,520
Colton

1904
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:32,128
Yeah Alex is responses so obvious

1905
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:35,456
Of course he was mascot to the present-day Alex saying that

1906
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,504
The literal Christian Satan

1907
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,040
The opposition

1908
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:39,808
Drop

1909
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:40,576
I forgot

1910
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:44,160
We have not heard this is the 6660

1911
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:50,560
Nobody has claimed that the devil is running anything out of mention of the devil

1912
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:56,960
Optimus point of anything 666

1913
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:02,592
Or something I don't cut out any mention of isn't it funny the date

1914
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:08,992
One of the reasons this was really refreshing and

1915
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:11,040
Fun to listen to

1916
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,832
Funning Petty quotes

1917
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:19,232
Comparatively to the present day is he's not just yelling about the literal Christian devil

1918
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:25,120
He's not yelling but pedophiles all the time your blood

1919
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,144
It's not that

1920
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:28,192
Tucker's right

1921
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,216
A pink

1922
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:32,032
Do get out of control and completely

1923
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:36,640
Icon will be once you enter that level of things

1924
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:42,016
Ostensibly political show become some sort of a religious mission

1925
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:44,832
Everything you're saying stops making sense yet

1926
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:47,136
Alex's show is

1927
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,952
Probably in some ways motivate

1928
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,000
Is that extremists religion

1929
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:56,096
But it's not as forward facing at this point the actual product

1930
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:56,864
Has like

1931
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,168
Here's a story. Maybe

1932
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:02,240
It's about a dumb viral video

1933
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,264
San Francisco

1934
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,032
But at least

1935
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:04,800
It's something

1936
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:07,104
Happened right you know it's not dry

1937
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:12,224
The devil wants to get you in a basement so we can scare you and drink your children's blood

1938
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:18,624
They're living in the world that ostensibly they've always said they wanted and it turns out it s***

1939
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:21,184
And so you can either

1940
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:26,304
Try and defend your monster president or you can say that the

1941
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,352
The devil is killing him and everybody else's

1942
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:31,680
So evil they are eating children you can order please

1943
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,728
You can only give a value judgment

1944
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:39,360
Your guy by decreasing the value of your enemies

1945
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:45,760
Which is evidence of how shity your diet

1946
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,088
You know the person who pulled the gun

1947
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,624
Yeah

1948
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,904
Tupac

1949
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:57,536
Take this from another level

1950
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:01,632
Everything gets out of control way too f****** fast

1951
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,424
Spends all his time

1952
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,704
With the stakes

1953
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,264
Being this sort of

1954
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,800
Spiritual

1955
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,848
Dichotomy

1956
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:13,920
The Trump

1957
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:15,712
Comes

1958
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:21,600
There's nowhere to escalate it from his after they want

1959
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:24,160
To kill all of your children to drink their blood

1960
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:26,464
Because it's a sacrament to Satan

1961
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:31,072
There isn't another level about that

1962
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:37,728
Until Trump actually sacrifices that kid to Satan and then they have to find a new way to make the left even worse

1963
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,496
Where's the mat

1964
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:42,848
I guess like you can make history altogether how bad a Republican

1965
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:45,920
Governance is by how evil they have to make the left

1966
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:47,968
It's a very simple correlate

1967
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,856
The more the Republicans go out of their way to

1968
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,904
Escalade how terrible the left

1969
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,208
If you look at the Republican National Converse

1970
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:01,280
Convention now you know how terrible

1971
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,048
Trump is

1972
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,328
Compared to

1973
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,352
Just f****** but

1974
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,888
Just as Bush wasn't like

1975
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,168
If you don't vote for me

1976
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,448
The world will

1977
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,008
Yeah

1978
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,800
None Shall walk

1979
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:13,568
The Earth

1980
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:20,480
That's how bad this comparison made

1981
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:26,880
Pointed out that tracks

1982
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:29,440
Chickens are out of power it's the talkies

1983
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:33,792
Always fiscal responsibility and the budget

1984
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:40,192
Through the concrete things and numbers and all these arguments and then as soon as they get into Power every

1985
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,728
Becomes culture-war bulshit

1986
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:44,288
It seems like that is

1987
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:45,824
That tracks

1988
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,360
What I

1989
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,640
Be live experience

1990
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:52,480
Yeah in my life I can't really claim to be an expert

1991
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:55,040
Just tell me about the deficit Walmart

1992
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,576
No deficit

1993
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:58,880
Devil

1994
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:04,768
So here's Alex and Tucker talking more about how creepy it is

1995
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,072
Stop it

1996
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:08,608
He has the only answer

1997
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,888
And that and that

1998
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,680
Cruz is Anointed one

1999
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,728
And that the children of their Dupree

2000
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,800
And if we don't do what they say we're going to hell

2001
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,336
That is Jim Jones

2002
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,136
We're trying to solve

2003
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:34,976
Hereafter

2004
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,256
We're trying to do this

2005
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:39,840
Reason

2006
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:43,680
Shooting

2007
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,728
More significant

2008
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,520
Support

2009
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,336
For me

2010
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:52,896
If my guy is

2011
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,432
Messiah or I'm the Messiah

2012
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,736
And you disagree with him or me don't do it

2013
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,016
You don't do it

2014
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,040
Looking at

2015
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,600
Don't do it stop it

2016
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:06,208
The person you're competing

2017
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,000
Stop it

2018
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:08,768
Is outside

2019
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,376
How f******

2020
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:17,984
Dario about the guy who's talking to

2021
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,544
He who is not a right

2022
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,568
The first stone

2023
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:28,224
You make a lot of sense to give it to you

2024
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:36,928
Is exactly what your president

2025
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,208
Tucker

2026
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,232
We'll see you in 4 years

2027
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:42,560
So we get back to this VP thing

2028
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,888
Alex wants to tease it by Tucker

2029
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:46,656
Thanks

2030
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:48,448
BP pet mean obviously

2031
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,984
We just actions will always be my

2032
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,776
My first choice because I think he's the smartest

2033
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,640
On immigration and trade

2034
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,248
Rodger Stone

2035
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:04,576
But I tell you okay

2036
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,488
To try to overthink

2037
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:14,304
Play He Who you never heard of

2038
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:18,912
Clinton for the CC

2039
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,192
Up to women

2040
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,544
No Organics

2041
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,568
Session

2042
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,872
Tucker W session

2043
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:30,944
So Alex goes out to break

2044
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,736
Tucker interview

2045
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:33,504
Pimping

2046
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,576
This interview with Rodger about the vice president

2047
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:37,856
Rodger Stone

2048
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,952
K102 BP is get ready

2049
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,512
Find out in 3 min

2050
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:49,120
Professional-grade he knows what he's doing

2051
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,400
That's good stuff we want

2052
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,936
To keep people around

2053
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:53,728
Haircuts

2054
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,496
Scream

2055
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:55,520
Stop

2056
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,288
At your stoplight

2057
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,152
I'm sure that

2058
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:07,552
Within a couple weeks of this episode either in the past or in the future.

2059
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,832
But this is a good job

2060
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:14,720
Because he does about job all the time doesn't mean we can't celebrate he has it within him

2061
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,000
At this point

2062
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,024
To do something

2063
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,352
Presentation stand

2064
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:21,120
Is

2065
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:22,400
So goddamn

2066
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,424
Foreign to me

2067
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,776
Going to be nice

2068
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:32,896
Just say I think it's acts like

2069
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:36,736
You you texted me multiple times

2070
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:41,344
There's no way this is not the same Joe it's not the same

2071
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,880
It's so different

2072
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:52,608
Like it's it's not like it's a cut-and-dry black-and-white there except

2073
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:56,192
It became

2074
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:58,752
Like what he is now which way

2075
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:04,384
I don't even I don't even know be honest though the last 4 years of broken

2076
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,152
Everyone

2077
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:11,552
And it allows us to

2078
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:16,672
Weathering the storm look at them

2079
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:19,744
Exactly where is the to everybody's broke

2080
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,536
Rolfe

2081
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:22,816
Hello it's gray

2082
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:25,376
So Alex comes back from break

2083
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:28,704
And instead of going straight to the report talks a little bit

2084
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:33,056
To setup the report

2085
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:35,360
What's f****** cool

2086
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:42,528
Too busy

2087
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,672
And I got hung out

2088
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:49,696
Everything

2089
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:51,744
Because he just really

2090
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,304
Funny really smart and fun to hang out with

2091
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:59,424
If I were Rodger and I heard that

2092
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:02,240
The sky

2093
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:08,640
I could do whatever I can take over his business in Ocean's 11

2094
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:20,672
Step two of the play at his complete confidence man is like I have achieved confidence

2095
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:23,488
Amanda

2096
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:24,256
Dirty rotten

2097
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,280
Scoundrels

2098
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:28,864
Bum me out

2099
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,144
Special report again

2100
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,680
And Alex.

2101
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:38,080
Michael Caine this is really interesting because Alex is talking to Rodger but at the same time

2102
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:40,128
Set up working four tens

2103
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:40,896
To Rodger

2104
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,176
Preston

2105
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:43,456
Hard who is

2106
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:44,224
Is the VP pick

2107
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:49,856
I'm not going to tell you

2108
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,160
What I think or what I know

2109
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:55,744
We will

2110
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,608
And I said okay well

2111
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,376
I have no

2112
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,728
That woman

2113
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:08,544
Whatever

2114
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,360
But he is on

2115
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:12,896
Fox last Sunday all over

2116
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:18,784
That's weird cuz he's talking to Rodger he's telling the story

2117
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:22,368
Using him yeah he did this

2118
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,392
Very strange

2119
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:29,792
I got to say I don't like Corey Lewandowski

2120
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,584
Everyone City pushed over this woman

2121
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,864
Reality just shoved

2122
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,728
Hii

2123
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:44,128
I defended this guy when he committed a violent act against a woman now

2124
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,920
Your measurement of you

2125
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:49,248
Your loyalty to this guy is you protect

2126
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:50,016
Him

2127
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,552
The worst thing

2128
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:57,952
That he's done but I don't like to be and mad that he doesn't hang out with you

2129
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:03,584
We talked to drop and I don't like to be goes and does interviews where he says that he's involved in choosing the VP

2130
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:07,680
Women over all day are we not going to talk him into the groundwater

2131
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:13,312
Alex and Rodger had dinner

2132
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,336
And

2133
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:16,384
We get back to this

2134
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,176
Go / gas

2135
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:19,968
That Rodger had at Alex's

2136
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:22,016
Half staff

2137
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,552
To come up with

2138
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:27,136
Last night dinner

2139
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:30,464
But yeah

2140
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,608
You've got

2141
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:38,912
People really want to know

2142
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,960
Obviously

2143
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:46,592
CIA

2144
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:47,616
Shooting range

2145
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:50,432
Oh boy

2146
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:57,088
Just an interesting Wrinkle in history

2147
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:01,184
So

2148
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,744
Will reveal

2149
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:07,328
You I don't

2150
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:09,888
Think that I've done anything to indicate

2151
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,424
What name gets Trump

2152
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,984
Not at all we know because

2153
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,544
Spring 2020

2154
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,336
They could have guessed my

2155
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,128
They could have guessed somebody else

2156
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:23,200
Didn't guess Mike I would like for you to come up with a list of

2157
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:29,600
Three names that you think they are going to you too if possible

2158
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:30,368
On the spot

2159
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,440
Go from most likely to least likely

2160
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,720
Alright

2161
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:40,608
These guys world I'm going to go with number one pick

2162
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:41,632
Ted Cruz

2163
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,656
Okay

2164
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:43,680
Alright

2165
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,472
Number to pick

2166
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,104
Number three pick I'm going to go with

2167
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,128
Judge Napolitano

2168
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,176
Judge Napolitano

2169
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:55,712
Supreme Court

2170
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,736
You know that

2171
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:58,016
Interesting

2172
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:00,064
Try some pics I know that Rodger

2173
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:03,392
It said some positive things about Napolitano in the past

2174
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:05,440
I don't think I like Joanne

2175
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:08,768
That was at Saint Joe, Missouri

2176
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:10,560
I'm going to say that your first pick

2177
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:11,584
Is flawed

2178
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:17,984
Because you forget that this is during that period where they hated was was the Zodiac Killer

2179
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,544
I forgot about that

2180
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:25,408
Forgot

2181
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:32,064
This is during that weird. Cuz Alex Ted Cruz before his tea party

2182
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,088
Best well-spoken

2183
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,368
Kinfolks and then

2184
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:36,928
Afterwards after he submitted to Trump

2185
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:42,560
He became good again. Especially during the primary and

2186
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:45,632
Into the beginning of the

2187
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,400
The General

2188
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:49,472
Not like Ted Cruz Ted Cruz was the Glenn Beck

2189
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:55,872
Canada in Craven until the ends of their

2190
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:59,200
That's right every person should be followed around

2191
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:00,224
People being

2192
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,272
Ted Cruz's be like you're the zodiac

2193
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:06,880
Every single day of his life somebody

2194
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:07,904
We should scream that into a

2195
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,184
His face

2196
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:14,560
Okay

2197
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:15,584
I think Buy

2198
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,864
By process of elimination

2199
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,728
I like myself

2200
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,008
Would-be Senator Jeff

2201
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:24,288
Jeff sessions

2202
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,312
Session

2203
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,848
Back to the Alabama Young

2204
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,872
Republicans in the

2205
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:28,640
80s

2206
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:30,432
It's all Jeff sessions

2207
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:37,088
Tucker Watson to be the candidate

2208
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:40,672
Really excited

2209
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:41,440
Greed without

2210
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:47,840
Yeah it was hard to read because he was like

2211
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:51,424
I'm making this s*** up

2212
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:57,824
That I'm making this s*** up is behind reaction to Tucker's

2213
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:03,968
Do you have any more concrete than I do

2214
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:09,600
Which easily be like

2215
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:12,416
Oh s*** I was going to say

2216
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:13,440
That's how I read it

2217
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:19,840
Exactly

2218
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:24,448
I don't feel bad

2219
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:25,984
Call session

2220
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,264
Wow

2221
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,544
Rogers

2222
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,824
Start stalking other name

2223
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,360
That he thinks

2224
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:32,384
Might be in the mix

2225
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,176
Mothers

2226
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:36,224
Am I saying Trump has chosen set

2227
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:36,992
Directions no

2228
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:38,016
I think Johny

2229
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:39,552
The senator

2230
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,320
From Iowa

2231
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,112
Under consideration

2232
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:44,416
Miriam

2233
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,696
And Sheldon

2234
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:47,488
Very aggressively

2235
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,280
Advocated Newt Gingrich

2236
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,304
I like

2237
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,072
I personally

2238
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:52,096
Are some drawbacks

2239
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:56,704
Consideration

2240
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:58,240
Kind of drawbacks

2241
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:00,800
I think the short list isn't involved

2242
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:13,600
Doesn't matter if this has any basis is reality

2243
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,880
We got to get 10 minutes

2244
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:19,488
Done this is an evolving situation that in hindsight

2245
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,024
The name that does

2246
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,048
Become the VP

2247
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:23,584
Is not meant

2248
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:27,936
Around

2249
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:28,960
Sure

2250
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:29,984
So Alex

2251
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,032
It's talking to Rodger here and

2252
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:34,848
Yeah man

2253
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:35,616
Session

2254
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:40,480
It's got to be session cuz I studied body language

2255
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,016
Body language

2256
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:45,600
Literal

2257
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:54,048
Body language

2258
01:57:57,632 --> 01:58:01,216
The body language expert Alex

2259
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:04,032
They're just like simpatico

2260
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:06,336
And then they have the same ideas about immigration

2261
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,872
Going to be session

2262
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,664
Is not session

2263
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,944
And

2264
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:11,968
Sessions

2265
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:14,272
Becomes available later

2266
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:18,368
Because he recused himself from Russia

2267
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:19,136
Stop pain

2268
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:20,672
Like that

2269
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:22,720
I'm too weak for the Maga crowd

2270
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:26,560
Turned on him

2271
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:27,328
Primary

2272
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:29,888
To get back into the Congress

2273
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,912
They all knew

2274
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,448
Everybody knew

2275
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:35,520
And they still convinced themselves that they could

2276
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,544
Pull it off

2277
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:37,312
You know it's

2278
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:39,616
At every part of this reminds me so much of

2279
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:41,408
Reading about Stalin

2280
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,176
Closest

2281
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:43,200
Group of friends

2282
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:45,248
And watching them disappear like

2283
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:51,136
You guys all knew that he was disappearing people

2284
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,416
Disappeared

2285
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:54,976
Murder of equation

2286
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:55,744
Look at it

2287
01:58:57,024 --> 01:59:00,608
Like 30,000 ft closer

2288
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,632
You have

2289
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:02,400
Like this

2290
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:04,448
Glimpse of this 2016

2291
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:06,752
Rodger that

2292
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:08,544
Sessions is going to be

2293
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,336
The VP pick

2294
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,360
Shame

2295
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:14,432
Out of the Maga community

2296
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:16,992
They're complaining about Corey Lewandowski

2297
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:23,648
Not involved at all

2298
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:24,928
He's alive

2299
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:26,720
Do you have that like

2300
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:29,792
Trump's fear these people talk about that

2301
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:32,096
Palace Intrigue about them that's so important

2302
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:33,632
Completely irrelevant

2303
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,216
You take it into a sharper Focus

2304
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:38,496
You looking forward

2305
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:43,360
And there's all these people who were there and now are gone

2306
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:47,712
Greased or or heat Alex now

2307
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:49,248
Just mysteriously berrykins

2308
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:53,088
None of this stays

2309
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:56,160
Yeah

2310
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:57,696
I'm not I'm not saying that like

2311
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,000
Every staff has to say

2312
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,024
Completely

2313
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:05,888
What is a high level of folks that are all gone

2314
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:07,168
Really

2315
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:11,520
And I think they I think at least the banana

2316
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,568
Republicans

2317
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:14,336
Flourish

2318
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:18,176
Under a Centrist president that they can

2319
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:22,528
That is where they grow their they become suck their butt

2320
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:25,856
They blossom in the beautiful flowers of who gives a s*** about the

2321
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:29,184
Deficit

2322
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,720
Angry but they all get

2323
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:34,560
And then

2324
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:35,584
Then the gift

2325
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,352
Power and they

2326
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:38,400
Realize I was shity they are and they're like

2327
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:40,192
Well it's obviously not

2328
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:43,776
Spell literally

2329
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:49,152
Yeah cuz I

2330
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:52,224
I don't agree with

2331
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,296
Arguments

2332
02:00:55,552 --> 02:01:00,416
Possibly productive people can at least like engaging reality because there's like

2333
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:02,464
You're actually finally saying

2334
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:05,024
800 billion let's atleast tell me about

2335
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:09,376
795 or 850

2336
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:12,192
Something you could look at and discuss if you like

2337
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:14,752
Let's talk about our priorities

2338
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:16,800
Right

2339
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:18,336
Cataclysmic

2340
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:21,408
Devil deep state

2341
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:27,808
Centrist president a massive Pentagon budget

2342
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:32,416
F****** love so much you get corporate bailouts left and right like you f****** love so much

2343
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:36,000
Oh you have to deal with is a little bit of extra Healthcare

2344
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,536
And that's not even hard

2345
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:44,192
You want to make that so toothless it doesn't even bother people usually allows you to fundraise really well

2346
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:53,152
Serta Progressive policies and

2347
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:55,712
Progress made

2348
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:56,736
Is enough

2349
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:58,016
You can

2350
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,808
Fundraise off it effectively

2351
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:06,208
With your your audience

2352
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:12,608
When they get power they like obviously we were right it's just sort of a larger version.

2353
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:14,400
He works

2354
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:15,168
Almost

2355
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:19,264
Only in an adversarial role

2356
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:22,336
Interdesign

2357
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:23,104
Or

2358
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:28,736
Just have it I don't know I would not be a competent person to speak on this but like

2359
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:33,344
Reason for whatever reason

2360
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,136
It seems to only work adversary

2361
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:36,928
Yeah they do not

2362
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:38,720
Seem to work

2363
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:40,000
Actively when they're in charge

2364
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:46,400
What do you mean for what but it seems like

2365
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:52,800
A bit more competent in terms of capable of

2366
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:55,104
Right

2367
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:59,712
Borderline is not a great driver the others ham

2368
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:03,552
Yeah

2369
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:06,368
So we have one last

2370
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:11,744
The wrong side of the road in Britain

2371
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:15,072
So we are one last clip and it's

2372
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:19,680
Alex has this pre-recorded

2373
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:24,544
David Knight is hosting the fourth album

2374
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,336
Answer when it comes in

2375
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:32,736
He's boring as hell but he gives us exactly what we need

2376
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:34,784
3 hours into this episode

2377
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:37,344
Jones Show on this

2378
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:38,368
Monday

2379
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:39,904
66

2380
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:46,560
I just mentioned that Alex Jones he says

2381
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:49,120
A lot of news this week

2382
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:52,704
Pentagram

2383
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,472
Demarco

2384
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:55,264
Play Five Points around

2385
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,056
La climbing at Forsyth

2386
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:58,592
Already had been.

2387
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:00,640
Do that

2388
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:02,432
Good job David

2389
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:05,248
Thank you David

2390
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:07,552
Little put the button on the back

2391
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:11,136
Episode

2392
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:17,536
It was pretty imprinting interesting to me that immediately address the elephant in the room

2393
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,888
66 and apparently Alex had no idea

2394
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:28,288
Clarity about Satanism as but it doesn't seem too important

2395
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,568
Something like something

2396
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:31,104
Distressed

2397
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:35,200
As this episode comes to a wrap

2398
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:41,600
I would say first of all I know that it was accidental and completely random

2399
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:44,672
If you can see you at

2400
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:47,488
Like the reasons that was such a

2401
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:49,792
Interesting tie

2402
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:51,328
To look over in

2403
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:52,352
YouTube

2404
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:54,400
To prepare an episode about I just

2405
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:58,496
I feel recital unconscious mind

2406
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:01,056
Yeah and it's amazing

2407
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:04,896
Based on your thinking about the death

2408
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:12,832
602

2409
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:14,624
Knights devil is Farm

2410
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,160
Cheeky and fun than Alex

2411
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:18,208
Is dapple a boring devil

2412
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:22,560
So much

2413
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:23,840
More palatable

2414
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:26,912
Despite the awesome

2415
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:30,752
What's up

2416
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:31,520
Much

2417
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:34,080
Much better 4 years ago 100

2418
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:40,224
Things that I've already learned cuz obviously I've listened to his shows

2419
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:40,992
In the past

2420
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:42,528
Is it ufer

2421
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:44,064
Forget you forget that like

2422
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:45,856
This show was

2423
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:47,904
It's very different

2424
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:48,672
Yats

2425
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:50,208
I appreciate

2426
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:51,744
Getting to experience that

2427
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:53,280
And

2428
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:56,096
F****** weird

2429
02:05:56,352 --> 02:06:02,496
You said

2430
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:03,520
What do I

2431
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:10,176
Tucker Carlson

2432
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:11,712
Cousin be there

2433
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,016
Of course it did

2434
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:17,088
Rodger Stone

2435
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:26,048
God what an amazing display of s*** head

2436
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:32,448
Except except

2437
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:36,032
It is it is one of those things where it's like

2438
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:36,800
You just

2439
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:38,848
Can't experience change over time

2440
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,176
And uh

2441
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:47,808
Suggest a road so slowly and you think today is still just as normal as it was yesterday

2442
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:49,344
And then reminded

2443
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,112
Time does.

2444
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:51,648
Christ

2445
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:58,304
I'm listening to

2446
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,328
Episode 26

2447
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,632
Back when I used to go to the gym all the time

2448
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:06,240
Always say

2449
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:11,360
Pink Floyd

2450
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:15,456
Getting into shape

2451
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:21,856
Something like you have to look at something from 3 months ago to recognize difference

2452
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:24,416
Alex is erosion

2453
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:27,232
It's become so normalized to us

2454
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:30,560
Especially in 2020 like

2455
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:39,264
In the present day

2456
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,032
With

2457
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:42,592
You notice many diversions is when used

2458
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:43,360
To do

2459
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:44,640
But I think we can

2460
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:45,408
Forget

2461
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:47,712
Like that that is not

2462
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:48,992
Yeah he's always

2463
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:52,576
Has been

2464
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:56,928
I just wish that I could only talk about

2465
02:07:57,696 --> 02:08:00,768
Cuz honestly I hate him I hate him

2466
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:05,888
16

2467
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:12,288
This is a this is a simulation and simulation where we talked about

2468
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,312
Descent into madness

2469
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:17,920
We didn't get stuck in the simulation where Alex Jones switches gears

2470
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:18,944
Hates Trump

2471
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:22,272
We turn

2472
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:26,112
That'd be a wild future anybody who's booking that guess what

2473
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:32,000
The problem with our evil twins in this universe is I guess they would have no face

2474
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:37,120
We're both bearded gentleman mustache

2475
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:40,192
Mustache just mustache problem

2476
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:51,712
I feel like if those are the two options and I would choose this

2477
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:55,552
So Jordan

2478
02:08:55,808 --> 02:08:58,368
The past for providing this so this is this

2479
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,904
Interesting

2480
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,448
Longtime listener

2481
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:14,496
Caller

2482
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,056
Think that

2483
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:19,104
Steven robbed

2484
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:24,736
Shannon Robb

2485
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:26,272
Nice

2486
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:33,440
That's worthwhile song

2487
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:34,720
Has like 20 kids

2488
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:38,816
I don't know about

2489
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:42,400
In the past and so I would assume

2490
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:45,216
Is hypo also there was that whole time

2491
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:47,776
When Alex was selling super male vitality

2492
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:48,800
I robbed you

2493
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,480
Boners too hard

2494
02:09:56,736 --> 02:10:00,064
Uncomfortable

2495
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,600
I kind of see rub do is

2496
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:04,672
Like in the movies the the mob assassin

2497
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:06,976
The Hitman who just he's just a hitman

2498
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,000
You know that's

2499
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:08,768
Tuesday job

2500
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:12,864
And then he comes home and he's a perfect family man he's completely divorces

2501
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:14,144
His professional life in

2502
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:14,912
His personal life

2503
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:17,216
I could see Rob do being an amazing

2504
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:23,616
Family discount

2505
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,896
To work never would have

2506
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:31,296
And it's still working

2507
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:33,344
And did that stupid deposition

2508
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:34,624
Never do that

2509
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:36,416
IPad guy

2510
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:37,440
I got to be on

2511
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:41,536
I'm waiting outside

2512
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:49,984
Help me find

2513
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:51,520
Ready for

2514
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:53,312
Shity shity remote

2515
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:07,904
Hellyeah Massachusetts

2516
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:12,768
All I got too many people have been like I use yours over learning and all that

2517
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,328
Really mentally prepare yourself for

2518
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:16,864
For s*** to come with

2519
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:29,152
No I mean it's tough in college right now.

2520
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:31,712
For them

2521
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:34,784
I don't know ticular Lee like if

2522
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:36,832
I understand if you're like just

2523
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:38,880
Entering College this is very weird

2524
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:41,184
No idea how you handle that

2525
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:44,000
But if you are a couple years into college

2526
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:46,048
The shift

2527
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:47,328
I just

2528
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:48,352
I have no idea

2529
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:51,680
My heart goes out to people who are having to deal with it

2530
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:52,704
That's

2531
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:55,008
Situation

2532
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:01,664
My dad's a professor and so he's talked to me about some of the issues of

2533
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,200
Of the remote teaching and

2534
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:03,968
And stuffing

2535
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:05,760
I don't I don't know if he's

2536
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:08,576
Experiences Universal by tell the teachers

2537
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,856
Resume arriving to deal with

2538
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:14,720
I keep telling my partner

2539
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:15,488
Convince everybody

2540
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:16,768
Toyota strike

2541
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:19,328
There's just no

2542
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:20,096
Functional way to do

2543
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:22,656
Everybody's being set up for failure

2544
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:27,776
And then they're going to blame them when they fail disgusting psycho that there

2545
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:30,848
Being forced to play into

2546
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:34,944
We see these new stories that are coming out about like schools opening and then

2547
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:36,480
Closing

2548
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:39,040
It's disheartening

2549
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:41,856
I imagine there are also schools that have open

2550
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:42,880
That have no case

2551
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:47,744
About that possible

2552
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,280
I'm about to make a headline

2553
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,048
So

2554
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:52,352
Possible

2555
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:55,424
Obviously not Universal that their outbreaks

2556
02:12:57,984 --> 02:13:00,288
Falcon challenge it's incredibly hard

2557
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:02,848
I was at the hardware store the other day

2558
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:04,128
I need

2559
02:13:04,384 --> 02:13:05,408
Plant lights

2560
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:08,224
To the guy there

2561
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,272
Love these dudes at the hardware store they're the best

2562
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:14,112
I swear I

2563
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:15,136
Bilal

2564
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:17,952
In Lakewood

2565
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:25,632
But I was talking to the guy and we really connected

2566
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:27,168
Boats

2567
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:30,496
I don't know

2568
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:32,544
What's going on

2569
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:37,408
I tried to listen

2570
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:38,688
To folks

2571
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:44,576
Perfectly happy to wear mask

2572
02:13:45,856 --> 02:13:47,136
I feel like rudderless

2573
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:54,560
Everybody has a certain amount of places where it's definitely the most

2574
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:57,120
In higher education

2575
02:13:58,144 --> 02:13:58,656
Even just

2576
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:00,192
Primary education

2577
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:04,288
I can't I look if I'm a 36 year old dude

2578
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:05,824
Who's self-employed

2579
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:07,872
And I feel directionless

2580
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:10,688
And like there's no leadership given a clear message

2581
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:14,528
Can't imagine what it must be like for people

2582
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:16,064
The responsibility to

2583
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:16,832
Teach

2584
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:17,856
A mentor

2585
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:19,648
The next turn

2586
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:26,048
To it it's a

2587
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:27,072
It's a scramble

2588
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:29,376
No one has any idea what they're going to teach

2589
02:14:29,632 --> 02:14:35,008
Nobody from the top who is supposed to be giving them like guidance is doing anything other than being like

2590
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,568
Hey you guys have known

2591
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:38,592
You know how to teach

2592
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:41,152
Just dude you just do one of those

2593
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:42,432
Just do one of the teachers

2594
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:44,992
Have you ever teach them before then just do the teaching

2595
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:46,784
Even though nobody is ever

2596
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:47,808
Existed in this situation

2597
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:48,832
That's okay

2598
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:50,112
Absolute

2599
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:50,880
F******

2600
02:14:51,136 --> 02:14:54,976
Disaster and a tragedy and it is going to explode

2601
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:56,256
In everybody's f****** faces

2602
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:58,560
So

2603
02:14:58,816 --> 02:15:00,608
Colorado did not say your name

2604
02:15:02,144 --> 02:15:08,288
I would say I like the look

2605
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:11,104
Nice Dan does that call

2606
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:12,640
Jordan

2607
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:13,408
Stephen Amell

2608
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:15,712
Good

2609
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:16,992
Heard that was

2610
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:17,760
Restarting the

2611
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:20,832
I had

2612
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:23,392
Or more

2613
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:25,952
If we get rid of Jake

2614
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:27,232
Still going to

2615
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:29,792
My idea

2616
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:32,864
We cut the gate

2617
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:34,400
The water

2618
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:36,192
Yeah it's

2619
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:36,960
Time

2620
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:37,984
Trump getting caught

2621
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:39,520
Embrasure water

2622
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:42,592
We'll figure it out

2623
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:44,384

Alright

2626

Get back to

2627
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:50,784
Water

2628
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:52,832
And it doesn't have to just

2629
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:53,600
Political

2630
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:54,624
Still

2631
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:55,392
Do all the others

2632
02:15:57,696 --> 02:15:58,464
Deflate water

2633
02:15:58,720 --> 02:15:59,232
4

2634
02:16:00,256 --> 02:16:01,280
Not bad at all

2635
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:03,584
Anyways

2636
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:05,888
Get back to me

2637
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:11,776
I like this because it's nonsensical

2638
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:13,568
Eat twice said get back

2639
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:23,296
I feel like I've got to respond

2640
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:28,160
And I was saying let's do it

2641
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:29,952
I'm for it

2642
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:30,976
A better than gate

2643
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:33,024
The water water

2644
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:35,584
Shadow

2645
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:38,400
All right here's another one

2646
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:43,264
Wife from

2647
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:58,368
Prison protest

2648
02:16:58,624 --> 02:16:59,392
Struggling everyday

2649
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:08,864
2

2650
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:10,912
Very much

2651
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,192
Laugh

2652
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:18,080
Family members

2653
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:20,384
Overall

2654
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:23,712
Take care

2655
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:25,248
Enjoy the Sodastream

2656
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:28,064
Yeah

2657
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:35,232
Yes thank you very much

2658
02:17:35,488 --> 02:17:36,000
Is really important

2659
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:39,072
Appreciate

2660
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:40,864
You know there

2661
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:47,776
Missouri is a state that is s*** on and look down on in the same way a lot of States particularly in the south

2662
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:52,896
Are look down just a bunch of dumb dumb pumpkin

2663
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:58,272
And I think it's very unfair I think it's a mentality that people need to train themselves out of

2664
02:17:58,528 --> 02:18:00,320
That's where the Columbia is at

2665
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:01,088
The town

2666
02:18:01,344 --> 02:18:03,136
That is obviously the college

2667
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:07,488
Call so very Missouri Town

2668
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:13,120
It's very nice to hear like I still

2669
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:14,400
A good

2670
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:15,424
Activist

2671
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:19,008
When I used to live there

2672
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:21,312
Protest we talked about this

2673
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:23,360
Every Wednesday I'll go out

2674
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:30,016
Back then it was just the peace Nook

2675
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:31,040
Bunch of hippies

2676
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:33,600
Fruit leather in a basement

2677
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:35,392
Yeah

2678
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:38,208
Hazleton Patchouli oil change

2679
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:41,024
Some books

2680
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:43,840
Organized

2681
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:44,608
These protests

2682
02:18:44,864 --> 02:18:46,912
Is very small and it's

2683
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:48,192
It's nice to hear

2684
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:50,752
I'll bet a lot of that sort of spirit

2685
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:53,056
Definitely as

2686
02:18:53,312 --> 02:18:54,336
Iraq War

2687
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:55,104
Continued

2688
02:18:56,384 --> 02:18:57,920
The movement got bigger

2689
02:18:58,176 --> 02:18:59,968
More people

2690
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:01,248
Amore protest

2691
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:05,088
But you know that a lot of that is still alive

2692
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:05,856
In Columbia

2693
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:11,232
That's one of the things that makes me think of

2694
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:14,048
How important it is to like following

2695
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:15,584
Support local journalist in Seattle

2696
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,608
Like that because

2697
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:18,912
The national news is not going to cover

2698
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:20,192
A protest

2699
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:21,472
In Columbia Missouri

2700
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:26,848
Unless they burnt out

2701
02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:28,128
You wouldn't know

2702
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:31,712
So many different places are holding daily protein

2703
02:19:32,224 --> 02:19:32,736
George Floyd

2704
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:34,784
I know so many different places

2705
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:36,832
Unless you were connected with it you know like

2706
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:38,368
I follow a bunch of

2707
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:44,256
I follow journalist on Twitter who are just deposit like a gray still Becky

2708
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:48,608
She's doing incredible work in Chicago like that's the kind of stuff

2709
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:51,424
You're not going to see on 2nd

2710
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:55,520
National news so follow people around your area

2711
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:59,360
Takes an investment it's hard to get

2712
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:03,200
Define voices you can

2713
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:03,968
Entrust

2714
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:07,552
But that is a part that's kind of like

2715
02:20:07,808 --> 02:20:13,696
Where this advice falls apart a little

2716
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:21,888
That is that like

2717
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:25,728
It's easy to stereotype

2718
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:27,008
Places

2719
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:31,616
Like a like

2720
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:33,152
Is right off

2721
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:34,944
All of it

2722
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:35,712
R2

2723
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:36,992
The people in

2724
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:40,320
I mean like totally

2725
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:43,648
Exposure to bat spend a lot of time in various cities around

2726
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:44,672
Even spikes

2727
02:20:44,928 --> 02:20:46,208
Springfield is a very

2728
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:47,232
Conservative

2729
02:20:47,488 --> 02:20:50,560
City butcher

2730
02:20:50,816 --> 02:20:56,960
I'm in the same way that I feel bad that I say f*** Fresno cuz my

2731
02:20:57,216 --> 02:21:00,800
And there's a ton of people who are

2732
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:03,872
Springfield Missouri who live in Springfield

2733
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:07,712
Service to a lot of regions

2734
02:21:07,968 --> 02:21:08,736
Is that the country

2735
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:10,016
Bye-bye

2736
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:11,808
By painting with such a broad brush

2737
02:21:12,064 --> 02:21:13,600
That's alright

2738
02:21:13,856 --> 02:21:14,880
That call for

2739
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:18,720
2

2740
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:19,488
Hell yeah

2741
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:21,024
Last call

2742
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:24,864

Georgia

2744
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:27,424
Bartaco

Heinie bullhorn

2751
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:47,648

02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:53,792
Tattoo of the

2753
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:55,072
Tiny bullhorn and

2754
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:58,144
A quarter for comparison

2755
02:21:58,656 --> 02:22:01,216
Just have it labeled on the bottom

2756
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:02,496
Actual size

02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:04,288
Like they do on like

2758
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:08,896
Medication label

2759

Wanted to throw out my

2761
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:13,248
Suggestion for what

2762
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:15,552
Could end up looking like

2763
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:18,880
We really welcome

2764
02:22:19,136 --> 02:22:22,464

I will say that

2772
02:22:51,392 --> 02:22:52,160
Actually

2773
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:53,696
That was straight talk

2774
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:58,304
Next tattoo tattoos

2775
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,328
That guys talk

2776
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:03,936
My next tattoo has to be there's another tattoo my brother design

2777
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:06,496
He designed the life is very fragile one

2778
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:08,032
And he also has

2779
02:23:08,288 --> 02:23:10,592
Comic strip that used to draw Batman

2780
02:23:10,848 --> 02:23:13,152
Sure there's a panel from if it's really funny

2781
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:14,688
It's called the all-nighter

2782
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:19,808
Is a panel of a comic strip version of me

2783
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:21,344
Smoking a cigarette

2784
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:22,624
Staring at

2785
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:24,672
Hungry Hungry Hippos board

2786
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:27,232
Is if I'm studying it for like

2787
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:33,632
Trying to figure out what's going on and it's just so funny is my next tattoo

2788
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:34,656
You for sure because

2789
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:36,448
I love that and I love

2790
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:38,752
The art my brother does

2791
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,592
And then I think

2792
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:47,712
My next tattoo after that is going to be I don't know how exactly it is or the design of it

2793
02:23:47,968 --> 02:23:51,296
But there's something that really resonates with me about a banyan

2794
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:58,208
Some version of that on my arm

2795
02:23:59,232 --> 02:23:59,744
Is

2796
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:04,864
Something that I like my for I'm going to finish more birds

2797
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,144
I'm going to finish my whole sleeve

2798
02:24:10,496 --> 02:24:16,640
The way up to my shoulder

2799
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:18,432
He said top on your bicep

2800
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:22,016
Yeah it is very connected

2801
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:27,648
Is on your way

2802
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:28,928
Can shoulder there's a bunch of different

2803
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:34,560
Some things that I've kind of put together and I want to finally do a full like sleeves sleeves

2804
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:36,864
So I'm working with a couple of people

2805
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:40,448
Get a full f****** forearm sleeve

2806
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:45,312
I feel like the real seal breaking for me

2807
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:48,640
I feel like there's two hands

2808
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:52,736
Yeah there's a weird social taboo that I think that I still have

2809
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:54,528
Inside me some

2810
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:57,600
Hand tattoos
