Knowledge fight

00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,792
Exit

6
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,656
Quick question for you

7
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,520
My bright spot today Jordan

8
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,360
Okay today is actually I

00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,944
Successfully finished forbidden West

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,528
Proud of myself

11
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,088
I realized way too late

12
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,672
That's the end game was a lot closer than I thought

13
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:39,072
Huh cuz I done so much other stuff I was roughly level all of them by you can't go higher than 50

14
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,144
And so then I hit barreled or the other

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
The game

16
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,520
It was one of those things that I do that's very annoying as I get soda

17
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
Distracted

18
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,616
For the first 85%

19
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:56,736
The last five percent is informality of formality

20
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,552
Yeah I put the game

21
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,856
To the side for a little bit to Silicon

22
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,952
Retain some of its wonders I realize that I was

23
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,792

00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Riverside Quest

25
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584

He will be removing all of the snakes from the Infowars off

55
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
Some of it might just

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,464
Get laid off

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
You might

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816

00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Got to hear tomorrow

94
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
And you never see me again

95
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671

108
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:29,631
And listen nobody wants you to pile on the US after that Point Golf Course

109
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Corrupt Anthony America

110
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
Enforce the American

111
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,799
You don't need to beat a dead horse certainly.

112
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
So Alex

113
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
Is not

114
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
There

115
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
When the show star

116
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
This is

117
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,503
Is becoming a little bit to the normal thing

118
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
Where are the show starts

119
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
Harrison Smith

120
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Explaining that Alex

121
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
Will be there eventually

122
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,719
I'm Harrison Smith sitting in momentarily

123
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
For Alex Jones he is in the building's taking care

124
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,375
Illegal stuff right now but he will be taking over just as soon as

125
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
But for now let me

126
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Give you a little

127
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
A little

128
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
PS2

129
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,847
How close we are to nuclear annihilation

130
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,943
God he sucks at this how close to the precipice we are before taking

131
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Plunge off

132
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
The cliff

133
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,063
That will destroy all of humanity it's it's not looking good

134
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
Before I do that let me tell you

135
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Happy Saint

136
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
Everybody hope y'all doing

137
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,255
Well hope you're you're wearing green if not

138
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
I hope you get pinched

139
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Okay now the time for

140
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
Celebrating the Glorious work

141
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
Most powerful

142
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Evangelist

143
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Christianity

144
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,543
Never saw him taking a quick moment

145
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
Tell me the story

146
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,711
Israel strange path of fox Harrison to begin to show up

147
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
We're all going to die

148
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
But first let's look

149
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,391
Enjoy the Silverline have a green beer

150
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,999
Patrick one of the most powerful evangelist in history of the Christian church

151
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
If you're talk about who's like it

152
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
The top of that list without a doubt

153
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
It's Paul No Doubt

154
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,471
About half of the New Testament is attributed to him and he was critically important

155
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,055
In terms of establishing the earliest churches in places like Ephesus and Corinth

156
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,127
Eddie's letters to these churches that appear in the Bible

157
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
A book in the Bible established a lot of church doctrine

158
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,271
Outside of Jesus it's not really fair

159
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
To compare anyone

160
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
DePaul in terms of their importance

161
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
In spite of

162
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Christianity

163
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,719
So you're looking down a little bit further on the ladder there are some major figures

164
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,607
You can make an argument that people like Constantine did wonders

165
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
For the spread of Christianity

166
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Converted in

167
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
312

168
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,799
While the emperor of Rome and that led to the Edict of Milan in 313

169
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
The codified in

170
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Cancel all religious

171
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
The tolerance for

172
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Christianity

173
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Where to buy

174
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Affect

175
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
Massively spread

176
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,015
Well if you're not going to be murdered for it

177
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
What is your name

178
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,903
There's the conquesting Emperors who spread the language

179
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
Across the ancient world

180
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Yeah

181
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:07,839
Alexander the Great spread in Greek

182
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Glands

183
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,935
Allowed for the transmission of information among culture

184
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Is that certainly somebody who

185
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,311
Well not necessarily you would say an evangelist

186
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Headache

187
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
Dramatic effect

188
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,687
Now what one could argue though is that the most

189
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Influential

190
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Members of the church

191
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Are the ones with the

192
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Spotted Cow

193
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,855
So then you have to rejigger the whole thing I don't know

194
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
I mean Paul's got

195
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
6 Max

196
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
You don't know if I was up here

197
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
We need a gritty Paul video game

198
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,031
Verizon

199
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
Something along those lines

200
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
Rick is one of the most powerful evangelist in the history of

201
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Christianity

202
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
Best

203
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,831
You could claim that he founded the Christian church in Ireland but even that claim is

204
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
Is far from solid

205
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,439
There's a lot of uncertainty about the historical record as it relates Patra

206
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,279
Breaking many believe that a lot of the claims made about his relevant to the Irish Church

207
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
Are conflated with Play-Doh

208
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
The first Bishop of the Catholic Church

209
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Who was that

210
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Ireland

211
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,703
The boy here is that the claim that Harrison is making

212
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,775
Is absurd but I'm excited to see how you back

213
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:26,175
Spits out I could befall interested also I think a lot of people in Ireland looking back on it would say that

214
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,527
Introduction of the Christian religion to Ireland might have wound up going wrong

215
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Later on

216
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,879
Implementation

217
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,975
Well let's take the wheel

218
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
We're taking a quick moment

219
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Tell me the story

220
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Saint Patrick

221
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
Cuz it's a great source of inspiration

222
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,447
What we're doing here in the infowar

223
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Saint Patrick

224
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
What's from

225
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
He was part of

226
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Romanized

227
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
British family

228
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
His father was a deacon in the church

229
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
As a Young Man

230
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
And taken to Ireland

231
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
Which was at the time completely pagan

232
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
Were you accept as a slave and he was abused as a slave

233
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
Any live to life

234
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
As a slave until he

235
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Got a vision

236
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
From God that told him

237
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Your boats here

238
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Your ride is waiting

239
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
It's time for you to escape and trusting his vision

240
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,375
He went to the coast and found a ship waiting there took him to England

241
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
We're again his troubles were not over

242
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
He was cap

243
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
Oxford multiple times

244
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,079
And I think about this

245
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Who's escaped

246
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Bondage

247
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
In Ireland

248
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:34,271
Has escaped the pagans you've you've made it out you live in a comfortable life with your family now

249
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
To give up that life

250
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,927
Go back and he was enslaved

251
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
Retribution

252
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
Some Revenge

253
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
Those people

254
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
To tell them the gospel

255
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
To convert them

256
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,495
Depreciated to perform miracles for them

257
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
And to better their life

258
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Multipack

259
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Was that man

260
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
But really it really trying to be like

261
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
Talk about yourself here a little bit

262
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
Well I find it very interesting that we can definitely identify with

263
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
Former white slave

264
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,951
Who come back to the land that they were enslaved in and then kicked out of

265
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,791
In order to do her

266
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
Straight up murdering anybody

267
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
Vine

268
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,239
Disconnect

269
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,567
But why would I

270
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:34,175
Which is a strange thing on Infowars because usually people

271
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
People loving Alex

272
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,015
Can pick us up but he has no idea what he's talking about

273
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,343
I'll bet at least according to whatever sources we do have available

274
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,903
What are the story of Saint Patrick is but like

275
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
That's the Wrecker

276
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,815
For yourself how reliable any of those sources are

277
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
And take him to Ireland

278
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
That escaped and then eventually decided to become a mission

279
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
Also Patrick supposedly had another Vision they called him to

280
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:03,615
Come back to Ireland so that's why you did it is supposed to go back in business

281
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,711
Giving these Visions is a little wishy-washy but we should be

282
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
Go get on the boat and back tire line

283
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
I

284
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,927
The one problem perform miracles

285
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Formerly of saint

286
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,047
He's never been canonized and the whole thing about running

287
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
This makes off that's not true

288
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
Of course

289
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:30,239
None of this matters though because employers and everyone associated with it believes in lore as reality

290
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
Folktales about someone

291
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Religious Doctrine

292
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,455
Absolutely important caveat though and that is at the Eastern Orthodox Church

293
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,039
Does venerate Patrick as a saint in equal standing with the apostle

294
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
But I really don't think that Infowars

295
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
Is an Eastern Orthodox operation

296
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,231
Alex Espinoza some theological beliefs that are at odds

297
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
With that tradition

298
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
So just seems hard to believe

299
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
That that would be there

300
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
Eastern Orthodox

301
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
Paul Bunyan is also venerated alongside the Saints in an Infowars so it's like

302
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,383
Find to true to Colonel Travis

303
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
I will say this with a fair amount of certainty

304
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,783
You're not going to find anybody who takes the study of Religion

305
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Like a

306
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,367
Just religious studies seriously that would say

307
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Play Patra

308
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Rick is a major event

309
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
Not part of

310
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,423
How many other of them have their own holiday that is entirely about there

311
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,983
Real life and events that happened 100%

312
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
To them it's a bizarre

313
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Notion

314
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
For Harrison to be spreading but

315
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
What's what about this is

316
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:44,479
It's just a way for Harrison to use his story Ben Tate Patrick really talk about himself

317
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
And Alex

318
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,831
They are like Saint Patrick and that they've seen the horrors of Ireland

319
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
The globalist metaphorically

320
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,999
So they could have a nice life elsewhere they returned and selflessly try to free people still in bondage

321
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,631
But I'm sure it feels better than dealing with the reality that you work for a malicious narcissist liar

322
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
Is only really packed in the world is increasing the suffering of all

323
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Which is

324
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Not like

325
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,847
The story of Saint Patrick

326
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,895
You bring religion to Ireland and then

327
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
Fights for the next

328
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
Thousand goddamn years

329
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
I don't know

330
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,599
Lozano taxes

331
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
So

332
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
Continuously about

333
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Was that man

334
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
And his writings have had

335
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Unbelievable

336
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Positive effects

337
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
The world over

338
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
He almost single-handedly

339
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Converted

340
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Country of Ireland

341
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
To Christianity

342
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,431
At the single man with nothing but the words

343
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,991
Uses in the truth that he's expressing

344
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,063
Changing the destiny of an entire nation

345
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
Entire world

346
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,159
The man who is free from bondage

347
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
Hate those who enslaved him

348
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
Helped to bring about

349
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
The abolition of that entire

350
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
Institution

351
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Love's very

352
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,031
Not true most of Ireland

353
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,895
Christianity in Ireland predated his arrival and historical record is full of

354
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,015
Bunch of other influences who

355
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:27,391
They're people who created a lot of like really isolated monasteries

356
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
I like because of their isolation

357
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,023
Many of them were able to survive much better

358
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
* the Dark Age

359
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
And

360
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Became

361
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
Something it was eight

362
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
The heavily influential

363
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
The developments of

364
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
The church in Iowa

365
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,591
Absolutely

366
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,551
Look at my selfie that is at night

367
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,599
Are you got a taxi

368
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
The point

369
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
For me is that

370
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,487
These guys have such a

371
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,143
A focus on the individual strongman theory of History

372
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,215
One person who's also in at 4

373
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
Basically the model of an infant Warriors

374
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
You alone are able to

375
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
How to change everything

376
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
Sure some people are

377
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Sansone

378
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
And hard work and luck

379
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
Some people are able to make it

380
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,599
Outsized impact in the world

381
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,415
That's not necessarily how everything

382
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
I mean

383
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
It is it is the interplay of 7 billion different things all happening simultaneously there

384
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
If you are the person with the luck to actually

385
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,447
That's why

386
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
Like a million different

387
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Saint Patrick

388
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,919
Someone else in the church that was not-so-great Bruce Willis

389
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
What's the Pope

390
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
Somebody needs to

391
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
Celebrate

392
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,367
What the church is supposed to be teaching cuz I'll tell you

393
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,415
Somebody who's not doing that

394
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
Little man named Pope

395
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,047
Francis the store infowars.com pump Francis warrants

396
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,119
Final catastrophe could extinguish human race

397
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
I suggest

398
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
Pope Francis

399
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Ask himself a question

400
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
Is that what the Bible says

401
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,847
That's not really what the Bible says is it no the Bible

402
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
Actually promises

403
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
What

404
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,759
Is wrong with you

405
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,343
Putting forward Christian Diaz he is about putting forward the great reset

406
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
New World Order

407
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,951
Control Paradigm that he seemed so eager to participate in

408
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,791
Pope Francis warns of the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine could lead to a five

409
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Catastrophe

410
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
That would extinguish the human race

411
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,959
Speaking during his weekly address to Pope's that Humanity would have to start from scratch

412
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
In the event of a

413
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Thermonuclear war

414
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:56,383
Increasingly concentrated on the representation of a final catastrophe

415
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
That will extinguish us

416
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Whether it's

417
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Climate change

418
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
Bored

419
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
The death of democracy

420
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,599
For the conflict in Ukraine

421
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
Everything

422
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,695
In the mainstream media has to be portrayed as an egg

423
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,487
Existential crisis because it's not about

424
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
Presenting you with the

425
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,863
And the truth of the situation so you can come to an informed decision

426
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
The how you want your

427
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Political

428
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
Representatives to behave

429
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Face the challenges

430
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
That we're up against a half

431
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
How to force you

432
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
Into an emotional

433
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,663
Do or die this is it the walls are

434
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
Crumbling down panic mode

435
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,599
Override your logic Center in your willing to do things and willing to allow things that you would never be willing to do or allow

436
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
In a more

437
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
State of Mind

438
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
Backflip is wild

439
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,583
Upset

440
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
The pope isn't playing into his Endtime Fanta

441
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471
I guess that Harrison is mad that the pope is saying the word

442
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
Ukraine could escalate to a situation

443
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,335
For the continuity of our modern civilization is at risk

444
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Right

445
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,919
But isn't that what Alex has been saying for weeks

446
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,015
Literally started the show talking about how we're facing nuclear annihilation

447
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,807
We're getting distracted with his Saint Patrick

448
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
QuikTrip

449
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
CC

450
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Pope says what

451
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
The times of 10

452
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
That's an unchristian attempt

453
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
To keep everyone in the grates

454
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Reset

455
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,863
New World Order fear Paradigm Alex and Harrison say they were one

456
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Away from nuclear annihilation

457
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:28,031
I just done being super cool more Christian than the pope and absolutely not trying to keep the audience

458
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
It is state of crippling fear

459
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
Does this make sense

460
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
Yeah

461
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,175
It goes like this but just make it to clear these guys know what the

462
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
They're doing

463
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,551
Accurately describe with their entire business model is when they're accusing

464
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
The pope of doing it

465
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,903
Fully aware that constantly bombarding people with

466
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,719
Do-or-die the world is ending type messages

467
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
Have the effect

468
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,071
Of overriding people's critical thinking or Lisa cam

469
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
Harrison's boring as s*** but also

470
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,167
Makes it to clear that there's

471
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,471
An intellectual understanding within Infowars

472
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,031
That what they're doing is manipulative and abusive

473
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
If you're doing

474
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:06,943
Infowars game you're supposed to not be aware of that psychology at all or at very least

475
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,735
Don't talk about it

476
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:14,111
This is a f****** liability for Alex I would fire his ass immediately if I were asked

477
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
I mean

478
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,440
Is not good you can't be talking like this

479
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:22,560
And here's the thing you can he's not going to sell it for you man I don't hear I don't hear a lie

480
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,888
In this I don't hear somebody trying to be Alex in this I hear it

481
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Child

482
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
That needs to be like

483
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
Put in a timeout

484
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
You need to stop this

485
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
Go sit in the corner

486
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:36,896
Like that's what I'm hearing no man is kind of interesting is

487
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,480
That is more lies doing an Alex impression

488
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
And I think he wants to

489
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
We become like our

490
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
Alex more like out

491
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,392
Harrison has his own

492
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Something

493
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
Which is

494
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,232
But obviously like I said boring

495
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,792
I think it's also a lot more

496
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,120
Crypto neo-Nazi

497
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:03,520
He lets on perhaps much more of a close association with people like Nick Fuentes on the groin

498
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:08,640
Be there the first book that he is like a much more subdued less bombastic connect

499
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
In terms of like

500
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
He's not willing to push it

501
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
He's not really push that was

502
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Does Bounder

503
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,344
Is a little bit on his own show but no one listened

504
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
You got 123 views though you'll be fine knocking down your door just indicate the

505
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,400
American journal on the radio station Kono

506
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Look dude

507
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Half an hour goes by

508
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
And

509
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,872
Long back rubs this is the auction show on Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones who

510
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
Momentarily will be joining you

511
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
I'll be

512
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
With you

513
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,272
Sitting and watching Alex Jones

514
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
In just a few minutes

515
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,856
No need to worry about that

516
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
I'm worried

517
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Like

518
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:58,560
I feel like there's too much of an awareness that this is a bad outcome for listeners like

519
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,912
Reassure people like I promised I would, almost out of

520
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
Have your lives for good again

521
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:10,592
Yeah if people wanted to listen to me they could choose to listen to my show and they don't know

522
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,640
Alex is coming don't worry

523
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,712
The 47-minute talent shows up

524
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:22,368
Ladies and gentlemen we are playing the game right now we are caught in the jaw so they could easily become

525
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,208
Civilization perhaps all life on earth like the Pope's

526
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,608
You know it was here back in the cockpit today that's a weird that Harrison is right there

527
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:38,240
Are the studio and he's not like offended by his boss Alex Jones we're playing the game it might result in

528
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
End of life on Earth

529
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,920
What the pope said something like that he was contradicting the Bible and trying to keep people in the great reset new world order for your States

530
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Harrison

531
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Harsh words

532
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
For Alex

533
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,064
So so weird that he doesn't fart into the studio and holds

534
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,624
How to speak to the fire about how we could possibly

535
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,024
Believe that life

536
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
Pretending to be mad about that

537
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,656
He's actually mad about but is that he's not enough

538
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Of a bigot

539
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
He cares about climate change

540
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
Imagine listening

541
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,592
Half hour to an hour the show and not thinking these guys are

542
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Complete joke

543
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Like this is

544
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Sew in

545
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
Eternally

546
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,968
Contradictory

547
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
It really hurts

548
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:28,416
I don't I don't think that they are doing a very good job

549
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,464
It work happened

550
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,864
St Patrick you're better off there don't go to the pope you don't have anything on the Pope I need to talk to y'all

551
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,424
About the most important relic of the early church

552
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
The Blarney Stone

553
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
Okay Harrison

554
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,640
Somebody told me they peed on it after I kissed it one time when I was in Ireland

555
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,688
So Alex has more interest

556
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
Alex didn't go to Ireland

557
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,272
For his trip as a little break

558
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,808
Eben ice Duets California

559
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,136
I was out in California for 3 days

560
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
And it was the most over-the-top

561
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
Before that it was the California the Bohemian Grove

562
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,120
But I infiltrated got the footage of the Mike Hansen

563
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,680
22 years ago that was the strangest thing

564
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Hybrid

565
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,872
Very interesting

566
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,480
Then the rest of it we will break very very soon

567
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,832
Anytime

568
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,136
A lot of big stuff a lot of big stuff out

569
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
It was what

570
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
Definitely Hotel California

571
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,144
It sounds like I'm a loser describes their boring-ass vacation

572
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:47,520
Oh my God best vacation ever so much stuff happening

573
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
So crazy

574
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:54,432
Can eyes wide shut thing going on but I can't tell you all about it

575
00:25:54,688 --> 00:26:00,832
As best as I can tell he was on that. Send podcast to trump it been on

576
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,904
Mike Tyson but beyond that I don't believe it he did

577
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:10,560
I'm also not impressed by Landing an interview with Mike Tyson in 2022

578
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
Don't know if that's

579
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:18,240
Like most people are banging down his door for an interview like obviously not great

580
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:24,384
If you would have gotten an interview with him in 1995 like when he got out of prison after he rape that lady

581
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
At least been like people were trying to talk

582
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,528
Would have been turning down some media appearances

583
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
This is just like

584
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Yeah

585
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
It wasn't audio

586
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
Mike Tyson will talk to you

587
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,976
Is that I know the pathway that he got to Mike Tyson with

588
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,024
And that's frustrating for me because

589
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
I know that

590
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:46,144
Tom Segura and Mike Tyson are fairly good friends so I'm assuming that it went

591
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
Alex to Joe to Tom

592
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
Into Mike Tyson

593
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,520
I imagine it might even be a shorter Road

594
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
That's possible

595
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,360
Because Alex does have a bunch of

596
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
Because of Joe bunch

597
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
Associations in the MMA and like

598
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,248
Like fighting World strip

599
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
It's called

600
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Yeah

601
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
I don't know

602
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
I'm not impressed

603
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
I don't care

604
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,928
See what Alex produces but

605
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:13,536
If that's what he was out there to do so far and that's what we know about these on that one podcast

606
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
I'm not imagining this going to top his holes

607
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,704
We can get the Bohemian Grove thing you know the thing that launched his f****** career

608
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:27,360
I mean Mike Tyson also has an adult swim cartoon rights

609
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Mike Tyson

610
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
I imagine if

611
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,432
Like Mike Tyson

612
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,736
Bigman star of it hasn't lost sponsors

613
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,856
I'm talking to Alex probably is going to lose his sponsorship

614
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
Yeah man

615
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,744
I'm not I'm not convinced his trip was as amazing

616
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Is it a zebra

617
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,376
You can talk a little bit more about this as the show goes on but goes to break

618
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Play Kenny comes

619
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
This is so dumb

620
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,176
Tycoon

621
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:13,696
So for what it's worth Rammstein is a pretty left-leaning ban politically speaking

622
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,232
Mark pedophiles if they were in America

623
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,072
This song is called angle

624
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
His poetry at because

625
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,400
Disinterment and he knows it out the audience's

626
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
Was not along and think that he

627
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,448
He's deep

628
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,008
Henry ality it is fairly poetic but it's a

629
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:32,640
Deeply anti-religious song about the lead singer doesn't want to be an angel and how the idea that if you're good at

630
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
If you get to be an angel

631
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Bulshit

632
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,784
Alex would hate just about everything about Rammstein from their politics

633
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,832
It's their support the lgbtq community

634
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,368
Music sounds angry

635
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
And Alex likes to yell

636
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,952
So he can

637
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,744
It's about how you feel

638
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
Alex

639
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,840
I hate that song I remade it doesn't matter

640
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
It doesn't matter

641
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,192
Like all of their songs that are like single

642
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
That have come out

643
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,776
That probably is the one that he should hate them

644
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
But I'm at least Du Hast is kind of like

645
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,664
It's vague enough it's not

646
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,736
Explicit

647
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:13,088
Fake your way through that you hate me or you have me

648
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,880
Can I have the American version is you hate

649
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
Anyways

650
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
But if you

651
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
You don't have a choice

652
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
To care

653
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
Conservative world

654
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,888
Because conservatives may call the worst media

655
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:32,288
They make all the worst music they make all the worst movies they make all the worse it out there probably some good like outlaw

656
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,896
Country types we've been conservative

657
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
Look up I'm not saying that

658
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:43,040
Okay maybe the exception that proves the rule the point is if all you've got is the best

659
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:47,136
Christian music you've got you're not going to be as happy as the rest of

660
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,720
That's that's probably true really have much choice

661
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:57,120
Take care you can't be like all this I got to listen to only music in other languages we can pretend

662
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:02,240
Patriot messaging

663
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
That makes perfect sense

664
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Epso

665
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
Alex gets to complain about Joe Biden

666
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,920
Is that the matchup he's on meth

667
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
Which one

668
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
Time in which B

669
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:21,440
Well I mean yeah but which one that we know that he's dead no no no no no that's that's in Project

670
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,232
Still just one Joe Biden the cardigan

671
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,560
And how do you stablish mcginn continue

672
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,936
Front of cameras

673
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,264
What's about to come out

674
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,312
The blond

675
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,616
Black kids roaches

676
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,712
If you sit there and

677
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
That's crazy

678
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,040
Will you don't help people with dementia

679
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,648
Please somebody with dementia that they give methamphetamine to

680
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
Is people

681
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,024
I'm giving back the blood

682
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,608
Islamic Society of civilization it really is drug

683
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
I was out in California

684
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
One of the biggest

685
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
Famous person

686
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
What's

687
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:22,624
If you smoke marijuana

688
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,672
A cultural thing like a piece by

689
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,536
Bonded me another route

690
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
I'm still laughing

691
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:41,056
Referring to hang out with Mike Tyson and going to do that.

692
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
He was out there and it was pretty

693
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
Armstrong which is obviously

694
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
Soros attack

695
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,224
The story of his vacation sound so desperate and pathetic

696
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,320
He's a flu to California to be on a podcast

697
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
Is no podcast is worth flying

698
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
Across the country to be Gaston

699
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
Maybe if you're an up-and-comer

700
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
Trying to make a name

701
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,816
For yourself then you could see like

702
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
Let's are you

703
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,680

Open podcast

710
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,856
He went to Florida to be on flagrant-2 and now he's going to California to be on

711
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Full send

712
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,416
It just seems really f****** thirst

713
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
I think

714
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,000
And here's my hair's my suspicions

715
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
He abs

716
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Absolutely does not trust

717
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,192
That he can make a voice call last long enough without the crew screwing something

718
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
Wow

719
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
I mean

720
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:47,616
That's probably a good theory so shity

721
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,920
I look up Skype breaking up

722
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
I can't even

723
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
Skype on my own show

724
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,016
Let alone for someone else's

725
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,600
How does the audience not get suspicious about all these trips

726
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
CC

727
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,696
Taking all the while yelling about how desperately needs money to keep the show going

728
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,488
Summit set off some alarms

729
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
These people like

730
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
He could pretend that he's doing like important

731
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:11,168
Grantee globalist business or something like I'm meeting with people behind the scenes

732
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:16,032

What somebody whose initial start

746
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,152
End weather

747
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,224
It's going to be here

748
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,808
Literally

749
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
Feel like marijuana

750
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,976
90 watt occasionally smoke it is easy still high

751
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,024
A couple days later from this

752
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
Cali weed

753
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
Nothing quite like those kids

754
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
Haha

755
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
You didn't

756
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
You didn't actually see

757
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,288
Is your life

758
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,616
I will agree with him

759
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
When I was young

760
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
Are you a get like

761
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Swag

762
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,528
Tweed was not nearly

763
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,064
The potency that they receive

764
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,880
Example

765
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,440
I don't know if you're going to be high 2 Days Later

766
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,328
No small town Illinois didn't get me past maybe 10 12%

767
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,888
And now you go up to

768
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,984
To 2829 you're going to have a good day goes numbers didn't mean anything

769
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,776
Sing to me back when I was totally

770
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,312
No I'd like to eat

771
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,616
I didn't know I didn't know there was

772
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
Such a thing as a contact

773
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,944
And that's what I'm saying now

774
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
If you're worried about it

775
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,528
You don't have to smoke the most

776
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,088
True

777
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
Oh you only want 15%

778
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
You can just

779
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,024
Not you got to do it once

780
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
You go to l.a.

781
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
There is just

782
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
Plentiful

783
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
Marijuana

784
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,776
Whirlpool weaponize everything else everywhere

785
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
The chemical bio attack

786
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,688
Protect America

787
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Discussion

788
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
About this

789
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,720
Everyday People

790
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:54,240
I'm serious California weed I can barely get off

791
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336

Cali dro

793
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:04,736
It's so fun to live in two different worlds of weed legalization you know cuz he still lives in that

794
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
You can get

795
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Are we

796
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
You know you can have a weed

797
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
Right you do not like

798
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,440
You can go to a store where they have the thing you want

799
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
Yeah

800
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,280
Sacrifice

801
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
It's made for the greater good and I like

802
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:23,168
I can't believe how selfish he is getting high with Mike Tyson so he could be a mug

803
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,240
The stone people and get the word out about the New World Order or something

804
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
Like what I f******

805
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,056
Gyro place in you and small town tax

806
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
You need to support the man

807
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
He's going to go

808
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:38,528
The California and get high with Mike Tyson right now for you

809
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
Brigham knowledge

810
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,928
To the people

811
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,280
Being I'm like Jesus really like I was a monk

812
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,840
What's the Riff Raff

813
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:58,240
Received the same word of Salvation that you a bum YouTube

814
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Is amazing

815
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:03,104
Wasted on Rogan's

816
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
Show cuz he needed to get them

817
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
Need to be monks

818
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,224
People got so drunk on Logan

819
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
Impulse show that Logan

820
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,552
Co-host with subtly trying to get him to

821
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
To stop drinking through the show

822
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,976
I got so drunk on his first time he took off his shirt and seemed to be in an active blackout

823
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,560
Part of the Infowars

824
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
No problem with Subs

825
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,400
Like honestly more fun

826
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
To be f***** up

827
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,704
Like that that nothing to do with

828
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,336
You know there is a field of anthropology that studies entirely about how much better it is to be high

829
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,872
In the exact moment you're in

830
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,408
It's not historical anthropology

831
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,224
It's just that's just doing drugs

832
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,016
Alex

833
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,576
Guy gets off this whole Cali weed

834
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,416
Go back to talking about the Pope

835
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,232
Shreeja couple these headlines there for you

836
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,608
Catastrophe

837
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
Costco

838
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,936
Could extinguish human race

839
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,496
I really should do the whole show on that

840
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
You do

841
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,944
Absolutely telling the truth it looks like there's another on take on this one

842
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,248
Suppose the business-like Harrison stupid ass did it

843
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
At the top of the show

844
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,808
Sure we hate the Pope

845
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,648
But in a situation like this you lose Nothing by just agreeing with the Pope and say

846
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,696
He accidentally got this right or is it

847
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,000
Reason to be right or something

848
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:30,656
That's the right move here from even a drop of integrity

849
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
He said

850
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
They should be huge

851
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,728
Problem between Harris

852
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Send Alex

853
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,592
Disagreeing about a news story this is a deeply rooted

854
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
Theological disagreement

855
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
Because

856
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
Harrison believes

857
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:46,272
The pope is wrong at least in part because the Bible doesn't say that Humanity goes out like

858
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,368
Super Alex entertainment is a possibility

859
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,160
That should be heretical talk

860
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
According to Harris

861
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:58,304
None of this means anything because this is a company full of extreme right-wing Zealot conman Liars

862
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,888
But I point this out to illustrate that if any of these people at any of the

863
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
They claim they did they could

864
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
Could never covid

865
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
Austin work together it would just be

866
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
Constant

867
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:13,408
Violence we would never be in this situation if they believed what they said because

868
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,200
Cuz he would never have said that the Pope

869
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,504
Was lying about the end of the world

870
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
Because

871
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,928
He believes that the world is ending I don't know about the inner workings of Infowars after this episode Harrison might

872
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,744
Have stapled the 95 Theses on

873
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,864
Alex's office door there maybe it's isn't happening within Infowars

874
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,704
Spoken out of turn

875
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,752
Martin Luther

876
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
Again

877
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
Blowing us

878
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
So Alex has been gone for a bit

879
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
And

880
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,664
And I have these been gone

881
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
Situation

882
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Ukraine has

883
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
Continued

884
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,528
How to be bad

885
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
Yeah that's got better

886
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
Mitch

887
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
Calculator

888
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
Why did he is

889
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,776
Foreign Service FSB head there their they're CIA

890
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
Pad

891
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,104
Why did they tell them that

892
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,408
Everybody was going to surrender

893
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
Directions to be in big trouble

894
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
2014

895
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,024
There

896
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
A secret

897
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,608
You know Boonton do that

898
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:47,360
He sure as hell has arrested the head of the FSB foreign intelligence service

899
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
Dangerous

900
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,504
Yahoo news

901
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,320
Exclusive secret CIA training program Ukraine

902
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,392
Directions

903
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,000
I didn't start 2015 started in

904
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Teen

905
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
40

906
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
Okay

907
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:17,568
So first off right off the bat this is no similarity with Alex's coverage of things before the

908
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,872
War started

909
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:24,736
There's a completely new narrative that he's pretending is been what he was saying all along

910
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
Domesticated

911
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
Because Alex is a militia

912
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,856
Also the CIA was founded in 1940

913
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,696
37 and you Brave didn't withdraw from Soviet Union till 1991

914
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
I guess when I was his 1945

915
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:42,656
This means the end of WWII so I guess at that point an organization that didn't exist yet was providing military training

916
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,472
To Country if it wasn't an independent country at that

917
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
It makes total sense

918
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,384
Yahoo news article that Alex is talking about is about how after the 2014

919
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
CIA groups

920
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
Did teach some tact

921
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Text Ukraine

922
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
Soldiers

923
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
But why

924
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
A secret or nefarious

925
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,087
From the article

926
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,463
After Russia's 2014 incursion the US military also helped run a long-standing publicly acknowledged

927
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
Training program

928
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,303
For Ukrainian troops in the country's western region

929
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,839
Far from the front lines

930
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,887
The program also included instructions

931
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,935
How to use Javelin anti-tank missiles

932
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
And sniper training

933
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,263
The story also includes about the

934
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
CIA providing

935
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
Santee

936
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
Mistletoe

937
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:29,247
I'm not saying this is a non-story it just doesn't carry the same kind of weight that Alex needs at 2

938
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,903
Also in terms of Sergey abesada the head of the fasb you got arrested

939
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
Generous story about that

940
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,535
Alex wants to create the image that everything Putin does he's okay

941
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
So in this case

942
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,631
Ffsb was aware of State behind that works

943
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,679
Didn't tell Putin about them so that he would set

944
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,007
Rightly arrested

945
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,335
Looking at it a different way it might be the case that Putin

946
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,871
Is realizing that this whole thing is making

947
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,895
I'm looking little bit weak

948
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,223
In an ordered shows about a subordinate to blame and make

949
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
Scapegoat

950
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,063
This is again an example of Oz editorial decision

951
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,367
Clearly revealing his position

952
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,951
You rationalize literally anything that Boudin does

953
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,303
Nuke the us out to get on air the next day and say that Soros made him

954
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
That's the point we're at now

955
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
It's

956
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Bizarre

957
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,447
It is very funny

958
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,007
That his question

959
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
About why Putin

960
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
Who did this

961
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
You know like

962
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
Why was why is

963
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,175
You failing why wasn't his intelligence very good

964
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,479
The actual answers to that

965
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,783
Could be very useful to Alex as well

966
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
Such as

967
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
Maybe autocratic leaders

968
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,367
To control everything

969
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
Don't like

970
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,951
Hearing bad news about how their military can't do stuff

971
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,535
Only good things and only have things reinforce

972
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,887
Only have people follow out their orders the way that they're supposed to

973
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,935
And when you do that sometimes

974
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,471
If you have bad intelligence

975
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
You make a huge

976
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
Drastic mistake

977
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,311
That you continue to do

978
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:02,175
For long after you should have that will eventually lead to you losing Millions upon Millions upon millions of

979
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,247
So maybe

980
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,319
Alex having everybody tell him

981
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,111
Things are going great

982
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Instead of

983
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,719
Going on a military Adventure across the country do podcast

984
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:18,559
We can't afford it something along those lines everybody's like a boss

985
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:26,751
Getting that tank was there all great ideas

986
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,311
I'll leave you

987
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
Your kids

988
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,383
Stay behind Networks

989
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:37,247
Whatever whatever metaphor here

990
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,575
And the first war after World War was not

991
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
Korea

992
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,439
45 in Ukraine

993
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,767
Military history books

994
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
But

995
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,583
Lilly on the Cold War

996
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,679
Has descended down at Churchill said

997
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
Eastern Europe

998
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
My network

999
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,871
The Nazis had

1000
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,943
The US came in that's why they recruited

1001
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
Klaus Barbie

1002
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,855
Josef Mengele and and all the rest of them

1003
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
What so they can

1004
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,159
Rolos Networks

1005
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,231
Hold off the Soviets political

1006
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,511
And overthrow Zenni

1007
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,327
Successful

1008
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,143
Pocono stay behind that works never

1009
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,423
Went away

1010
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
For hundreds of years

1011
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,895
It'll still be going to plan on

1012
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,479
I received

1013
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,503
The Sprout perfectly

1014
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,599
Miracle-Gro

1015
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,671
Civil War

1016
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,487
When Sorrows did that

1017
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,839
Tesoro's beautiful

1018
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,399
Call Mom

1019
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
In World War

1020
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,263
Beautiful,

1021
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
Popping back up

1022
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,335
Because they were just laying there dormant

1023
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
For 75 years

1024
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
Their children

1025
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,735
This metaphor completely Got Away pallets

1026
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,527
Control

1027
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,623
He's trying to make his audience think of the Vols operation gladio

1028
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,183
Isn't involved in any of this

1029
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:21,951
Reality

1030
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,231
We're talkin about here

1031
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,279
This all sounds pretty good

1032
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:31,679
Fun metaphor there like Seether never die Soros planted the seeds of rebellion the lay dormant until the uprising

1033
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
This feels good for Alex

1034
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,263
To say or like laying out the

1035
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,311
Does metaphor until he starts realizing what he

1036
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
You saying

1037
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
He runs into

1038
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,383
Two very serious problem

1039
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,431
The first is that seeds don't live

1040
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Ivy I was going to

1041
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
I was going to say.

1042
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,039
Most are not viable after a few years

1043
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,831
And this is

1044
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,647
The case when they're properly stored and

1045
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Preserve

1046
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:57,279
There are some ancient seeds that have been viable and could be planted but they're absolutely the except

1047
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
Not the rule

1048
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,911
Do you want to see between viable and still planted was a Judy and palm which is 2,000

1049
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,703
Years old but the next oldest is

1050
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
13

1051
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,495
100 years old

1052
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
My oldest CD

1053
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,823
It's been able to be terminated

1054
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
That's a big

1055
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,639
Jump

1056
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
The big

1057
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,943
700 years

1058
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,223
With almost 50%

1059
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,247
Of the

1060
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
The time

1061
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,319
It's really rare for this actually work

1062
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:25,695
Hoaxes where people plant seeds that they claim are old but they're actually just current Daisy

1063
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:30,815
Houses probably seem like Daily Mail headlines about these hoaxes and assume that happens all the time

1064
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,631
I'm not sure why you said it was Papyrus but I guess who's

1065
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,655
Just because that's a word

1066
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:37,727
That sounds like an ancient thing

1067
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,359
The second problem is that when he started the metaphor I don't think you realize how far back he was going

1068
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:47,711
If you stay behind networks were set up in 1945 then assuming the members were eight

1069
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,991
18 at that point they be like

1070
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:54,879
109 know what you don't understand is that they were shot of the rocket at relativistic speeds

1071
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:02,303
Alpha Centauri okay and then when they got back around

1072
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,655
But see because they were irrelevant to do they didn't age

1073
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
Okay right

1074
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,983
Is it raining the whole time

1075
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,799
Think that your theory is interesting but as soon as that isn't

1076
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:18,943
The case is good as his they will be 100 years old and I don't know how effective hundred-year-old stay at work would be

1077
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,223
Ha rappelling

1078
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
Russian invasion

1079
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,343
I saw Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and that old dude did not fight well

1080
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:30,975
100 years old is tough for an infantryman

1081
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:39,679
Realizes his mistake and how dumb that sounds so he says that it's the children and grandchildren of those stay by Networks

1082
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,959
This is so stupid

1083
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:47,615
He can't prove that these networks exist and even if he did now he has to somehow find a way to show that they pass down their positions Jen

1084
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Generationally

1085
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:53,503
This is really really dumb stuff and it's just leaving me disaffected Alex he's still high

1086
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,551
I think you might still be high

1087
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,575
Performance

1088
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,391
I do like the idea of something

1089
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:05,791
Teenager being behind Network you're going to be able to stay behind Network

1090
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,351
Miracle-Gro on us

1091
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,375
Dad

1092
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
You will be

1093
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,799
I was going to stay behind Network my father before me with a rhino

1094
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,359
We're unstable network family

1095
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,271
That's great

1096
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
Alex

1097
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Knows a lot

1098
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,111
About the situation

1099
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,391
Historically

1100
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,159
Between

1101
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,183
Russia in

1102
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
That's why I like

1103
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
Everyone thinks he's a bad guy

1104
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,375
Casinos facts

1105
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,447
Like things that were put out by Putin and press releases

1106
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,727
We hate people who know if

1107
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,263
Yeah but

1108
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,287
He's not taking a side

1109
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,079
That's what people can

1110
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:50,847
Grasp

1111
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,807
Do you know what the

1112
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,511
Both sides have arguments

1113
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
What's in the show

1114
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,887
We need peace we to deal when you stop this right now

1115
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
To stop

1116
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:24,383
Medias

1117
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,711
Instead of being on

1118
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,783
Directions sites including perfect and he deserves it all in

1119
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,319
He's right let's get behind

1120
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,695
Ra7

1121
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:44,351
Have you had to blame somebody for us in the left of the globalist

1122
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,911
Who started dishing who drew first blood

1123
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,959
Got the song going in it

1124
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,287
Come down the path

1125
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,359
New World Order

1126
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,407
If Barack Obama George Soros

1127
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:03,807
Well that kind of undercuts your whole point about the not taken aside and I'm not going to take a side

1128
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:07,135
I am just going to say that is entirely Obama's fault right

1129
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:11,743
MLive

1130
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,535
Not on his side

1131
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,375
Blameless in this situation aerial Act

1132
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
They

1133
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,423
Just reveal

1134
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,959
Your actual position

1135
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:24,031
Alex Gibbs say that he's neutral or whatever it does

1136
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,055
Sport Bun B

1137
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
Bebe

1138
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,847
Compounded effect

1139
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,919
Literally every piece of information that he provides

1140
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,223
Why is Putin is Right losing his good

1141
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,527
The death invasion is just

1142
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,319
Install

1143
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:41,439
That's the story he's the stay behind that were started in 1945 not 2015

1144
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
Immediately following

1145
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:46,559
Putin Faja country

1146
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,887
It wasn't in response to something that is already happening

1147
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:56,287
Obama was a Madman dictator crazy guy

1148
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,055
One more mad

1149
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Haha

1150
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,359
This

1151
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,383
Clip is not

1152
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,199
But I did I did like this

1153
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
Alex

1154
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,527
Kind of laying out this idea that what you should do

1155
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,807
Is you should

1156
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,111
Globalist Lee

1157
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,927
I'm sorry what globalist

1158
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,791
Shanghai

1159
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,583
But being against

1160
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,399
Understanding what they're doing.

1161
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,447
Not going to be part of this

1162
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
Find a solution

1163
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:26,751
Can out of this

1164
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
With this water bottle

1165
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,407
Because of nuclear weapons and other things

1166
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,783
Of course all this is insane

1167
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,391
Waterloo records

1168
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,303
I get sick

1169
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
Everytime I'm there

1170
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Huge headache

1171
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
Like hell

1172
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
Good question

1173
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,151
Cool

1174
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,943
I hope I Alex didn't get covid

1175
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:13,087
I guess we probably won't know for a while because he lied about it the other times they got it came to work and

1176
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,879
Exposed entire crew to it that

1177
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,951
You'd rather do that than admit that he might have been wrong about it being real

1178
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
Seriously

1179
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
Dreamcatcher

1180
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,535
Like a California curse

1181
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
Scott

1182
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,679
With the flu

1183
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:30,495
Is bio lab in Ukraine

1184
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:36,895
That's where it came from

1185
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,223
I like building Alex's solution is literally a dawn solution

1186
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,271
Absolutely no solution

1187
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:45,599
Provided herein every single one of his talking points is backing up Putin

1188
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,623
Narrative of the war

1189
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,439
Soros and Obama are to blame ultimately

1190
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:52,767
He is just trying to wipe out these dangerous bioweapon labs

1191
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:57,375
This is wall-to-wall weasel life Putin propaganda much of a coward to admit

1192
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
Is real position

1193
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
You can say is nuance

1194
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
What species both sides

1195
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,263
The reality of this content the information that he's covering

1196
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,543
Is deeply one-sided

1197
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,823
Everything he brings up

1198
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,871
Is something metal legitimized boutin's invasion

1199
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,223
The basically one

1200
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991
Person who can do that

1201
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,295
It's not Ukraine B

1202
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:19,647
Continuing this morning

1203
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:26,047
And also think globalist is fun

1204
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,607
Presenting this idea that if you want to save the world all you have to do is

1205
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:32,191
A shadowy all-powerful group pavillon

1206
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,519
Bright planets are really dumb and they come from your imagination

1207
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:40,895
Hahaha I mean it was it was originally Steve Harvey's sequel to

1208
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:47,295
Think Like a Man I Think Like a Woman Act Like a Man

1209
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
I think

1210
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,159
It's crazy to me that you can say okay we'll all the

1211
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,207
Justifications for the

1212
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,511
This war totally true and right

1213
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,303
Yeah now I'm not on the side

1214
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,631
I'm not saying that he is totally justified in this

1215
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,935
By his own justification into because

1216
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,703
If not

1217
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,727
Why not

1218
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,543
His justifications you Woodside are true

1219
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,823
So why aren't you supporting

1220
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:16,735
That's a very simple question that Alex doesn't want to

1221
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,271
Piece of that is

1222
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,087
Information are you relying on other than things

1223
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,367
Things directly from poop

1224
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,903
To assert

1225
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
These

1226
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,951
Talking points that Putin

1227
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,719
That is just

1228
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:30,815
Location of the Warriors being correct the person you specifically noted lied

1229
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
Do you

1230
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:36,447
Well you pretend that episode didn't happen

1231
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:41,055
All of Alex's stories in the lead-up to the war and where the invasion happen or happens

1232
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:45,663
No absolutely not

1233
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,943
Very aware of

1234
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,503
Did Putin the end of February

1235
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,343
To stay behind networks and they betrayed him maybe that's what Alex is

1236
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,415
Thinking that's what it's got to be right but still that wasn't

1237
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,231
The topic of conversation up until this point

1238
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,023
You'd think it'd be really important

1239
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,047
Another headline

1240
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,095
More that lives here

1241
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
Loving

1242
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,191
I mentioned this earlier

1243
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,519
U.s. sending suicide drones to Ukraine

1244
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,055
Oh wow

1245
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,103
Headline for Alex to use because

1246
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,407
Based on the wording of it I know exactly where

1247
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
From

1248
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,991
Other outlets reported on the story saying switchblade

1249
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,015
Drones

1250
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,807
The site that uses this headline

1251
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,087
Suicide drone

1252
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,415
Is it freeze at information liberation.

1253
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
Cam

1254
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,743
I decided to check out some of the most recent articles

1255
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
Oh man

1256
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,047
What's going on here

1257
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:39,935
These storms will contribute to Russia's Glory Putin holds giant Rally impact Moscow stadium

1258
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:45,823
That's not good

1259
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,431
Zelensky delivers his funniest performance yet in speech before US Congress

1260
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,967
Wow

1261
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:55,295
I can see disagreeing with zelensky or possibly even like being

1262
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
Opposed

1263
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,367
Yes you can

1264
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
Maybe

1265
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,439
I don't know I don't know exactly how you would but

1266
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,743
Whatever it's a position somewhere

1267
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,559
It's another level of being a s*** had to say that speech was

1268
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,327
Funny

1269
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,143
This line was probably really funny to this blogger

1270
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:15,007
I'm almost 45 years old today my age stopped when the hearts of more than

1271
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,031
Do children stop Beat

1272
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,103
I see no sense in life if they cannot stop the deaths

1273
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:22,687
This is my mission is the leader of my people and the leader of my nation

1274
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,223
So I guess that's funny

1275
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
To the sky

1276
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:31,647
Hilarious this one doesn't sound good quote the great Jewish oligarchs Escape Russian oligarchs Fleet

1277
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,695
Israel in bid to dodge sanctions

1278
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,791
Who is literally going to make a joke no

1279
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:44,191
YouTube don't even need to bother with an interesting lead interesting Lee this was covering an article

1280
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:46,751
Tourettes title CO2 the Great

1281
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,311
Escape with his blog decided to add Jewish to it

1282
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,383
Have to make the whole story really just an exercise in the empty

1283
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,175
Somatic dual loyalty trope

1284
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,735
Play the classic in white nationalist a Neo-Nazi

1285

Communities

1286
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,551
Truly weird great way to do it weird

1287
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,599
Oh here's some important news that they decided

1288
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:06,463
Patriarch Kirill conflict in Ukraine is a battle against the

1289
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,535
International order built on gay pride parades

1290
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:14,655
This was about to be spiritual leader of the Russian Orthodox church and Putin Ally patriarch

1291
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,703
Making some really dumb,

1292
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,263
Today there was such a test

1293
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,335
For the Loyalty of this government I kind of pass

1294
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,127
Happy world

1295
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,919
The world of excess consumption

1296
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,711
The world invisible freedom

1297
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,991
Do you know what that test is

1298
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,783
The test is very simple and at the

1299
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,807
The same time terrible

1300
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,855
This is a gay parade

1301
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,927
So yeah this Saturday

1302
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,487
A Putin Ally

1303
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,791
Evicted stay at 8 you want in the club

1304
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,071
Hey got have a gay parade

1305
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:43,839
There is

1306
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
Nothing

1307
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,655
That gets one closer to God

1308
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,239
Been really blaming the murder of

1309
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,031
Thousands of people on

1310
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
Gay people

1311
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
That's

1312
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,919
Here's a here's a bad one articles they post

1313
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
Just before the invasion

1314
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,015
Tell me if his blockers

1315
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,063
Think this is a good or a bad thing

1316
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,087
Quote

1317
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:09,183
Give blood and soil speech on Ukraine unifying with Russia

1318
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,719
Okay well that's probably

1319
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
Only going to be a bad

1320
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,303
I think as we all know the blood and soil speech is is

1321
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,351
It's a very specific

1322
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,727
Beginning of the article

1323
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,287
Vitamin Putin on Monday delivered an impassioned speech

1324
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:27,615
Accusing the Ukrainian government of operating a kleptocracy controlled

1325
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:32,223
By corrupt oligarchs and advisors and non-governmental organization

1326
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:37,599
And made the case for a reunification with Russia is what people Bound by Blood and Christianity

1327
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,903
Don't say this website looks

1328
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:45,279
Totally Above board and the sort of place that I would be shopping for articles to cover on my show if I were a lie

1329
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,631
This is almost offensively biased and Alex knows

1330
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:56,031
Is that he gets his news from aggressively pro-putin sites and espouses strictly popotan appropriate messaging

1331
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,079
But hiding behind this facade that music

1332
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,103
Exploring both sides

1333
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:03,711
How much does this because he's fully aware the Putin is the aggressor in the war

1334
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,479
If you stop

1335
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,039
Attacking Ukraine there would be no further War

1336
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,831
There isn't anything that you crank

1337
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:13,951
Can do to stop the war other than acquiesce to Putin's demands and essentially no longer be a sovereign country

1338
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,743
How to play the game of

1339
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,767
Just consistent with the warranty

1340
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,327
Sounds great if you're not paying attention

1341
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,375
Does need to end

1342
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:25,471
I was just pretending that the guy who supports isn't the only person who can make that happen

1343
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,239
And it means

1344
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,055
Just totally ridiculous

1345
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
Aires

1346
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,847
This

1347
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,127
This attempt

1348
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:32,895
2

1349
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,967
Pure like moderate wow the same time

1350
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,783
Like you're taking your news from this

1351
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,063
F****** blog

1352
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,647
That is disgustingly pro-putin tobacco love

1353
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,671
Mocking

1354
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,695
Itsfunneh

1355
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,719
Zelensky speech

1356
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,511
Where he discusses needing help

1357
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,327
Right and the civilian

1358
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,351
Rapping killed

1359
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,119
Yeah it's

1360
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,167
I mean

1361
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
What I see from this

1362
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:01,567
From so much of that especially the people trying to like run interference for it

1363
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
Is

1364
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
It's

1365
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,943
Smart to get people to think it's okay to

1366
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,735
To murder people based on false

1367
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,039
If you are a conservative

1368
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,879
It is

1369
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:21,279
You know you don't want to say that it's wrong for Putin to just go murder people because then people might connect that to Hugo

1370
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,559
Going in murdering people

1371
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:28,959
And then you won't be allowed to do it I think there might be some of that underneath the surface but I think there's also a

1372
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:34,847
Pot committed kind of thing in poker terms which Alex has built up

1373
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,919
Who has the enemy of the globalist

1374
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,943
And all this in

1375
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
Into

1376
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:43,807
Accept and admit that he's carrying out and

1377
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:46,879
Award that is unnecessary and is targeting

1378
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,975
Sure is terrorizing people

1379
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,071
It would lend you

1380
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,607
Require you to take the side of the

1381
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:02,495
The quote-unquote globalist and Alex can't get himself to that point I feel like it's not that hard to

1382
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,519
To go from

1383
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,823
Putin miscalculated

1384
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
2

1385
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,639
Putin's trick.

1386
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,943
You know just being like he's a liar

1387
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:17,343
He lied to me just say he's a liar and he's a secret Gobal global Assault

1388
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:23,743
Secret globalist double-time cuz he's fighting gets Ukraine that is full of Soros and stay behind Networks

1389
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,703
Trump is a secret Patriot for 50 years

1390
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,263
That didn't work

1391
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,103
Do you think about this to there is no hope for this auntie globalist

1392
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,383
Leadership

1393
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,151
If Putin

1394
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:41,919
Isn't that

1395
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,503
Do you have that you have bolsonaro

1396
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,575
Rally

1397
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,927
Brazil is not a insignificant country a world superpower

1398
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:54,975
To create

1399
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
Kind of

1400
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,047
Situation where there's a multipolar world

1401
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,887
I guess of

1402
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,679
Potential hostility

1403
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:07,007
Against the the the UN

1404
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,799
Global government

1405
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,335
Like you need

1406
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,895
The superpower to be led by an

1407
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,943
Anti globalist person

1408
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
Hey Matt is dead

1409
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,759
Putin is required

1410
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,783
For that

1411
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,575
I would take her one

1412
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:26,207
Literally being like surprise

1413
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,023
Weevil

1414
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,839
Sure there's no hope

1415
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
For the

1416
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,887
The possibility of life

1417
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,655
Leadership

1418
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,447
Nothing like Trump is gone

1419
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,215
Yeah

1420
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,495
Probably not coming back

1421
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,263
Maybe is

1422
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,847
But even if he does it's not going to be like

1423
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,151
We've played that game already it's

1424
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
It's

1425
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:46,943
Sour grapes

1426
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,479
Shaffer for Alex

1427
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,783
I think that's a big part of

1428
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
What he can

1429
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:52,831
Give up on

1430
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
It is that like

1431
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,159
A student where to

1432
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,951
Strong man can't lose

1433
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:02,303
If a strong man loses he's not strong and that McCabe lose if you're against

1434
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,375
Strong man can't lose

1435
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:09,215
And then your ideology or your the story that you're telling

1436
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,495
I think eight

1437
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,287
Continue past NY

1438
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,591
We don't know about Casey's next

1439
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,383
Setback

1440
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,455
So get another headline

1441
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,247
Something baby headline I don't know

1442
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,391
White House Press briefing

1443
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:31,999
There's a bunch of women

1444
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,047
That's one little bit of sexism they're great

1445
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,119
Who told Alex that women were against the war

1446
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:43,519
Well considering that one reason he hated Hillary Clinton so much was that she was a warmonger

1447
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
True seems like it will be hard

1448
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,871
Had to go back now and say that women are against War

1449
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,407
I think maybe he's

1450
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:54,271
Thinking of Greta thunberg

1451
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,807
AR buddy

1452
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:01,951
So this was a compilation of clips of reporters in the pressure of asking if there was a point where Biden would see is like a red line

1453
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:07,839
It does come off a bit bad preoccupation with the idea of a larger

1454
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,655
But these reporters weren't begging for a war

1455
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,191
Too much as they were trying to get information

1456
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,215
Taking report

1457
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:17,567
I want the main questions on the reader's Minds presumably as whether or not there's a situation whereby

1458
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,103
Consider sending troops

1459
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,175
How do I get to spend my time defending it but Alex

1460
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
Is misrepresenting

1461
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,223
This clipping weirdly

1462
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:27,039
How using it has a strange attack on women

1463
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,319
Sure

1464
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,855
Why not fund

1465
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,671
It seems like the the

1466
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,695
Obama lesson

1467
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
Just don't say

1468
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,255
Openly that there's a red line

1469
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
When it gets crossed and you don't do s***

1470
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,327
What about it

1471
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,143
You're f***** I think that's probably a great Paula

1472
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,959
In general don't make that kind of

1473
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
Specific

1474
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,519
I b 2

1475
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
It's due

1476
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,055
Chaotic

1477
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,871
Altering the chaos we got a guest coming in

1478
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,663
Haven't heard from you in awhile

1479
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:57,759
Welcome ladies and tell him he's got freely on the best experts we could have on about

1480
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
Spoiled

1481
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,855
Went to harbordale universities and got the

1482
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,391
Special degree PA

1483
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,415
The only hand out once

1484
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
Someone kissing

1485
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,719
Forgot the same one

1486
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
Kissinger administered we got that

1487
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,303
The anglo-american

1488
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,143
So you like

1489
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,167
Yeah

1490
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
Route of the u.s.

1491
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,495
Chemical in the lighter biological

1492
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,055
Weapons laws

1493
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,335
That was instrumental in

1494
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,871
The UN treaties well-heeled

1495
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,919
Are you in

1496
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,479
I also prosecutor and some of the biggest

1497
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,295
Everglow somalogic

1498
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,903
Here really interesting I'll Francis Boyle stop

1499
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,719
Showing up on the show for a really long stretch where Alex

1500
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:41,023
See much money and pushing the Wuhan lab

1501
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:41,791
Conspiracies

1502
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:45,631
Either because the audience was getting bored of them or because there wasn't any new territory

1503
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
To cover their

1504
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:51,007
Either way without that being a Hot Topic Francis Boyle is straight-up worthless as a guest

1505
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,031
He's boring

1506
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:55,615
He seems like a crank in order to introduce him in a way that the audience alike

1507
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,151
You have to lie about his

1508
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,943
Double quick erection

1509
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,527
Loyal wrote wasn't adapted into the wall

1510
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,551
Do you and uses

1511
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,855
The US version boil wrote was adapter

1512
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,391
From the UN version

1513
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,695
Alex always lies about this be

1514
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,719
Because his version makes

1515
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,535
The pier like boil is influencing international law

1516
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,815
As opposed to the reality

1517
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:18,655
He was just a dabbing International lawsuit would apply domestically in the United

1518
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,935
Actually

1519
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,215
Because think about that that's

1520
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
What a global

1521
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:25,567
Well what he had to do was remove the use

1522
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
From color

1523
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,383
Because an American colors are have the you

1524
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663
I mean

1525
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,687
That's a pretty big

1526
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,991
United Nations to United

1527
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:38,367
Yeah yeah that stuff that is also he wasn't a prosecutor let alone the lead one

1528
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,391
The case against melosa

1529
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,719
In that case

1530
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:46,559
What you be opposed to that because that's the case was heard in the UN

1531
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,607
Can't believe has any jurisdiction

1532
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,447
I don't know why

1533
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,727
Some you win some you lose

1534
01:07:54,239 --> 01:08:00,383
Doesn't want to get into the weeds with boils resume because he represented the provisional

1535
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,455
Government of the State of Palestine as well as many Native groups

1536
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,735
Like the Lakota Nation

1537
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:08,063
Andy was formally on the board of Amnesty International Alex

1538
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,879
It's called a child trafficking operation in the past

1539
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:16,511
How do I appreciate some of the folks at Boyle's represented with this dude sucks Ukraine biolabs

1540
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,791
Is flying around 2 Alex

1541
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,071
Remember the boy exist

1542
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,631
He's got to try this boring-ass down for a chat

1543
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,167
Fun

1544
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
Great

1545
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:28,287
Great so we got boil in there to justify Putin killing

1546
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,895
Alex

1547
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,711
They get into the bio lab thing

1548
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:36,991
He's also

1549
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,039
Biological weapons

1550
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,599
Frustrated in that

1551
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,671
Obama and others Winton

1552
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,255
Basically refurbished their labs in Washington Post

1553
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,423
Ukraine expert has a collar

1554
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:01,311
And then the media simultaneously

1555
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,639
I am in your Russian agent

1556
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,199
Two of them

1557
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,759
USA Today

1558
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,295
Weather

1559
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,879
I told you land of Beyond

1560
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,975
Beyond the Tea Party in Alice in Wonderland I mean this this is just

1561
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:23,071
6 brass balls to accuse something of being like the tea party when that's what you called your

1562
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:23,839
Political party

1563
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,119
Realwear

1564
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,423
So here's the game was being played

1565
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:31,007
Alexandra's weirdo propagandist Friends making incendiary

1566
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:35,615
Accusation based on years old Russian propaganda in Russia used

1567
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,663
Asians like in Georgia

1568
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:42,015
Alex says there's bio-weapon Labs run by the US and Ukraine

1569
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:45,087
And starts building a conspiracy about how that's why Putin is

1570
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
Is invaded

1571
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,391
Then we made out of originated

1572
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:51,231
The claim he amplifies it

1573
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,023
Elaborate stories to flesh out the

1574
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,095
To the point where a bunch of idiots online or convince

1575
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:57,887
Got made

1576
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,191
Push back

1577
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,471
And say that this is ridiculous

1578
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:05,055
And there aren't bioweapons lab

1579
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:05,823
In Ukraine

1580
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,639
They aren't saying that there aren't any biological labs

1581
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:12,735
Country and are covering up us support for the modernization efforts

1582
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,551
But they are pushing back against the stupid over Blanca

1583
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,319
Conspiracy

1584
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:21,183
Now Alex is taking those denials and pretending they were actually denying that there were no labs

1585
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:21,951
In the country

1586
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,487
This is super confusing to him

1587
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:28,095
Things get confusing when you just make sure it up all the time and attack your imaginary enemies

1588
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,399
You constantly lose the thread

1589
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,447
Do you imagine what they're saying back in

1590
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,727
Adult

1591
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,495
Exhausting

1592
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:40,383
Also Obama has nothing to do with the starting of this partnership between Kiev in the United States in terms of modernizing those labs

1593
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,175
That dates back to at least 2,000

1594
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:42,943
5

1595
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:47,807
And the weapon non-proliferation treaty we signed with them years before Obama was President

1596
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,391
Also if Alex has 1945

1597
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,951
USA slow

1598
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:58,047
Articles about Obama

1599
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:58,815
Ukraine

1600
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,631
How was there no mention of this in the lead-up to The Invasion

1601
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:08,287
It seems like if all this s*** would be relevant and it's definitely a large part of its coverage now but it feels like is only week

1602
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,079
Campbell talking point Alex was aware of

1603
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,103
After Putin

1604
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,895
Inline media started pushing

1605
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,175
The story is a means to just

1606
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,199
Supply that invasion

1607
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,247
Seems weird that that wasn't even

1608
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,783
Wasn't even

1609
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:23,647
Turtle in Alex's mind if the days before the invasion

1610
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,927
Yeah yeah

1611
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:25,951
Weird

1612
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,719
Weird

1613
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,767
I do like the I do like that

1614
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:33,887
Like they refurbish them how evil and shouldn't it be a simple question of like a

1615
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,167
What do you want

1616
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,471
In foreign bio lab

1617
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,543
Do you want them to have drips dropping from the ceiling

1618
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,335
And Lakeisha

1619
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
Or do you want it

1620
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,383
To be safe

1621
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,919
There's that

1622
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,991
Reason why

1623
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
Labs

1624
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,039
Require

1625
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,599
Keeping some of these samples around

1626
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:59,487
Some people often don't understand exactly why that is one of them

1627
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,535
Never discussed by Alex

1628
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,815
That in order to

1629
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,839
To calibrate

1630
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,863
Testing

1631
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:12,031
You need a sample of the thing right that you would be testing for in order to assure that this thing works

1632
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:16,127
Machine works

1633
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,663
That's what I want by 11

1634
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
Seems like

1635
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,527
Is like

1636
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
Important

1637
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:26,111
High-risk high-level stuff and

1638
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,647
You know I think

1639
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:31,231
Knowing that you need to keep you samples on hand whether it be for

1640
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,511
Some kind of a test

1641
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,535
Sometimes it

1642
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,327
Experiment or some kind of

1643
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,863
Calibration of equipment

1644
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,399
You need to be safe

1645
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
You needed

1646
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,191
Pedicure

1647
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,751
And that was a large part of the u.s. involved

1648
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,567
Hi there already

1649
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:54,271
I mean the conspiracy mind is that preparation for a disaster is preparation to make

1650
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,295
The disaster

1651
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
So

1652
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,927
Weather

1653
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:07,327
What happened to that like survival food is he planning to burn all the crops in America

1654
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,143
That's how he works

1655
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
So

1656
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,447
The boil starts

1657
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,031
6 minutes

1658
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,335
What is your synopsis if you were

1659
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,639
Briefing World your briefing Millions right now

1660
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,455
About the some knowledge of what you would call

1661
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,503
This sleepwalking into Armageddon or what is

1662
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:30,367
Thank you very much for helping out my best year

1663
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
Viewing audience

1664
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,279
With the

1665
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:41,375
Promises made by Secretary State Jim Baker

1666
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:44,703
And many of the other NATO leaders

1667
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,263
That are secretary-general gorbachov

1668
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:50,079
Agreed to the unification

1669
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,127
All the of Germany

1670
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,711
Not move to the east

1671
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,015
1 star Clinton die

1672
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:02,367
They proceeded to expand 280 to the east

1673
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:07,231
The promises the Baker and the other European leaders

1674
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,023
Beta gorbachov

1675
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:12,095
War binding under international law

1676
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,119
This is bulshit

1677
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,167
Boyle is just repeating things he's heard

1678
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:21,311
Gorbachev is giving interviews about the negotiations with Baker and he said the topic of other countries joining NATO never came up

1679
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,615
There wasn't an agreement accepted NATO troops

1680
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,383
Copy station

1681
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,407
East Germany

1682
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:30,783
So we're starting off here on a false premise that only serves to legitimize Boone's argument for invade

1683
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:35,647
And to be clear I'm not necessarily saying the NATO expansion is a positive thing and I think there's

1684
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,927
Is a lot of Fine Art

1685
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,719
Commence against NATO and how it operates

1686
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,255
What I am saying is

1687
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:46,655
The claiming that native agreed to not expand with Gorbachev negotiated with Bakery is not true and even if it were it wouldn't be a

1688
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,191
Navigation for invading Ukraine

1689
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:51,519
Went to other NATO countries already border Russia

1690
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,567
Ukraine is not going to be joining anytime soon

1691
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:58,431
Bigger problem boy was supposed to be an expert in international law and I guess if

1692
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:00,735
He really believes this line then boil shouldn't

1693
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,759
Have a problem

1694
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:05,087
Arguing that a pre-emptive strike against any NATO country should be just

1695
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,111
Ossified if Russia did

1696
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,391
Yeah

1697
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,463
Well they were I mean you could say that NATO is

1698
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,487
Intox with Eddie Kane

1699
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:18,399
Or any countries that recently joined like Montenegro join not too long ago

1700
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:22,239
And everybody's got to take down Montenegro even matoes like while we're going to go down there

1701
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:27,359
Did the rationalizations and

1702
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,687
Vacations you can make Based On Believing gas

1703
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,479
Are are staggering

1704
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,527
Do anything

1705
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
Mama's

1706
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,319
What's what's

1707
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,135
So insane is when you're like

1708
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,671
Redoing

1709
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,231
When you're redrafting pass

1710
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,047
Treatise

1711
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,607
You know you're not accounting for the fact that

1712
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,655
Putin is the f******

1713
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
President of

1714
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:54,239
Of Russian man we're dealing with his b*******

1715
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,263
Not even

1716
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:58,335
Really the way he's reacting to

1717
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:03,711
Treaties in the past or anything like that this is a dude who is a megalomaniacal lunatic

1718
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,247
Who is trying to read

1719
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:11,903
Form the Soviet Union it wouldn't matter if NATO was weaker or stronger imagining like

1720
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,463
Kind of a reality where he hasn't broken for you

1721
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:20,863
Yeah what are we doing

1722
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,423
Absolutely

1723
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,215
They're really parses Act

1724
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,031
See how well that holds up

1725
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,591
Speaking of treaties

1726
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,127
Boyle is Mother dump

1727
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,967
December as you know

1728
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,807
Russian government submitted to treaties to Nato

1729
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,111
And to the bidens ministration

1730
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:46,463
I've read them I won't go through all of them here that was a wish list okay

1731
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,767
Why was

1732
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,839
Russia wanted assurances

1733
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:56,191
That Ukraine was not going to join NATO

1734
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:00,287
And that NATO would not expand se2

1735
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,311
Moldova

1736
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:05,151
And Georgia which are right there too

1737
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,687
In this area

1738
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,247
For two months

1739
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,039
Z

1740
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,319
Conformist

1741
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,135
Lulu sweet negotiating

1742
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:18,207
With the bike Administration over this

1743
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:22,303
And refuse absolutely refused

1744
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,863
Assurances

1745
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,423
Which insured have given because

1746
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,775
They were required by the promises that Jim Bakker have made

1747
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,567
4

1748
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:34,591
Who cares

1749
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:39,455
Boyle's World Boonton is asking for assurances of things that are already established International laws

1750
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,991
Biden's response doesn't matter

1751
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:46,879
However if boiled wrong and all this didn't happen and there was no guarantee that it's really just food making demands in

1752
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,415
Listen to them

1753
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:52,767
Yeah also there's a reason to boil isn't going into the details about these

1754
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,047
A treaty to man

1755
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,351
It's because they're a bit over-reaching

1756
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:02,751
Suggested that they were designed to be rejected to give the appearance of trying to have a diplomatic approach

1757
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,287
One request

1758
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,591
Is the demand that they do not expand

1759
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:10,431
Specifically to include Ukraine but also generally to not any other country

1760
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:13,247
The other main request is a little sticky

1761
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:16,319
This wanted Biden shoes now

1762
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,599
That might have been fine

1763
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:23,231
Was that they wanted they do to agree to not deploy any troops or weapons

1764
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:28,863
Any country that have joined NATO past 1997

1765
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,399
I doubt that would be to be fine

1766
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:33,471
The day was 1997 because that was when it agreement was signed

1767
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:36,543
Between NATO and Russia called the founding act on Mutual

1768
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,567
Cooperation in

1769
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,103
Security between NATO and the Russian

1770
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
Confederation

1771
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,431
This was an agreement aimed at warming relation

1772
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,991
Pacifically deals with

1773
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,783
He's not deployed nuclear weapons to member

1774
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:50,879
Also weirdly in that document with both the both

1775
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,183
NATO and Russia agree to it says quote

1776
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:59,583
Needle has expanded and will continue to expand its political functions and take on New Missions of peacekeeping and crisis management

1777
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:01,887
In support of the United Nations in the organization

1778
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,167
For security and cooperation

1779
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:07,007
Europe should be in there based on boils understanding

1780
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:10,079
Things like why would Russia agree to a document

1781
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,359
That says NATO has

1782
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,127
Expanded and will

1783
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,687
Expand because they've already paid off the rush

1784
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
Military in

1785
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,735
Zielinski

1786
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,527
It's all making sense now

1787
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:26,463
Being 45-45 is when he first took office

1788
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,487
Alright

1789
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:31,839
I asked that Russia was making at the end of 2021 was a non-starter

1790
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:37,983
Because essentially what it would do is make a NATO say that these countries that have joined since 1997

1791
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,543
The Czech Republic Hungary Poland Bulgaria is

1792
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:45,663
Estonia Latvia Lithuania Romania Slovakia Slovenia Albania Croatia Montenegro

1793
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:51,551
North Macedonia right they would all be in the alliance but also if they're in trouble NATO wasn't going to be able to help

1794
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,367
Undermine the entire premise of an alliance

1795
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:58,207
Anson leave all these countries on their back foot unprepared for a possible encourage

1796
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:03,583
Also from 1997 to 2014 there what it wasn't a super common practice for States

1797
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,351
Send troops

1798
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:07,935
Happens to new member states unless there was an emergency

1799
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,727
Change

1800
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,751
Putin

1801
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:16,384
Invaded and annexed Ukraine if you cry me up

1802
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,480
Right perspective

1803
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,272
Naturally this isn't

1804
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,552
An agreement that bite

1805
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,320
When is going to accept

1806
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,368
And guess what even if you wanted to

1807
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,136
He couldn't

1808
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,672
It will be up to Nato

1809
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,696
They revoked

1810
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,488
Find doesn't run NATO

1811
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,560
Herb oil to climb with this was a sincere effort on Putin

1812
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,096
Barton that there was a rejection of

1813
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,120
Pizano

1814
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,960
Is completely absurd and reveals only that he's probably a big

1815
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,240
Consumer afar rape

1816
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,568
Sporting media probably like Reeds information Liberation over breakfast

1817
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,104
It's sad

1818
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,944
Nonsense I find it hard to believe that

1819
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,528
If Biden were to come out and could have

1820
01:20:54,784 --> 01:21:00,416
Picture later to every demand that Putin made believe the far-right would be like

1821
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:04,256
Great idea for the leader of our Sovereign Nation

1822
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:10,656
Giving a weakness

1823
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:15,776
Are you giving an inch now take over America

1824
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,312
But I doubt these people

1825
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:20,640
I hate speaking dumb things gives no dumb pot boil has

1826
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,712
Even today

1827
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,504
I'm in favor

1828
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,784
Stopping War

1829
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,576
It could be stopped today

1830
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,648
President by where to get up and announce

1831
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,768
Yes Ukraine will not be joining

1832
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:43,680
Already said that will not be expanding to the east in Georgia Moldova

1833
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,960
Or elsewhere

1834
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,520
And the rest were prepared to negotiate

1835
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,336
Certainly over

1836
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,360
Removing

1837
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,920
US nuclear weapons for Europe

1838
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,200
This is so stupid

1839
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,760
NATO won't expand means nothing

1840
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:03,392
He doesn't control that unilaterally it even if he did I thought the premise of war was supposed to be about

1841
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
Be notifying

1842
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,464
Ukrainian or shutting down bio-weapon labs are

1843
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,256
Taking back a dumb bass region

1844
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,304
Is rightfully Russia's and under attack by Ukraine

1845
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,352
I'd arrive lost

1846
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:17,472
The plot I don't really know what we're supposed to be justifying anymore I feel like if you have these just

1847
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,240
Vacations

1848
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
Then before April

1849
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,568
Peace treaty even including

1850
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:25,152
You get we're not NATO's not going to move all this stuff

1851
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,456
Right they would have to handle the

1852
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
Ukraine

1853
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,760
Situation

1854
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,040
So if you wanted to have a

1855
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,832
Peace treaty then you would have to say

1856
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,368
Okay well Ukraine's going to give up

1857
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,416
Its leadership of itself

1858
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:42,816
It is going to put everything under the control of Putin's Russia Now consume only Russian

1859
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:45,888
Promedia for as long as it takes for them to stop

1860
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,168
Listening to the West ever

1861
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
I feel like

1862
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:53,056
A little bit past that being like

1863
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,896
Going to work maybe a little salty

1864
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,712
Because it is incredibly frustrating

1865
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,992
Try to pay attention to

1866
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,016
All these

1867
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,064
Various reasons why this is

1868
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,856
Invasion is okay

1869
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:10,208
Consistency the point changes from day-to-day and yet what remains and his ever-present

1870
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,768
The insistence of Infowars is totally right

1871
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,048
And they whatever they're saying

1872
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,584
Today's what they said all along

1873
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,376
I know this isn't news but

1874
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:21,216
It's really getting to me a little bit more than usual admittance because there's

1875
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:28,640
Boyle's functionally advocating for like you brought up as a complete acquiescence to food

1876
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,664
And the surrender of

1877
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688
Ukraine to his rule

1878
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:34,528
He may not think that's what he's saying and the other bunch of bad

1879
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:37,088
He wishes to see

1880
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:39,648
Is wherever one resistant Putin's invasion of Ukraine

1881
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,928
Just stop and let him take over

1882
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,720
I mean that's the end

1883
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,256
Maybe if you're only

1884
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:47,840
Conversation if your thoughts on how to stop the war have

1885
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,864
Nothing to do with

1886
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,424
Ukraine whatsoever entirely about

1887
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:55,264
NATO not expanding then you're just saying that Ukraine should be blue

1888
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,568
At this point

1889
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,408
Boyle brought up the

1890
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:02,944
That treaty

1891
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,224
Tremblay class

1892
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,760
Last year and Alex

1893
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,296
Decides to Riff on it a little

1894
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:11,648
And so it is true that all these trees expire the US did not want to go shade

1895
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,416
Let them expire

1896
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,976
This again is wow

1897
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,512
They cut all their

1898
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:26,752
Major provocation

1899
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:29,056
I'm going to get your take on that we come back and talk about

1900
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,848
Where this is all going

1901
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:34,176
Oh man a major provocation is totally justified

1902
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:34,944
This action

1903
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,992
What treaties is Alex trying to claim

1904
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:39,552
Expired specific at all what the f*** is he talking

1905
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,136
Tannin

1906
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
Tannin

1907
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,184
Treaty Albert

1908
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,304
There was a nuclear non-proliferation treaty called the new start

1909
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,840
Began in 2011

1910
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:56,704
2022

1911
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,240
Really work well for Alex

1912
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:02,592
Argument but it was Channel 5 years

1913
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,360
Until 22

1914
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,384
Sex

1915
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:07,200
That agreement was announced in March 2021

1916
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,736
Re-signing it

1917
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,272
Considering the treaty with a high priority

1918
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,552
Biden

1919
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:16,672
I don't think that this is what I was talking about

1920
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:20,768
The fake story about it a me but he just assumed that they didn't extend it or something

1921
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,536
I don't know

1922
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:25,632
I think what's going on is there to boil is brought up in this b******* about

1923
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,656
Demand food was making

1924
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:29,728
Right now is writing a bigger story on top of all of it

1925
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,544
It's all just an exercise in excusing Putin's invasion

1926
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,080
Literally all day

1927
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
The show is

1928
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,128
At this point

1929
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,152
That is

1930
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
F***** up

1931
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,200
It's f***** up

1932
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,064
Domino's say about that

1933
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,112
What's up with this club is even more f***** up

1934
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,952
And as I said they're using Ukraine in Ukrainian

1935
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:53,536
As a battering ram against the Putin government

1936
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:58,400
And against the Russian Federation

1937
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,424
And so it makes the West

1938
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,312
What looks like

1939
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,592
Guess it's just continue song

1940
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,616
I'm going to have to

1941
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,640
Hey listen

1942
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:11,712
When you're fighting two Wars sometimes you just have to commit atrocities

1943
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,504
I mean on Fortune

1944
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,272
Italy think

1945
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
That that is

1946
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:16,576
Trudeau

1947
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,344
Descriptive

1948
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,904
But I went to the speaking of this kind of

1949
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,928
Moralistic

1950
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,792
I think that the carrying out of War

1951
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,328
Almost always

1952
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,096
Involves

1953
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,120
Atrocity

1954
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,144
It is an atrocity

1955
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:31,936
Definition

1956
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,984
And that is a good reason to be opposed

1957
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,008
To war

1958
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,032
On a general base

1959
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,360
Alex seems to be

1960
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,640
First of all

1961
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,408
Denying

1962
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,784
The atrocities that have already taken place

1963
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,064
So that's

1964
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,832
Traveling

1965
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,624
I meant

1966
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,184
Call me sometimes you commit atrocities no big deal

1967
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,768
Strategic thing just choose to

1968
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,072
Kill a large number of civilians

1969
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,888
In order to end the war that you started

1970
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:04,192
Because Nazis were killing Civic weigh

1971
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,616
Killed ukrainians ocean

1972
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,384
No

1973
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,176
Nope

1974
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,992
It's it's outrageous

1975
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,016
Comically pro-putin

1976
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,112
How do you see this gut-level ending right now

1977
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
Deal

1978
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,256
Looks like deals are coming

1979
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,816
He's going to have to ask like somehow to try to

1980
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,352
Defeat these embedded

1981
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:37,472
Nazi forces that are are high

1982
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,496
Thread that needle

1983
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,544
Western propaganda against

1984
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,128
I really don't know Alex

1985
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,408
Wow I just

1986
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:49,248
I find it shocking boil just like accept the premise

1987
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,576
Just crazy

1988
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,624
I don't know Hey listen

1989
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,696
I don't know how he solve this imaginary problem

1990
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,792
Play without Escalade he's going to have to ask

1991
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,072
The US

1992
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,608
Is it making a deal

1993
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,680
No it's entirely the web of course

1994
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,704
It's not alike

1995
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,728
Zelensky isn't make

1996
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,008
Making a deal

1997
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:17,408
Cusd80 says he'll do because he's going to be

1998
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,432
Beat wait no he doesn't

1999
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,456
To join NATO

2000
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,736
Desperately wants

2001
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,528
The deals we can save face

2002
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:26,624
Get out of here with a little bit of strength intact right but it's not coming so he's going to have to

2003
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,416
Well I mean

2004
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:32,256
Alex seems like legitimately to be preparing his audience to accept

2005
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,048
Really f***** up stuff

2006
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:34,816
No.

2007
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,096
Absolute

2008
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,168
There's no other

2009
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,192
No other

2010
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:45,056
Solution great that he's talking to like an international law expert on war crimes

2011
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,592
And it's like and it's like that

2012
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,384
What is that's his idea of

2013
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,408
Realpolitik

2014
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,432
You know like

2015
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,712
Okay well

2016
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,736
He's in a bad bargain

2017
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,272
Position you know he's losing

2018
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,040
The war

2019
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:57,600
So he doesn't want to get a deal now

2020
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,368
Cuz they won't

2021
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,392
Good terms for her

2022
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,928
You understand Dan

2023
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:04,512
He doesn't want to deal right now cuz they won't be good terms for him

2024
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:07,072
What are you doing

2025
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,608
The deal you want to deal with it

2026
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,144
For him so

2027
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,448
If he commits atrocities

2028
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,752
Bended deal might be sweeter for him

2029
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,544
And Alex is fine with that

2030
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,360
Because it's all about the deal man it's like

2031
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,664
Alex's ideal ruler is MBC

2032
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,968
Fighter movie

2033
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:28,064
Maybe something to that

2034
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,368
Anyway boil Legacy

2035
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,648
Oven sound like a broken record

2036
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,672
Dudes dumb

2037
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,464
I think we have

2038
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,488
The demand

2039
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,792
Jet biting himself

2040
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,096
Publicly Proclaim

2041
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,912
Ukraine will not

2042
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,192
Join NATO

2043
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:48,544
This is a dumb bullying tactic because the demand is something meaningless

2044
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,872
The hope is that you have some sort of the meaning of symbolic action

2045
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:55,968
Seeds power-to-the-people making that depends ivy

2046
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:56,992
Russia

2047
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:57,760
Putin

2048
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:00,320
And align propagandist

2049
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,344
Blackout you got it

2050
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:06,464
Also in June 2021 by Moses at a press conference about Ukraine joining NATO

2051
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,048
It depends on whether they meet the criteria

2052
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,096
The fact is they still have to clean up corrupt

2053
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:15,424
Meet other criteria to get into the X

2054
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,448
Action plan to

2055
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,728
School's out on that question

2056
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,008
It remains to be seen

2057
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,312
And it will not just depend on me

2058
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,872
Whether or not we conclude the Ukraine can't become apart

2059
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,944
Tornado on the alliance and how they vote

2060
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,248
There's a world reality that Biden

2061
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,272
Can't wave his hand

2062
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:32,320
The Forces Group to vote the way he wants them

2063
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,624
However there's an infant

2064
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,184
Pretend reality were a big strong man ruler

2065
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,208
Just do whatever he wants

2066
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,744
So the fact that fighting isn't

2067
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,536
These things means he must not want to

2068
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:46,656
It wouldn't believe middle school-level s*** and I feel pretty embarrassed for these dudes talking like this public

2069
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,448
And to clarify

2070
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:51,520
Trump was able to do a lot of s*** unilaterally but

2071
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,544
You might notice

2072
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,640
But all the stuff he did like that were times when he pulled the us out of

2073
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,712
He never deserted his will over these organization

2074
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,992
They're groups with his strength

2075
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:03,296
You just didn't get his way and withdrew

2076
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:05,344
Do you know how to relax

2077
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:10,208
Now you see that might be an explanation of how they think the world works

2078
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,744
Trump is like

2079
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,024
You have to do what I say

2080
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:13,792
And they're like

2081
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:14,816
No

2082
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,584
And he's like

2083
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,960
Well then I am going to go back to a world where people have to do what I say and you are not involved

2084
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:23,264
I am taking my ball and going

2085
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,312
Going to Blackmail the lynskey

2086
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,616
So Alex is

2087
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,176
Steven the conversation with boil about dumb

2088
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:34,016
Immature nonsense

2089
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:38,112
Illinois

2090
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,416
Damn it may be just outside Chicago or in Chicago

2091
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:44,768
Rolling Meadows

2092
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,632
I'm not saying I want to fight him but I will call him a baby to his face

2093
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,704
A big dump

2094
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,496
I'm a little bit salty

2095
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:57,056
So Alex is talking to boil

2096
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,616
This one conversation and Alex gets

2097
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,640
Distracted by

2098
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,176
Important breaking news

2099
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:05,760
Arnold Schwarzenegger has just gone live infowars.com

2100
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,040
Video of it

2101
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,088
German translation

2102
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,160
Please bring them in German

2103
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:13,952
Whataburger

2104
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,232
German

2105
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:20,096
Father fought the Russians now they're fighting today

2106
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:22,656
Ceiling

2107
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,704
I mean

2108
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:29,312
Like Twilight Zone Stalingrad

2109
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,080
I did fax

2110
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,104
We fight in these areas

2111
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,896
I was in the SS

2112
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,968
Arnold wasn't speaking German in that video he's speaking Russian

2113
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:42,880
He was appealing to the people of Russia and it's really interesting but probably an effective way to see the way that Putin is

2114
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,672
To them but what's going on in Ukraine

2115
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:49,280
It's not mostly about his dad so Arnold doesn't hide that is that was fighting

2116
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,048
For the Nazi

2117
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,328
He does literally mean

2118
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:58,496
Videos about Arnold's love for Russia and the people of Russia and its first weightlifting hero with a guy

2119
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,544
Name Yuri petrovich of a sloth

2120
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:04,384
Have you met your fourteen-year-old boy

2121
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:08,480
Arnold Dad didn't like that he idolized Yuri because as Arnold

2122
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:11,040
Explain ski was injured in Leningrad quote

2123
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:15,136
What are the Nazi army that he was a part of did vicious harm to the great City in

2124
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:15,904
It's brave people

2125
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:21,792
The video touches on how we got to meet Yuri again as an adult when he went to Moscow again to film red heat

2126
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:23,840
The first American movie those permitted to film

2127
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:24,864
In Red Square

2128
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:28,448
Essentially it's a very compelling argument that Schwarzenegger

2129
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,728
As a deeply felt

2130
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:33,056
Connection to the people of Russia and the country itself

2131
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,848
Outside criticizing that it doesn't

2132
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,616
Something like this

2133
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,152
Committal make a real difference

2134
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,712
I don't know what the complaint about this video is

2135
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:45,600
Like it's definitely less cringe-inducing than other celebrity videos we've seen it ain't got to say that it feels very sincere

2136
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,648
Like a memories really do

2137
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,416
Mean a lot

2138
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,976
Donald

2139
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:53,536
Very important too I think

2140
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:54,560
What was it

2141
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:56,352
One of the mr. universes

2142
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,400
Everyone was

2143
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,936
Like

2144
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:00,960
IDrive

2145
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:03,520
Stump some videos like broadcast on

2146
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,544
Russian States

2147
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,336
TV one of the biggest

2148
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:09,920
Things that they've seen

2149
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:14,272
It's such an interesting intersection of his lived experience to with don't like

2150
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,576
Being the son of an Austrian

2151
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,600
Former

2152
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,136
Nazi Soldier

2153
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:22,720
Who idolized a Russian weightlifter that got him

2154
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:28,096
Like really motivated into that world actually ended up creating his career

2155
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:30,144
Our leading to his career.

2156
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,424
Intersection of

2157
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:36,544
That like lineage of coming from somebody who hated Russians because of his

2158
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,080
Experience in World War II

2159
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:42,176
To being somebody who sees the country and the people for the beautiful

2160
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:45,248
I think that it is

2161
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,784
I don't know it

2162
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,808
Obviously like I'm saying

2163
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,856
I don't think it's going to move the needle in terms

2164
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:51,392
Of world affairs Council

2165
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,952
But I do think it's a more valuable

2166
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,976
Video to watch

2167
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:55,744
Then

2168
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,280
The Imagine video

2169
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:00,096
What is going around about that if I was Putin

2170
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,888
Mom yeah

2171
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:05,472
You don't like that stuff nonsense at least had some substance to it

2172
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,264
If only as a

2173
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,288
Like a sort of

2174
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,592
Moving

2175
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,152
Autobiographical

2176
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,200
Slice of Arnold

2177
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:19,040
Tickets addressing it did remind me

2178
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,624
Message of course but it did remind me like I

2179
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,392
It went back

2180
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,440
Can I restart a remembering

2181
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,464
Schwarzenegger's life

2182
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,488
Just going

2183
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,256
This man is a car

2184
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:29,024
Cartoon character

2185
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,048
Dislikes

2186
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:33,120
It's not real but I kind of like watching you get like you.

2187
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:37,984
Kind of why he won Governor like today

2188
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,032
You forget

2189
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,824
Like you see the movies and he's like

2190
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:42,848
Goodwill drop off

2191
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:46,688
Write a big muscley weirdo shoots people and rice

2192
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,504
A strange accent it's never explained in the movie

2193
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,296
But there's a compelling

2194
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,088
Missing person

2195
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:54,624
Still just mad that

2196
01:35:55,136 --> 01:36:00,512
Derail that campaign back is still just mad at Arnold probably anyway

2197
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,536
Import

2198
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,072
News

2199
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,864
We got to get it

2200
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,960
I'm clearly the way I want to talk about you can tell he hasn't walked

2201
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,240
He doesn't know what this is

2202
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:15,104
Reporting on Imaginext

2203
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,688
You know that right

2204
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,456
If you'd watch this

2205
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,272
Boyle is

2206
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,320
He's somebody who

2207
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,088
Like I said

2208
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:27,648
Drafted the indictment

2209
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,416
Against Melissa

2210
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:30,208
That's right he's somebody who has

2211
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:33,280
At least a level of Gravitas in terms of

2212
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:35,072
The world of international relations

2213
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,096
You should

2214
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,376
Be somebody who understands

2215
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,400
To be careful

2216
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,424
With his words

2217
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,704
And if you wrote

2218
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:45,056
Slobodan milosevic is indictment you should probably be aware that Putin is

2219
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,848
Has got a real good shot

2220
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,688
I didn't offer close to that apparently not only goes the other way

2221
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,480
Yes these reports

2222
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,528
Coming out of

2223
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,856
Are fully consistent

2224
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,904
With the United States government

2225
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:00,928
Supporting

2226
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:03,232
Biological warfare

2227
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,024
Against Russia

2228
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:08,864
If you take a look at the map you'll see large numbers of

2229
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:13,216
Biological warfare weapons surrounding China

2230
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:16,288
I've read the reports

2231
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:19,872
They certainly sound a credible to me

2232
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:22,176
She was actually accusing the United States

2233
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:24,480
Biological weapons lab

2234
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:30,880
It's literally like listen all I'm saying is Iraq should invade America we have we have wmds

2235
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,952
I'm not saying I'm just saying I'm just saying I'm not saying but I'm just saying

2236
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:36,768
And it gets worse at justifying this gets worse

2237
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,304
There's the match

2238
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,352
Rife

2239
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,144
Biological warfare

2240
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,936
Weapons facilities

2241
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,240
They've been bought and paid for

2242
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,032
By the Pentagon itself

2243
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:51,616
Does not engage in missionary activity

2244
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:57,760
I have no doubt about that in my mind

2245
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,320
Indeed

2246
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:03,648
I gave interviews to Russian news

2247
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,024
How do I stream the DNA

2248
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,840
Materials of Russians

2249
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,912
And they asked me why and I said simple because

2250
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,448
They're going to try to

2251
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:18,496
Create an ethnic specific

2252
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,288
Biological warfare

2253
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:22,848
Weapon against Russians

2254
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,896
If they can figure it out

2255
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:26,944
Wow sounds

2256
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:32,576
Is he telling me that this I bet he doesn't even I didn't even get paid

2257
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:35,136
Probably not Irwin and

2258
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:37,440
Did some f****** propaganda for Putin

2259
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:43,584
Fury Shady

2260
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,352
Listen

2261
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:46,400
Find you're a monster but at least

2262
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:48,192
Hey do you know you're an idiot

2263
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:52,544
Yeah paid Alex plugs Boyle's book

2264
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:55,616
And this is this I would have done this differently

2265
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,552
Search

2266
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,856
Francis a boil and find a spring

2267
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:07,904
Especially

2268
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,184
Comp

2269
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:11,488
Amazon

2270
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,304
You can find his work

2271
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,328
That I don't know

2272
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:17,888
Amazon.com amazon.com

2273
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:20,192
For finding work that I don't know

2274
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
Bezos

2275
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,264
Directing traffic

2276
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,384
We had Elizabeth Williamson on and we were talking about her new book and very specifically

2277
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,408
We made a point

2278
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:32,992
To not have the link go to go there

2279
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:38,112
Stock Amazon almost like when we say that we hate Jeff Bezos

2280
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,904
We didn't follow through

2281
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,464
Well I mean there's no there's no need to be dramatic

2282
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,256
Performative about it

2283
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,048
Functionally

2284
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:48,608
If anybody was going to buy

2285
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,656
A book based on our recommendation

2286
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:55,264
It would be ideal for them not to do it through Amazon and if we can direct

2287
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:56,800
Traffic through a lake

2288
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,592
To another place to get the

2289
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,872
Body way better

2290
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,432
Supposed to be

2291
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:04,736
One of Jesus's blood enemies

2292
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,808
One of them Must Die

2293
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,112
Tried to get him a cut

2294
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:10,880
Does it does

2295
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:13,440
Do not have his own website

2296
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:16,512
Where you can find his books I bet he doesn't

2297
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:20,864
Like if you look at the shots of him but he's being interviewed his

2298
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,632
Is offices

2299
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,912
Just like piles of

2300
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,800
He looks like he might might might be all analog baby

2301
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,848
I'm angry that insert

2302
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:32,896
Topic

2303
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,688
Mitt Romney comes up

2304
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,456
Sure

2305
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:38,272
And he's important this is where the interview ends

2306
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:41,088
But I think there's a couple things are a little problematic for Alex

2307
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:45,696
Remember

2308
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:47,744
He was elected in

2309
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:51,840
Massachusetts is a rhino the only way he could be elected

2310
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:55,424
Extreme right

2311
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:57,472
And in order to work

2312
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,752
The boots of the

2313
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:02,592
Free Riders Republican party I'm not single Republican Party

2314
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,920
But the extreme ride

2315
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:10,272
And Romney tried to restore the death penalty

2316
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,648
That weird started the death penalty the sacco-vanzetti case

2317
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,976
In Massachusetts there in law school together

2318
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,512
A new water Travis

2319
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,792
See the whole thing

2320
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:26,144
Reading Massachusetts.

2321
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:31,264
You have to be sick and demented

2322
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:32,288
To spend

2323
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,336
Full-time like Romney did

2324
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,616
To restore the

2325
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,664
County in Massachusetts

2326
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,944
Alright is a problem

2327
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:45,600
First there shouldn't be any acknowledgment that there is an extreme right in terms of the political identity of people in government on this

2328
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:48,416
It's not a reality that's accepted

2329
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:54,560
There are GOP members of Congress who Alex thinks our Liberals are left-wing extremists like AOC

2330
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,656
Spencer's old school Constitution Loving people

2331
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:01,728
They're blue liberals on classic liberals

2332
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,008
Speedstream right doesn't

2333
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:05,312
Exist because when you consider who like

2334
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:11,712
No just comes to mind with Boyle says that Romney kissed up to the extreme right

2335
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:18,368
The second problem is it boils going hard on the death penalty which Alex actually supports

2336
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,648
You think he would

2337
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:25,024
Because he's so anti-government and he pretends to be a Libertarian but thank you loves the idea of the government killing his enemies

2338
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:27,328
Seems like you wouldn't want the government

2339
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,608
Who you don't trust

2340
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,400
Right who you think is lying all the

2341
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,496
The power to kill you.

2342
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:38,336
In principle relies so much on the you know the government not being the

2343
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,360
Solsource

2344
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:42,176
Force

2345
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:45,248
He's fine with the government killing people he walks on

2346
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,808
Them to kill

2347
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:50,112
Bon to this interview autograph

2348
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:52,672
We have a couple of clips

2349
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:54,464
Left here and

2350
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,000
Alexandra

2351
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,024
Talking to boil

2352
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:01,376
But I want to get

2353
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,448
I got to tell you when I saw this headline earlier

2354
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,032
I can't be real then we went and watched it in check

2355
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:08,800
German

2356
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:13,920
Radiance

2357
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,480
Anatomy

2358
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,504
Schwarzenegger said

2359
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:22,112
Arnold Schwarzenegger

2360
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:28,512
Twilight Zone situation

2361
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:30,048
Play some of that

2362
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,072
Bodily harm

2363
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:33,888
Dot-com

2364
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:35,680
Interested

2365
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:39,520
No no conversation about what's going on in my area Paul

2366
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:40,544
Nothing

2367
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,312
About

2368
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,128
It exists in Ukraine

2369
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,664
The type of news that Alex

2370
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,712
Can cover is

2371
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:50,784
Complaining about a imagined version of

2372
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:52,320
A video that Schwartz on

2373
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,088
Tiger put out

2374
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:55,904
That's what right do end of the spear

2375
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,672
That he has

2376
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,464
Stupid

2377
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:01,024
Yep we are kind of in a Twilight Zone episode

2378
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,792
We're like

2379
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:04,096
You can show people reality

2380
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:06,144
And they can tell you they can lie

2381
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:09,216
Like read word-for-word back to you what was said

2382
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:13,824
And they will still tell you that Arnold Schwarzenegger was trying to be a nut

2383
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
Supporter

2384
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:17,664
Love by like they can't like it is such a

2385
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,944
Oh you just don't live in

2386
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,712
The world man

2387
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:20,736
You just don't live here

2388
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,784
Yeah

2389
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,320
Talk more about the Arnold video

2390
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:26,624
Says we should play some

2391
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:29,184
Let me get to it eventually but

2392
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:29,952
Coronavirus data

2393
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,512
I am not in the point

2394
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,560
Where

2395
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,352
I couldn't even do the first

2396
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,376
Show today

2397
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,192
Because I'm sitting

2398
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:42,496
Sponsorship

2399
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,312
For money in

2400
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,360
Just to make

2401
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,176
Judge

2402
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
Money I've got Noah

2403
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:52,992
Find me

2404
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,112
Your money in

2405
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,136
Boiling

2406
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:04,512
I like to joke a lot and have some laughs but

2407
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,280
Sincerely here

2408
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,816
I don't believe this s*** at all

2409
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:09,120
But if this is true enforces the most

2410
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,400
Static organization

2411
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,472
And Alex has the worst business owner in the entire propaganda game

2412
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:15,520
His number one job is to

2413
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,544
To do his show

2414
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,312
Which is alive

2415
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:20,896
From 11 to 2 and then someone else takes over for the last hour

2416
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:26,016
There's literally no reason why you can't talk to a potential sponsor before 11 or after 2

2417
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,808
Except for a couple options that I can play

2418
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:30,624
One is absolutely no power in

2419
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,416
Situation at all

2420
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,952
Calling all the shots now except

2421
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,488
The bend over backwards in order

2422
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,256
A few bucks

2423
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:39,584
Yes I will take a call while I'm supposed to be on air

2424
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,704
Be f****** with him if they're forcing him to take a call while he's on air

2425
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:51,104
Says so little interest in doing any work that he's essentially only be working from 11 to 2

2426
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,640
Supposed to be on air well

2427
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:59,040
That's why he pays that Saint Patrick obsessed dork to to work there for that you wasn't talking to

2428
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:02,112
Father who's talking to lawyers or Court who he can't reschedule a meeting

2429
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,416
Think I might be more

2430
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:10,048
Embarrassing level of inability to do one's job and I honestly I sent it

2431
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,888
I also hate that's all you just want to LA to do a podcast

2432
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:17,472
Do you really expect anyone to feel sympathy for your inability to make payroll

2433
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:21,312
Like 10:30 last guns or get rid of the potentially

2434
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:22,336
Studio like

2435
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:28,224
Get rid of weird LED lighting behind your don't take a week vacation to another state to do a podcast

2436
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,016
You need to make payroll so badly

2437
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,808
You're over-extended

2438
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:38,208
Danseaza the problem we have been out of the regular Workforce for too long

2439
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:41,024
That's the way everybody I've ever had

2440
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:45,632
Sorry we can't make payroll I am calling you from Hawaii right

2441
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,168
Right now just in case you were wondering

2442
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:49,216
I'm sorry I'm going to pay you next week

2443
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:49,984
Your

2444
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,264
Can't make it this week

2445
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,312
Reminder to work for your cousin

2446
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,104
Well not everybody

2447
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:03,040
I have a different work history than you I do not have a lot of recipe

2448
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:05,088
I'll tell you this the hearing aid game

2449
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:06,624
Real Shady

2450
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:07,392
Okay

2451
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:10,720
I find that Alex's sales pitches

2452
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,488
Seem to be like

2453
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,304
A guy who has a bad business model

2454
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,072
Explaining it

2455
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,608
Beautiful

2456
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:20,192
What's going on a little bit like Hey listen

2457
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,496
I am a failure

2458
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,520
You buy

2459
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,288
This bowl

2460
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:27,872
We were really high in the lead-up

2461
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:29,408
To Trump

2462
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:31,712
You're right we were crushing it

2463
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,992
Too much

2464
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:36,320
I hire too many people overhead we have too much

2465
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:37,856
Rent to pay never heard of

2466
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:41,440
Electric bills are through the roof

2467
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:46,048
Almost like autocratic leaders don't like hearing bad news before they make

2468
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:48,608
Decisions that they want I decided to make this

2469
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:52,448
Dum dum free speech YouTube clone type website

2470
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,496
And

2471
01:47:55,008 --> 01:48:00,128
There's no on there because no one wants

2472
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:03,712
Advertise this is a sinkhole if money is real bad

2473
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:04,736
Lot of Hosting

2474
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,576
Cost

2475
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,344
There

2476
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,952
Oh great I have to pay in order to host

2477
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:18,304
The video of the guy who dressed like Uncle Sam yelling at people on the street

2478
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:24,192
He's changing the world and Harrison Smith has got 200 views on This Heart of this video

2479
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,216
I need to be

2480
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,032
Look Harrison doesn't have a lot of use

2481
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,568
More than that

2482
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:30,592
Alright

2483
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:37,504
If there's any Solace I think that

2484
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,784
Does not he's not long

2485
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:43,904
He's already exhausted the money that he could get out of Mike Lindell

2486
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,696
Who's conceivably glendale's

2487
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:47,488
Blackguard

2488
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,512
Breeze in the Wind

2489
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,536
Right

2490
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:51,328
I don't I don't know if side of like

2491
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:53,120
Shady right-wing billionaires

2492
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,144
What kind of

2493
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,680
Since he might have

2494
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:00,544
He could go down if he hasn't burned that bridge

2495
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,848
Milo yiannopoulos coming back to

2496
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:06,176
Isn't he our people paying attention to him in the right-wing spear again

2497
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:06,944
Not real

2498
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,736
Not really

2499
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:15,136
Good I think maybe his name came up because allegedly he hooked Marjorie Taylor Greene up with

2500
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:17,184
Nick Fuentes for that

2501
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,768
Nick Fuentes have like a bit of a weird history

2502
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,048
Because

2503
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:22,816
Nick

2504
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:23,584
Obviously

2505
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,888
Outright bigot hey hey people

2506
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:28,960
But he and Milo even when Milo was

2507
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:30,752
Still a gay man

2508
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,288
According to him

2509
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,336
He was still a Catholic fashion

2510
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:35,872
Frightened so like

2511
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:40,992
The two of them bonded over their desire for a Catholic Tater ship

2512
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,344
Now that Milo is a forward a man according to him

2513
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,880
The two of them have

2514
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:49,184
Les hurdles in terms of their Association

2515
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:52,000
And their desire to bring about a Catholic fiachra

2516
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:55,840
That shouldn't that give you pause

2517
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:57,376
As for your wanting a Catholic

2518
01:49:57,632 --> 01:50:00,704
Dictatorship if you and the guy next to you who both want the Catholic

2519
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,472
Dictatorship

2520
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:07,872
If one of you were to get power over the other one the other one would die

2521
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:11,200
Understand

2522
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,480
Maybe

2523
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:13,760
This'll Catholic dictator

2524
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:16,320
Bishop is a bad idea if the guy that I like

2525
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,344
What killed

2526
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:21,440
I don't know how you get there but yeah Edwina

2527
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:22,464
It seems weird

2528
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,792
The beard is rising back to

2529
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,328
Venereal

2530
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,864
It's within that seeing good

2531
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,400
But who knows who knows

2532
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:37,312
He's a disgusting a exercising Putin apologia

2533
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:39,616
I don't know why we came back to the Press

2534
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:41,408
You know I

2535
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,176
Was

2536
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:43,968
Substantially more enjoyable

2537
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:44,992
Maybe less salty

2538
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:45,760
Right

2539
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:48,320
How are you I am amazed

2540
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:49,856
I really am amazed

2541
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,904
You like it would feel bad

2542
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,720
For me too

2543
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:57,280
Make justifications for any

2544
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:59,072
Large-scale murder

2545
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:01,888
It would make me feel bad

2546
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:03,168
To do it with this

2547
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:03,936
Gusto

2548
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:07,264
I mean in a very

2549
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,568
Neutral term of the word

2550
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,336
Awesome

2551
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,104
It is

2552
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,640
Tiring

2553
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:14,176
It is like

2554
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:20,320
How how is it possible that those picture of Gaston and

2555
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,368
Pretending to be like

2556
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,648
I'm just looking at Alside

2557
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:26,208
Sure I'm not I'm not defending Putin's accident

2558
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:29,792
Yeah it's a defective admission that you know what he's doing is wrong

2559
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:32,608
You could read it that way yeah

2560
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:35,680
It's a cowardly Augusta which is

2561
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:37,216
Not something you see all too often

2562
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,776
Beretta

2563
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:42,848
The show sucks

2564
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:46,688
We'll see what's happening later though

2565
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:48,992
And

2566
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:50,272
Another episode

2567
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,808
Possibly something fairly

2568
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:56,928
Fun on Wednesday maybe maybe something

2569
01:51:57,184 --> 01:52:00,000
