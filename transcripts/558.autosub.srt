1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,304
Six around works with celine's alter

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704
Indeed we are Dan how to smooth tips time I got it right in there

7
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,752
In there

8
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,800
You know what a lot of people meet

9
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
To see the

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Process

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
Becoming definitely and I consider this part of my 10,000 hours towards getting ready production

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,136
Also part of your 10,000 hours towards telling Malcolm Gladwell he's a moron

13
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
Community service

14
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
Jordan

15
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
Hey Dan I have a

16
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
What's up

17
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,240
Maybe you should go first maybe I might be a little extended alright

18
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
Mine's just like

19
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,824
Emphasizes

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
Well

21
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Shohei ohtani

22
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,576
Today just hit his 12th home run to win

23
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
Incredible

24
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,648
And here's a picture of the Cubs

25
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
No

26
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
Not know he's on the angels

27
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
12

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,304
Andy has an era around 2

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,656
She has several a I mean this dude and it hears why he was right

30
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
He's

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,800
Everything he's the only baseball player on this plan

32
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
That has ever lived

33
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,176
Yahoo can reliably throw 100 mile-an-hour fastball

34
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,736
And hit 450-foot dingers

35
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
On the regular

36
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,112
And I have thought about that if yours was my pricing is because unlike

37
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
So many other achievements

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,208
Right now

39
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,768
Is the only time in history that anyone has

40
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Has ever done

41
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
What shohei ohtani is doing and maybe the only

42
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
He's the only person

43
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Who is ever lived out of the 5th

44
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
Billion

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
People

46
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
He's the only one who can do this

47
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,896
For some of our international walks

48
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
Baseball

49
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,016
It's very rare for a picture to be able to hit well

50
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
It is rare for picture to Hitler

51
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Well yeah it is

52
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
He's not rare for a picture

53
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
To hit

54
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,120
What is he's on Pace for over 40 home runs in a season that is crazy

55
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
Never happen anybody wants

56
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
Talk to me about Babe Ruth

57
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,080
Can shove it up their ass Babe Ruth hit home runs off of people who threw slower than I do

58
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
Babe Ruth

59
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,944
Is garbage

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
Garbage human being played against garbage

61
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,064
Understood

62
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
1/2

63
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,672
Major League Baseball as an organization doesn't make

64
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,536
How not good at hitting federally that there's a

65
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
The game was like these guys are

66
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
So bad it here in town

67
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,800
Yeah I was going to make a joke about Jeff suppan

68
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,664
I believe famously hit a homerun in the World Series Cardinals

69
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,064
Yeah the Cubs reliever I can't remember his name off the top of my head but he was one of the last people to hit

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,648
Home run in a playoff game as a relief

71
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,952
Hell yeah

72
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Very rare

73
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
So he's he's

74
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
You get to see him

75
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
There's only one like

76
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
How

77
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
Insane

78
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,543
One person case for that

79
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
Sure that to me like I just imagine being in that position being in those shoes like I don't know how you would handle that pressure

80
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,271
You know I don't know

81
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
You grew up in the Japanese

82
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
Baseball leagues

83
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
If you've never liked in the Japanese baseball legs

84
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
If you're if you're eight

85
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
Playing for your team

86
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,583
You have the same amount of pressure as a major Leaguer the United

87
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,423
I don't know if you know anything about it at all

88
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
Okay

89
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:02,335
My bright spot is I made a little trip long-overdue trip down to the

90
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
The box mailbox

91
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
Some stuff to take out the bag Z Excellence

92
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,855
Something I realized I didn't mention this when it was my birthday because it also included

93
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
To get for your birthday

94
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,535
And I forgot what your birthday came around

95
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
You so much for that absolutely

96
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
And then

97
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,751
I went to mail back there some other stuff that was a bit birthday related

98
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
Cin-cin

99
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,711
Young at ginger ale which I don't know if that is Young gingers could be a rap name

100
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
Carl Jung specific I believe Beck sent a pink yukle

101
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,791
Lely which I'm a little confused but but I'm excited to try to learn

102
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
Time to learn a couple chords

103
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
Last night

104
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
If I was playing around with it

105
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
And my fingers are

106
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
The two fat

107
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
So I don't know if

108
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,519
It's going to work out but

109
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
They turned into a weird ukulele bad I don't know but I do some cover songs parodies absolutely also

110
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,759
You belong in the city is right for a ukulele parody

111
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
Also in this

112
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855
Was the Sega Mega Drive classics

113
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
It's for the switch all right

114
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,231
Sand I've been used to seeing these kinds of

115
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:28,095
Collections of old games

116
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
Actually good games on it

117
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,983
But this is pretty solid you got dr. robotnik's mean bean machine

118
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,775
Classic got to have that Sonic

119

Toejam & Earl

Whole lot of stuff on there and it's it's

00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
It's very nice it's been a long time since I've moved

127
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
From left to right in

128
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,007
Things there are a couple games that are entirely that

129
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,847

00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
I'm here

00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:17,247
And this was a little bit weird Jordan I feel like I'm going to need your help because I think I might have actually been for you

132
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015

00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
We listen

And we have feelings too

141
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
Love,

143
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
Nothing else

144
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Okay now

145
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
Okay to mugs

146
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
And this is one of them

147
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
Alright you shall know the truth that

00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
The truth shall make you free all right

149
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Central Intelligence

150
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
Agency sure

151
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Sure

152
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Map

153
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,239
There is a sticker gift shop

154
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,639
Either Becky I is trying to f*** with you and let you know Jordan

155
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,479
Fairfield

156
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,295
Either the CIA is very sensitive

157
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,439
Or it's already f****** Minnesota entirely shirt

158
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
Dot-dot-dot yeah we

159
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
But who's we

160
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:39,423
CIA man but I mean why would they send me a cute little puppy

161
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
Script address in Virginia

162
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,031
Oh well that would kind of make sense then wouldn't

163
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,919
I don't know if it's entirely possible but there tells me that it's someone f****** with you

164
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,551
But I still appreciate a mug mug admit how ironically

165
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,831
Would be for Alex

166
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:02,463
To constantly claim that they CIA at all important heads-of-state listen to him and yet we get very kind

167
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
Almost downright

168
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
Cute cards from

169
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:11,167
The CIA you are being too mean

170
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,567
CIA I guess wow wow Jordan is

171
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,407
Apology to the CIA

172
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,551
It does take both for all of our leftist listeners out there the really looking at Jordan is as kind of

173
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,623
Oh yeah he's on the edge man

174
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,183
You just apologize for the pink eye

175
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
I would be surprised Jordan a I would be surprised to know to what he left us

176
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,911
Is to a pod receiving a cute puppy or

177
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
Kitten card wouldn't be like

178
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
I mean it's Austin's me a little bit

179
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,407
Just to know the cute puppy

180
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,967
Jordans

181
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,575
You are talking about May 8th and 9th 2003

182
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,183
One of the things I wanted to try to do was I wanted to try to keep pace

183
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
Sure was 2000

184
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:12,095
13 I don't think we're going to be able to do that that's going to be tough with him

185
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
But here we are May 8th and 9th

186
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
Pink stuff to go over some

187
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,311
Weird parallels of present as per usual due to my witchcraft

188
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
Before we get into this will take a little moment to

189
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,711
Say hello

190
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:35,135
Ezpopsy

191
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,535
Next all hail the cult leader Saline

192
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,863
I'm a policy wonk

193
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,679
Good good muscle Nate thank you so much

194
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,335
Jordans

195
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
I'm a policy wonk

196
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Thank you very much

197
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,479
Should I do next

198
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
I'm a policy wonk

199
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,087
Thank you very much

200
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
To give a little

201
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,463
Cap to sew mr.mac makinton thank you so much you are

202
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Technocrat

203
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
Money off that heroin

204
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
Freakishly large

205
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
Also before we get into this

206
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
The showbiz

207
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,647
Certainly not

208
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
We've never been

209
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,511
We have Mike's we're holding in our hands we are not in Show Business

210
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
I got a message from a

211
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
Character named Jeff

212
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,423
Just wanted to get a message out and that is apparently

213
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
They have a friend named Alex

214
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Who's opposed to the spider leadership

215
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
If this is relevant cuz you're wearing the spider l

216
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
Artesia right now

217
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,687
Perfect so this is his friend of Jeff's is opposed to you

218
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,503
Also apparently Jeff's brother Evan

219
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
Justa got into the show so

220
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
What up kayak

221
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,743
Welcome to the wokery I have no idea this is just what we've become welcoming a new listeners

222
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,959
Another day

223
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
The god album

224
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
Here are a couple out-of-context drop

225
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
The first

226
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,503
Is a little it's actually a little game I want to play that is

227
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Alex

228
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
Or Bill Clinton

229
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,231
Was that Alex or was that Bill Clinton

230
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Here we go

231
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
Okay we can't do we can't do this is a stolen Newsradio B from 4

232
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
4 years prior to the show Eric's when Phil Hartman wet on his bill McNeill ended long in

233
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:09,503
Interviews with himself as Bill Clinton we can't say that it's that I will say that it's definitely nothing

234
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
Either

235
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
Sounding a lot like bill collector

236
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,255
Or Bill Clinton with Alex is going to break music playing in the background

237
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,887
Depression of dude smoking pot

238
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
Yeah

239
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Good to know that

240
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943
The Denver Airport will never die

241
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Doing impression of himself

242
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,999
Little little sad

243
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
No backup back in his dad today

244
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
That's when people were smart

245
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,911
I really don't know if that's how anything works

246
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
Education or knowledge

247
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
College joke

248
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,127
We start here on the 8th and actually Begins the show with a story that is that

249
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,687
Mirror parallels to present day

250
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
You don't have

251
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
But the government

252
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
First things first

253
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
Alex

254
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,703
Stat that he cited there at The Little Owl

255
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Outlandish

256
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:10,591
Not off on some of this stuff but the story that he's telling about this is missing some point

257
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,407
I was able to find a CBS News articles

258
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
From May 2003 which is

259
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,039
Discuss the proposed plan to vaccinate half-a-billion healthcare workers against smallpox

260
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
Of which on

261
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
Only 35,000

262
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
One of the targeted workers had been inoculated

263
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,487
There's not good evidence that I can find that anyone was refusing the vaccine

264
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,047
Just at the program they have only vaccinated about

265
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
7% of

266
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
The stated goal population

267
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,871
Refusing it but 1 and 7 is closer than I'm used to him being

268
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,455
93% of the targeted population that they meant

269
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
To get a smallpox vaccination

270
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Did not get it

271
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:56,159
Sure Alex is making up but they all refused we don't know again

272
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Not getting it

273
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
Doesn't like weed

274
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
No instead

275
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
7%

276
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
There's a real decent

277
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
That most of that was

278
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,775
Just due to structural problems out of the rollout of campaign

279
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
Most people

280
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
Not need to get vaccinated against smallpox now.

281
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
The reason is because thanks to vaccination efforts made by the people who came before us smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980

282
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:29,695
A 911 there was a concern about a terrorist group or hostile government using smallpox as a weapon

283
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,511
And that sucks the US government stockpile massive amount

284
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,583
The smallpox vaccine in order to be prepared for that kind of possibility

285
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
But typically speaking

286
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
Most people won't need that.

287
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,055
The people who do according to the CDC are typically lab workers who might be in contact with any viruses similar

288
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Small popular

289
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,175
The booster vaccinated 2003 was based on fears that the

290
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Potential Terror

291
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
First attack

292
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,527
And what was ultimately decided was that it wasn't worth

293
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,855
The risk and vaccines could still be effective after someone was

294
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
Exposed to the virus over wasn't

295
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Much of Annie

296
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:06,559
The program was ended early and only a total of about 39000 people were ultimately vaccinated

297
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,167
Part of the resistance to this program was the people didn't buy that there was a real threat

298
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,751
Been pretty clear that there was no information of an imminent attack

299
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
And hospitals were reluctant to participate

300
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:22,687
In the end however through this program's failure Public Health preparedness was improved even

301
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
Critics of the smallpox campaign credit

302
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:29,087
With helping us be more ready for the later outbreak of SARS

303
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,183
David blue was a thirty-nine-year-old combat reporter working with NBC

304
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,767
He passed away on April 6th 2003 while on assignment

305
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Reporting from a rock

306
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:43,679
It's pretty well understood that the cause of death of it was that bloom had developed a blood clot in his leg

307
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,495
From spending days on and crammed into an armored vehicle

308
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
And having deep vein thrombosis

309
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,895
Is clock made its way to with his lungs and caused a pulmonary embolism which

310
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Resulted

311
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,503
Are the days after he passed away a doctor named Brian

312
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,343
Strong made a number of comments to the media about the possibility that blooms death

313
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,415
Was related to the smallpox vaccination he gotten several week

314
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
Week prior to his past

315
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
There's no direct evidence

316
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,559
Support this conclusion and making stuff up

317
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
And jumping to conclusions

318
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,959
That said no medication is fully without some risk in the smallpox vaccine is no

319
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Exception

320
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,775
Compare to the smallpox

321
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
Fox come back though the risk is very minimal

322
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
Isn't it so f******

323
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,223
It's just so indicative of how stupid people are

324
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
That

325
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
The government was like

326
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Okay

327
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Now

328
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Despite not having

329
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,903
Any idea whether or not they could have weaponized

330
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Is polio

331
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
Smallpox

332
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,767
Would weaponize polio smallpox

333
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
Or

334
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
I even

335
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,375
I have some way of delivering it

336
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:50,751
We're just going to go out of our way and protect ourselves against the possibility of a smallpox

337
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Despite the fact that

338
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
The overwhelming number of humans have died of diseases that have occurred regularly and at no point in time

339
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Have they been like

340
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,063
Let's put a lot of effort into preemptive

341
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
It said

342
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,391
I mean they have any they have but not like

343
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,023
You know whatever you know what my point is it's not like the Bush Administration wasn't also

344
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,655
Getting tetanus shot

345
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
I don't know

346
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:25,311
I feel like you're just looking for a way to attack

347
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
Isaac

348
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
I think when you look at this it's like

349
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
It's a terrifying Prospect

350
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,367
Maybe there was some chatter of some sort I would believe

351
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
Possibly

352
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
This is something we should be concerned about you

353
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Some

354
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
Body might have a sample of

355
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
Some Laboratory

356
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
It could really f*** things up

357
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,727
Maybe if you

358
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
If you ask late in your head

359
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,311
What the possible threat is

360
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,591
Then the idea of

361
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
The campaign of

362
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
Vaccinating

363
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
Healthcare workers

364
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,735
Who might be in the front line for

365
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Or soldiers

366
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
A certain amount of sense

367
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,391
Looking back we obviously have the gift of hindsight knowing the

368
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,207
Didn't happen a lot more silly

369
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
But

370
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:19,327
Even back then you could probably make a pretty decent argument that it was

371
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
Excessive

372
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
We can understand where the thought process

373
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,311
It's just we had too many examples of this type of paranoia being the excuse

374
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,847
Action

375
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
When is paranoia vets

376
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,455
Inherently devalues the life of other people

377
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
As opposed to

378
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
The paranoias it's like

379
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Hey

380
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,831
Diseases just come out of nowhere from

381
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
All of the time

382
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
Infinitely more important

383
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Instead it's like

384
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:52,095
We've always got to be preparing for a war or or someone to try and get

385
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
Misunderstood

386
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,935
Your point

387
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,007
I think it was indicative of

388
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
A lot of

389
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:05,151
Like sort of public mentality

390
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
I also think that you can do both

391
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
Then that might be where

392
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,575
Might have misunderstood you were saying

393
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,159
At one or the other choice

394
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,000
But I think everybody was

395
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
Ideally

396
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
Heather pet on both

397
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:29,216
But it's not necessarily the best way to go about talking

398
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
I don't think you broke new ground

399
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
Start a revolution dad

400
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,664
This clip I thought was a really good instance to illustrate why you

401
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,504
You can't take vaccine-related stories seriously when they come from Alex

402
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,088
No matter what the reality of the story is Alex is always going to take

403
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
The story about the

404
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,440
Possibility of danger and he's going to report that is definitive

405
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,744
Exaggerated out it is like

406
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
It's been proven

407
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
They shown it

408
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,632
It's the same thing that he's does with covid-19 vaccine

409
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,192
Stories in the present day

410
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
This behavior is

411
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Consistent

412
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,312
Cuz he is staunchly opposed

413
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Do vaccines

414
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,152
Right not based on the science of it

415
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
And you can

416
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
You can argue

417
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
The problem with it is that the argument of like look

418
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
20 years ago

419
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,112
This a****** was saying the same lies

420
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
About different vaccine

421
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
And you can see that those didn't come true

422
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,536
So why would you believe him now and they are the argue

423
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
It will always be like

424
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,840
Yeah yeah but it's

425
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
The Black Swan

426
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,448
You know sure this one was a fake they want to make you come

427
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
Struble Road vaccine

428
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,544
Until they do it they want to lower you into

429
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
And you're like fine we will never

430
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,408
You can't you can't really be back by thinking

431
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,808
And I think if you do are able to get yourself to a point where you recognize that like he does

432
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,856
Do this over and over and over again

433
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,392
Regardless of the circle

434
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,952
You have to start to ask yourself why

435
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,512
What is it exactly that is

436
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
The opposition Tyvek

437
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
What is that about

438
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,168
I think you could probably come up with a couple of possibilities one is

439
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,984
A sort of inclination towards

440
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,640
Divine Science medical intervention

441
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
I believe that Alex is there

442
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Because he

443
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
Like he's gotten surgery

444
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:22,880
No but it is it is that kind of like when it happens to someone else

445
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Very much

446
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
What's the will of God

447
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
I'm going to happen

448
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
To you

449
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,328
The will of God is to save yourself

450
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
Themselves

451
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,776
Because it was their time it was their time to go damn you can't deny them that sure I'm saying that's slightly

452
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
The unsatisfying

453
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Explanation for Alex

454
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
The other one that I come up with

455
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
This is the

456
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
Notion

457
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
I understanding that

458
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
Like vaccines

459
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:54,112
Have drastically improved the world the lives of poor people

460
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,416
Yeah people in developing countries around the world

461
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
And

462
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,768
I don't know a whole lot of Alex's policy positions

463
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
Seem to be

464
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
About not

465
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,400
Turn off foreign aid

466
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,728
Two things are are things with that

467
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
Seem to be

468
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
Kind of

469
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,824
I overlap of a lot of his beliefs

470
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
Yeah

471
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,896
I don't I don't know if that's where the opposition

472
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,920
In comes from but

473
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
It certainly makes more sense

474
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
Since then legitimate

475
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,832
Scientific when you think about

476
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,880
When typhoid spread through wealth

477
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
Neighborhood

478
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
There is far less like

479
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
Auntie medicine

480
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
Spread around about that s*** was very much

481
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,584
Everybody needs to clean their hands everybody needs

482
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
You know that kind

483
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Anything

484
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,704
So Alex gives a little bit of a shoe

485
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,520
The beginning of this episode

486
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
You know hey man

487
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,080
Sometimes the world doesn't

488
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Make sense

489
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,640
That's when you need a little bit of infowar

490
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
War

491
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,136
Your children

492
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,280
You'll find the answer right here

493
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
Is it the devil

494
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,680
Is it the devil devil

495
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,472
It's got to be something like that

496
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
I'm confused

497
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,544
I mean I understand

498
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:53,920
No I think we were all wondering that you know like those are correct wonders

499
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:58,272
Sure there's something

500
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,856
Yeah it's certainly there is there are there are confused

501
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,672
Militarization of police is confusing

502
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
What's going on

503
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
Why is this happening

504
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,816
I don't get answers from Infowars

505
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:14,912
He turns into a

506
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
I wonder if he's just not telling the audience at this point yeah but this is secretly just a big religious

507
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Campaign

508
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,640
Is part of God's plan for him and

509
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,712
In fighting the devil to lie to these people early on in

510
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
His career

511
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,552
Like slowly trick them into being

512
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,576
The holy Warriors

513
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,112
Guide me right

514
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
Ass ain't isn't going

515
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,440
Bring these centers in

516
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,024
I kind of idea

517
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,424
Got it God was talking to Sullivan cell was like 9 or 10 in his dreams and he's like listen you got to lie to everybody

518
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
Right up until the good time

519
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,264
Yeah I don't know I don't know it's really straight

520
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,616
It's really strange to me it looks like I said it needs 2015

521
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,176
My ion is worthless ideas.

522
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:03,808
Does he think he's fighting the devil in 2003 you know if he does

523
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Then that clip

524
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Is busiek

525
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
If he doesn't

526
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,952
Then his world view doesn't make sense

527
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,768
Appreciative that clue

528
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
So Alex has got a headline that's not a headline

529
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Federal lawsuit

530
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,856
This reading is not from a news story or any kind of journalistic source

531
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
It's actually the title of a press release

532
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
Was put out by the office of Lauren Regan

533
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,536
The lawyer representing the people who are the subject of this real

534
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:50,912
I can understand how this is still a source of information and it's entirely possible that the lawyers press release

535
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
Could have stuff with conveying

536
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,544
It seems like something that shouldn't be treated as the same as an article in an actual news

537
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Outlet

538
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,896
Incidentally this case resulted in the City of Eugene paying one couple

539
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
$30,000 and another $92,000

540
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
To settle their cases

541
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,064
Which claimed unreasonable search and seizure excessive use

542
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
Assault and

543
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Folsom Prison

544
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,464
The police consider contended that it was an instance of them having bad information

545
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,256
I believe in that they were raiding a drug house

546
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,072
Whereas the couple's believe that the police got a warrant by lion

547
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,376
Whatever the case it's not good policing

548
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
And even if the Intel had all been good

549
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,240
Directions would have been excessive for a drug raid

550
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,848
Here is that in terms of the big picture that this kind of police action is wrong

551
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,896
Alex and I are in complete agreement

552
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Not hard

553
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,248
I still don't support how he pushes the message though however given that

554
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
You presenting

555
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:44,160
Biased information from the lawyers of people involved in the story present neutral headline

556
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
It's not

557
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,256
It's not necessarily the way you would want to go about

558
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,584
Framing your case even if your case is something that I agree

559
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
Yeah yeah yeah

560
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
I mean

561
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,448
It would be hard to be on the wrong side of

562
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,008
Strangers destroy your home

563
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,544
For no good reason

564
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
And face no punish

565
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,616
Like that

566
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,200
Seems obvious yeah and has a large portion

567
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,504
Of this episode talking about this

568
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
Couples

569
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
Houses that that were

570
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,112
We're search they were

571
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
You know how old

572
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
Does

573
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Become hard

574
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,608
Take seriously

575
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:34,336
Wahkiakum I do care for these people who had this police intervention in their lives unnecessarily

576
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
And they were treated poorly

577
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
I just don't

578
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,784
I don't consider Alex a legitimate person some absolutely any more

579
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
Yeah anyway

580
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,368
Is that is also a really good

581
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
Question about the

582
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
I mean as far as

583
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
The fighting the devil in

584
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
The present goes

585
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
Another

586
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
Another like question that that raised

587
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
This is

588
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,400
Is this guy that guy

589
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Or does he

590
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
You change into this guy

591
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
And what

592
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
What does that mean

593
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
You know like are there is

594
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
Is it possible

595
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,616
That Alex and I could have had a comp

596
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
Conversation in 2003

597
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,712
That wouldn't have wound up with me trying to throw something into his face

598
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,832
Probably I bet I bet it is I bet you what you might not really enjoy it all that much

599
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,416
Because he's lying to that because

600
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,696
He was a different person

601
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:26,560
Possibility that I could eventually change into this very monster

602
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,656
That's actually why we're doing this

603
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:37,312
That's really the thing that this is all about is like

604
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:42,432
Be like what do we have to be afraid of

605
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,528
Somebody get a whiteboard up with a cautionary thing yet

606
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,136
Alex starts to read this article and you bring up

607
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
This

608
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
The differences between presentation

609
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,976
Is this

610
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,048
Bring up this article and

611
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,584
You can see in this clip

612
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
Similarities and difference

613
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,424
Like okay one

614
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
What's big similarities

615
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,008
He starts reading and every

616
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,568
Nothing here EP editorialize Azar

617
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,896
A whole bunch of stuff it's not in the article

618
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
To the article

619
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
But a big

620
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Difference

621
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
He says that this was written by a lawyer

622
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,600
He doesn't clarify that it's the lawyer of the people

623
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
Who were in the story Shore

624
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
He does he does

625
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
Give a clarification that I did

626
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Didn't expect from him

627
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,432
Pre-dawn

628
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:01,280
You can hear the difference in his voice when he's editorializing

629
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
That's it

630
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
It's

631
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,936
Curry gets in a way you can you can

632
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,752
Feel him almost telling you when he

633
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
He's not

634
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
There is a slight

635
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,848
Bit of that

636
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
Still it's still like

637
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:22,528
To read this article myself constantly would suffice

638
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
Did I see we got you

639
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,880
It's slightly more responsible feeling

640
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
Because if you are at

641
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:32,000
Actively listening you can tell when it's like these are at the words of Alec right

642
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,536
This is his reading voice

643
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:38,912
And you know why that's a more compelling show than just reading the news because this is

644
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:44,288
This is very similar to how some a****** might be reading an article as he's reading at you no like

645
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:49,920
If I'm reading an article sometimes I'll read a sentence and be like

646
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,760
Delray the next sentence you know this is an engaging way of almost

647
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
Reading the news with your body

648
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,856
I don't I don't disagree

649
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,440
So Alex gets to talking about other places that have been rated

650
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,824
This is a case from early 2000 to wear a 27-month long invest

651
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,128
Navigation into an international gun and drugs

652
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
Smuggling operation

653
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,200
Culminated in arrest in a town called

654
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
Carthage

655
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
In Missouri

656
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
This is a real headline from an AP story but

657
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:32,160
The use of the words Town searched isn't meant to be taken completely literally

658
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:38,304
The multi-agency task force that was working on this extended operation set up some checkpoints to make sure the subject at their best

659
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
Navigation couldn't flee

660
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
Anime made the arrest

661
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,656
I'm not justifying

662
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,240
This policing us early I'm just saying that

663
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
Bee image that Alex wants

664
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,104
Creative cops kicking in every door in this town in Missouri

665
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,384
Looking for wrongdoing

666
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
The jam someone up

667
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,432
Like

668
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
Not accurate wants

669
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:01,600
To create and it's not real has elephants across the Rock

670
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
To get there

671
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,440
I felt like that might have been a terrible idea

672
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
But

673
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,792
Right I got it

674
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
I got it

675
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,424
I was trying to think of a way if there was a like

676
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:21,824
It's Corral do Jo Peckham Lane in the boat

677
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,152
It wasn't worth it

678
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:30,784
It was probably would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't trying to make a Fitz Corrado joke

679
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
And say what

680
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
We were working at cross-purposes

681
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,160
Sazon that rip yams

682
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,232
I apologize I should be there for you more that was on me

683
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,584
Alex is completely

684
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Fudging

685
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Find for him

686
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,240
His lawyer

687
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
I guess

688
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
If you put the pizza

689
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
This Together yourself you can

690
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,104
Kind of makes sense of

691
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,920
Text at this isn't the headline this is

692
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Something

693
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,504
The press release word is never used

694
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,832
But you can put the pieces together that this is a lawyer representing

695
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,624
The people

696
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
A not unbiased actor in The Circle

697
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
Yeah you will

698
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
I think of this lawyer seems

699
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
Fairly straight up

700
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,424
I think she's distracted and

701
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,728
Maybe a little bit bemused by Alex's

702
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,008
Is constant

703
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:29,408
Said her name was Roberta Barnes gave me some pause

704
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
I felt more comfortable

705
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,248
Alex Alex knows how to arrest

706
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
You should know that

707
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
Go work

708
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Go ahead

709
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
You can tell kind of air that she's trying to respond to staff

710
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,608
Is how I would characterize the interview

711
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:25,216
She has a point I don't know if she necessarily knows who he

712
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,240
Alex is

713
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,544
And Alex certainly isn't it as talks

714
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
Amantadine

715
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
2003's Ryan presents

716
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:36,736
You might not think twice about an invitation to come and talk about this

717
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,040
You're passionate about new want to get attention for

718
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:44,160
And you don't know going in that it is going to be a life-or-death struggle to

719
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
To finish ascent

720
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,464
You didn't know that

721
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,864
And you don't know that Alex is going to be constantly trying to drive the image of a naked woman being dragged out of her house

722
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
Yep

723
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,448
Because that's a visceral for them correct

724
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,800
Where is you maybe want to talk about

725
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,104
Infringement

726
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,664
Alright

727
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
Spell really

728
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,016
Interesting

729
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,320
Partially because

730
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
I mean

731
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
I agree with Alex

732
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,672
I don't agree with his tactics

733
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
I don't agree with him

734
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:21,280
Sensationalizing the story like I looked at the

735
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
The story in

736
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,584
Normal Outlet

737
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,656
And the conclusion of the police shouldn't have done this

738
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,008
Because we're in the future

739
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
That the police

740
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,336
And the City of Eugene did payout

741
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
Settlement

742
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
You take away whatever these people

743
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
Experience

744
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
You know something

745
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:46,880
Some figures are as restitution for the cops destroying your home

746
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,672
And your sense of safety

747
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,440
Be forever

748
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,512
There's there's going to be psychological things

749
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,560
Angel

750
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,400
There's a there's a modicum of Justice in that are in a settlement

751
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,264
Anyway the interview

752
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
And

753
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,824
Patrick says this

754
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
Rolled my eyes

755
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:20,160
1 800 25

756
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
He's setting himself up for failure

757
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:26,816
I'll give you plans to get 250 stories boss calls in one hour that's just not possible

758
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,864
If you factory commercials he's giving

759
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,912
Himself like 20 seconds birth story

760
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
That's not even enough to get through the head

761
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,056
You should be more realistic about what he can and can't cover in the time he has and then

762
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:41,664
Focus on what he has the time to cover sure make for better content

763
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,504
Sure it wouldn't be so dumb it does it does make it

764
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
I don't know what would I say

765
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:52,160
It does make it far more reasonable to just ignore that in the Press

766
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,952
You know it's like a long-running

767
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,512
Joke on a sitcom

768
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,560
It's been going on for 30 years

769
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,352
What are you going to complain now

770
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
If avallac'h says he's going to get to the stories

771
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
And you've listed

772
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
In 2000

773
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:08,288
You know damn well he's not going to listen to he's not going to get to the store too

774
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:14,688
Doctor house

775
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
Symptoms

776
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:23,392
Sprite

777
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,720
Play diagnostic game.

778
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,048
Coffee is not part of it

779
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,376
Alex has

780
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
Trouble with quotes

781
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,728
Extends far beyond time

782
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:59,744
So Alex

783
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,024
Perception is reality

784
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:06,400
That's interesting because that's quote most famously attributed to Republican strategist Lee Atwater

785
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:10,752
Notable prison tattoos of racism as a political tool

786
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,360
What did it what did name one big strategy

787
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:23,808
Also there is a associate with the Willie Horton

788
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:30,208
Pretty notable 1984 senior partner at Black manafort Stone and Kelly

789
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,792
The consulting firm run by Alex's Future Good Buddy Rogers

790
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,608
Wow something is real perception is reality

791
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
Jesus

792
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:47,872
1984 good ol Rodger Stone looking to his left seeing leatt water if they could I got a break

793
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
Futureadpro

794
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,712
Call Morgan

795
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:58,368
You really are going to get charged with crimes in 36 years boy

796
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,208
Definitely not laying the groundwork for all the crimes were going to do

797
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
This was addressed

798
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
Tumi

799
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
I'm going to stop saying it

800
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
This was weird

801
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,168
Sure okay

802
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Alex

803
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:19,616
Hasn't intense news Blitz he needs to get for a full hour of news with I forgot about that

804
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
New World Order

805
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,136
Turn in the military

806
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
Waze

807
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,448
Everywhere

808
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
American

809
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,056
Revolution or I could say

810
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,503
We've had requests for the song wheel

811
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,607
Liberty

812
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:22,079
Alex plays the entire song of Billy Ray Cyrus's songs

813
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,895
I was worried it was going to be what I heard it being

814
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,711
Unhappy

815
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,271
I would give anything to go back to that moment in time

816
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,319
And tell Alex about Miley

817
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,719
Oh my God it's so weird

818
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
It's so weird

819
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,535
He plays a full song

820
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,095
As like a shout out to the Troops and he doesn't

821
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:48,959
He doesn't sing along with it or editorialized / Reeves

822
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,031
Now he couldn't eat a sandwich is easily back then

823
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
That's probably true

824
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:57,663
Yeah that was buzard this format is very strange

825
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,759
That makes me feel deeply uncomfortable

826
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,295
There's no what no

827
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:07,391
A lot of people have been wanting me to play Billy Ray Cyrus and I say to them know

828
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Again

829
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,975
Everything I understand about Alex's format

830
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
Song requests

831
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
You can request songs

832
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,911
He doesn't play songs

833
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,495
What a weird strange

834
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,031
So the news Blitz doesn't really happen

835
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,639
What guy this guy is interesting

836
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,223
Hehehe seems to believe

837
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,783
That's spam

838
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:35,807
Yes

839
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,575
Messages

840
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Oh right

841
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,671
Yes but not the food spam messages need

842
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:44,511
To be clearly delineate it as something with a commercial purpose

843
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,815
Cuz he got accused of stealing somebody

844
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,863
And he was just trying to harass them

845
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,447
Okay two things if I can get someone at the supremacy clause

846
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,007
Kakashi's veterans law

847
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,311
Legislation to make Spam

848
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
On the internet

849
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,455
To a Spanish commercial

850
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Not

851
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,087
Not forcing

852
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,135
Compressor media to

853
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:15,231
See the pictures

854
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,559
Your email goes if somebody wrong you live in prison or white

855
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,375
I was accused of scamming people

856
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,399
How many times

857
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,935
After 9/11 Iraq War

858
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,263
They leave their email addresses in the newspaper articles

859
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,615
Is email address so he doesn't have to

860
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
Mystery

861
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
To the treason that's gone

862
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,319
Yeah it's open goes in

863
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,647
Find email addresses in newspapers in the

864
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:47,231
Yeah he's worried about a law against

865
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
Yeah

866
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
Yeah

867
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:54,143
That's a fundamental misunderstanding of all of the problems with what you're doing

868
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
You back but it's fun

869
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,983
I believe you got the

870
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
That wrong

871
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:03,359
It's a phone call though because you can see the Dynamics that are going on and like

872
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,991
I don't know that sounds like an Alex Jones listen to me

873
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
Make

874
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
Making it illegal

875
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:15,391
For me to send chain emails to my family

876
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
And that

877
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:20,255
That's going to really get in the way of Mimi capping this reporter over here

878
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,327
So we got to stop this Cheney mailbox

879
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,375
Not spam

880
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
I

881
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:30,751
Email a journalist 100 times in a day until he's going to go to jail for today

882
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,687
I'm not a but I'm an ass-whole I suck every one of those messages by half the button

883
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,527
We're going to hear a little bit of

884
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
Talking about

885
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,111
Do you know you got the new money coming in

886
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
The new bill

887
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,719
Yeah yeah and a lot of people a lot of theories

888
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
About that

889
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,535
This caller believes

890
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,607
Will never have Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill

891
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,399
This color believes that there is like

892
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
Metal strip

893
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,263
Sure if you hold on to the money

894
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
Alright more than a month

895
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,567
It'll be able to time that

896
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,967
I like this money will know when it's changed hands this is a good conspiracy I like this and if you hold on to

897
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
To a too long

898
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,527
It'll Auto tax

899
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,855
What that man was talking about on

900
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
Money

901
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,719
Program the other day one of the things with the money with the strip

902
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,743
When you get it

903
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,535
If you don't answer

00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
Turn on within a month

905
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Cubeecraft

906
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:33,215
Starboard Virginia

907
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:38,591
A real person to have on with the Donald mcalvany intelligence

908
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Visor

909
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
He's very well.

910
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:49,343
I have no idea however timer of a month would stars are

911
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
Love it

912
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,671
If I work if I were to buy something

913
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:56,255
With a bell like this is ridiculous

914
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,655
I don't I don't know anything about this. Old guy but look into it a little bit

915
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:06,239
Website is just a portal to a gold sales Outlet

916
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:12,639
So he's saying that maybe you shouldn't get paper said you should get gold

917
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,431
So then he of course

918
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,455
Sell gold

919
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,503
That's very strange how that work

920
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
Completely nutty

921
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:26,975
Conspiracy theories about paper money always said that sell gold

922
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:33,375
Super weird people who hate the fed and paper currency love

923
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,215
And also sell at Providence

924
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239
Firstrade

925
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,519
So we go to

926
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
Okay

927
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:45,407
I didn't find that episode all that satisfying a lot of it was about

928
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Is that lawyer

929
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,735
Just kind of spending

930
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,503
Wheels

931
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,295
I got in on the 9th

932
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,343
I found myself

933
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,647
Very excited

934
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,671
Is that the right word

935
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,439
Interesting

936
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:06,655
Will be joined by Geoff Moore

937
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,199
But

938
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,415
You heard on the

939
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
News

940
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:41,983
Would you say they got canceled if you will just misspoke there any tried to cover it by insinuating that the media

941
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,591
Got the story wrong but making you think that the two DJs got in trouble for playing Dixie Chicks

942
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,127
When maybe they got in trouble for

943
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,151
For criticizing

944
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,199
Only Alex can get to the bottom of it

945
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,735
How could you get speaks

946
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
Could you know

947
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,295
So these two guys works

948
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,087
Tkacs

949
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,391
102 FM in Colorado Springs

950
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,487
It's a station to Aveda put in place a boycott on playing Dixie Chick

951
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,023
Kick songs after Natalie Maines

952
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:09,375
I had some comments at a concert they were seen as being Auntie troop when she said

953
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
That you was a shame

954
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,191
The President Bush was from

955
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
State hazard in Texas

956
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:19,615
Good for the Dixie Chicks are being ahead of their time you know like now we're all the same to the United States but they really got there first

957
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,431
Obviously this was an instance of ever losing

958
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:27,807
Damn mind and Dixie Chicks but some of the details of the story

959
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,831
Particularly about this

960
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:34,719
Is DJ situation might not be what you remember

961
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,559
What's the ricin

962
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,399
Dueling Elvis impersonators

963
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:49,055
Actual to DJ's the story that I remembered was that they dare to play a couple songs from the Dixie Chicks and that was enough

964
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,335
Have to get them in trouble

965
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
An article from the

966
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,175
Times Herald-Record has some other details

967
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:58,271
Kctcs instituted a ban on the Dixie Chicks

968
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
Zoo at the time

969
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
Two songs on the charts

970
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,415
But to DJ's at the station Dave Moore and Jeff singer decided at 2 months

971
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,439
Was punishment enough

972
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,719
They broke the band

973
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:12,095
At 6:15 a.m. on Monday May 5th 2003 they lock themselves in the DJ booth

974
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:16,703
They started with long time gone and they didn't stop playing Dixie Chicks Tunes until noon

975
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
Was Adams

976
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,031
Taylor and Brittany

977
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:26,431
I didn't remember that was part of the story

978
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:32,831
Real life even though I agree with the point of what they're doing I totally understand that it's a brazen

979
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,623
Active insubordination

980
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:39,999
Listen you guys are here but we can't just not do anything what happened

981
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,815
The station manager Jerry Grant gave the to a choice

982
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,095
To either continue playing dicks

983
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,375
Dixie Chicks songs and get fired

984
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
Or stop

985
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,703
Unlock the studio to be suspended for a few days

986
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,983
And they chose

987
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,055
To end the occupation of the states

988
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:59,455
I have a huge problem with everything surrounding this story but I'm not sure I disagree with these two DJs getting a slap-on-the-wrist

989
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:05,855
Christopher essentially like you said living the movie area

990
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
AirHeads you just can't do it

991
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
It's like what the

992
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:13,023
The movie Airheads a good cause

993
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:18,911
You're sort of as we learn later but

994
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,959
What is dumb no matter what absolutely

995
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:25,055
I would want them to be punished too harshly but you can't lock yourself in a repeal booth

996
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,639
Pirate the transmission and expect nothing

997
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,431
Where is that

998
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:36,319
I think that is actually pretty restrained response

999
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
From the boss

1000
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:43,743
Couple days suspension whatever overreacted everybody would have turned it in

1001
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,559
Into a cause I would slap on the wrist is almost

1002
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:51,423
Insulting to them like that protest was worth nothing more than take a day off

1003
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,239
I found

1004
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,519
It seems like

1005
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
The guy was like

1006
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:01,663
Yeah we were getting ready to start playing their music again anyway but

1007
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:06,527
We wanted to do it on our terms you are a

1008
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,599
I could see how

1009
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,879
I could see how this

1010
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,159
You know what

1011
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,183
It's ultimately

1012
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,999
The audience and the Pea it's been 2 months

1013
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,047
Sure audience is kind of over it

1014
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,335
Pretend This is

1015
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,639
And these guys are

1016
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,455
Yeah which is also interesting

1017
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:41,855
And maybe probably for the best I bet they got a s*** ton of Free Press out of that they even suspended them

1018
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,647
And then they came back and everybody was like

1019
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:49,791
I don't know I don't know if you remember those dudes name

1020
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,655
Dave Grohl

1021
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,007
I mean it's a story that you kind of remember

1022
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,311
Inasmuch as I do remember that there were

1023
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,615
Some DJs who got in trouble for playing pics

1024
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,431
I don't remember those details

1025
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,479
I don't remember their names

1026
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
I don't think that there

1027
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,831
Kevin & Bean

1028
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:17,951
To live echoing throughout history that's true

1029
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,511
Angle of it worked out as well as you

1030
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,143
They were going to be on I thought

1031
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
Okay

1032
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:33,055
Here we go this is this is nonsense exactly the kind of thing that I think is really fun

1033
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,871
About going back to

1034
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,407
Long-forgotten

1035
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,455
Sort of

1036
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,527
I want to call it trivial because what happened to the Dixie Chicks

1037
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,551
So unfair

1038
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,391
I'm not I'm not with minimize that at all

1039
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,159
Of course

1040
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,207
In terms of Alex's world

1041
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:50,975
This is

1042
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Trivial

1043
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,047
Yeah yeah yeah

1044
00:53:54,303 --> 00:54:00,191
It we're all going to die alright we're fighting the literal devil also these two guys got suspended for playing the Dixie

1045
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,799
So there's a little bit of a disconnect and steak

1046
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,567
If you will

1047
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,663
These guys are probably not super political

1048
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:16,063
But they don't know who Alex Jones is the other nationally syndicated

1049
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,391
Eucalyptus beard intersection of things that would never happen nowadays

1050
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
And I think

1051
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:20,927
It's amazing

1052
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:25,279
Anyway just to check in with the NRA

1053
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,015
Alex doesn't like the NRA at all

1054
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,295
She hates me

1055
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,575
Don't like

1056
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,623
I don't like going into the past

1057
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:53,183
As much as you do because I find that his

1058
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
Behavior

1059
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:54,975
Is left

1060
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
Egregious

1061
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,023
And thus make

1062
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,583
Makes me feel more like I'm saying stuff where I'm like

1063
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,143
I mean yeah that's a good point

1064
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,167
I don't like

1065
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:07,007
Will like it cuz his behavior is still egregious just under the surface

1066
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,335
Here's the thing that we need to really

1067
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,359
Finally delineate

1068
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,639
Yeah it's like yes

1069
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,687
Opposition to the NRA is great

1070
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
Opposition to Bush

1071
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:22,367
He's great with those things great as sentences on a piece of paper correct

1072
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,135
Why

1073
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,159
Alex is against

1074
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,183
Both of those things

1075
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,231
It's different than what we thought holder

1076
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,535
And so I actually think that you can be

1077
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:36,191
What you're experiencing is exactly what lured a lot of people who wouldn't agree with Alex's radical politics

1078
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,471
Into thinking

1079
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,519
He was more in the center than he acts

1080
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
Actually

1081
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,615
Like the NRA

1082
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,383
Maybe

1083
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,479
He's one of these people whose kind of conservative but kind of gets it no

1084
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,759
He's more

1085
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:55,903
Extreme

1086
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,183
It's so frustrating that

1087
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,975
He could get away with

1088
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,511
Conceived

1089
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:07,167
We got away with really well for him at this

1090
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,959
Decide this era

1091
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
Yeah

1092
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:13,311
And I think one of the things that is really good for him to is

1093
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,591
This this Brandon

1094
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,383
And you know we're talkin about this like

1095
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,919
Attacking me Honore from the right

1096
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
Because he is a

1097
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,991
Extreme right-wing person

1098
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,855
Extremely far to the right of bush

1099
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,927
Because he's to the left reason the center

1100
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,975
Impression

1101
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,535
And Alex plays into that impression

1102
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
Hair clip

1103
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,375
He's talking about how people call him a commie

1104
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
Because he's again

1105
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
Bush

1106
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,055
Call John Hardin

1107
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
Oprah

1108
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,519
American flag

1109
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,151
Alex has this

1110
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,687
Superficial

1111
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,759
Defining himself by opposition

1112
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
Yeah things

1113
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,831
Dit-dit-dit actually does

1114
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Mulatto

1115
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,367
People

1116
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:33,951
I'm opposed to Bush and now it won't cost me a commie when I was against

1117
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,767
When I was against Clinton they called me a hard right

1118
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,583
Extreme you were and you still are

1119
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,935
I don't care I don't know if I ever had anybody who

1120
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
I heard

1121
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263
Say like

1122
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,055
Alex is a communist

1123
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
Bushnell

1124
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,383
I just think of people thought he was more sensible than

1125
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,687
You might think on 1st

1126
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:59,551
And if you are an enemy of any part of the right-wing you will be called

1127
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
Communist

1128
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:04,415
Regardless of anything you may or may not have ever said or believed

1129
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,719
Possibly by other people in the right wing

1130
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:12,095
Michaelsavage.com

1131
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
It's just wine

1132
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
Yeah yeah

1133
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:21,055
I think there is a pretty key problem there too though

1134
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,079
They did something

1135
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,871
That I notice about Alex

1136
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
That is

1137
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,663
The

1138
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
Defining self

1139
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,991
By opposition

1140
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,015
Or by others

1141
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,039
Response

1142
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,343
When he talks all the time but knowing that he's right

1143
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,647
Because people are attacking him and stuff is like

1144
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,439
That's not a reliable metric

1145
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,207
Back of

1146
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,231
Yeah you know

1147
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:43,327
I'm right cuz everybody hates me well

1148
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,095
Yeah

1149
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,887
Does that mean that Isis is right

1150
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
Yeah

1151
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,679
No it's there

1152
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:51,263
If he goes to therapy one time the first question is just going to be like

1153
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:56,639
How do you define yourself and he's going to talk about everybody but himself in there but like

1154
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,663
From the inside

1155
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,455
And it's going to be 6

1156
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
Years of concert

1157
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,295
Did talkin digit even figure out where Easter

1158
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,343
So these DJs

1159
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
Come on

1160
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,647
And I got to say

1161
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
Is a little bit of a

1162
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,207
Current style for Alex

1163
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,999
The interview

1164
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,279
Tough question

1165
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,167
Chloe

1166
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,703
Alright

1167
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:27,359
Well we did it good journalism everybody let's go let's wrap it up and go home that's certainly better journalism but he normally

1168
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:34,271
So how long has your management been evil it in the

1169
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,087
The devil in the globalist

1170
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:42,207
Think Alex's bedside manner leaves a little bit to be desired their attitude

1171
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,279
S***

1172
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,095
No follow-up question

1173
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,119
The feel of like a

1174
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
Maybe if I do

1175
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,447
Just surprised them aggressively they'll be tricked into an

1176
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,519
One of the thing

1177
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,591
I think Alex has been presenting

1178
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,383
People

1179
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
Felt

1180
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,431
Was that this was a prince

1181
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,479
Multiple stand that these DJs are making

1182
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,527
That it was they were opposed

1183
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,295
The band

1184
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,831
And they played this music

1185
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:12,415
As a way of being like no totally believe in free speech

1186
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,951
Pirate Radio

1187
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,511
Vietnam War were doing it all over

1188
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,303
If you listen to them it's

1189
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:24,191
Very clear that that's not the case they did not agree with what Natalie said

1190
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
They agreed with

1191
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:30,335
They just thought I had to run its course

1192
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,783
Because of what Natalie

1193
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,343
Main said about our president over in London

1194
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,623
So I'm that it was

1195
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,439
Was starting to turn the other way like nu-start beat

1196
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,375
Work for the president

1197
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,679
Amendment 1

1198
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,775
What you said absolutely not

1199
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,335
Walmart

1200
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:24,607
They were fine with this for two months

1201
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,631
Superfly

1202
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:31,519
I'd started the turn if you'd like

1203
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,823
It has an expiration date of 2 months

1204
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
I don't know I mean

1205
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,687
I don't know I don't know how I feel about this from my likes

1206
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,711
Station management

1207
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
Perspective like

1208
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
Do they have the right

1209
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,295
To just say like

1210
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,599
I don't want to play this person songs

1211
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,159
They don't have a contract

1212
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,951
But they have to play

1213
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
Baby

1214
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
Shity

1215
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
Yeah if you're

1216
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,583
No not playing some of the music

1217
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,119
Because of a political reason

1218
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
Yeah but like

1219
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,727
Shapiro metal station you're not required to play reggae

1220
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,007
Right I mean like

1221
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,287
Unless

1222
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,359
I don't know

1223
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,687
Wyclef stacy says something anti-bush then you have

1224
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
Have to play it

1225
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,223
And so

1226
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,247
Easy

1227
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,039
Protesting

1228
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
What if

1229
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,135
This is like we're talkin

1230
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,183
Mid late 90s

1231
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,231
Sure he got an alternative station

1232
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
But you hate

1233
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:24,767
Peanut

1234
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,839
The personal is personal do you have to have a 11

1235
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:32,959
Like a personal problem

1236
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,983
With Nick Hexum

1237
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,519
Do you have to play 311

1238
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,799
Don't think so

1239
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,079
I don't know if it's

1240
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,639
Weird and certainly I'm opposed to

1241
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
Politically

1242
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,199
Just saying like no I don't

1243
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,735
Your politics are such

1244
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,527
But I'm not going to play your songs but like

1245
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
I mean

1246
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:52,671
If I was going to be impressed by these DJ's having any interest in gas than their actions

1247
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
Probably come on

1248
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,999
No it is a little bit like a

1249
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:03,935
I've decided that it is no longer popular for me to suppress this seat

1250
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,983
We're not going to carry Jane Austen

1251
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:10,079
We're just not doing it I remember her comments about bush

1252
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,919
That's how we do carry no more than two months later that I will put you

1253
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,527
New Jane Austen novels pretty hot people like it

1254
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:24,671
See that this is pretty much exactly what they say there's like

1255
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,239
Is that a joke

1256
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,775
No no he said no

1257
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,799
Seriously guys

1258
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:45,151
That was not a joke

1259
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:48,735
That wasn't even like one of those jokes where you laugh but you

1260
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,807
You're hoping they'll be like we're totally going to

1261
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:55,647
To do that you'll be like that was what I was trying to do I was just making

1262
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,439
Can a joke it wasn't that it was like

1263
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,463
Hey

1264
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,535
What reality show was seriously

1265
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:06,399
You made a lot of news suspension right now

1266
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,423
Please block me

1267
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,959
It is nice to know that

1268
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:14,079
The cop chasing still strong back in 2003 early adopter

1269
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,639
So Alex has

1270
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,687
F****** clear

1271
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:21,503
Evil doesn't really spell it out but if it

1272
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,271
Really clear

1273
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
He thinks that there's a

1274
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:24,575
Conspiracy of

1275
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,367
So here's the conspirator

1276
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,159
Clear Channel

1277
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,719
Alright about to radio station

1278
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,487
That's right

1279
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,791
To Clear Channel own about the radio station

1280
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,327
And also about the concert venue

1281
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,631
So what they have done

1282
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,423
They have manufactured

1283
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,959
A whole crisis

1284
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,751
Where the Dixie Chicks

1285
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,055
Picture of these stations that are owned by Clear Channel

1286
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,079
And then

1287
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,103
They go on tour

1288
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,175
And they have sucked the sell out all their shows

1289
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,199
At these venues

1290
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,735
That are owned by Clear Channel

1291
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
I would I would

1292
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,551
Suggest that

1293
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,599
The Dixie Chicks don't need to sell more tickets

1294
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,135
No they were doing all right

1295
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:02,463
They were huge

1296
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,743
Yeah yeah yeah

1297
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,511
They were huge

1298
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,839
What are the reasons that it was so nuts their orders

1299
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:10,911
In the top

1300
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,215
3 top 40 country music X

1301
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,751
In the world

1302
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,775
They were killed

1303
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:20,127
That's why they had to be taken down cuz they had two large of a platform to criticize bush

1304
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
So

1305
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,223
Alex tries to lay out this can

1306
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,759
Conspiracy to the DJs

1307
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,319
Now through this conspiracy to make sense

1308
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,879
There's two things that need to be true

1309
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,903
Yes one

1310
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,695
This needs to be clear channel station

1311
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,463
True

1312
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,511
The venue

1313
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:42,911
Where the Dixie Chicks are playing needs to be owned by Clear Channel for this conspiracy to have any of

1314
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Effect on them

1315
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,591
Okay

1316
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:11,839
I don't know if they are the promoter behind the Dixie Chicks concerts or not I know they do

1317
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:15,935
They have several venues across the country including a couple in Colorado

1318
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:19,775
And I didn't know they have Clear Channel entertainment which are for both concert

1319
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:24,127
Not sure if there are one of the promoters for the chicks or not

1320
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,735
Jonathan Ross

1321
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,551
Their venue in Colorado is fairly small bills

1322
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
Center

1323
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,887
Once I get all this attention oh I guess we won't know but you know

1324
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,239
People do.

1325
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
True

1326
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,055
This this is falling apart

1327
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:57,919
Usually it's more like

1328
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,967
Verily this

1329
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:03,295
Interview is fascinatingly falling apart

1330
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:08,159
Because these DJs are not free speech Crusaders anyway that Alex

1331
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
Maybe would have liked

1332
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,023
Refuted

1333
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:17,631
Weisinger in the span of about a minute correct pillars

1334
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:20,447
If it's conspiracy that clear channel is trying to

1335
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,727
Boost their life

1336
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:22,751
Sales

1337
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,799
For one of the most popular actor in the world

1338
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:31,455
Let's talk where they get kicked off radio

1339
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,015
Three of things that you hope to her true

1340
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,343
At least one of those should have been true

1341
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
Man

1342
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:43,231
No that's not good and at the very least you're not a data point for the Clear Channel

1343
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,023
So

1344
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
Alex

1345
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,839
Is recognizing some of the similar thing

1346
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,607
Things that I am

1347
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,887
Another this is falling apart

1348
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,423
Besides

1349
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:57,311
Retreat to attacking these guys supports Natalie Maines as bright

1350
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,847
To say whatever she wants so

1351
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,783
Coronavirus

1352
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,183
Mayweather

1353
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,975
Were there because I don't know

1354
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:18,303
You know personally whether or not there are weapons of mass destruction

1355
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,351
Weather Thursday

1356
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:25,471
I'm not an expert on that part

1357
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,639
Not

1358
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,503
91

1359
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
That's true

1360
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:50,303
We're just country DJs and the end for us it's about the music mainland

1361
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,327
Yeah

1362
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:56,447
We are just country DJ's bases on the fair

1363
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,263
I hate you

1364
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
I like that.

1365
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,055
Yeah

1366
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:07,455
I would like to use that yeah okay so my position is that I support the troops and your reply

1367
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:11,551
Bottles of that is making the own literally everything the government has ever done

1368
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,319
Great

1369
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:17,439
How about I tell you that I'm a country DJ the f*** alone

1370
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,303
I'm not going to litigate every before the government has ever made

1371
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,607
Great what a great comeback

1372
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,655
Cuz what

1373
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,423
Do you work

1374
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,959
Picture of a country DJ

1375
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:29,983
I'll tell you what

1376
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,519
Complicated in

1377
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:34,079
Clear-eyed views of global international politics

1378
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
No

1379
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,175
You're not with me even express

1380
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,967
Phone or show we play music

1381
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:43,295
We are going to we're not all that political

1382
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,319
Certainly

1383
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:49,183
This is coming on the show you certainly confused

1384
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,743
Why did you say all those words

1385
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,303
Did that is Alex just trying to take something

1386
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,863
From the interview

1387
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,935
Clear Channel conspiracy didn't work out

1388
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,215
You guys aren't Heroes

1389
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,031
They're kind of just morning Zoo dick

1390
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,591
If your

1391
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,615
Few have been

1392
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,639
Slated Soca

1393
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,175
Completely by these assholes

1394
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,967
Then there's also that

1395
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,759
Little bit of Alex's like

1396
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:17,855
Resentment coming out of like you didn't give me what I want so I will

1397
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,647
Take it from you that kind

1398
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
Oh yeah

1399
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
So I think

1400
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,255
Codependency with the auto

1401
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,095
This caller who calls in after the interview

1402
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,887
Wants to make Alex feel better

1403
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,679
And try and help him with that Clear Channel

1404
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,447
Conspiracy

1405
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,031
Name of the promotion promotion

1406
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,823
Company is sfx

1407
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
Payment

1408
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
Counters

1409
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,919
Go to website

1410
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
Channel

1411
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,935
It doesn't matter

1412
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,639
Yeah

1413
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,759
It does really does

1414
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,295
Should

1415
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,111
Does make me mad mex entertainment

1416
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,463
And then got

1417
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,487
Awesome

1418
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,255
Into its own

1419
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,279
Sing again

1420
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,351
I don't know I couldn't

1421
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
Go back in

1422
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
Can figure out if

1423
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,911
The Dixie Chicks

1424
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,215
All of their events were

1425
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,799
I'll run through Live Nation sure I don't know I don't think

1426
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:45,407
It doesn't prove any conspiracy

1427
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,711
I believe we are at this moment fighting

1428
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,039
The little devil who is destroying all of Iraq

1429
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:53,343
In order in service of

1430
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,391
Destroying all of the United States

1431
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,415
I'm so

1432
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,719
What clear Channel's doing about the

1433
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:03,327
The Dixie Chicks promotions make a few extra bucks on tickets

1434
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,863
Whatever

1435
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:09,215
Go for it Clear Channel I'd be willing

1436
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,983
2

1437
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,007
Stipulate

1438
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:13,567
And not accept as true but I'll just go ahead and

1439
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,591
I'm not even fighting

1440
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,663
By virtue of

1441
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,687
Live Nation

1442
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,759
Is doing ticketing for all of

1443
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,783
Of the Dixie Chicks

1444
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
Sure why not

1445
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:29,183
That still doesn't prove the conspiracy and Alex

1446
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,999
No I won't put it past the recording industry

1447
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:38,399
They pull up some b******* all the time that man so I saw Josie and the Pussycats movie was

1448
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:41,215
I get it all

1449
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:41,983
Conspiracy

1450
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,287
So I called her called in another one

1451
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
He's going to Siri

1452
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,103
Sometimes

1453
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,383
Alex's show

1454
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,919
Is being blocked out

1455
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,967
By waves

1456
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,503
I think I'm tired

1457
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
2

1458
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,343
Because you need someone

1459
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,255
I know frequencies

1460
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,559
Continue with the same hours later

1461
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,631
They can get you into

1462
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:16,287
You can hear it but I don't know if they trying to block you out of work

1463
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,311
The same thing too

1464
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,967
I'm doing the day but at night time when people home

1465
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,759
I want to listen to the radio

1466
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:33,183
If the same block out they can't get you in

1467
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
Appreciate

1468
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,303
What a what a

1469
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,399
I just wrote down

1470
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:48,543
What do you mean they block us out like Alex said what do you mean they block us out not

1471
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:53,407
Obviously they are always

1472
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,199
Well I think

1473
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:00,063
I think I'm going to realize there's not money in that probably

1474
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:03,391
And the only action you might end up

1475
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,183
Precipitating is harassment of

1476
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,511
The stations that do play him that's true and you might end up

1477
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,279
Cutting in

1478
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:15,679
You might bite bite the hand that feeds

1479
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:22,079
Convince people under attack with the affiliate

1480
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,103
Restaurants

1481
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
No good

1482
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,151
Alex

1483
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:28,223
Describing his enemies

1484
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:28,991
Use

1485
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,783
See if you hear The Devil in

1486
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,543
Warburg

1487
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,079
Rockefeller

1488
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:06,367
That sounds astoundingly terrestrial that sounds like

1489
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,391
Business interests

1490
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:09,951
To have an idea of working

1491
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:12,767
Together to create a worldwide dictatorship tyranny

1492
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,303
Yeah it does not seem like

1493
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,071
It's

1494
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:18,143
People who are in the employ of the devil who has

1495
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,935
Contacted them via trans

1496
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,959
Dimensional demon

1497
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:22,239
And offered them life

1498
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:24,031
Suspension technology

1499
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,079
They carry out an elaborate

1500
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,383
A complicated plan

1501
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,967
To slowly and orderly kill all Humanity

1502
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,783
Should they fail to do that they have a back-up plan

1503
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,087
They're just really super bioweapons real everybody off

1504
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:41,695
It seems like this is a guy who wants to at least be taken seriously

1505
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:43,743
As a knot science

1506
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,535
Fiction writer

1507
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,303
Yeah

1508
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,607
His improvised storytelling is much more like

1509
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
Grisham

1510
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:55,263
At this point I propose to Phillips

1511
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:01,663
Powerful lawyers taking over everything

1512
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,687
Realty

1513
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,527
No indeed exact it seems like his biggest problem is

1514
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:10,879
Ultimately what the end result of capitalism always seems to be which is staggering wealth

1515
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,415
Trinity quality leading to it

1516
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,207
Aristocratic

1517
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:18,047
I'd love for you to go back in time and talk to him about that

1518
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,839
So that cooler

1519
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,119
Who's talking about Alec

1520
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,679
Speeding under attack through waves right

1521
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:26,751
I thought he was

1522
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,359
Terraplanter

1523
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,463
The minds of military man

1524
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,199
Scalar attack

1525
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:15,135
Too much truth Play the song comes back from break and

1526
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:19,743
Where in Texas in the satellites

1527
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,303
In Minnesota that sometimes you know there's a problem

1528
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,095
Just like that

1529
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,887
It happens

1530
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,447
Could be

1531
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,751
And attacked because he's telling too much truth

1532
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
Possible

1533
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:35,615
Alex has an article in the LA Times

1534
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,407
But he's been bringing up a little bit

1535
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,199
To-do with

1536
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,247
Ro boy Joseph McCarthy

1537
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,015
Subway

1538
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:46,111
Wednesday

1539
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,183
Really why

1540
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,975
Arone

1541
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,079
Moral one

1542
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:26,047
This article from the LA times as an opinion piece and Alex's actually lying about the main thrust of the article

1543
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:32,959
The author John moroney is arguing that there was a point to opposing communism during the Cold War but the actions of people like Joseph

1544
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,775
McCarthy gave that opposition a really bad name

1545
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:39,615
Because McCarthy was an opportunist fraud and demagogue

1546
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,687
Even in that sentence Alex reads the words

1547
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:46,527
Quote the document shouldn't be allowed to undermine the importance storical Factor this

1548
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,575
Soviet communism was a very real threat

1549
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,599
Like those words

1550
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,135
Don't make sure

1551
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:54,975
Are these lizards curious why this article is arguing that documents

1552
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:58,815
Possibly undermine that notion of his articles about McCarthy

1553
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,607
The headline literally starts

1554
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,631
Quote despite

1555
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,399
McCarthy

1556
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
Anyway

1557
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,823
Things are in this headline everything because these documents that got released

1558
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,871
2003 world record of Secrets

1559
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,431
McCarthy held with Witnesses prior to them

1560
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,455
In public appearances

1561
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,735
And he was attempting to

1562
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,759
Intimidate

1563
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:21,087
Article about the documents from the BBC

1564
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,647
Many had only tenuous connections of Comedy

1565
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,719
Through family members are book clubs were marks was red

1566
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,511
For unions with left-wing leader

1567
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:34,655
The new documents paint a picture of a senator out-of-control summoning Witnesses at short notice and browbeating them with

1568
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,191
The threat of imprisonment or public.

1569
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:36,959
Disgrace

1570
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,751
But it was noticeable that those

1571
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,823
He could not intimidate and private were often not called

1572
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,591
Then public session

1573
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,919
How shity is our government press that they're like

1574
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:49,759
These documents show Joseph McCarthy was unhinged

1575
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:56,415
I don't know if you were alive when he was arrested to do it they reveal a new level of

1576
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,183
Artifice

1577
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,487
Some crap like

1578
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:03,327
The articles that I was reading about this really laid out how different

1579
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,351
He behaved

1580
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,119
In the public

1581
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:05,887
Earrings

1582
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,167
And these private one

1583
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,191
Sure and there was

1584
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:08,959
Kind of

1585
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,239
It did almost feels like

1586
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,263
The feeling out process

1587
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,799
That's like that last sentence there

1588
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,824
Are the people that wouldn't

1589
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:18,176
Back down to him quickly were called to the public why

1590
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,200
Create the public

1591
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,504
Looking

1592
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,272
2

1593
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,040
Grandstand

1594
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:23,808
Sandwich

1595
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,344
Also from the article quote

1596
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,952
According to Senate historian David Ritchie the private hearings were more of an Inquisition

1597
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:35,328
Using circumstantial evidence hearsay and intimidation to force people to acknowledge his point of view

1598
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:40,960
Documents that came out in 2003 paint Joseph McCarthy as an out-of-control lunatic trying to run

1599
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,544
Times editorial is an attempt to remind readers that just

1600
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,080
Because McCarthy really suck

1601
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,640
That doesn't mean that Soviet communism didn't exist

1602
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,200
What do you say

1603
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,344
If you were really someone who was opposed to Communism in you'd read this article

1604
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,160
You couldn't come away from it honestly with the position that it

1605
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:00,928
Vindicated

1606
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,696
McCarthy

1607
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,488
The article literally says quote

1608
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,144
Many seem to have forgotten that the Communist party was dedicated to replacing our democratic form of government with a totalitarian state similar to

1609
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,424
Listed in the Soviet Union

1610
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:16,032
McCarthy and those who exploited his successes are largely to blame for that

1611
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:19,104
According to Moroni McCarthy is a detriment

1612
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,384
To the opposition of God

1613
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:21,920
Essentially

1614
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:26,272
The only two conclusions I can come to about Alex's coverage of this article or the following

1615
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,296
1

1616
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,600
He didn't read the article anything that actually says that

1617
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,880
McCarthy was totally cool

1618
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,440
And he's just making up with the body of a tie

1619
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:38,304
Defending McCarthyism in the tactics of witch hunting is more important

1620
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,864
The Alex and actually being opposed to Communism

1621
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,912
Which makes us anti-communism essentially

1622
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,448
Tactical as opposed to something

1623
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,216
Play some Prince

1624
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,520
Yeah I was going to make sure what I think

1625
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,080
I was going to say you just read

1626
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:56,480
Alex is also a detriment to and I

1627
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
Defend

1628
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,552
McCarthy as well

1629
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,600
Yeah it seem it seems like

1630
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,136
Nobody's like hey you know what's

1631
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,696
Great the John Birch Society fighting,

1632
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:10,048
I think they really did a great job I think they really got to the point

1633
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,584
Really hammered at all

1634
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,352
He is

1635
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,376
You know like

1636
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,400
Idealist

1637
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,472
Sickly an ideologically opposed to Communism in all this

1638
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,008
But

1639
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:19,776
If you can't

1640
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,080
Do it like McCarthy today

1641
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:25,920
It doesn't want to do it

1642
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,688
Defeat

1643
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,712
Sex trafficking

1644
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:31,296
With a daring sunlight raid

1645
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:34,880
Then I don't want to deal with that I just want to make everybody else angry about

1646
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,672
Yeah it is

1647
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:38,720
I get

1648
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,024
The science that he would not be so opposed

1649
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,048
To Communism

1650
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,632
Is his route to do it was to be

1651
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
An economic

1652
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:52,800
Professor researcher got no Fanfare and didn't get to do these

1653
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:59,200
Public hearings like McCarthy which is a show

1654
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:01,504
Out of it I don't know if your DS

1655
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,784
As interested

1656
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:09,184
This word is academic and more just s******* screaming we might have Alex on our side

1657
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,232
It is basically what we're talking about here

1658
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
Maybe there

1659
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
Impossible

1660
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:13,792
So

1661
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,888
Neri so much.

1662
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:24,800
So Alex picks another call and this guy has a terrible answer to it and that is why are we even talk

1663
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,080
Talkin about the assault weapons

1664
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,872
It doesn't even come up

1665
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:28,896
Until next year

1666
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:32,736
2004 is when it's up for re renewable or

1667
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,272
Or I let it let it laugh

1668
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,040
Sure sure

1669
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,064
And so Alex hasn't

1670
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,368
Interesting answer that I think is totally wrong

1671
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
And

1672
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,488
Reflected on on

1673
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,536
24-hours

1674
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,304
Circle B

1675
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,072
Points

1676
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:48,864
Dandapani

1677
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,912
Administration

1678
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,704
Dealing with the assault weapon

1679
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,616
With so many concerns about

1680
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:00,896
Warren so far

1681
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:03,968
The blue so far

1682
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,248
Start screen

1683
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:20,608
Probably going to be a shooting at the second Matrix opening

1684
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,144
Second Matrix movie

1685
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,424
Disturbia trigger

1686
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,192
And then

1687
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,752
They're talking about the assault weapons ban stuff

1688
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,544
So they can be right in advance

1689
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,592
Ryder this thing that didn't happen

1690
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,408
This like

1691
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,944
Is the president

1692
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,504
To the way he engages with gems

1693
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,296
Yeah in the future like that

1694
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,112
This is the pattern of thinking is there all along

1695
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,672
That almost sounds like Norm pattis

1696
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:49,024
The the color does not voice almost sounds like him

1697
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,816
I'm not sure who the phone I can

1698
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,864
Kind of hear it and I would love to

1699
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:57,984
To find out that that was actually a young Norm noise like developing their way

1700
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:02,080
Bishop for those early appearances

1701
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,360
Is either

1702
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:08,992
Like someone who legitimately doesn't really understand what Alex does or somebody who

1703
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,576
Really really wants people to think he doesn't

1704
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:16,928
I don't know it just sounds like we're in the word like it

1705
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:21,280
TV show in our eighth season and we start doing all the flashbacks and it turns out our

1706
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,048
Main characters

1707
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:28,448
All coincidentally met twenty years ago in Netherland

1708
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,240
Owen Shroyer

1709
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,032
It's true what a weird world

1710
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:34,592
So here Alex's

1711
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,872
About things that will happen

1712
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:36,640
In the future

1713
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,208
Worse than

1714
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,472
Borders

1715
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,568
Empower

1716
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,664
I'm really into

1717
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:15,296
I know this getting repetitive and these two thousand three interested in what's

1718
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,064
Going to happen

1719
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,624
I went the bathroom.

1720
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,392
Because

1721
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,696
Keep hitting this note so cancel

1722
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:24,256
He's bringing up

1723
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,328
How the benefits are in charge

1724
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:30,912
The government US government

1725
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:31,936
It's

1726
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:38,848
He's so insistent about something that we know for a fact to be 100% diamet

1727
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,128
Strictly the opposite

1728
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,408
And then he is going

1729
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,944
To eventually run into that

1730
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,712
Brick wall

1731
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,480
Driving

1732
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:47,808
It's 60 miles an hour

1733
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:48,832
Interested to see you like

1734
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,368
Does he

1735
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:55,744
The brakes

1736
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:02,400
The roadrunner

1737
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,424
Ready go through you like

1738
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:08,288
I hate I feel like that metaphorically is what he does a lot of the time

1739
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,336
Tunnel drive-thru

1740
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,640
So a caller calls and wants to know

1741
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,176
Underground prisons

1742
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:14,944
Better paying bill

1743
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,224
I wanted to ask

1744
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,248
Give you any information

1745
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,272
Underground

1746
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,040
Prison camps

1747
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:23,136
Developing because

1748
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,768
Underground

1749
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,360
Because down here in Trinidad

1750
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,152
Epic reading

1751
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,480
Japanese

1752
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,784
And it has all mine

1753
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,808
It's that they're getting

1754
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,648
I'm going to collect

1755
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,192
Sure

1756
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:11,776
Bro

1757
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:16,128
Yeah it's very cool very strange to listen to Alex be like

1758
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:22,784
The prison pipeline are the prison industrial complex is going to eventually become what it is like he's he's right on

1759
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,808
What about the Prison Complex

1760
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:30,464
To hear the crazier conspiracy theory from his collar like that weirds me out

1761
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,024
We're living in a complete topsy-turvy world

1762
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,096
Because normally nowadays he would come out with something

1763
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:39,424
Let you know this at the devil's killing everybody in there like

1764
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:45,824
Yeah but maybe the devil is just trying to raise the corporate tax rate like you know it's weird

1765
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,104
The way that goes

1766
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,408
It is true

1767
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,200
Speaking of

1768
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:53,760
Like an inversion of the present

1769
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,040
This next call

1770
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,600
Locked up

1771
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,136
If you consider Alex in the present

1772
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:01,696
I'm saying we need to

1773
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,720
Increase

1774
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:05,024
No demanding that they

1775
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,816
Bring these people to Justice

1776
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,584
The whole bush

1777
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,352
Administrator

1778
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:09,888
Nor'easter

1779
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,168
Minions the bootleg

1780
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,568
We need to get his puppet master

1781
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,272
Everybody else

1782
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:28,576
If it's good enough everybody else is probably

1783
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,600
Good enough for now

1784
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:34,720
Your

1785
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,000
Call Omar

1786
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:38,048
You're right your audio is cutting out

1787
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,864
Sure

1788
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,400
Exterminate their enemies

1789
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:47,008
And the Puppet Masters of the globalist puppet

1790
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
It's like bush

1791
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,592
And Alex pretends that he didn't hear him

1792
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,616
And goes to break

1793
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,664
When he comes back from the break

1794
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,200
He makes a point

1795
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,480
To bring this back up

1796
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,624
I heard what I heard from Target

1797
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,792
From Michigan

1798
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,056
Rent control

1799
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:05,344
I know that Alex is like

1800
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:12,512
Politically I want to kill you in the future or whatever service to the idea of

1801
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,280
Was not violent

1802
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,328
This is an instance where he

1803
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:18,912
Clearly was caught off guard by The Scholar saying we need to exterminate these folks

1804
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,704
And then went to break

1805
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,240
And decided to come back

1806
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,776
Re bring it up

1807
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:24,800
Distress

1808
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,080
Did violence

1809
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,616
He's not the way to go

1810
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,664
Haven't you heard the old adage

1811
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:32,480
If you're not a liberal at

1812
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,248
20

1813
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:36,320
You have no heart and if you don't want to exterminate the

1814
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:38,112
The port 40 you have no brain

1815
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:40,160
At everybody everybody knows this

1816
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,952
There's a real sense

1817
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,720
What's the Tiger

1818
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,488
Alex

1819
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:46,560
Might be a little bit more

1820
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:53,472
Keenly aware of how dangerous some of the people who are drawn to his worldview Maybe

1821
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,008
Possible

1822
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,288
I do I don't know though

1823
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,640
Boring as hell maybe you just doesn't have the

1824
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:04,224
I mean he's just more in a vulnerable position

1825
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,760
You know he's still got boss

1826
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:08,064
At this time he doesn't have

1827
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,088
Complete

1828
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:09,856
Autocratic

1829
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,648
Yeah well that's fair

1830
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,208
But I mean answer to some

1831
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,256
There is still someone

1832
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:17,792
Above

1833
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,840
And now there is no one

1834
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:22,400
While his dad is HR

1835
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:30,336
I don't know if his dad is still alive I think this is a psycho situation where his dad is actually

1836
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,616
In his attic

1837
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
A skeleton

1838
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:34,432
I just think it's very

1839
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,456
Interesting

1840
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,224
Then Alex

1841
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,296
It's still like obviously is bracket still incredible

1842
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:41,088
What you're doing

1843
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:42,880
Weep

1844
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,904
World of difference

1845
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,208
Taking a step back

1846
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:46,976
To calmly

1847
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,000
I am in

1848
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,536
Emphatically stress

1849
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,328
No violence

1850
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:53,376
Violence is no good it's not the answer

1851
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,656
And Alex's

1852
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,424
Long

1853
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,704
Pornographic ramps

1854
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,752
Sprite about slitting people's throats

1855
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,824
I am talking about how all the globalist are already dead

1856
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,944
And all they said that in the present-day I mean if you want

1857
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,736
Bulshit argumentative Bedford

1858
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,016
Cancel culture

1859
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,552
Look at how people act

1860
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,344
When there are possible consequences

1861
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:19,744
Look at how people act whenever you just build available

1862
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,024
Versus when you act

1863
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,072
When there are absolutely none

1864
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,096
To be done

1865
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,400
Is there

1866
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:31,008
This leaves Alex earlier

1867
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,544
Cuz do

1868
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,824
Wrestling episode

1869
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,360
He gets into a bit of a hint

1870
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,640
Space where are you

1871
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:39,456
He's saying things that a lot of it sounds

1872
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
Pretty good

1873
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,760
I don't believe him

1874
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:47,904
And obviously because I know where his Show Goes

1875
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,464
Don't think that he means it.

1876
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,176
But

1877
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,832
Go after

1878
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,440
Because

1879
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:22,720
That's the reason

1880
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,024
Yes

1881
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:29,376
It's really interesting for our today that hate Camp our their their movement

1882
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,400
Or whatever

1883
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,168
Because I mean

1884
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:37,056
I would say that that's one of the major problems with the right-wing as it exists

1885
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,080
Today

1886
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,360
Yeah

1887
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:43,200
Because hate fuels their worldview

1888
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:47,040
Allison 2003

1889
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:49,600
Even as aware of it it's not as over

1890
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:50,624
Or you just

1891
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,672
Such a wide net

1892
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,952
He doesn't even know the difference

1893
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,488
It's between hate and not

1894
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:02,656
You got this you got this headspace where you don't exterminate your enemies

1895
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,192
No that would be bad

1896
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:04,960
Wants them

1897
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:08,544
Sure back off globe

1898
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,840
I want to give you some really good advice

1899
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,360
Has an interview

1900
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:10,752
So much trouble Alex has good reviews and people coughing

1901
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:12,288
Don't sign it worth

1902
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:14,592
Is there time to argue with him I guess

1903
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,128
Need to back off

1904
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,408
Any other good news

1905
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,200
I've got some advice

1906
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,224
It's for Alex

1907
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,600
Why Woody

1908
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,392
Or something

1909
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,976
If the

1910
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,024
Is a globalist when they see week

1911
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,560
Interstate acting when they see

1912
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,864
Dominus they move forward

1913
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:39,168
The preceding eight years after this

1914
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,448
Keep it Alex

1915
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:42,496
And all of his friends are dumb and weak

1916
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,520
Yeah it's correct

1917
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,128
Stop everything exactly what they prove

1918
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:48,896
That's it

1919
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,456
In two

1920
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,760
3 turns out there's not many global

1921
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,824
Wholesomeness

1922
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,896
Also, I would describe his show in the present day

1923
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,688
Wholesome wholesome

1924
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:59,040
The buttercream gang

1925
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:02,368
Alex

1926
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:07,232
Harrison whites are the best Smith

1927
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:09,536
I think of the buttercream gang

1928
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:13,376
Yeah either this was just really weird

1929
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:15,424
Cuz it was it's filling time

1930
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,544
More last night about how like

1931
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,360
We got to be peaceful we can't be hateful

1932
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:26,688
Wilshire the globalist are in trouble cuz we're so popular

1933
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:29,760
And you got to be strong and we believe in

1934
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,552
Goodness

1935
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,624
Seems to be in respond

1936
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,440
Monster that caller bring up extermination of the enemy

1937
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,720
It does seem like it's

1938
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:39,744
Genuine to

1939
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,536
I wonder if I mean

1940
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,328
I wonder if it's also in part

1941
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:49,728
Because Alex is probably pretty excited about getting these DJs on and it shouldn't go well sure I wonder if that really

1942
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,776
Little bit

1943
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,800
Since we know that

1944
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,080
Generally speaking

1945
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:56,896
The what comes out of his mouth is the result of how he's feeling

1946
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:59,200
As opposed to what's going on

1947
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,552
Wasn't something

1948
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:08,416
To build on at all and he was going to pretend that interview never happened

1949
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:11,744
Mulligan or whatever

1950
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,280
Thunder

1951
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:18,144
What are the things we discovered

1952
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,704
. of time that we've looks

1953
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,472
Through

1954
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,240
At least the last

1955
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:27,360
Few years you are going back into 2015 right even prior to Trump's candidacy

1956
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:28,896
Alex loves poop

1957
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,944
True and Russia

1958
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:31,968
Love them

1959
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:38,624
Big strong man I think the song I'm a horse without a shirt on

1960
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,184
Yeah there's a little farther back

1961
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,232
That was

1962
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,352
Here's 2003

1963
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:12,672
Figure that out

1964
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:13,952
In the present day

1965
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:15,232
Alex does not believe

1966
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,512
Oh no absolute

1967
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:22,656
Does not believe that Putin was behind the bombings they were blamed on the Chechen Rebels

1968
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,424
Expedient

1969
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,192
Truth

1970
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:30,848
I think there is something interesting about this is

1971
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:33,920
When was the LIE

1972
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:39,296
Was he lying about there being a fact or is he lying now

1973
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,088
Yeah

1974
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,880
Or does he just

1975
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:43,904
Not care

1976
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,464
Yeah I mean I I think

1977
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:51,584
To a certain extent like when you think about Ally you do think about somebody

1978
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:54,656
With malicious intent or at the very least like

1979
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:57,472
Desire to hide information or something like that

1980
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:00,800
And to me what I'm seeing from all of this

1981
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:02,080
Totality now is

1982
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,384
The man who just doesn't give a

1983
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,944
F*** if it's true or not or whatever

1984
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,712
He's not

1985
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:09,760
Lying he's just he just doesn't care

1986
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:10,784
You know he's

1987
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,344
He's he's just beyond lying or not lying

1988
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,696
He's just making up his own reality that he exists in from a moment-to-moment

1989
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:22,048
Point of view and there's some things that seem pretty consistently import

1990
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:24,096
Like him being left alone

1991
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,120
Christian

1992
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,912
Supremacy whiteness

1993
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:27,680
Spell rotten

1994
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,984
And then he's figured out some

1995
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,032
Routines that work

1996
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:34,592
Pretty well-liked the vaccine live

1997
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,128
Love you too see him doing

1998
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:37,408
Consistently

1999
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,992
Another caller

2000
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,016
Jesus

2001
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,552
I just keep this in because I think

2002
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,576
Make sidewalk look like

2003
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,768
I can't,

2004
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,680
Yeah I know but

2005
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,056
What

2006
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:11,456
Wow that is that is pre-staging his televangelism right then

2007
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:17,856
Your home sell your home to give it to me

2008
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:24,256
Go to your neighbor to go get money to buy a second VCR so you can make copies of my

2009
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:28,096
My movies which will Free Press

2010
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:28,864
Wow

2011
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,448
That's real.

2012
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,496
Yeah I can't I can't imagine

2013
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:35,264
The

2014
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,568
The level of narcissistic you have

2015
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:38,336
CB2

2016
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,384
Have multiple follow-up

2017
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:44,480
When someone's explaining why they can't Robbie your tapes

2018
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:45,760
Sales

2019
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,296
You know it that's at like

2020
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:53,440
Bill

2021
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:56,512
Back when I worked in telemarketing

2022
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:59,072
You know if your calls were monitored

2023
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:02,144
But you didn't trouble if you have two bottles

2024
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,960
Exactly what Alex was doing there but

2025
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,496
It's not it's not sales

2026
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,520
Talking to a

2027
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,360
Bulshit

2028
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:13,408
31 West whip Year from May 9th

2029
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,224
Alex

2030
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,760
About his enemies

2031
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,040
There's no mention of the day

2032
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:45,920
Now that's newworldorder bankers

2033
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:48,992
I mean

2034
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:57,440
Multiple times at least 2 days

2035
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:01,536
Clearly expresses who he feels he's up again

2036
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:05,888
And it's all good rest real concerns if it's not an elaborate

2037
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,680
Conspiracy of dimensions

2038
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:14,080
It's not no it's not metaphysical dreams when he was 10 nothing

2039
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
Oh no

2040
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:16,384
And I mean like

2041
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,152
This doesn't

2042
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:20,224
Prove that he never talks about any of this stuff I like

2043
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,760
A lot of the themes

2044
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:22,784
That you would think

2045
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,320
Might have been important

2046
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:27,136
Yeah are not important if they normally come up

2047
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:30,208
Now if you brings up something

2048
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,488
Similar to these topic

2049
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:37,888
There's always that personal element of like you know like none of that none of that

2050
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,424
No talk about

2051
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,192
Do you

2052
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,472
No talk about

2053
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:44,032

2055
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,640
Are you guys mentioned Bill Gates or what why

2056
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,688
It isn't in there with The Rock

2057
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:52,480
Child's in the Bilderberg

2058
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:55,552
Mention of Bill Gates

2059
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,600
Of course he's been relevant for a long time in Atlanta

2060
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:01,696
I'll take that because it works

2061
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,744
Counter to his political positions of

2062
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,512
Doing everything

2063
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,792
You can't hurt the developing world

2064
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:07,584
Anyway

2065
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:11,936
I thought you enjoyed a little bit of this

2066
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,216
Inasmuch as

2067
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:13,984
You know

2068
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,032

Chickadee

2070
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:22,432
I think the

2071
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,456
Certainly

2072
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:25,504
I don't even want to know what Alex is doing

2073
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,272
In present day

2074
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,832

Conflicted about whether or not

2078
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:43,424
To cover present day

2079
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:49,824
Anyway whatever whatever ends up happening will be back

2080
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,128
