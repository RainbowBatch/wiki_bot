1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,544
Beverages

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,592
Don't talk a little bit about Alex

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
In

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,640
Deed we are

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:23,040
Did you say in because you're subtly trying to buzz varkey or show tonight in Indiana the people who are listening to this tomorrow

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,864
Mishawaka

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,264
What time machine come check out Jordan in Indiana last night

9
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:52,736
Go to better Java plug-in yourself

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
I think it's probably a smart I probably enough show cover

11
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,000
Conversation

12
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,472
A little bit disappointing cuz they're called bomb

13
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,520
And all they do is Fizz a little bit

14
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
Find a display

15
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,176
What you mean I mean

16
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,968
Experience out of it

17
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
I want I want

18
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
Or something I don't know

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,648
Bath salts for me are very like

20
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,512
But it's a part of my

21
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Brains

22
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Still loved

23
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
New AG b*******

24
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,144
It's something I really value

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,728
Which store do I go to

26
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,544
There's

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,944
The one I bought was from

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
I know that there's no magic

29
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,368
But I'll be damned if I'm not going to go by

30
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
The Calgon brand

31
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
Even though I have

32
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,792
Calgon bath salts in my bathroom right now

33
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:22,080
Just people who make this possible

34
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,856
Maria

35
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,184

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,744

37
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,072

00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,144
Jackass so much

39
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm a policy wonk very popular with Jack

40
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
We're trying to fill up our quota

41
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
I'm a policy wonk

42
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
So Rachel

43
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
Thank you so much

44
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
Democrat

45
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
What's the business

46
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,240
Heroin

47
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,848
Freakishly large

48
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:34,016
Thank you so much Rachel

49
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:39,392
It's for these guys what they do you do that website says sports show

50
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,304
Now Jordan today we call a pickle Barrel

51
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,144
I do or I did yesterday when I was preparing myself.

52
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
We had it weird weird situation original coming up with episode to do and the time frame of the word

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Really f****** in

54
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
European elections

55
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,272
All his boy faraj

56
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,600
Buckwild on food of course

57
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
Call Alex's other friends lost

58
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
All the people who will show up on Alex's show the Tommy Robinson

59
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,399
I guess the Sargon

60
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
I don't know if he's ever come on out

61
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
What's the show but he also lost

62
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,567
So I thought like for sure Mondays show is going to

63
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
Pretty Buckwild

64
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
Turned it on

65
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
It was was trash

66
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,575
I don't know why but Owen Shroyer was co-hosting the entire show

67
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
Tiger show

68
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,207
My theory was that they thought he alternated babysitter cuz it was Memorial Day

69
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,095
Okay that was kind of weird

70
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Doesn't seem drunk

71
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
You just seems kind of

72
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,287
Present-day Alex there's nothing

73
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
On hand underneath his death

74
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015
So the first half-hour was kind of just

75
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Bacon

76
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
For money it was all just

77
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Like seriously

78
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
Severe

79
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
Plug

80
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
Yeah

81
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
I'm not just saying it

82
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
Happening it was a

83
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Attracted

84
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,119
Commercial

85
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,191
Based on the premise of the European elections

86
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,031
And how can over the world

87
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Clothes of Alex

88
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,711
Entirely Infowars as Nigel farage is jeavons

89
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
Alex is responsible for UK

90
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Becoming a viable party

91
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
That should be

92
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,159
Punishable by

93
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:53,279
I think 20 25 to life

94
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
But what

95
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
So Alex

96
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
Construction

97
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,215
Nationalism

98
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,055
Kind of rambling nonsense

99
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
Not really care all that much there's no real good analysis

100
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
There's no good point

101
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,943
It just sort of fatalistic in like

102
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
Trump is going to drive people for treason

103
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
Laps around

104
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
South Verde

105
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Kind of talked about already

106
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Alright it's

107
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
Where is Wednesday

108
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
Wacky Wednesday

109
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Let's get into it

110
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
Someone over Project Camelot there's nothing there

111
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
Trash

112
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
Wall-to-wall discussion

113
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:40,383
Everybody lady I don't care get stop it

114
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
Contacts

115
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
Alright maybe Dave daubenmire

116
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
3 minutes into a video like

117
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,623
Get out I already understand you

118
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
This is

119
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,231
This is garbage you know what I just remembered

120
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,839
Larry Nichols has a YouTube channel where you started recording things

121
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
Larry Nichols has a YouTube channel

122
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
Cowboy

123
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:10,335
So maybe we should start covering Larry Nichols weird YouTube videos

124
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
Like 30 minutes

125
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
Dispatches

126
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,455
Information brakes sure

127
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
Are so boring

128
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,159
Not surprising cannot imagine how terrible it is to listen to

129
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
Half hour of Larry talking

130
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
Straight I can we talk to him

131
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:33,375
Without anybody else there Larry is

132
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
Listen to

133
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,959
Okay so what

134
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
Although I will tell you this

135
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,311
Because I went through his YouTube channel

136
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
I can tell you two things

137
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
1

138
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Larry doesn't believe in qanon

139
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
Larry Nichols recorded an album

140
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:02,047
I just took a drink that was a very close

141
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,631
Song covers

142
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,735
This is not that terrible

143
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:44,287
Japan time

144
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
50/50 serviceable

145
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,919
Call Larry Nichols

146
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:00,319
That was long but me I needed us to get to Larry McCoy

147
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
That was very that was the cherry on top

148
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
You can go find B online

149
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
If you need more of that Larry

150
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,775
Fairly recently recently

151
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Yeah

152
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Kohl's

153
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
To question his voice

154
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
You know what I mean like

155
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Red rose

156
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,487
I know the people speaking and singing voices can be pretty markedly different but I don't think

157
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
I think that's

158
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Absurd

159
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Dammit

160
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
To his vocal cords

161
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
You wouldn't be able to sing

162
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Things like that I don't say

163
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
Very much like a

164
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,199
Disney cartoon from the 90s

165
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,599
It's the speaking voice in the singing voices all the sudden you're like a different person entirely

166
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Exactly

167
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
Yeah Christina Aguilera is singing

168
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,999
I don't know how many points

169
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Butts

170
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
I don't think that Larry has the right

171
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
2

172
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Sal covers of the song

173
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
Like did you get the Eagles to let him sing Desperado of course

174
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:31,455
I certainly don't have the time or interest in doing this but

175
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,271
Glenn Frey if you're listening

176
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,903
Larry Thiessen

177
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
Larry

178
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
If he's not paying your royalties

179
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Get down there take care of business

180
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
So we can't listen to Larry Nichols

181
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,871
What's a while we going to do I was really up against

182
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
I couldn't figure out what

183
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,455
What to do if

184
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Alright

185
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
With Project Camelot stuff

186
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
It basically becomes

187
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Like

188
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Let's

189
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,463
It's always exciting when there's new information about Margaret

190
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
Never she goes back to the prison

191
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
It's always fun

192
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Steward of morph

193
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,167
Because of Kevin Moore making this documentary

194
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
About Mark Richards

195
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
And him having this

196
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
Feud with Carrie

197
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
It became become more

198
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
We covered him

199
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
Because of his

200
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Coverage

201
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,295
Psychic

202
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Quote let's

203
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
And I found

204
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Completely insane

205
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,631
Does involve Kerry Cassidy out-of-context drop from

206
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Today Show

Splash

208
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,319
What we got going on today is

209
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Kevin Borg

210
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
Guys making a documentary about Mark Richards

211
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
2

212
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Kerry Cassidy believes

213
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,327
Is whistleblower

214
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,887
But it's actually a murderer

215
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
Yeah, con man and

216
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,055
Is on another show

217
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,663
He is on a show called freedom of Joyce

218
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Who runs this show

219
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,135
It's a little

220
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
Answer sheet

221
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Kevin Moore on as a guest

222
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Discuss

223
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
He's documentary about Market

224
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,679
But over the course of it you might

225
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Joyce

226
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Doesn't like

227
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
Cassidy

228
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,895
It is excited about the idea

229
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,687
Maybe 3rd or 4th

230
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
Most important

231
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
In terms of the trends

232
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
Some sort of saying hello

233
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Unpleasantries

234
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:25,535
On YouTube

235
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,119
Is Kevin Daniels

236
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,727
Welcome to the show today thank you thank you so much for having me on

237
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
Glad to see you in person

238
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,871
Yeah I know we've talked a little bit on the telephone

239
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,991
Person you'll notice that she says

240
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:51,647
You're listening on YouTube and hopefully literally just wrote hopefully it will

241
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,975
What is hopefully

242
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Automatic

243
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
No

244
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,631
It indicates to me that the only place she knows this is going to be is on her YouTube

245
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Challenge

246
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
So important to remember for later

247
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:11,359
As it is now I believe she met has an association with American Freedom radio

248
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Which is better

249
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Second network of

250
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Chose

251
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,623
Shows of people who have like snowball bike talk about Liberty

252
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,207
So that's that's the sort of

253
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
Thought in the sex club

254
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Kevin

255
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
Gets into some of the ideas of

256
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
The documentary

257
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
You know why

258
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
It's offensive

259
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Carrie believes Margaret

260
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Cuz he doesn't get it

261
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:52,063
36 years for the murder of his friends Richard Baldwin Wichita

262
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:58,463
Richard Alexandra Baldwin along with his crime partner Crossing river

263
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Considered that carry doesn't that

264
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,519
Yeah the people that she has as longtime gas on her show I mean

265
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,103
Like yourself and myself maybe you know someone's coming on for an hour

266
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,503
What wedding are we going to do you know what I mean

267
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
Maybe we'll pick him up in the interview

268
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Complete

269
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,975
You know where to get the airspace to the people weapon into talk about that was

270
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:37,119
Just remember that he's on his show before he's had Joanne

271
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,727
So many other f****** weirdos Paul Craig Roberts

272
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
Jerome corsi

273
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
Never heard of before their names

274
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
I just listed them off

275
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:56,063
Universe

276
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,487
Wow wow of the game is not wedding people because if you

277
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,559
Start a f****** game is busted

278
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,471
Kevin borseth the he runs a sex shop in Amsterdam

279
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,079
He runs a f****** psychic hotline are you kidding me

280
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
Let him the way that we can

281
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,783
Because the game is up then

282
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,719
I think they like to pretend that they are like with a Google search

283
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,303
It's it's nonsensical but everyone knows better than to

284
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
To poke

285
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
Each other in the

286
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
The places where the

287
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,471
They themselves are vulnerable

288
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
Because

289
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Target glasses

290
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Collaborative

291
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
It's like a Mexican standoff

292
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,271
Yeah you know it's just okay I'll blow up your business if you blow up mine

293
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
No one's going to do that

294
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,743
Stop self-destruction

295
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
Basically pointed at each other's heads at all times

296
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,631
Hey you f*** this up for any of us

297
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
You f*** it up

298
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,959
For all of us

299
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Consider really

300
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Almost universe

301
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Parcel Within

302
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Paranoid

303
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Truth

304
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Communities

305
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
Is attacking people who have left

306
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Yeah you know

307
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,295
I was inside the

308
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,111
Toxic and awful

309
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,183
F****** flip by the CIA

310
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
Or they make a personal attack

311
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,279
That has nothing to do with their

312
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Cam lights

313
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,119
He on the sex shop what is it which isn't a personal attack

314
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
But it is

315
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Smear the guy

316
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:54,079
Heat interview

317
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
From primary school

318
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
He was thinking

319
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Sing about

320
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
Setting up a sex toy shop

321
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
In Amsterdam

322
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,759
But then decided to go to university

323
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Instead

324
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,831
So you never actually followed through

325
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
But there are like

326
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
That would lead one to believe it

327
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Still an actual

328
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
Osoto

329
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Show Business

330
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,887
No it'll

331
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:22,751
About his own life over Carey

332
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
Covering up a

333
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,127
Sex toy shop that you're admitting

334
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
We're going to start

335
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:37,087
There's no there's no strap

336
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,719
In this next clip I think we'd get what I'm going to

337
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Described as

338
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Kevin Moore

339
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,119
And he uses a buzzword that is

340
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Tremendously

341
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Important

342
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
And it gets thrown around

343
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
These worlds

344
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
What does Worlds

345
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
Pearl Harbor

346
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,847
No

347
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,575
The documentary to be at the surname documentary

348
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,671
I want to go to a community V Community the

349
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,767
All since 2008 when I first

350
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,119
Took out radio broadcasting at Glamorgan University in Wales

351
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
Discernment

352
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,495
Discernment is a buzzword with these

353
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,287
What is what do they use

354
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,383
I mean I think it means the same thing that you are you are I would think it means

355
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
The ability to tell

356
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
Truth from fiction

357
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
Yeah that's what you do Discerning the reality of like you bring something to me and I use my discernment

358
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Tell if

359
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
I believe you are

360
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:51,327
Are incapable of even allowed to use their version of discernment

361
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
Based on subjectivity

362
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,983
What's true

363
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,079
That's your discernment as a really don't make sense

364
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Information

365
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
Empirical evidence

366
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,271
Directors not caring for chocolate I know that

367
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,807
That doesn't resonate with me

368
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,855
It doesn't resume

369
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,184
Chocolate

370
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
Okay

371
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
I like that

372
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,352
Where are they doing this interview

373
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,400
What is going on

374
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
I don't know

375
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,448
It is

376
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,824
I think it might be

377
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,640
In a library

378
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
I think it might be

379
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
Library

380
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
Shushing people

381
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
I don't know

382
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,696
If you think anything goes in the library now

383
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,024
Everybody in the library's just stoked that libraries are still at

384
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,680
Yeah you'll put up with a lot more these days it'll

385
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
Library

386
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
I'm not sure

387
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,568
I couldn't tell from the video where it was taken

388
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
In place but it looks like a room

389
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
Corner of a public building

390
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
A hundred percent

391
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
Could be a library

392
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
Not a private

393
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
They couldn't

394
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
The studio space

395
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Cuz Larry was

396
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
Regarding follow up

397
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,816
Next one

398
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
The Pendragon

399
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,192
Part of Mark Richards

400
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Murder

401
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Which if you are

402
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
You haven't listened to all of their apps

403
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
We've done it

404
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
Mark Ritchie

405
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
Plan to turn Marin County

406
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
Into his own kingdom

407
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
Styled after Camelot

408
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,528
Literally would have worked for those meddling kids

409
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:52,672
Murdering Kids Laser

410
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
Yeah there's a problem

411
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
So he learned about that

412
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
He's telling about his learning

413
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
And how's that was

414
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,192
The time

415
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,032
Recording a documentary on channeling to get to be released

416
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
Again not documentary movie

417
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,432
My journey and just sending out on this documentary

418
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,832
So I get that and he shows us things we were coding interview together and I technically to the way back to the UK

419
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:25,184
This is just not right on this guy

420
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,488
So he's talking about getting

421
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:33,376
Contacted by someone doing his interview with like a couple years after

422
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Interview with Joanne

423
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,728
Guy gets in contact with him is like a man

424
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
This is f****** nonsense

425
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Nation about the

426
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
The trial

427
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
Press clippings

428
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,200
What have you

429
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
Bet her very well

430
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,784
OU

431
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Cousins

432
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,928
Almost almost

433
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
This is storico

434
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,840
Why isn't this a catfish Channel

435
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
So

436
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
Bipolar

437
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,288
We play about the the

438
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,104
Audio recording that we did was I now because

439
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,432
Austin mission to record a conversation

440
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,784
I don't release again if you want to put it in the show we can play it right now okay

441
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
So

442
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
What follows

443
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,696
The half-hour recorded conversations oh yes

444
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,304
What are calling Kerry Cassidy

445
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,864
And that is what we're going to look at 2

446
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
They played the whole thing

447
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Can't be real

448
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
It is

449
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,056
It's far more interesting

450
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,528
Want to say before we get going

451
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
Up to a point

452
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,160
I'm totally on Carrie's side in this phone call

453
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,720
Totally right

454
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,840
About a number of

455
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
There's a social dynamic

456
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:20,128
Between her and Kevin Moore even about Market

457
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
That she's on the right side of

458
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
I think

459
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
And we'll get into that as it goes along

460
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
Here is from the call

461
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
This information

462
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
About

463
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
Camelot

464
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Pendragon

465
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,816
Him but it's not new information to

466
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
Scary but he doesn't

467
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,144
You seem to know that

468
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,544
He doesn't realize that Carrie knows all this s*** just doesn't care so there's that there's a weird dynamic it play there

469
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,896
Emailed him out-of-the-blue contacting him

470
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,920
Being like hey

471
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,968
This guy is evil and

472
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,760
No one ever contacted

473
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
Larry Carey

474
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
Who is

475
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,648
Years of her life of course

476
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:08,000
Either thinks that or using the appearance of him

477
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,792
Thinking that as cover for trying

478
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
Cover

479
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Either way it's sort of patronizing

480
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,728
Consulting

481
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,008
Yeah he's an ass

482
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,056
It does seem real assholes

483
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,128
We get watermelon to reach it for

484
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,664
Was

485
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,712
Just to let you know about

486
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,528
Chapel run into

487
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,600
When I was over in San Francisco so

488
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,904
I was over at contact in the desert

489
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,280
Which I just released my interview with yourself

490
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,680
When I was at contact the night then I would spend this this this chat that

491
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:54,592
This kept getting contact with a spine priority oh but by the phone I've been seeing once we swap numbers and everything else

492
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,152
The tell me a story about Mark this

493
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:01,760
This this this Chapman to speak to him ready

494
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Because

495
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:07,392
I didn't want anything to do with 1800 Enderman I said I put my interview with you out

496
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
And it it really hot

497
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
You know it's really not

498
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
Not my business

499
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
But

500
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,656
Doing this

501
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
One thing is showing me is that

502
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,008
Showing

503
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,616
I've had to show the sermon to student in the bedroom

504
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,968
Reply to that then

505
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,016
Maybe I should apply to this other

506
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,320
This UFO Scott.

507
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,648
That raises the question

508
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,232
Why did you apply discernment in your career

509
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
Beforehand

510
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,072
Sloppy

511
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,728
We all grow and change get a word of day calendar and discernment is on I don't know May 27th

512
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,640
Everydays is remember

513
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
So

514
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,504
I thought about it and I thought look on in

515
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
I'll speak to him

516
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
It is

517
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,904
We have to say this this this guy

518
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,976
New nudes

519
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Stung

520
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,864
I got kobold when the guy that was this guy that was murdered

521
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
In

522
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,496
Annnnd in the case of my riches

523
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,104
He knew the song

524
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
But anyway

525
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:37,504
Please tell me the story over the phone and he sends me a couple of links

526
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,184
It was interesting what was in the links had to say I never come across the meadow before I thought montrichard

527
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,464
Innocent

528
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
Did you know what I mean

529
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
From YouTube

530
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
As well

531
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,984
You thought it was what I was when I watched it

532
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:07,712
Expect a more passive aggressive speaker

533
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,368
What the f*** are you talking about you talked to a guy

534
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
To sum that up in like 5

535
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,096
Ya knows the victims

536
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,752
Information that I found really troubling would you like to hear more about it

537
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,032
Now that is red

538
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:41,248
I got in touch with the guy on the phone numbers and when I talk to him

539
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,808
Nobody talk to me

540
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,136
Pieces of paper that's passive-aggressive

541
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:52,512
Let's

542
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
Invader information

543
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
Sew-ins

544
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Eclipse

545
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,632
He gets to the

546
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,960
Actual Dragon of it all

547
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,288
Sheridan care

548
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
At all

549
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,616
It's admire this response

550
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,224
It was

551
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,320
Because this guy was a complete nutcase Mark was in some respects

552
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344
Brood

553
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
Set this

554
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,720
Disney in the Golden Gate area

555
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,536
I know it sounds crazy to you but

556
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:29,376
Again reading the court document

557
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,424
The case when I've done it a lot of invest

558
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Navigation

559
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,520
Right

560
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
And he wasn't

561
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:45,248
But it's you know I understand that perspective out there and I understand the links in the things you read

562
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
So

563
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
What is the

564
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
You know I guess

565
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,136
Cut to the chase

566
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,720
I don't have a lot of time I'm packing

567
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
So if you could

568
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,584
What new information was this person trying to revive

569
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:04,704
I never knew about that if you knew about these links before I don't think

570
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
That's not

571
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,360
Like out there is those these things are out there and people can just find a most people go along with the

572
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,968
The story that you accept that that mutt reaches telling you

573
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,112
22 lynxville 23 links

574
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:26,976
I don't think most people doing the just take it a tattoo

575
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
That happens

576
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
With everything I got

577
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
Celtic.

578
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,168
Investigate what they take

579
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
To put it

580
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
Essential Google

581
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:44,128
I was one of those people that went

582
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
Cuz your f******

583
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,552
Stupid that's why I just don't look into them at all yet

584
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,856
View myself as a pillar of truth I don't know why

585
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,720
Responsibility tell every angle

586
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:03,328
Of course I got a hundred percent disagree with what Carrie believes

587
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
There's probably

588
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:11,776
Turtles about the social

589
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,592
Dick

590
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
That's not my job

591
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
I'm running

592
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,296
A f****** secret space program media operation

593
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,600
It's not in my interest

594
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:32,256
To try and debunked my own guess other people want to do that information is out

595
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,816
Why would I do wreck them to it

596
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:38,400
I know about all that stuff I've chosen not to believe it

597
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,448
F*** is wrong with you a******

598
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,408
Oh I'm just one of those people who would never put it into a cursory Google search

599
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,968
Is a dam

600
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:58,368
Anything to your Covington Mark Richards

601
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,184
Information without

602
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,048
Like when he had a joke

603
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,888
Press clippings available all over the internet

604
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,216
What I get from

605
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,800
I mean

606
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,152
At a certain point I think it goes bad for Carrie

607
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,224
Up to this point in the beginning of it

608
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,576
If she just hung up I would been like Kevin you shouldn't put that out

609
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,416
Has a space

610
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
And she's protecting her

611
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Like

612
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,584
From the first question that's like the first question

613
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
Which

614
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
Can't believe that it took

615
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,216
7 minutes

616
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
He's a little bit of

617
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,800
I don't know how to describe it is just a bad talker

618
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
I mean

619
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
Passive aggressive question

620
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
That is clearly a question

621
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,200
That is an accusation

622
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
Hey

623
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:03,392
You don't know about this that your guys and Uncle that's the first knows that she doesn't

624
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,720
Covering this up

625
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,048
Will be covering it up but it's not like

626
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,096
She has the ability to

627
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,424
Actually coveranything

628
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
Google search

629
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,032
So

630
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,848
Little bit more

631
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
Contentious

632
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,664
Still on Carrie's side

633
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,968
He was still out there anyway

634
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,784
In the original court case

635
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
No he had to

636
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,416
Put this new

637
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,608
Agency operation

638
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,400
And that

639
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,192
Details a two-sided

640
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
What is that worth

641
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
The truth

642
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,872
Opposite was true have you considered that

643
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
Both sides

644
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
The story

645
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
You know but

646
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
What I'm saying I'm

647
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
Kevin I'm trying to

648
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
Cut to the chase here

649
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:08,928
Are you bringing me new information are you just saying go look at those links I've already done that so this

650
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
That would be the end of the

651
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
This conversation

652
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
If you have new information

653
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
If that guy has new information

654
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,584
Then what is the new information

655
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:20,192
Well I didn't know you knew about that so you know about those links right

656
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,752
Investigative reporter

657
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,824
You know I'm interviewing some guy eight times I go to the

658
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
I mean give me a little credit

659
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
You know

660
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,968
I do investigate my my soul

661
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:38,112
People in their source is excetera so you know I do I find necessary

662
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,648
And yes of course I've been missed

663
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:47,072
I think you and I would probably have a different definition of due diligence that's necessary

664
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:52,704
But whatever he's doing is just rude well what are you doing is also tested

665
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
Doesn't

666
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
Do any investigative

667
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
Like if he's if he's asked

668
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,408
Her that question

669
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
Assume

670
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
That she would know that's that

671
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
But she wouldn't have looked in

672
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
2m at all

673
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
Meaning that he assumes that

674
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
Because he does

675
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
Or he's trying to

676
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
To pass off

677
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,440
The responsibility

678
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
His guests

679
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,256
His own preparation

680
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,840
Like ideas

681
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
It's on her to have researched

682
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Husband

683
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
So if she's coming on

684
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,752
When she's wrong that I'm not really wrong

685
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,080
Haha carry-on it whatever she's saying

686
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,920
She has the responsibility of figuring out with her cats are legitimate or not

687
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,480
If that's not good enough

688
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,528
So that's almost cowardly and compass

689
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,112
I would I would describe things I have

690
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,744
So I can try to get down to business

691
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
You got any new information

692
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
Because

693
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,376
This is old

694
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,704
Making a call to me York

695
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
Claiming this guy calls

696
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
To direct you

697
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
You could do on your own

698
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,152
That you know

699
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:09,248
Regular person can just do

700
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
No

701
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,552
Any of them

702
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,600
So it's me with new information

703
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
I do too

704
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:22,816
You're already know and care about

705
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,192
I'm really on

706
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
To be trying to

707
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:41,504
Conversation because it has run its course this guy called me he has this information that I found

708
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Tubi

709
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
New

710
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,648
I thought it was interesting and added a layer to this story that you're

711
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,720
Not covering on your show

712
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,768
Bulshit

713
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:59,168
That's why I think Carrie get

714
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,984
Savely frustrated with it

715
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,848
Crosses into like

716
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
It sucks

717
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,456
I do feel like there's

718
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,992
Bienville

719
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,016
Poorly

720
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:19,904
But it comes from a frustration that is very understandable and she's not wrong

721
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,928
Social

722
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,512
F***** up a sphere reminds me so much of

723
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,912
The energy vampire from what we do in the shadows FX

724
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,448
The office just going in there just

725
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,008
And Iyaz solo

726
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Have you ever

727
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,824
That

728
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
The show I can't

729
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
The name of

730
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
Show

731
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
It's the one that

732
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Have you ever seen

733
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,064
TV show

734
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
The TV show that your breath

735
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
Or the character is

736
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,696
Okay well let me talk about it

737
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,560
Hang up

738
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,120
Chicago to Barcelona

739
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Escape

740
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:09,056
Because Kevin Love

741
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,456
He carries has to get into Attack Mode

742
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:20,832
The first thing she does is suggest this guy contact

743
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,112
Is up to no good

744
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:26,464
I guess what you're doing is you're letting me know that

745
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Dunning interview

746
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,512
With some guy

747
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,328
New the son of the guy that was murdered

748
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,352
Sakura

749
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Exactly who it was

750
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,520
So he's not exactly

751
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
That clue

752
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
Forward years later

753
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
To set to suddenly

754
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
Try to contact you

755
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:53,856
Trusting that is trying to contact you and Joanne

756
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,928
So then you have to ask yourself is Disgaea paid in

757
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,536
Informant is he working for the CIA

758
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,608
Reasons a person comes forward in this way

759
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,680
To try to bring a journalist such as yourself

760
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:14,080
Into one direction or another you can believe him and it's fine if you did an interview

761
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,360
Thanks for letting me know if

762
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
Not that it matters

763
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Too terribly much

764
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:22,528
But you know if you think I'm going to change my point of view because this guy suddenly

765
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,928
Coming forward to say absolutely 30 years

766
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,464
Absolutely

767
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,096
You cannot just tell the story just the one person to Angela

768
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,376
So I

769
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,936
Even though that's a little bit stupid

770
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
The CIA

771
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,568
It's a little bit overly paranoid

772
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,360
At the same time

773
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:53,760
Coming in with a position of like kind of Desire

774
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
To convince

775
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
Really of her

776
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,856
Correctness in the position

777
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,184
Barcelona

778
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,560
Yeah I find the only issue being that she called him a journal

779
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
That's problem

780
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
He's still

781
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,216
She's really wrong

782
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:17,056
Yeah but who cares she doesn't care if

783
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
If Kevin believes

784
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,640
This guy who contacted or I don't particularly care

785
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
She decides to believe

786
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,200
Mark Richard

787
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,296
Yeah this phone call should be over unless he unless he's got

788
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,600
Okay cool

789
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Out-of-the-way

790
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,416
What exactly was Mark Richard

791
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
It's doing at this

792
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:39,584
Tell me about that later on

793
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,632
People that that okay

794
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
Click

795
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,472
So instead of that resolution

796
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
The call

797
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
Kevin

798
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,544
Sammer's

799
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,848
Kerry Getz

800
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
Kevin because of

801
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,807
Sky had nothing new to add

802
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,903
Have you ever done that

803
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
You know what I mean when I say a false flag

804
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,631
Okay have you ever tried to investigate

805
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
Will it let me ask you this

806
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,215
Would you put these links

807
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
In a new videos

808
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
Easy face

809
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
I'll check

810
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,407
But I do I've known

811
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:31,807
Investigate

812
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Was Kevin Democritus

813
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
Stuff like you and

814
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:38,463
You knew about police before you knew about the 23

815
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,863
3 + linxonline anyway or what

816
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,191
Supposing that

817
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:53,055
No actually that's not that's not what my job is I mean everyone

818
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,359
Does what they want to do about these things

819
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
My job is

820
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,431
Discussions are not about

821
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:02,271
A murder for which he was framed over 30 years ago

822
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,319
I mean she's wrong

823
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
Obviously

824
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,135
But it isn't her job

825
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:15,071
Is b*******

826
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:20,191
That's what exactly it's it's it's

827
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:24,543
Such a hypocritical expectations of another conversation

828
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,895
I wish they would all get right with the

829
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,455
The story or whatever nice

830
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
If everybody had a

831
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,271
The more rigid

832
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,343
Intellectual honesty

833
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,183
I would love it if

834
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,743
The access but she has to Mark Richards

835
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,791
Actually took the story seriously

836
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
And

837
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
You're told the fullness

838
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:57,823
I don't know what her job actually it's entertaining

839
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,943
The only thing about it at all is people thinking it's real

840
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,527
There's going to be people who believe crazy

841
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
Baby stuff is real all the

842
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
She's just

843
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,951
You get one in the large family of people who are

844
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:23,167
I would prefer if every Infowars man who believed that

845
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
That weird bulshit

846
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,775
Go over this where we carry and believe that b******* I think I

847
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
Slightly less

848
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,359
Probably there's a lot of overlap

849
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,199
I would say Carrie is

850
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:43,391
Dangerous that I was not guns and more the Raptors

851
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,719
Auto Repair

852
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
Anime

853
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
Spyder leader

854
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,519
So what's what happened

855
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,055
Mark guilty

856
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
Of course

857
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,591
He was often

858
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
And also I think this clip

859
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,223
It's kind of where I turn the corner on

860
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
Find her anymore okay

861
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:14,367
I still think he's being rude to her but I lose all interest in defending her after the

862
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,207
Innocent

863
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
He was off

864
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:25,375
The planet when the f****** murder house if that's the truth if that's the truth

865
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,751
If you don't understand I mean I have so much evidence

866
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,055
Of of the way that this works

867
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,847
Do you have you ever looked at Obama's

868
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
Birth

869
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,015
Different way of looking

870
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,783
Reality

871
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,319
The false Flags

872
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,367
The reason I asked you about false Flags is

873
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
That if you invest

874
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,671
Westgate Falls Flash

875
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,191
I mean listen to my interviews with James Fetzer

876
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,727
Ask yourself why you

877
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,519
Doesn't want those interviews

878
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
Out there in the public

879
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:09,151
They've deleted them off my sight he's he's an ex-marine

880
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,687
He's at a tenured

881
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
Professor

882
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,783
He's written over 10 books

883
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,343
He's a heavy-duty investigator

884
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,135
Very respectable man

885
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
Empty investigation

886
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
In my noosha

887
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
Every

888
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,023
Flag that is

889
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Just happened

890
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
In the United States

891
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
He's he's

892
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
Obsessed with

893
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,911
And so what you really have to do is

894
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,191
Is look at the false flag

895
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,215
Start

896
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
Manufacture

897
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,079
By the secret

898
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
Government by

899
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,663
Under orders from

900
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:46,271
Higher-ups Etc and disappeared

901
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
It's a

902
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
A fascinating Journey

903
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
And I take it

904
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,695
I don't have time right now to educate you as to all the steps

905
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,999
Encourage you to watch my James Fetzer

906
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,791
Interview which is no longer on YouTube

907
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,071
It is now on

908
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,887
And also on

909
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,167
What is this called

910
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
Bitchute

911
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,775
Bitchute is place where people get thrown off of other social

912
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Videos

913
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,895
Even know that this was going to be

914
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,735
Played on another show

915
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,063
Yeah I do know what that's nobody else

916
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,855
This is being played on Kevin

917
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,927
Channel and on freedom of Joyce

918
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,535
And I'm certain we have more listeners than Beau

919
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:36,447
Which makes me feel a little bit awkward about this probably

920
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,751
I think now

921
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,103
Comparatively

922
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,663
With the continuation of a storyline

923
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,711
I feel bad punching down but

924
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,503
It escaped its kind of inevitable

925
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:55,903
Receive the difference between

926
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,439
Where

927
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,207
That

928
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,279
Defense goes away

929
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:05,375
The defensive Mark was a murderer

930
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
And is making all this up

931
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,495
She's telling a story out is like

932
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,799
And I can kind of see it there

933
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,103
I think I probably feel differently

934
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,503
If there was any chance Mark was going to get out of prison

935
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,551
You going to start a cult that actually

936
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,367
Could get some traction

937
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
Mannerable

938
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
Syfy

939
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,255
Novels

940
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,791
Internalizing

941
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:38,143
The flip side of that

942
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,679
Stray is James Fetzer

943
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
Jim Fetzer

944
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,775
Carrie does have a responsibility

945
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,055
Need to point out one of the things

946
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
This is a false flag

947
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,615
And that is

948
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
The Holocaust

949
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:54,527
She's talking about

950
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,087
He's a great scholar and

951
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
Alright

952
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,207
That is where you do have a responsibility

953
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Little bit

954
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,535
Is really into

955
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,815
Just include like

956
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,655
As we already know now but it's a clue as to how bad care react

957
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,519
I think it's a Rosetta Stone

958
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:20,383
Videos

959
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
Okay that's

960
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:26,783
In the right

961
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,831
Interesting

962
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,927
Because in the early 2000s Fetzer was a popular conspiracy theory

963
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,719
He was an actual professor

964
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:40,607
And because of that state is arguments about 11

965
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,375
Credibility

966
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
His work was s***

967
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,703
And most of it was entirely debunked

968
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,495
And the rest of the stuff that isn't debunked

969
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,031
Just the stuff it's too absurd to eat

970
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
EvanTube Anki

971
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,383
11 was done with super powered lasers

972
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:56,735
Celebrity status

973
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,551
Conspiracy world

974
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,855
Is a holocaust denier hamamoto

975
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
Something happened

976
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:08,767
Any wet for Holocaust denier along the road

977
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:13,119
Yeah when he was putting out these theories about 9/11

978
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:16,191
He was coming at it from a perspective of

979
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,239
Entering the conspiracy world

980
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,847
Decided to go in the Holocaust denial directions

981
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,687
But someone suggested that it was a natural conclusion to the path he was on

982
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,551
Career was characterised by severely uncritical readings of primary sources

983
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,855
And it nearly pathological drive towards

984
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
Sensationalize

985
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,439
He never cared too much about academic rigor

986
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,207
Wisconsin

987
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,023
The Hive making claims that got him attention

988
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:45,887
It feels like it might have only been a matter of time until he realized that denying the Holocaust wood

989
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,959
The most sensational

990
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,519
And there was plenty of that information he could misread

991
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,287
To defend his claim

992
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,871
That's pretty much top of the list in terms of

993
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,919
Wild out there clams beds

994
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Will get you

995
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,039
A lot of tension

996
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:07,135
But it's a lot what is it what else can you deny or call a false-flag that

997
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
Bigger than the holler

998
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:13,279
The book no one died at Sandy Hook also

999
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:20,959
On May 21st 2013

1000
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:24,287
Wisconsin hosted by jazz music

1001
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,591
Where you came out publicly as a holocaust

1002
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:33,759
This makes sense because admin believes that the narrative the Holocaust that is a religion for socialist Jews who were trying to use the

1003
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,319
Religion to create a new world order

1004
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,599
2007

1005
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:42,207
History

1006
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:48,607
The book is as been described by United Kingdom Jewish Watchdog group has quote quite possibly the most

1007
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,167
Antisymmetric book published in this country in recent years

1008
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,703
That's an accomplishment.

1009
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:59,103
Sure you got to give it up give it up.

1010
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,383
Like to hang out with that guy

1011
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:06,783
Decided to argue publicly for the first time in his career that the Holocaust was a false

1012
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,487
Play Never Happened alright we're going to play some Miles Davis over here

1013
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:20,863
So in 2015 Saturn started publicly supporting the Paul McCartney Is Dead

1014
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
Conspiracy theory

1015
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,959
A book called

1016
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:29,311
And I suppose we didn't go to the Muenster subtitled The Beatles the Holocaust

1017
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,103
And other math illusions

1018
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
Yikes

1019
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:39,295
Man that is a title of the book

1020
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:42,623
Poorly researched and badly edited

1021
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,207
But I believe

1022
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,023
You can turn a phrase

1023
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:54,143
Yeah we get to learn something about Kerry Cassidy that changes my tune on

1024
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:54,911
Pretty much all

1025
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,727
After Fetzer started denying the Holocaust

1026
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:01,567
He wasn't really as hot and item in conspiracy circles anymore

1027
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:06,943
It really says a lot about someone if they're still interested in interviewing Jim Fetzer in the present day

1028
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:11,807
Has been on Project as recently as October 19th 2018

1029
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,647
Redid a two-part episode about how Christine blasey Ford was engaged in a

1030
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,439
Psyop against Brett Kavanaugh

1031
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,999
Which is suspiciously exactly with Alex Jones

1032
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,047
So

1033
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,607
I've been defending Carrie to a certain

1034
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,631
610 and

1035
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:30,239
Mostly because I picked Kevin Moore's addicts he's being a dick

1036
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:35,871
But defending her for there is a bad version

1037
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,455
Of the same behavior and I think it's important

1038
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,735
To recognize that

1039
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,855
You got to you got to look at things on a sliding scale with people like this

1040
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,951
Mark Richards is a murderer

1041
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,231
It's kind of funny

1042
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,559
In terms of

1043
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:59,935
Lack of Integrity telling people that the Holocaust denier

1044
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,983
Is irresponsible and dangerous

1045
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,775
In terms of

1046
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,543
Akademiks

1047
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,127
Intellectual dishonesty

1048
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,175
We've always known she's got

1049
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,223
Solid anti-semitism

1050
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,807
Little little bit

1051
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,367
Kind of races that up to a larger red

1052
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,927
And also

1053
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,023
They have not

1054
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Not addressing it

1055
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,191
Yeah this is this is one of those you know I got no hero it's fun to let him slap

1056
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,263
You both suck

1057
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
Still

1058
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:43,711
Even if I don't like either of them say you're being a dick I don't like

1059
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,015
My largest issue is how

1060
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,295
Awful he is at

1061
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,343
Talking acrobat

1062
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,671
Note so scary

1063
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,207
Just outright tells

1064
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
Mark

1065
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,255
Bart

1066
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,559
Outright tell Kevin

1067
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:04,959
This information that you're coming so I know all about it it's b*******

1068
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,847
It doesn't it's your choice

1069
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
Choice

1070
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:15,455
You know you have to rely on your

1071
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
Investigate

1072
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,271
If you think that I should be

1073
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,319
Links on my website

1074
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,111
But I'm not

1075
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,647
Okay because I think

1076
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,327
Like I don't

1077
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,399
I do think that the motivation

1078
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
Preservation

1079
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,031
Play We destroyed if everyone believed

1080
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:40,799
He was a murderer

1081
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,103
I just making all this s*** up and tricking me

1082
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,199
I'm not going to post this stuff I don't have

1083
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:47,967
Yeah

1084
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:53,087
I don't know I just

1085
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,903
Yeah she's going to be able to

1086
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,207
Even though I was

1087
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,767
Wrong about him murdering somebody but

1088
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,559
Still right about every

1089
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:06,143
Everything else you know too much weight

1090
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:09,727
He was off playing it on a secret space program mission

1091
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
You know it's

1092
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,567
Established that he's lying about that

1093
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,847
Calls into question

1094
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
His

1095
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,455
Integrity about all others Place really a claim

1096
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,271
Emma's next clip

1097
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,831
Probably the worst offense

1098
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,111
The marks you could deposit

1099
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:34,559
As her friend happened right so who

1100
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,887
And Quentin that I masterminded it

1101
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,935
How can I how can I counter that

1102
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,079
You're talking about a man who didn't come

1103
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,407
Which any kind of instrument show up on the scene or anything

1104
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:52,479
He was supposed to have Mastermind

1105
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,551
That is a mental David koresh

1106
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,855
Mastermind you know

1107
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,439
Whatever that was called again

1108
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,975
Are these

1109
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,255
Responsible

1110
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:08,095
It's it's.

1111
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,887
Verbally get

1112
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,679
Cordis voice

1113
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:18,079
Did he actually write in the Bible those words but we don't know any of that but but we talkin about

1114
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:21,919
This particular case talking about but think about it

1115
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,711
You know you're talking about

1116
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,503
It's basically when

1117
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,039
Reduce it all down

1118
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,575
It's f****** word-of-mouth

1119
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
There's nothing

1120
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,623
Improve it

1121
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,183
That's a little bit

1122
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:38,047
Stop Fair Word of Mouth

1123
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,607
Is everything word-of-mouth

1124
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,495
If your argument is David koresh didn't have any

1125
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,543
Do with Waco and f******

1126
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,823
Jesus wasn't real

1127
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,639
Choosing the Jesus wasn't real I think

1128
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,527
Persuade anybody event wasn't the bathroom

1129
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:01,855
Take that

1130
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,879
Stanford

1131
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,439
Universal

1132
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,743
Everything on her show is worth

1133
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,023
Were you there on the moon

1134
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,119
Are you going to Indiana tonight to do a show

1135
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
Who knows

1136
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,519
Get out of

1137
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:25,407
Plans tonight you are a very Discerning color

1138
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,479
So the claim is

1139
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,527
Actually what's going on here is there's a strong

1140
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
Inflight

1141
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,879
And that is the carry his taking the Mastermind

1142
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:35,903
Idea

1143
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,463
Mark masterminded this murder

1144
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,487
And turned it into

1145
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,511
He was mine

1146
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,279
Controlling

1147
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,351
Do 17 year olds into

1148
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,911
Because that's an easier thing to argue against then

1149
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:52,543
You promised them a car

1150
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
Yeah it takes on

1151
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
Superhero

1152
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,223
Kanye

1153
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
To her

1154
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,527
And because of that she

1155
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,087
Attacks that Mastermind idea

1156
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,111
5

1157
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,159
Potential other people

1158
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,463
Who might have mind control

1159
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,743
Crossing Hoover

1160
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,583
Jean Grey

1161
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,607
Any number of these

1162
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,727
You cannot prove that those 17 year olds

1163
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,751
Brain control

1164
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
By him

1165
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,079
Who else brain control

1166
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,127
And who's very likely

1167
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,199
Well hello the Nazis

1168
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,479
Well hello there

1169
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,759
People that took over mine

1170
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,783
Control technology

1171
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,551
From the

1172
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,903
Which is the secret government

1173
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,439
Rich pretending to visual

1174
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,975
Or is it the state

1175
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,791
Your Allegiance with the state

1176
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,815
In this conversation

1177
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,143
And you know I'm saying

1178
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,167
That's not my

1179
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,727
WIC Way Beyond that and I've got

1180
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:58,079
For so many years I mean

1181
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,871
A little condescending

1182
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:05,247
No I meant you to smoke me a little bit

1183
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
You're just talk

1184
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:12,671
My anti-establishment

1185
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,463
Has been triggered

1186
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,447
Spell manipulation works

1187
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
I then

1188
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,871
Called her out of the blue

1189
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:37,503
I'm not judging the condescension because I think you deserve

1190
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:46,207
She has no reason to call need to be like half an hour long it's absurd that it is

1191
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,255
It just gets to her being rude to him

1192
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:52,095
But what about is so f****** awesome

1193
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,631
You put your mic down

1194
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,399
The snakes clip

1195
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
Kind of subtle

1196
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,495
But in the middle of it carry complains about the lighting

1197
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,775
In the interview that she

1198
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,567
Did with Kevin Moore

1199
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,615
Cuz you did that

1200
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
She complains

1201
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,919
About the visual

1202
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,455
Of the interview

1203
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,527
Kevin Motors

1204
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:16,927
In self-defense but it's kind of

1205
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:20,255
All I can tell you is look at Obama's birth certificate

1206
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,327
And ask yourself

1207
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,351
President of

1208
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,375
United States

1209
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,911
And allies are

1210
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Plant

1211
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,959
Unbelievable

1212
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,823
This is the reality we live in you know I didn't create it

1213
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
But I can tell you

1214
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,151
That if you want to believe the evidence

1215
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:41,759
That this man is showing you that's already very much in the public domain and has been

1216
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,039
30 God

1217
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,063
God knows how

1218
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,879
Do so

1219
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:50,463
It's alright if you want to put on your website links

1220
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:55,583
People which is not very nice because it was visually

1221
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,631
Aside from

1222
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,655
From that you know

1223
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,191
My information was good

1224
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,495
Clear people I don't

1225
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:06,079
Courage people to think what I want

1226
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,383
Think for themselves

1227
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,151
On the other

1228
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,687
I am not going to

1229
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,991
To become a state

1230
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,783
Post their bulshit

1231
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,831
I'm not going on to mainstream news

1232
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,623
And post their lives

1233
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,647
I mean

1234
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,183
Post what I feel is

1235
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,207
The closest

1236
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,487
Truth

1237
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,511
Disciple

1238
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:28,607
If it wasn't coming from her I think that's a good pic

1239
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:35,007
Crispin's Day speech for bass

1240
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:43,199
Do whatever mean if you knew nothing about Kerry Cassidy be like yeah

1241
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,719
Amended if you got her channel it's like oh here's a holocaust denier oh hear somebody talking about

1242
01:02:54,975 --> 01:03:01,119
Beatles and have been a very different speech that Pat

1243
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:06,495
If he started with an also the president's birth certificate is fake

1244
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,543
Right

1245
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,847
But man I think

1246
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,871
It's so

1247
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
Funny

1248
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
How

1249
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:32,351
It's so funny because Carrie like visually her videos are just like

1250
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,119
Sturgis

1251
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,911

1252
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,679
Call

1253
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,359
This is not this is not the

1254
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,127
Kettle black

1255
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,199
This is watching the pot in the kettle stare each other down

1256
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
Like this is

1257
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,247
Crazy

1258
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,295
So this point

1259
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,831
You get Kevin

1260
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,367
Talking about

1261
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,135
The Pendragon

1262
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,975
The idea that Mark had intended

1263
01:03:59,487 --> 01:03:59,999
Set up

1264
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767

The end

1268
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,519
Of her yelling

1269
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,543

01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,719
He seems like he doesn't like what's going on

1277
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,999
With that carry much

1278
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,791

Weird

1285

You know he did talk about he wanted to isolate Marine County wooden Transformers

1286
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,831
Intermodal of Camelot

I think I'm The Reincarnation of Guinevere what do you do about that I found something crazy I can tell you that

1294
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,879
The bill Ryan

1295
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,415
Comes from the Arthur

1296
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,695
Arthurian bloodline

1297
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,231
According to the Illuminati

1298
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:36,767
That we've got

1299
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,303
Okay

1300
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,839
You know he's oneg

1301
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:46,239
What do you want to do with that if you want to say we're crazy cuz he really a descendant of the Arthurian

1302
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,775
Been told by several psychic

1303
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,543
Pixie is

1304
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,079
You know that's my intuitive

1305
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,407
He doesn't claim it

1306
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,735
It sound

1307
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,759
Outlander

1308
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,807
It sounds like

1309
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,135
And if you want to come to that conclusion you're very welcome

1310
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,463
How to make a pretty good point

1311
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,095
He hasn't murdered anybody

1312
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,911
Which is kind of a conversation

1313
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,447
I really love a good

01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,983

In this neck

1323
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,359
Kevin is talking about

1324
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,895
Going to the

1325
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,199
Conference call contact in the desert

1326
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,479
And

1327
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,063
He's not talking about going there and realized

1328
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
Mark is

1329
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
Full of s***

1330
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,391
Or anything like that

1331
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,047
I went to this conference I got a little bit disillusioned with

1332
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,327
The Uso

1333
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
Community

1334
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,679
His mind again

1335
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
Mark Richard

1336
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:24,543
Their contact in the desert

1337
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,591
On contact in the desert

1338
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,151
He'll turn to the ages

1339
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,991
You know I think nothing is truth out that this is my take on it right now

1340
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,527
Especially

1341
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:39,903
Can of worms

1342
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,927
A lot of this

1343
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,023
They're not being honest

1344
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,327
And I can tell I can go right down the

1345
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,615
I was going to say to that

1346
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
Going to least

1347
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,663
There's about 20

1348
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
80%

1349
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,711
If I

1350
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,247
Is that an ATM

1351
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,015
Symbolic

1352
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,551
20%

1353
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,319
Truth

1354
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:14,207
I think this so much disinformation in the UFO field

1355
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,231
Belmont

1356
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,047
Is it ripped apart by disinformation

1357
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,327
Ripped apart

1358
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
Yeah certainly is

1359
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,167
I would say

1360
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,775
You got to throw the baby out with the bathwater

1361
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:37,503
From scratch

1362
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,039
Hold yourself

1363
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,063
Responsible

1364
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,599
Then for creating

1365
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:47,999
Spaces where it don't let the b******* 20% is so real

1366
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,583
I know what I'm sure there are

1367
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,119
Some ghost alien

1368
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,423
Researchers who aren't

1369
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
Nonsense

1370
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:00,799
Maybe the person exists

1371
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,103
I've yet to see them

1372
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,175
University

1373
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,991
Possible if that person does exist

1374
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
To preserve that

1375
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
5

1376
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:16,415
Harshly excluding 80% of liars

1377
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,207
You have to

1378
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,487
Because if you don't

1379
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,815
And you know what they do

1380
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,095
They support each other

1381
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,399
Each other's cons

1382
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:30,239
The same thing but not wedding your guest

1383
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:35,871
Is what those 80% due to make sure that they Remain the 80% in that space

1384
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,991
It's pretty much a

1385
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,271
It's pretty much

1386
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,087
Yeah

1387
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,367
And you know what else

1388
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,951
Exactly what

1389
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,303
Put also about yourself

1390
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,095
Yeah that's the problem

1391
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,679
It's the new Hustle

1392
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
He's trying to

1393
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,519
Create legitimacy for his discernment

1394
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,823
About his channeling and his own

1395
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:09,407
By putting a feather in his cap of taking out Mark Richards

1396
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,431
Yeah it's

1397
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:12,991
Disgraceful

1398
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,599
Yeah it is

1399
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:19,903
Cannibalistic

1400
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,511
Yeah it's a hundred percent

1401
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,279
He's willing to

1402
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,303
Take the risk

1403
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
Hope you know

1404
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,655
Eating himself

1405
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:37,567
How to try and get over her

1406
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:40,895
No one other than

1407
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,919
This b*******

1408
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,271
The possibility that his documentary could be

1409
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,807
Outside

1410
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,903
Space interested Community world

1411
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
It seems low

1412
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,767
It's about a half-hour on net

1413
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:04,191
I don't think that he has much to worry about in those

1414
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:04,959
Communities

1415
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,983
Like with him

1416
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:11,359
Going after Mark Richards hotline

1417
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:16,735
No one's going to the community

1418
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,015
I already

1419
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,807
And they already believe the others

1420
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,111
Yeah there's not dark people

1421
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,903
Externally

1422
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,207
It's so subterranea

1423
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:26,975
And it's not

1424
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:30,303
It's so far outside of what most normal people pay it

1425
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,607
For sure

1426
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,631
Flourish

1427
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,703
It's a it's a little bit of a

1428
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:39,519
But it makes for more fun for us

1429
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,079
I'm a little bit put off by this

1430
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:42,847
Conversation now

1431
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,127
Because now it's

1432
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,199
Seems like Carrie is full on bullying him

1433
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,759
Really like trying to

1434
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:55,647
Steamroll over here putting up with this for like 20 minutes

1435
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
Within the fur

1436
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,303
If you don't have new information this conversation isn't really

1437
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,607
Do we have anything else

1438
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
Talk about

1439
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:09,215
So I understand why she would steamroll

1440
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,263
Bulshit

1441
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,287
And she

1442
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,895
Attack him in a way that would

1443
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
Useful

1444
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:21,503
And I also find him

1445
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,295
Manipulating and godinger in

1446
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,599
So I don't like

1447
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:29,439
Like it was fun whenever I was doing just great

1448
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,463
And now it's

1449
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,743
He's here

1450
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:34,303
He's putting these little needles in everywhere you can

1451
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
He's trying to goad her

1452
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,119
Into screaming

1453
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,935
Batman

1454
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:42,239
Of somebody who's like yeah

1455
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,031
Itsy itsy

1456
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,151
It seems like

1457
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:49,919
Awareness

1458
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,455
On his part of like

1459
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:55,039
I do believe that there's a possibility that he's just

1460
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:58,623
Wired in such a way that he doesn't think that Carrie knows all this stuff

1461
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
I think

1462
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:03,231
If you bring her new information

1463
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,815
He doesn't know where to go with it and doesn't want to

1464
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,607
Sounds like an idiot on the phone

1465
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:15,007
He's trying to find different ways to bring up the

1466
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:15,775
Flags Apple

1467
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,311
Do you know about this stuff

1468
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:23,711
Osher Project Camelot

1469
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:30,623
Call you don't want to be on

1470
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,391
Yeah

1471
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:35,231
I get I get where you're coming from but I think it could all be

1472
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,767
Him being

1473
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
Poor communicator

1474
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,423
Out of his depth in terms of

1475
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,983
Communicating with someone who's like

1476
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,567
Before

1477
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,151
Purposeful

1478
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,431
Satoshi

1479
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,223
Oh she's recording

1480
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,503
She brings up

1481
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:00,319
Durant

1482
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,855
So they're both recording

1483
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,159
I think that's what makes it legal for him to

1484
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,439
Play it

1485
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,207
What are these people

1486
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,071
I don't know probably smart for Carrie to have done that

1487
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,095
Just as

1488
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:12,863
Self-defense

1489
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,143
Yeah for sure

1490
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,679
Because this guy is a manipulative

1491
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:20,543
She didn't know that back bringing up stuff about Mark Richards

1492
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,847
It seems like it would have been a wise

1493
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,871
Decision just in case

1494
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,151
Edit

1495
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,431
Have your own version

1496
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,735
So

1497
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,015
K2

1498
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,039
Try to pretend

1499
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,087
Joanne on the show

1500
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,927
I think someone

1501
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,743
I think when I interview John about years ago

1502
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,023
Many moons ago like I did

1503
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
Insofar facts

1504
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,143
No that is not at all how he comported himself

1505
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,959
He was helping her make the narrative

1506
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:49,983
Established

1507
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:56,383
On his own without at her helping at all that Mark was off-planet when the murder

1508
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,151
Participate

1509
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,687
And the Farfetch'd

1510
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:01,503
The very first question I believe was like

1511
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:04,319
Everything that you say is true tell me a little bit more

1512
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:06,111
Basically

1513
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:08,927
Purview

1514
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,695
If you can call that

1515
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,231
Phone call annoyance

1516
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:17,375
Kevin just gives up on what he's trying to do because realizes I've hit a brick wall

1517
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,959
There's no real point

1518
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,983
Continue

1519
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,543
Carrie's just like I don't really care what you

1520
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:28,383
Small Potatoes

1521
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,687
I think it's I think it's

1522
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,967
I think it is at

1523
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
Pureness

1524
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,759
In her

1525
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,807
Establish DeLucia

1526
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:39,135
I knows it I know whatever information

1527
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,695
You're going to throw at me I've decided what I believe

1528
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,511
Let's live our lives

1529
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,303
What you do

1530
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:50,911
Flakka

1531
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,191
Looking at this place

1532
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,727
Interesting

1533
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,495
You know

1534
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,287
I mean you don't have to let me

1535
01:15:56,543 --> 01:16:01,407
Just do whatever you do to be honest

1536
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,431
Iridescent

1537
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,783
You're an independent agent and

1538
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
If you want to let

1539
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,599
Joanne know that you know

1540
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,903
Journalist you're going to do something you know

1541
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
Whatever

1542
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,695
That's fine

1543
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,999
Cat litter I'm sure if

1544
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,559
If you don't if you need her email address I'll send it to you

1545
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,607
You know I mean it

1546
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,655
It's really neither here nor there what

1547
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,679
You said to me

1548
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
In this conversation

1549
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,239
Because it's not

1550
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,519
Anything I'm not aware of

1551
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,311
And have dealt with

1552
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,335
Not just to do

1553
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,103
This case

1554
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,127
But so many others

1555
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:36,991
Alright

1556
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:46,207
I would say outside of Defending a holocaust denier

1557
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
Support

1558
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,279
Pretty much our entire position

1559
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,351
A little big except

1560
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,007
Is

1561
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:02,335
For me to get home

1562
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,383
But in terms of social dynamics

1563
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:07,455
Swear at him

1564
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:16,415
Oh yeah absolutely planes on Terry juices show is Evelyn

1565
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,351
By having that

1566
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,935
Mastication

1567
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,519
Hey call him a pedophile Adeline

1568
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,103
I got no one's back

1569
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,943
Exception of herpes

1570
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,735
Totally

1571
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,623
Rooting

1572
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,767
And then I want her to be

1573
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,791
By somebody

1574
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:59,935
Government regulation on Tropicana

1575
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,007
No Maybe.

1576
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,311
To spiral out of control

1577
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,591
Surprizamals

1578
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,175
For all of them

1579
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,199
To just have

1580
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,039
Actual exposure of

1581
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,063
What they

1582
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,343
Put out to the portal

1583
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,463
Are you rooting for some sort of ironic

1584
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,791
Revere Kevin documentary not him

1585
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:30,911

1586
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
Isn't

1587
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,215

Channel

1589
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,263
Like someone who doesn't have to

01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,287
Text the business

1591
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,335
Someone who can actually be like

1592
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,127
This is how the sausage is made

1593
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,151
A bunch of dick

1594
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,223
Someone who doesn't get

1595
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,503
Channel 8

1596
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:48,831
Ghost and then have that goes tell him how great

1597
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:55,743
Write his own voice character

1598
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,535
You are such a good boy

1599
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,095
Bring up the

1600
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:00,863
Portion

1601
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,399
Because we get back to

1602
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,167
Terry Joyce

1603
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
His interview

1604
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,495
They come back after playing

1605
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,287
There's a lot of caffeine

1606
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,055
Aspersion on

1607
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,591
Carry course

1608
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,871
Terry believes

1609
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,895
Security might be working

1610
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,431
Things for Michael Aquino

1611
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,647
To Satan it's a bunch of

1612
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:30,815
Not a problem in this world or alive

1613
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,375
Terry brings up that Carrie is like

1614
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:36,191
Seems to have a lot of people who are criminals

1615
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:41,823
Switch

1616
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:46,175
FairPoint Sean David Morton.

1617
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:46,943
The

1618
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,967
Mark Richards

1619
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,759
Some others that I don't know

1620
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,831
I'm not I'm not going to necessarily DoubleDown on cuz I haven't

1621
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,623
I don't know

1622
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,415
If they're actually criminals but

1623
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,351
If not convicted

1624
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:09,727
Still eligible to be a criminal

1625
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,775
Fraud types

1626
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:16,896
So clip from their interview they had that conversation

1627
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,944
Can I get around to talk about Simon Park

1628
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,224
Who is the

1629
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,248
The former MP

1630
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,272
From England

1631
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,064
Who says

1632
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,600
About once or twice.

1633
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
Alien

1634
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,928
Either

1635
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,696
Defender

1636
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,464
Of Marc rich

1637
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,000
He is one of the ones

1638
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,536
Carrie

1639
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,816
Goes to all the times I

1640
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,680
They've got marks back

1641
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,216
The voucher all this

1642
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,752
I remember liking him

1643
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,288
SMS

1644
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,336
I think I thought he was doing

1645
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,360
Pretty good job

1646
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,664
Better than Nigel farage

1647
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,688
Perhaps

1648
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,224
I will certainly

1649
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,040
Pequa Park

1650
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,832
And that he had intelligence

1651
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,600
Contact

1652
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,624
In the UK

1653
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,648
Who

1654
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,672
Vouch

1655
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,952
For all of Mark's stuff

1656
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,720
And could prove

1657
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,256
Fitmark wasn't lying

1658
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,024
About all this

1659
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,096
Would have access

1660
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,912
I don't think he is anymore so

1661
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,472
Look I don't want you I don't sweat

1662
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,056
He claimed that he had all this proof and then

1663
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,896
Kevin contacted Emma's I'm more than happy to look at it

1664
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,944
Obviously

1665
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,248
Excitement

1666
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,272
So

1667
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:28,320
So Kevin is decided he's lying

1668
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:30,880
Wouldn't allow that s*** out of

1669
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,928
Home office

1670
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,696
No thank you

1671
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:38,816
Agree with Kevin

1672
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,120
About this s***

1673
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,400
Kevin take that

1674
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,680
Is problematic

1675
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,960
As we know that

1676
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:46,752
Channel Azalea

1677
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,056
When you

1678
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:55,456
To lie

1679
01:21:55,968 --> 01:22:01,600
What are the b******* are you talkin about on your other parts of your information that you given out Friday

1680
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:02,880

1681
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:08,256
No it's not allowed to say that

1682
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:14,400
Literally not allowed to say that

1683
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:18,240
I am now talkin from an alien

1684
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:27,456
Yeah yeah yeah

1685
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:31,296
Can't you can't be like okay

1686
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,344
What about Mark Richards

1687
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,368
When

1688
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,160
F****** alien

1689
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,208
If you're willing to

1690
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:42,048
Aliens on your show

1691
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,864
My God

1692
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,704
But that's part of why ice I entirely believe

1693
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,240
This is all part of

1694
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,264
Intentional strategy

1695
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,336
Who does Kevin wants to Corner the market

1696
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,456
Community

1697
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:00,992
Debunking

1698
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,272
She wants to

1699
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,552
To take the space of

1700
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:08,160
Within the community who also

1701
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,440
He wants that

1702
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:12,256
Space really badly and I take that from

1703
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
This

1704
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,816
At the end here where

1705
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,632
Is that some plans

1706
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
To make more.

1707
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,984
I wish that Sam

1708
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,056
This just helps one person this information

1709
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:31,200
Jokes on you know what I mean I will be walking away from at some point and start in another documentary

1710
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:35,040
Tomahawks will be a documentary that I am going to be doing this well

1711
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:41,440
Civil Corey Goode and David Wilcock okay but they're also fragile

1712
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:42,976
You hear that at the end

1713
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:47,584
But not from the same place of anger

1714
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:50,912
Coming from a place of anger with Carrie which is

1715
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,680
Unhealthy

1716
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,032
New channel would want you to do

1717
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,896
Will tell you not to do this

1718
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:05,248
Don't do it

1719
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:13,184
I think that he is a completely sucked up dude who's operating from

1720
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,720
Composition of bad faith

1721
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:17,792
A doing something

1722
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
To be done

1723
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,096
That's what's up

1724
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,680
I can't trust his Mark Richards documentary

1725
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:24,960
Robin

1726
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:26,752
Somebody information probably you can

1727
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,056
Do you verify it

1728
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,592
I can't trust

1729
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:31,616
Because it comes

1730
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:34,176
From him I want a mark Richards documentary

1731
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:51,072
So awesome

1732
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,096
Tia Mann

1733
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,632
Absolutely

1734
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,424
Absolutely I think

1735
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,960
Topics are grapes

1736
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,496
4 documentary

1737
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,824
Great for documentaries coming from a critical perspective

1738
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,640
I don't want him doing

1739
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:08,736
Service of him

1740
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:12,064
Establishing a position of unassailable Leti

1741
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:12,832
It looks like

1742
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:16,160
Are you f******

1743
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,952
Serious I'm skeptical

1744
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:21,280
Because

1745
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:26,912
That only increases my legitimacy

1746
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:33,312
I am a skeptic towards this channeling I obviously have interrogated it

1747
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:35,872
Google search on every ghost that I'm f******

1748
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:40,224
Build a wall around himself

1749
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,272
For him being full of

1750
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,296
Right

1751
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:44,832
I can't support

1752
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,112
Well the same time trying

1753
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,136
The siphon away

1754
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:47,904
Carrie's

1755
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,672
Audience

1756
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,304
What is the real thick

1757
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,072
Deal

1758
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,096
I hate it

1759
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:01,216
I really would be even more I'm going to be so mad if

1760
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,240
Turns out the

1761
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:09,408
Like it's Nails it everything I've seen some of the other stuff he's made

1762
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,480
Not as professional you know like your vlogs

1763
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:15,040
Spiratone Ocampo

1764
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,832
His trailer

1765
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,672
Zoe contain clips of interviews that I think

1766
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,440
Bye.

1767
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,048
The voice-over was terrible ending wasn't great

1768
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:29,632
So if he's working

1769
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,424
I think that it could be

1770
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:34,240
Not that good

1771
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:37,312
I really hope that actually

1772
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,080
He never released

1773
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,616
I feel like people are

1774
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,640
To demand

1775
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,664
We do an end

1776
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,672
Documentary about

1777
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,792
It's interesting that

1778
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,096
Kevin Moore is on this show that

1779
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,680
And he's going

1780
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,472
On and on about

1781
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,240
Discernment

1782
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,264
We've heard him

1783
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,568
Within the interview with

1784
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,616
Terry and in the car with

1785
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,640
Carrie

1786
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,176
Say discernment

1787
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,016
The buzz word of the day

1788
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,296
This is what

1789
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,064
It's all about

1790
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,648
It's one thing to let someone

1791
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,440
Something awful slide

1792
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,208
Just coasting in life

1793
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,536
Be able to Channel 8

1794
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,304
Intelligences

1795
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,352
We can probably easily told you

1796
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,120
Mike Richards

1797
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:38,240
But yet you can see how that might be a low priority for these days

1798
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,264
Tell you about that

1799
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,288
Yeah they got bigger

1800
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,848
That's the difference of discern

1801
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:44,384
Discernment is something you must

1802
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,176
Tubac

1803
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:48,480
Earlier he can make the argument I wasn't

1804
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:52,576
Fixing this discernment about these topic

1805
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,392
So Kevin says

1806
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,928
In this interview with Terry

1807
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,464
This is a fairy in Fort

1808
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
Interview

1809
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,304
This was an important interview at 2 I'll do with you

1810
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,144
Right now I'm at wall

1811
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,448
That's how I feel

1812
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,520
This is a very important interview for him

1813
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:14,592
The bearer of bad news

1814
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,640
You go on the freedom of choice

1815
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,176
It's

1816
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,224
Just one in a long line of

1817
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,272
Kevin Moore

1818
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,040
Chose

1819
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,088
Shity discernment

1820
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:28,672
Cuz for what he's saying it's important interview like

1821
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:31,488
This video has been up for a couple days now it has a

1822
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,256
Couple hundred

1823
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,048
Did did she make it

1824
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:34,816
On the radio.

1825
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:38,912
I don't know I don't think so and I don't think the audience is much more than that

1826
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,192
Which is 80

1827
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,728
Very small

1828
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,544
Audience but he's speaking to not

1829
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,568
An important

1830
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,408
I wonder if she

1831
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,200
Put in the

1832
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,736
Comment to the Linq

1833
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,784
In the comments of the YouTube video a lot of Link

1834
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,576
Two showing how much of an

1835
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
An a****** that

1836
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:00,416
I would love that if that's okay

1837
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,632
Interview

1838
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:16,544
He's full of s*** right it's giving it seems unlikely cuz even though it be

1839
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,336
Beginning of their interview they talked

1840
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,896
About how Carrie doesn't

1841
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,136
She does that

1842
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:34,208
She's doing this interview right now

1843
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:41,888
She's had Randy Cramer on as a guest who's the super soldier who carries

1844
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:43,680
Also had one who told stories

1845
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:47,264
Miraculously being returned into his bed

1846
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,104
After years of fighting in space

1847
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,384
Yeah but the

1848
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,432
Space Ghost that Kevin channels

1849
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,552
His story is no less or more credible than mark

1850
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,344
It's just he didn't murder a guy

1851
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,368
Yasso

1852
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,976
I don't understand okay.

1853
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:10,816
You do get points for having a guess who hasn't murdered again

1854
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,584
You get a pass

1855
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:20,032
It doesn't matter if you didn't murder a guy I guess

1856
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,080
So

1857
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:22,848
You have

1858
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,616
The same

1859
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,384
Guest

1860
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:30,784
Shows that your discernment or whatever

1861
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,320
Now

1862
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:33,856
I have

1863
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,904
Strong reason to believe

1864
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:42,304
Her discernment is far worse than carries cuz there's a guy who's been on

1865
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,328
I think one

1866
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,888
Maybe twice on Project Camelot

1867
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,704
Who has been on Terry show

1868
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,520
Time

1869
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,288
That's

1870
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,568
Kelly

1871
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:58,432
The guy who believes that there is a alien base Under The Getty Museum

1872
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,200
Right

1873
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,480
Okay

1874
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:01,504
Now

1875
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,528
In his defense

1876
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,064
There is

1877
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:15,840
She's a huge fan of Steve Kelly

1878
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:23,264
Anybody with the tiniest amount of discernment would be able to watch a video of his and be like

1879
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,312
Oh my God this guy is a f***

1880
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,080
Freep

1881
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,944
I think if you had any better

1882
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,480
Wedding that you wanted to do

1883
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,504
Did you get it

1884
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:37,344
I think I did this within an hour 2 hours of just looking into it

1885
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,184
Oh my God this guy seems like someone who steals

1886
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:50,656
Looks like this guy is the weapon

1887
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,264
Museum

1888
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,824
And let me tell you

1889
01:31:59,360 --> 01:31:59,872
Play Museum

1890
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
No aliens

1891
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:04,992
Great music

1892
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:07,808
I know this from going to Terry's

1893
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,344
YouTube

1894
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,392
She's also

1895
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,184
Which

1896
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,768
With Steve

1897
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,536
Okay

1898
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,912
No

1899
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,448
The f****** outside music

1900
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:30,080
Now you see this slope to slope of this wall is so they have a good shooting

1901
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:33,920
Position from Up

1902
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,944
For the Dozen

1903
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:39,040
Unauthorized tour that he gave some bogetti

1904
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:41,600
He wanders around outside

1905
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,648
The outfit that he's wearing

1906
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,416
Is

1907
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:50,304
Ridiculous what does it look like long hair long hair

1908
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:54,400
Rocking sunglasses has a button up shirt

1909
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,520
Also

1910
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,544
Unbutton

1911
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,128
Not all the way

1912
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:09,504
I would say three buttons

1913
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,576
California

1914
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,856
All the way up

1915
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:17,184
It's real like this is how you decided to dress up

1916
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:21,536
To give it to work of the alien space base Getty Museum

1917
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:24,096
I think I might get the

1918
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,632
The appearance

1919
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,912
You don't care

1920
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:34,336
There's a lack of professionalism here certainly

1921
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:42,016
Different

1922
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:45,856
Like I want to go to the the Tower of London be like

1923
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,136
I see you know if you went down this

1924
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:48,928
You would find

1925
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,720
The first

1926
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:54,560
So she has a bunch of b******* going on

1927
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:56,864
On her website

1928
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,424
Exercise

1929
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:03,264
None of them will talk to each other

1930
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,032
So

1931
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,824
Anyway here

1932
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:11,712
So here's the last clip

1933
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,736
The cabin is a f******

1934
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:13,504
Cancel

1935
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:16,064
Is there anything else that you would like to add

1936
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:21,696
As a button or something that you want to make sure that

1937
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:25,536
Those who were listening to my Channel or

1938
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,328
Radio

1939
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:34,752
Get Terry Cassidy I hope this documentary

1940
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,800
Your work and yourself

1941
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,104
That's what I want

1942
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,664
Awful

1943
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:46,528
Is he recording a shoot promo like

1944
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:51,648
So I just I can't walk away from without

1945
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,928
Thinking you're

1946
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,024
The total assholes

1947
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,304
Cuz I want to support

1948
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,352
The Dabangg king of these people

1949
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,400
Playful debunking

1950
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,960
Right

1951
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,752
He's a malignant narcissist

1952
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,800
Two took that phone call really person

1953
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,360
He got bro

1954
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:17,760
And he was like I'm not going to let somebody do that to me so I'm going to

1955
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:24,672
Definitely

1956
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:31,840
Yeah you're making this documentary

1957
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:39,008
The last word

1958
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,312
I hope that I destroy you

1959
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:47,968
F*** you man it is all so hard not to the sample size is small but it's hard not to notice it

1960
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,736
Set of the people

1961
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,272
Matarese about

1962
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,040
The one who

1963
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,064
He's filled with anger

1964
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,672
I think he might also have that anger towards Simon

1965
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,696
Parks

1966
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:01,024
I don't know it's hard to tell from the context to what he was saying

1967
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,816
Brightest future documentary

1968
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,888
I agree and if I had more

1969
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:08,704
Actual evidence

1970
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,496
To say that he

1971
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:12,800
Anger towards believe me

1972
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:15,616
I would bring it up

1973
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:19,456
I think that Carrie probably

1974
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:22,528
Call

1975
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:24,576
And maybe he's responding

1976
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,112
I asked

1977
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:29,440
In a chauvinistic his anger comes from a place of

1978
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:31,232
His masculinity being attacked

1979
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,048
It's possible I don't know I don't have enough

1980
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,584
But certainly would fit a pattern

1981
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,632
Other people

1982
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,656
Is Trey Smith

1983
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,936
Play that

1984
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:40,960
Phone call

1985
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,240
Like it was his choice.

1986
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,008
Play that song

1987
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,544
Is he does not come off

1988
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:45,824
Looking good

1989
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,592
He doesn't

1990
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:50,944
I listen to all this and I came away feeling a bit

1991
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,480
A little bit

1992
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,272
Because

1993
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,808
On the one hand

1994
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,856
I'm defending Carrie

1995
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,648
It's qualified

1996
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:02,464
It's not

1997
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,536
Sounds like yeah she's right f*** this guy

1998
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,328
I think f*** this guy but not because I'm

1999
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,120
I'm just

2000
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,400
Being fair the

2001
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,424
But he's being rude

2002
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,472
I'm also being fair

2003
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:17,312
Her behaviors can go too far and when

2004
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,848
Define holocaust denier

2005
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,688
And so it's not it's not cutting it's not black and white

2006
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:25,760
And I realized I was having

2007
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,808
Of discern

2008
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,952
Seems to be all about

2009
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:36,512
Jordan what if I told you

2010
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:39,328
That I found the perfect place to learn

2011
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,608
About discern

2012
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:43,168
Microsoft Encarta

2013
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,448
No

2014
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:50,848
What if I were to tell you that Kevin Moore has channeled aliens about the very issue

2015
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,896
Of discernment

2016
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
Really

2017
01:37:54,432 --> 01:38:00,576
We're doing this

2018
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:05,440
Here is a video that Kevin Moore put out a couple years back

2019
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:07,232
Where he channels

2020
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,256
The one

2021
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,024
Lucci

2022
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:14,656
That's the people that he talks to might as well been

2023
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,192
So here's where he channels

2024
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,520
About what

2025
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,080
It is a good question

2026
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:29,760
We would say that too hot

2027
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:30,784
22 sermon

2028
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,088
One has to be

2029
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:35,392
In complete control

2030
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,440
Allstate roof

2031
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,208
To begin with

2032
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,536
One has to know

2033
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,352
Xanax

2034
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,888
In order

2035
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,680
To take back your power

2036
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,472
I know you'll truth

2037
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,520
You must first

2038
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,336
Learn to listen

2039
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:57,152
Until very soul

2040
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:03,040
I got Paws here really quick as we get through this

2041
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:11,744
Concrete thing that he actually says open by reading the dictionary

2042
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:16,608
No just really interested in Webster

2043
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:22,240
What do you do I open with closing his eyes and making a scrunchy face

2044
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,544
Choose not

2045
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:27,104
Which your eyes look out

2046
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:30,944
Which

2047
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,736
Is inside

2048
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,272
Audiobahn

2049
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:39,136
To that what you came here with

2050
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,672
And you shall leave with

2051
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,464
The only thing

2052
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,512
That will always be a come

2053
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,304
Fuel cell

2054
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,912
He smiles as if like

2055
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:53,728
I pulled that one

2056
01:39:53,984 --> 01:40:00,128
Well almost

2057
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,664
The improv lines

2058
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:02,688
He was like ice

2059
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,224
Surprise myself with how

2060
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:10,624
Bullshittin that was exactly the vibe I got from the visual

2061
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,976
The discernment is something comes from within you have to listen to your soul

2062
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,000
Great

2063
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:19,072
I feel like Stefan molyneux if enough people

2064
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:20,864
Perhaps

2065
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,144
Yeah

2066
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,680
Honestly I hate

2067
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,448
To say this

2068
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,728
Christopher newest

2069
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:26,496
Stupid

2070
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:30,848
Stefan molyneux is way smarter than

2071
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,616
Stupid

2072
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,432
Antelope

2073
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,456
What it is

2074
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,784
And how it says it

2075
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,808
Your soul that is

2076
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,856
1010

2077
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
Chihuahuas

2078
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,392
Any

2079
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:46,208
Current situation that you may be going through

2080
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,488
It is your

2081
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,256
1

2082
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,536
Through

2083
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,560
Alarm

2084
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,584
You're one

2085
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,608
Ruth

2086
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,632
To yourself

2087
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,728
Knowing or loving

2088
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:01,312
All of you to you for you for others as well

2089
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,664
Define this

2090
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,712
You must go deep within

2091
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,736
Instead

2092
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,784
Justice situation

2093
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:11,808
Feel-Rite

2094
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,600
No

2095
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,928
Really

2096
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,232
Except

2097
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:24,096
Sometimes it gets a bit

2098
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,400
You could say

2099
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:31,264
On the way that

2100
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:35,616
Lost in the situation of

2101
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,896
This is Phil Right

2102
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:42,528
No no I'm not feeling right this is this this is not right I shouldn't be doing this

2103
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,832
And you you

2104
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:50,208
Get logic mixed in with a motion mixed in with a motion to extend with logic logic logic

2105
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,232
Motion

2106
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,768
And he's never coming from that

2107
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
To place

2108
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,560
Pure soul

2109
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:58,144
I want to point out that it's strange

2110
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:04,800
That these aliens that he's channeling verbal tics of him

2111
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:11,200
Sorry I told you when I start back

2112
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:18,880
It's so weird interview private folktale

2113
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:23,232
Aliens speaking through him

2114
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:25,536
I think they would probably still change

2115
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,096
Word choices

2116
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,888
Samurai

2117
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,192
Customer is just looking for words

2118
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,216
It's just

2119
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:35,264
How the the Bible

2120
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:39,104
It can just be a vocal tic by Asher

2121
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:40,896
You cover

2122
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,176
Your brain trying

2123
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,456
To come up with the word you're looking

2124
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,736
I do it all the time

2125
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,576
If aliens were guiding the words coming out of your mouth

2126
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:50,112
Unless

2127
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:53,696
I don't know use your brain to come up with Words which I guess

2128
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:54,976
Which just means are you

2129
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,608
Anyway he's not done

2130
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,192
Yes of course

2131
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,728
New alarm

2132
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,080
Hope you recognize

2133
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,872
What's true north

2134
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:12,640
Realself

2135
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,688
But we are choking about here

2136
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:20,064
Most important

2137
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:20,832
Audible

2138
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,856
Yeah come on

2139
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:25,696
Start it over after that

2140
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:32,096
Now these situations remembrance

2141
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:32,864
Yes

2142
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:34,912
Then there's nothing

2143
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:38,752
Someone

2144
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,568
It would be wise to

2145
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,848
Stop straightaway

2146
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,128
Cuz you have no rights

2147
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:44,896
Do that

2148
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:48,736
I think you doing

2149
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,272
But how would you like that

2150
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,808
We still talk about the sermon

2151
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,208
House choice

2152
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,232
Situation

2153
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,512
Is one way

2154
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:01,792
Define that place

2155
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,584
No it is not

2156
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:08,704
How discernment works

2157
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,496
Factory

2158
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,080
Another

2159
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,360
It's true

2160
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,176
Very still

2161
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:21,760
Being

2162
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,856
As much as you can be

2163
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,136
That

2164
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,208
The feeling of

2165
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,488
This feels right

2166
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,768
Is foolhardy

2167
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,840
Now to be able to get to those

2168
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:36,864
Actuation

2169
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,472
Places

2170
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:49,152
Shall we say the shall we say aliens often

2171
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,432
The one thing I leaned often

2172
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:52,736
Supermarket

2173
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:57,088
Situation situation

2174
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:01,696
The shall we say

2175
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,744
Trying to pretend

2176
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,840
I'm saying this is reasonable

2177
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:12,448
Or something almost compulsively as a tick

2178
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,728
You can edit

2179
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:19,616
You can do it you can do takes

2180
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:24,480
How do you watch yourself doing this go

2181
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:25,760
Going through

2182
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,808
Suntrust.com feeling

2183
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:28,832
A number

2184
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:33,184
And you feel not too sure

2185
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:37,024
As we have said to you before the best way is

2186
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,304
Little

2187
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,096
Small decisions

2188
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:41,632
That's very cool

2189
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,168
Getting to that place

2190
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,216
Feeling what they got saying

2191
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,752
Feeding weather joyous

2192
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,312
Feeling with the feeling

2193
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,664
Situations with small decisions are to be taken

2194
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:55,712
Small small

2195
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:59,808
And then yourself undisable ones come alone

2196
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,880
You may need to

2197
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,024
Do I take this job do I not

2198
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:13,888
Do I put this investment money here to Minot

2199
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:17,472
Newspaper decision aliens are real

2200
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:18,496
Used

2201
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:19,264
Same

2202
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,288
Apply the same

2203
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:23,872
And you

2204
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,408
Only come

2205
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:26,944
Scheelhaase

2206
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,712
Truth

2207
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:34,368
Aliens are really into portfolio

2208
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:38,976
Crab

2209
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,024
If he's Twitter and I got burned

2210
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:47,168
What he's talking about there is really Elementary basic self-help

2211
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:51,776
Difficult time

2212
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:55,104
It is very powerful is

2213
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,664
Building the

2214
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,456
It's from those smaller victories

2215
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,480
It smaller

2216
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:03,552
Regions where you did make a choice

2217
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:07,648
Knowing that you made a choice and everything was okay

2218
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,720
You know building up your confidence

2219
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:15,328
It's this is 101 self-help tapes

2220
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,120
Just repurposing

2221
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:18,400
And regurgitate

2222
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,936
Under the guise of speaking

2223
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:22,496
For a f****** group of alien

2224
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:26,592
This is interesting

2225
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,616
Isn't

2226
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,896
Because

2227
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:35,552
101 stuff

2228
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,416
Find if someone

2229
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:43,744
Takes that game power over their ability

2230
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,536
Controller

2231
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:51,936
Don't also think it's that interesting

2232
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:55,776
Because we've already kind of talked about that

2233
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:56,544
Absurd

2234
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,824
Especially

2235
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:03,456
Smaller parts of it where it's

2236
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:10,624
Came up with a word before you do it

2237
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,160
Dammit

2238
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:16,512
I'm trying to get to that I find really interesting

2239
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,048
Realized

2240
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:20,096
Can't really

2241
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:21,888
Come up with it ahead of time

2242
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,960
Because I think that was actually going on

2243
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:25,984
Is

2244
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,544
Almost as genre of performance

2245
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:29,824
Like

2246
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:34,176
If you want to take it from like an anthropological sociological level

2247
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:35,712
Is

2248
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,480
Expressing

2249
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,784
A modern version of

2250
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,552
Performance

2251
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:41,088
Kind of an oral tradition

2252
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,624
Like the way

2253
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:44,672
Using these terms

2254
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:45,440
Susan talking about

2255
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:47,232
Comes from within

2256
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,512
Those words

2257
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:50,816
That he gives a s*** about closer

2258
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,096
Those are signals

2259
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,632
Open oral tradition

2260
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,400
Comes down

2261
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,424
From

2262
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,448
People trying

2263
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,216
To rip off

2264
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:02,592
Eastern Traditions people who have channeled aliens in the past

2265
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:06,176
All funnels down in this oral tradition

2266
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,200
And he's just trying

2267
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:08,224
To become a part of it

2268
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,248
He's trying to

2269
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:14,368
Thinking he's channeling alien

2270
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,648
I don't think he is

2271
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,744
A willing misconception

2272
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,512
That was a

2273
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,304
She's actually doing

2274
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,352
Tapping into an oral tradition

2275
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:26,400
These people have established

2276
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:27,424
In the past

2277
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,216
I don't know hundred years

2278
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:31,264
All the way back to Edgar

2279
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,032
Perkasie

2280
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:34,592
All of the people who Channel bulshit

2281
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,872
He's taking the

2282
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:38,176
Terms and taking the ideas

2283
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:40,992
From is that that's built up in his subconscious

2284
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:44,576
So when he's very looking forward

2285
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,624
Or feeling like something is

2286
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,648
He's coming through him

2287
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,672
He's

2288
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:52,512
Willingly misleading is audience into thinking it's an alien group

2289
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,560
In reality what it is is

2290
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,328
Corpus

2291
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,352
Of

2292
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:57,632
Work

2293
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:59,424
Existed from those

2294
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:03,520
Spiritual Revival of the early nineteen

2295
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:04,544
100

2296
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:10,944
Interesting go on it is actually more interesting to me than just calling

2297
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,224
Outright Charlotte

2298
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:14,016
Because then you could kind of get in

2299
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,296
To like how this

2300
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:16,576
This

2301
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:18,368
Tinuum of information

2302
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,184
When you look at it as

2303
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,208
Type of

2304
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:22,976
Performance

2305
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:30,144
I don't know I mean it's still misleading and dishonest and he's using it

2306
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:33,472
You make money off people in psychic hotline

2307
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:36,288
Becomes much more

2308
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:38,592
I think

2309
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,872
What I find in

2310
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:40,640
Interesting about

2311
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,176
Channel

2312
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,712
Play song

2313
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:44,992
All of his other

2314
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,784
The wind chime

2315
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,552
Is that

2316
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:51,136
Channeling and more

2317
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,672
Daily Affirmations

2318
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:56,768
Like he seem like he's more talking to himself in almost

2319
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:00,864
Like writing down

2320
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,656
Here's what I'm going to do I'm going

2321
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:07,520
And he's just packaging it in this

2322
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:13,920
Way because

2323
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:20,320
Some of them have to do with like Atlanta Roswell crash

2324
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:23,904
And stuff like that but because

2325
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,184
The word of the day

2326
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:29,536
Discern babe that's what we get when you start

2327
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,376
We get to the end of this and I would say that my discernment tells me

2328
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:35,424
Kevin Moore is

2329
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,704
First of all

2330
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,496
Piece of s*** to Charlotte

2331
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:40,800
Yep

2332
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:42,336
This is an elaborate

2333
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:44,384
And carries the victim

2334
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:45,920
Ensure

2335
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:46,944
Carrie sucks to

2336
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:50,272
You know no winners

2337
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:55,136
Yelled at me for saying that last time

2338
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,672
So anyway

2339
01:51:56,928 --> 01:52:00,768
This is been our Wacky Wednesday

2340
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:02,560
Stuff

2341
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:06,144
I don't know why I'm interested

2342
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,936
Has metastasized

2343
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,216
Spread

2344
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,520
Looking at

2345
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:13,056
Mark Richards interviews

2346
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,592
On Project Camelot

2347
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:16,640
Has now spun out of control where

2348
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:17,920
We were listening to

2349
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,968
Kerry interviewed by

2350
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,504
Kevin Moore

2351
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:25,856
And now we're listening to Kevin Moore being interviewed by someone else

2352
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:34,304
Stereo completely out of control everything is going crazy

2353
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,632
Terry Joyce

2354
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,912
Nothing good

2355
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:40,192
Probably hanging out with

2356
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:41,472
Steve Kelly talking about

2357
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:48,128
Avenida storm the Getty

2358
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:55,552
I believe Steven Kelly would bring a bomb

2359
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:02,208
You have to blow up the outside to get inside

2360
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:10,144
Human life would be lost

2361
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:14,752
You got to get the bomb into the center in order to get rid of the whole thing

2362
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:17,056
If you just blow up the outside that's cosmetic

2363
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:18,592
But you can always rebuild the Getty

2364
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:21,664
You're still talking about a bomb

2365
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,456
I don't like it

2366
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:26,528
So anyway

2367
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:32,928
On Friday with

2368
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:39,584
We're also on Twitter

2369
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:43,680
We are at knowledge underscore

2370
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:49,312
I'm at go to all sorts of other places are

2371
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:50,336
Free to get Podcast

2372
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,616
Around this year intern

2373
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:55,712
For now as we come to the end of it

2374
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,528
I don't think Kevin Morris killed

2375
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:00,064
Anybody that's good for him

2376
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,928
No he doesn't he's making that up

2377
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:08,512
That's all bulshit

2378
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:11,584
He's killed

2379
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:16,448
My ability now he hasn't believed this stuff before him

2380
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:21,824
The definition of discernment

2381
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:27,456
Beat that into the ground

2382
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,224
Is Alex gay

2383
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:31,296
Holding

2384
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:36,928
Alexandra Thurston color
