1
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:20,736
I'm sweating

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,088
Respectful

3
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,392
I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
Knowledge fight

5
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
Prepare for the question question

6
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,920
This one should have been prepared for this question in the past

7
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:33,696
I don't like the generally by video game

8
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,304
As soon as they come out because

9
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,632
Experience playing a game

10
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:47,264
2 years later and say generally very late to the party

11
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
Almost all the time

12
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
Exception because I had to give Tony Hawk 1 and 2

13
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,184
Out of the game first came out

14
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,304
I was unable to

15
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,128
Structure of a

16
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:31,040
Snow fun

17
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,632
Pretty self-contained

18
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,984
Enormous

19
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
And sprawling

20
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,176
A lesson about asking for what you think you want

21
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,808
Rendering

22
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,672
These areas

23
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
It's just great

24
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,424
Just Machinery itself

25
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,712
Maybe the parallel

26
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,160
And every

27
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
Nope that's the challenge

28
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,704
I got all of them as I started

29
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,008
The new remaster version

30
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664
I noticed

31
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,248
Trying to do that

32
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,280
I might

33
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
State around

34
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
Yeah yeah

35
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:37,247
U.s. open

36
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
Tennis in ever

37
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
Today

38
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,743
What playing the game the world's number-one player perhaps the best tennis player of all time or at least maybe the most perfectly constructed

39
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
Accidentally

40
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Hit one of the line judges

41
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
In the throat

42
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
So he's disqualified

43
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,871
So he played one set and then he accidentally hit the lines

44
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
U.s. open

45
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:22,303
He's an accident

46
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,703
Exactly

47
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,575
For the first time in like 10 years somebody under the age of 20

48
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
Probably going to win a major

49
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:08,639
Perhaps

50
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,599
Incapable

51
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,655
Sports 2020

52
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
Hrrr Friday episode

53
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,311
Was such a disgraceful I need money

54
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
Stop

55
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:47,295
See where his head's at

56
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Panda

57
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
See what happened how

58
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,799
Are you very much Thomas

59
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
You could absolutely take that generosity

60
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,951
X much like a tennis ball toss it up

61
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
Hit a nice serve directly into your local charity or bail fund and that is

62
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:22,015
Love you

63
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
I got to say to the confusing look at the mailbox okay

64
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Knox

65
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,695
Purse not so confusing

66
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Imagine

67
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
Epsom salts

68
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Yes

69
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Yes

70
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:50,431
EBay

71
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599
Shut up

72
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,231
Scratch

73
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
Computer

74
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Happy birthday

75
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
Could be

76
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,319
A day would be great

77
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Inside

78
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Is back

79
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Going on here

80
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Potatoes in this

81
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Bach

82
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,287
I open up the bag potatoes

83
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
Directions

84
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Yes

85
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
Potatoes

86
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,631
Because I

87
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:20,031
Furious

88
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,943
You can buy a bag of potatoes

89
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,207
I didn't know that that's not something that I'm

90
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
Actually I already got it

91
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,775
Message person who sent that

92
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,615
Yes

93
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
I do need to share this with you

94
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
Whatever you do

95
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
Do not drizzle butter

96
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
Alright

97
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
Message to me

98
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,863
Alright

99
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
Appreciate more

100
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
Or the confused

101
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
Is it a message

102
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
You know

103
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:42,207
Did not know what's going on

104
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
No I want

105
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
Sorry

106
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
Switched it up

107
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
What happens in the election

108
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Trump won

109
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,559
Secretly or publicly where

110
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Democrat

111
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
The economy hostage

112
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
War

113
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,559
Criminal scumbag

114
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
These this is going

115
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,127
Be the most contested election

116
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
Pearlridge

117
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:11,039
Anything that I would say the same about mail-in ballots was true he probably would be

118
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,927
Materials that are needed to create

119
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
No matter what

120
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,303
Yeah and whether or not the mail-in ballots thing is true they're going to say it

121
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,143
Doesn't matter yet

122
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,055
Is going to be like week afterwards

123
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
2

124
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
We predicted this

125
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
Predictive literally every single day

126
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
Advice

127
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,103
That is

128
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:13,503
Or Biden win for Trump actually want to take out the right

129
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,439
I don't know

130
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
I think that we could have

131
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,591
Starting to give me hope now

132
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,639
Is that I'm starting to see the right

133
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Pitch

134
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
Trump is the single greatest there

135
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
There's little bits of like

136
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,975
We know Trump is going to kill everybody

137
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:59,583
And it's like I've heard that kind of argument before

138
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:05,471
People who are not

139
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Come back around

140
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,663
Relationship

141
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,271
Between local and you work

142
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
Co-equal between the feds

143
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Bashar

144
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Separation of power

145
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Understatement

146
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
So you and you come in and take over the cities

147
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
The governors in August

148
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Antonio

149
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
Remove the board

150
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
Separation of powers

151
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:19,455
This is weird

152
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,071
Control local government

153
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
There is a

154
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
Constitution doesn't need

155
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
YouTube

156
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,455
Nothing is extremely constitutional

157
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:29,855
It's just in there

158
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,671
Very

159
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
Very

160
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
Degrees

161
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,663
Deserve

162
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Joe Biden

163
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Thomas

164
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
Edison was black

165
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
He said eight million.

166
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,615
Wisconsin audience

167
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:58,943
Edison's design suffer from a particular issue

168
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
According to CNN

169
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,575
His longest lasting light bulb could only last for about 15 hours

170
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
For the filament burned out

171
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
Which was essential

172
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,887
The best of electric light for people to actually use

173
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
So technically

174
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,847
Diversion

175
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,247
True

176
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:43,231
Thomas Edison just invented

177
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,631
Going to ignore that be

178
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
Alright

179
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
The great resource

180
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
Now we're a lot of children

181
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Growing up

182
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,599
You should graduate pastor

183
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,439
That's like me saying that I still apply for book it

184
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:22,399
He sees this as

185
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,215
Sjw

186
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,287
People everywhere

187
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,431

Everything by Gresham

189
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
The mental illness of the left

190
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
Making movies

193
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:15,135
Work there

194
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,512
Marc Anthony

195
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:29,216
It doesn't come from a study history

196
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:35,616
Overwhelming amount of scholarship you can find

197
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,176
Diversity in ancient empires

198
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
Is raw

199
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Coming up

Covid-19

203
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,608
That is reason for deciding is what they're going to do is

204
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
Familiar

205
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,704
Murray State Police

206
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008

00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
They have this whole war game

208
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
It's going to be Wicked

209
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224

Careful.

218
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:52,928
Just don't like a real Super Evil plan of the enemy is going to do

219
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,512
And I know they're going to do about it

220
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:01,888
I know in that situation if you're in their situation

221
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,288
What I would do instead is improve other people

222
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,176
Weasley I'm as evil as they are and their situation

223
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
Yuck LOL

224
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:21,088
William Barr rambling

225
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,392
About mail-in vote fraud

00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,512
Bad clip

228
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,288
Every subject

229
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:46,688
Remember just like a couple weeks ago

230
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:58,720
Just went off on bar for all of the ways that he was betraying Trump

231
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
I just like

232
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:08,192
Just like that I disagree

233
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,752
Guess who's a trailer

234
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
I wish people would

235
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:25,088
Listen to this and be like

236
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
Like I really like you and then you just

237
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864
He might about that

238
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
So

239
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
Upsetting but also

240
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
Because the Alex

241
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,360
Yeah you know he's he's wearing his

242
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
Is familiar

243
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,112
Metaphysically piss on people that have done this.

244
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
We go down this road

245
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,560
Survival

246
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
But the enemy

247
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,168
This will be like

248
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
It'll be alright

249
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,800
Because

250
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,176
So illogical purging

251
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Great

252
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
Okay

253
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
It's just a little weird

254
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,712
People

255
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:01,088
I just think if you knew that this was going to happen you would provide a better plan then

256
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:09,280
I just Barrel forward

257
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,680
Real strong aversion to it that I did

258
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
Infowars is about being

259
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
Gateways to then

260
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,664
Brought out the enemy so we know their real numbers

261
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
Instinctive job

262
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,648
Is the pawn sacrifice

263
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
I will tell you

264
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
More to do

265
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,168
Before we reset

266
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
Victory or death

267
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Eternity

268
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
The other side

269
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,632
You can decide what you're going to do

270
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Becomes

271
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,128
That's the sacrifice itself

272
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,992
Can survive

273
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,296
This is the true nature of

274
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
Real leadership

275
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
Okay

276
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,816
If you had somebody who's describing like the

277
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,096
Before suicide attack

278
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:53,216
I didn't want to say that kind of thing you should become suicide attacker

279
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
What we are is the Vanguard

280
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
I don't think he understands how Chatsworth

281
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
No

282
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,048
In order to

283
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,472
Great

284
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240

00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:32,896
Where is Ray Lewis

286
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576

Sprouts

292
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,896
The kind of affixation more than anything else

293
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,040
Constantly talking about it

294
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696

295
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,680

Characterization of all the black women

00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:03,136
Involved in protest picking up herself is

342
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624

Cinema way

They should take all of them over to the

Make sure they have no way of coming back

357
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,976
That way you don't have to worry about him anymore

358

As a system of government

362
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:16,000
If I were a reality TV show

Give up before you begin

532
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,367

00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,415
Power numbers

594
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,535
How many

595
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,351
Do we have to gather in math

596
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,655
Maybe once a month

597
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,263
We have to gather and show them what they're really up

598
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,967
The globalist have all this

599
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,367
Is their main opposition

600
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
More than that

601
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,855
So you want you want to run

602
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:39,743
Do you listen to my Ibotta food truck

603
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:52,287
Getting together for a rally that's

604
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:56,127
Not as big as it used to be

605
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,343
Zester

606
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
Queer

607
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,159
If they want the produce

608
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:11,743
No I mean the right-wing is done pork

609
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,279

Centra store

611
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,887
Somebody in the protest movement

612
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,655
Just enough

613
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:25,055
To get them to break away and then they don't have the same power

614
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,663
Not doing it right now because I accidentally elected

615
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:36,063
You just can't give up a little bit so it's not hard

616
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,879
A little bit and you go back to normal

617
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,439
A winning formula

618
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:50,399
Worst

619
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:57,823
I'm not even going to dignify

620
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:11,135
That we're fine with metal

621
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:20,095
Before we go

622
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,431

01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,703
So I from an Australian

628
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:03,103
Australian accent

629
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:09,503
Disgraceful understated

630
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,767
Just say like I'll see you I'll see you on the street

631
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,071
That's great

632
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:30,495
Can't you accept

633
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,031
Never bothered without one

634
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:38,431
Like I've always had to do voices in order to get by there

635
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,295
Oh s*** now I got to find it

636
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,559
So everything

637
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:01,983
You know everything's minimized

638
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:07,103

Lovely

645
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:50,783
