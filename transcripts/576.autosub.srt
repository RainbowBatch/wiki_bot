Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:01,952
Dot-com

4
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,536
Blues Licks it around the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,096
Jones

6
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
Jordan

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
What's up Jordan is worth checking in on bees Survivor re-watch

8
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,592
Continued and I have more thoughts

9
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,920
Did you hear the news out today no

10
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,712
5S project

11
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,320
Veritas has been using a former Survivor contestant is a Honeypot trap

12
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,624
What's this

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,024
I think it was 38 season she was allies masquerade yearly so that

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
No I have not

15
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,144
I do not know I know there is a later Survivor contestant who is

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
Become like a trump

17
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Person

18
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752
The same one but

19
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,360
It's definitely not Elisabeth Hasselbeck from Elizabeth

20
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
Filarski / Hasselbeck

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,016
April from the Australian season who I thought was great and then

22
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,320
So I've been watching it

23
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:06,208
I think this is an interesting Dynamic that goes throughout like some of the early Seasons that is like

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,792
They start to realize that they need to make the show

25
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Familiar enough

26
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:16,192
That it's like the same but also different enough each season

27
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
That's it it's not

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Stale

29
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
Exactly

30
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,640
Tension a little bit and I think it's really well done

31
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664
Infer about the first

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Four Season

33
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,576
You're already past Four Seasons how much farther

34
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
Through those

35
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
And then I got to the fifth

36
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
Season and I could not watch it

37
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,744
I don't know what it was I was just like

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
I

39
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
Don't like this

40
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
It stinks

41
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Okay

42
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,008
No I wasn't really worried that like okay

43
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,408
I guess everything fell apart the fifth season

44
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,224
And I like I can't be too sure what I have to do is

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
There's nobody forcing me to watch

46
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
I was skipping

47
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
I don't care you don't have to immediately I was like I love this again

48
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
It was the cast about what was going on

49
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Is actually

50
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Fantastic

51
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
I really enjoyed it

52
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
7th Season great

53
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
Rupert

54
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:29,664
Is the Miami efforts this year passed into the actual zeitgeist

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,016
Survivor comes back

56
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
And such and I don't know if things

57
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Turn bad

58
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,136
I've no idea

59
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
So if I

60
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
If you did end up becoming like a real.

61
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
Dick head or something please don't judge me for it

62
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,096
At this point all I know is that if you was also in season 7

63
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52,192
Spoiler alerts for a thirty-year-old joey

64
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,520
It's amazing how immediate is food like

65
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
This guy is

66
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,896
Oh okay so everybody just suddenly passed to the king like okay

67
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
Hey f****** let's do it

68
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,968
People on the island of the show is

69
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
Clearly like

70
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
Presenting him

71
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:12,672
And I like that I think it's probably partially sincere that he's just a big-hearted guy

72
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,791
But I would always watch that season

73
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,959
Everybody f****** love in this bearded hippie dude and I want to like older I get

74
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,055
Is a very Magnetic Personality

75
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
One of the things that I've recognized

76
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Is is that

77
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Season 6

78
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
I think

79
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
Is where things

80
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
Sword of Begin to Fall Apart

81
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
And that is

82
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,879
Because season six has be first instance that I've really found

83
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,207
How somebody who's really relishing being a sociopath

84
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,607
Oh those people yeah maybe Greg and season 1

85
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
Or Rob Boston Rob maybe even earlier

86
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
Those two guys are

87
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Kind of dicks

88
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,103
Right and there are people who are dicks

89
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
6in black Richard hatch's

90
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Is a dick

91
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
You'll be polite to each other but

92
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Rob

93
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
On season 6

94
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
He seems to

95
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Take

96
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
Pleasure

97
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
Audi

98
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,719
King with people is kind of characters

99
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,023
That felt a little bit like okay

100
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
I know that a lot of other people past this point

101
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Aronov Lake

102
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
And it's become

103
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,519
My confessionals and all of my talking to the camera is just like

104
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,919
I lied to this guy and I love it

105
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,735
From then you could have a trophy room filled with ears

106
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:50,463
Who clearly was

107
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
I like lying

108
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,071
I don't play

109
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:01,471
Yeah that's really worried that there is now this

110
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Trend of like

111
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,823
This is how you get attention this how you rise above the

112
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
The Fray

113
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
Maybe you don't win the show but you

114
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,039
You become a character and that to me is like a metagame that I'm not interested in and I think is actually

115
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Destructive to

116
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,951
The enjoyment of the show that's what happened to everybody you know everybody knows this about the bachelor now like

117
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
At a certain point

118
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,071
All the sudden stops being about whatever the

119
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,887
Jeff is supposed to because it never really was what we all crazy

120
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
And then it starts being like

121
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
I'm jacking to become the neck

122
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
Next Bachelor and then maybe that'll turn my into a career you know so everybody always

123
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
Fifth episode conversation with

124
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,527
For the right reason you like all my God we do this every year

125
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
Yeah that's kind of why I think

126
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Fake baby Eva

127
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
Season 8 is

128
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
Does like actual beginning of the end

129
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,231
Yeah because season 8 is All Stars

130
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,791
Oh yeah people back

131
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,375
I think that incentivised some of that

132
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Behavior

133
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,447
Of like

134
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
In this

135
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
As opposed to

136
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Like no you're one-and-done

137
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,895
There's nothing coming from this ya play the game dammit

138
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
I think that awareness

139
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
Is a little bit of

140
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
It's something

141
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
That is within

142
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
The game itself that

143
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
Doesn't belong there

144
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
Not sustainable

145
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,303
And I'm worried I'm worried that we've already reached

146
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
The point where it's like wow

147
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:37,727
I think it's going to get a rear end and we haven't even gotten to the point where they're hidden immunity idol.

148
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,311
Where the game becomes hyper complicated

149
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:47,199
Yeah you know I wonder if that's kind of a very similar trajectory that wrestling took as as like that

150
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,503
Kayfabe started a break and everybody was

151
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,111
You know that people knew about all that stuff in the mad but then it became part of the ACT

152
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Actual

153
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
But Global watching of the the Show wrestling is now also including the metagame

154
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,607
And I think the same thing happens with Survivor where it's like

155
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,703
Once everybody becomes aware of it there's that loss of everybody's like

156
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
And all that stuff

157
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,639
And then it builds back up again when everybody's like well now that I know the metagame is part of the game

158
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
A better game is on top of that metagame

159
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
That's just another day

160
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
You know how you

161
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
A beat back again

162
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
And I don't know how you do like

163
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
30 more seasons of the Mist

164
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
Without it completely becoming

165
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Unattainable

166
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
Marvel movies we had

167
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
Half the universe die

168
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
True Religion

169
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,895
I know you're tired of tennis

170
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,295
So I won't give you any tennis bright spots and in fact I don't have any Barrio tennis

171
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
The Wimbledon again

172
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,231
To tie both Rafael and Federer with 20 most grand slams of all time

173
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
Djokovic is undoubtedly going to break

174
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:11,167
Those records and then probably beat Serena's open-era record 223 because he's a robot

175
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
And I heard

176
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,031
So he's either he'll the biggest heel

177
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
But I will say my breakspot Dan is

178
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,663
The night at which you are listening to this on Monday night

179
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
Is the Home Run Derby

180
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
All of it

181
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:30,367
Normally I never watch the Home Run Derby I don't really care last year or two years ago

182
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Hit the

183
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,207
Salute ever-loving s*** out of the ball and it was amazing

184
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
Shohei ohtani baby

185
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Take the picture

186
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,679
The picture who is leading the league in homeruns in 33

187
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:49,567
That's not

188
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
I look picture

189
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,015
Outrageous

190
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,807
Wow he's a god

191
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,903
Well I am I'm excited I may watch this Home Run Derby 2

192
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
He's going to hit

193
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
Are you going to hit a ball

194
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
Well over 500

195
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,839
I always liked that Home Run Derby me and Nikki get

196
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,119
Nobody naked gif

197
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,679
You still sit around and watch the Home Run Derby

198
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
Yeah

199
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:24,895
It was fun for a while but then they added this new like you have a

200
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Time limit

201
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,319
And if you hit enough homeruns you get like bonus time and all that it's 11

202
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
July 9th

203
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:45,375
I exploited that this is Friday's episode

204
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,447
I thought I would check in at the end of last week

205
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,543
See what's going on I know that my Friday was very

206
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
We put out the episode

207
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
Alarm show and then

208
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,783
Yeah and then you texted me in the morning and I get the same

209
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,391
Nothing to do with our episodes

210
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,951
Intensely weird timing

211
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
So probably going to

212
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
Address the fact that is

213
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Little baby bigger

214
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
Friend got the boot

215
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:24,287
It is no longer necessarily profitable throughout have on the network

216
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,151
I thought that might be interesting and nothing to do with that

217
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
Azimut to think things to go over so we will do that but first

218
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,551
It's a little moment say hello to some new walks

219
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,855
First Noah also happy birthday Mom

220
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
You are now policy walk

221
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,207
Happy birthday Noah welcome to the wall

222
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:48,607
Is a better offer than JK Rowling

223
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
As if possible thank you

224
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
Unfortunately that is not possible

225
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,847
So Hillary website

226
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,991
I don't know if these are codes

227
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:10,111
Messages that are like activating something

228
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
How's your 401k

229
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
Money off that heroin

230
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Freakishly large

231
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Before we do the episode

232
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Get into this

233
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
Are we going to get

234
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
If we have to

235
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,439
Giving someone life is giving someone dead

236
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
You can say that

237
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Life is death

238
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
You good

239
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
Happy birthday

240
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
Also Christopher

241
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
Reached out this this might be

242
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
I love

243
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Giving people a birthday

244
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,247
I got to be honest this might be excessive

245
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,231
I swear to God we are just

246
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,095
Not trying to do that we may have to end the season of

247
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,679
Birthday shout out and not because of Krista

248
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,519
For anything like that pictures

249
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:36,127
We might have to to real this in a little bit it's definitely getting out of control

250
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
Control your butt

251
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,575
Elana and Brian just had a birthday so happy birthday also Christopher's best man

252
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Sweating

253
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Robert

254
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,975
Robert has birthday

255
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
I don't know exact code is that

256
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:58,911
Activating some sleeper cells at work

257
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,239
Happy Birthday to everybody

258
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,311
So Jordan here we are

259
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Ammonite

260
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
Begin the show

261
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Some severe covid

262
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Last we heard

263
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,855
Alex talking about elevator cause 82% of people to lose Brakeman seats

264
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,183
Turns out there is more trouble

265
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Basically

266
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
These vaccines are straight of killing

267
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
Everybody

268
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,959
Mom 45

269
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
A job at John Hopkins

270
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Hospital dies

271
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
John Hopkins Hospital

272
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
After she got the

273
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
And I said yeah the vaccine reaction

274
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
Until all the blood vessels

275
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Along

276
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Horrifyingly painful death

277
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,719
Great shape and totally happy

278
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
Then a doornail

279
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
Within a few days

280
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:06,495
So the case that Alex is covering is about a person named spring Saunders and there's a number of problem

281
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
The way that he's reporting

282
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
In the story

283
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,103
The first problem is that all of his primary sources

284
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
It's just limited

285
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Screencaps it someone took

286
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
From Facebook post

287
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
That's not

288
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,527
Exactly accurate to be honest

289
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,623
The story from a Blog called the Empower or which intern just took all their reporting for

290
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Facebook posts

291
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Great name

292
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,463
It's all good and well to take some open-source

293
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
Information from Facebook

294
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
Proposed

295
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
Suddenly aware that anything you read might be intensely by us

296
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
Only telling half a story or could just be completely made up

297
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,031
In this case the woman in question does appear that existed there's a memorial page

298
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
You can find online

299
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
Conclusions that Alex's jump

300
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
You are completely not damaged

301
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
Castrated by the primary source

302
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
Nothing available present

303
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
Presented indicates that anyone

304
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,087
It said that her death was proven to be from a vaccine reaction

305
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
Nothing in the article indicates

306
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,927
Their brain swelled until all the vessels pop

307
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,999
And Alex is just writing a compelling story to tell his audience

308
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
Some of the other details here don't match up

309
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,655
But the primary sources that Alex's article presents but I honestly feel like bringing up to

310
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Specific

311
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
It kind of feels like

312
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,519
Splitting hairs and it might come off as disrespectful to the woman who passed

313
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Tanner family

314
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Which I don't want to be

315
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,407
My only Point here is that Alex is jumping to a conclusion they can't prove any of

316
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Is that he's reporting

317
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,551
Also if you try to find this story just by Googling the words in the headline you'll find another interest

318
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Recent story

319
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,159
Another 45 year-old woman Trisha Jones died this week

320
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,743
From covid Delta variant having refused to get vaccinated

321
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,583
Her mother told the local news quote she was afraid of the side effects I think

322
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
You hear a lot of horror stories

323
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,679
I myself when I had the shot it was rough

324
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
So it scared her and freaked her out

325
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
So she didn't want to do it

326
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
I couldn't convince her

327
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:50,687
Also there's an article in the BBC from my April and it discussed the incidence of people having Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis

328
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,015
After having received the Pfizer or moderna vaccine

329
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
This 30 reviewed electronic records

330
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,903
Of 81 million us patients and found that the risk of this thrombosis quote

331
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
He's 82 10 times higher in people with covid

332
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Then those who got the vaccine

333
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:10,655
Of course it should be pointed out the drunk hard conclusions from this study isn't really possible and there's review that needs to

334
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
Indications

335
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,751
Pure to show the people have a far greater risk of this

336
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Condition metallic

337
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
Does making his audience

338
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,103
Really afraid of if they get covid

339
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
Then if they get back

340
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
Just playing game

341
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
No I mean

342
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
If you

343
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:30,367
What is it it's like 90 it's at least 98 to 99% of all covid deaths now are

344
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Unvaccinated

345
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Play

346
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
Alex has the exact opposite staff who have talked about later so hold on to that

347
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
Version of reality that sound fair

348
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:47,263
I can be in this

349
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,823
Of somebody who died

350
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
Blaming of the vaccine.

351
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,199
Beautiful young Italian girl killed

352
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
Brain surgeon

353
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
Brain surgeon

354
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
Said he's never seen

355
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
A brain

356
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,439
I've never seen anything like this

357
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
Thrombosis

358
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
A neurological trauma

359
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:22,079
I know this for me it's a red flag when a headline do you know you're talking about

360
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
Discusses how the subject of the story is beautiful

361
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
Right off the bat

362
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,479
That's the Hallmark of a

363
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,295
Journalism

364
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Turn the 1940s

365
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,671
This is a headline from citizenfreepress which is another attempt at making

366
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,999
King Anu drudgereport.com right-wing link aggregator

367
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
Headlines meant to be attention-grabbing at the

368
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
The expense of journalistic Integrity so we're off to bed

369
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
This story is about a young girl named

370
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,263
Camilla canepa and comments that are surgeons

371
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
Gian Luigi Zona made after her death

372
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
I have never seen a brain that was effect

373
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
Goodbye such extensive in

374
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
Severe thrombosis

375
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:04,063
Seems slightly unethical for a doctor to make comments like that but actually a world-renowned

376
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,391
Maybe things are different in Italy I don't know

377
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,303
About their number reasons to think the kidnappers death was not directly caused by the vaccine even though that's how it's being reported

378
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
Boarded by people like out

379
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
Was it because she was hit by a car

380
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Oh okay that would have been in

381
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,263
The first thing is that you got vaccinated on May 25th and only died this

382
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
This past week

383
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:30,687
It's a little bit of a long time to have him between these events in order to make a definitive connection

384
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
6 weeks right yeah the second reason

385
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,343
To be suspicious is far more

386
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,183
Which is that there's some reporting going around for medical officials that can make my headache

387
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Chronic condition

388
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
Called familial autoimmune

389
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
Thrombocytopenia

390
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,583
Which affects the ability of the body to create enough blood

391
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:53,471
It appears that this condition was known prior to vaccination but investigators are trying to determine

392
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,543
If it was known to the people who administer the vaccine

393
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,895
Since we probably shouldn't have given the increased risk that her condition would have put her in

394
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:05,759
Can I receive the vaccine at a quote open vaccination day so it remains an open

395
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
Question about how

396
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
Bulova medical history was known as

397
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
The time door if

398
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
There was an awareness

399
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
The people should have had and then ignored

400
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:20,863
Conversely there's also reporting that says her parents have commented the quote she had no disease

401
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
I'm not sure what that, does it

402
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
Response to or any of the surrounding context

403
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
Isn't finding information on that has been

404
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Challenge

405
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,847
This quote is the only thing that they were cited In Articles and Outlets

406
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
Where they

407
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
Casually called

408
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Can I beautiful

409
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
Icna there headlines

410
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Stop

411
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:42,111
There appears to be a bit more to the story than we know at this point an important thing to remember is that

412
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,183
The previous story about the woman who work

413
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Route to Johns Hopkins

414
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:51,327
That had to do that that was in America and then had to do with the Pfizer or moderna vaccine

415
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Theirs has

416
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
To do with an AstraZeneca vaccine which

417
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,983
She's not an mRNA vaccine it's not used in the United States

418
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,079
Blurring the line between a pretending that the

419
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
Different things

420
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
Completely different

421
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
Vaccines are having

422
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
The same

423
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Side effects

424
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,575
Killing off everybody and identical

425
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
Fezzari

426
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
It's not

427
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,952
Yeah I just don't know how we're ever going to deal with this it without a certain

428
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Kind of like

429
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
Reckoning of like hay

430
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,840
Ninety-nine percent of people are dying because they're on back

431
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Vaccinated

432
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,192
40% of Republicans refuse to get unvaccinated almost

433
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
Entirely

434
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,496
Because of this level of prop

435
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
Opaganda.

436
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
Their face

437
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
So

438
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,688
In no way is the propaganda not responsible for at this point in time

439
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,992
Massive percentage of Coke

440
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
That's right

441
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
Like it can't be

442
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,624
Cannot be said any other way

443
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
Like that

444
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
The influence

445
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
Seems very direct

446
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
Very understandable

447
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
Drawing

448
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072
A concrete Linebaugh

449
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,912
Between the individual disseminator of the information and the people who are

450
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,520
You know making me stress is to not get vaccinated a Barrette that's more of a challenge

451
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,872
But yeah it doesn't it it seems it seems like it's pretty hard to argue that

452
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
Like that influence

453
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,200
Is leading people to make a lot of bad decisions

454
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,248
Sprite that are having consequences

455
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Canby Ferry

456
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:18,112
Yeah it can't be a I'm not going to say like oh okay every night went

457
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,440
Tucker goes to sleep he is responsible for another hundred.

458
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Cats or anything like

459
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,280
Like that as part of the right-wing ecosystem

460
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
It is the right wing

461
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
Again the ecosystem that is killing

462
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
You know as a whole

463
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:37,312
All 99%

464
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
Constable yeah it in the largest part

465
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,432
You know it definitely it definitely seems like that and it seems

466
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,480
Also add additionally

467
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:50,368
Difficult to figure out exactly what you do about that elderly on an individual actor bases held because of

468
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
You know how do you

469
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928
Prove a concrete mixer

470
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah

471
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
Spongy assholes

472
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,608
So Alex has some bills that he wants to talk about

473
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,632
But have fun number

474
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400

Well it's official

United

480
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
That means whatever they

Add

The bill is 666

485
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
Contact tracers coming

The trace Act

495
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
Foreshorten

496
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:04,096
Who's introduced in the house on May 1st 2020 and it died in committee before even receiving

497
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
NFL 2016

498
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:10,240
Even come close. Alex is talking about

499
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
Close to being committed

500
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
Committee

501
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Don't even vote

502
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,224
This is what that Alex talked about a lot you made a big deal out of the number being

503
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,552
But he didn't even follow up with it or care enough to notice

504
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
But it died in committee

505
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,112
The other stuff is just kind of

506
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Madoff

507
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
In the 100s

508
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
16th Congress which was last

509
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
Are there were four bills

510
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
Also the number 66

511
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
None of them even received a vote and one of them was a senate resolution quote honoring the faithful and unwavering service of

512
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,752
Civil Air transport and air America to the United States

513
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
Civil Air

514
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Transport

515
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Cat

516
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,640
And air America

517
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
Put that around at a knesset probably Satan

518
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
Sure

519
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:59,392
News the Senate resolution that was just like good job Civil Air transport and that didn't even get a vote

520
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:04,000
F****** Congress we have a new 666 bill because they count

521
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,424
We're now in the 117th Congress and in the house ayonna Presley introduced the anti-racism in public

522
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
Health Act of 2021

523
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
This seats

524
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,032
Quotes to amend the Public Health Service Act

525
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
To provide

526
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,408
Research and investment

527
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,456
Structural racism and police violence

528
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,528
This doesn't seem like what Alex is talking about

529
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
Unfortunately also it'll almost certainly dying

530
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,416
Do anything to help people will die

531
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,744
On the Senate side we have another very Sinister Bill 6

532
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
66

533
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Quote

534
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:42,912
Ability to modify the criteria used by the Corps of Engineers to dredge small ports

535
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,472
Devil Rays

536
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,824
This will also probably won't pass and it was introduced by Ram

537
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Paul

538
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,664
Real numbers don't hold some kind of secret signific

539
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,968
Alex never really take the time to update

540
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,760
It's past the point where they have gotten

541
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,296
Very stale

542
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
Is a great example of

543
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
Stampy's forgotten

544
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
To check in and see if that's

545
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,184
666 overpass

546
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
I I just

547
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
I know it's

548
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Stupid

549
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,840
But if we're going to live with hotels not having

550
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,936
13th floors let's just live with congress not having sex

551
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,264
Let's just do it just skip 666

552
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,592
660-520-6422

553
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:27,456
Let's just get it out of the way I'm sick of people being like Oh it mean something

554
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,272
Well I think that it's okay

555
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
To have superstition

556
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
In the private

557
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Sector

558
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,136
I would feel worse if

559
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
The government

560
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,560
Change their behavior based on some people's weird version to a number

561
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
That might that might be a little bit

562
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,960
F***** up you know Stones get worn down you know

563
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,800
The Rushing Water will wear Stone down over time

564
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,848
Eventually you just go underwater

565
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
I guess

566
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
So Alex is mad about this

567
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,248
There's something else he's even more mad about

568
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
The

569
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,464
City-sponsored in San Francisco

570
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,816
Corruptor children were coming for your children

571
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
We're going to recruit your children

572
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
Giant

573
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,288
Porsche

574
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,104
Well now they come out and say

575
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,152
Oh they were just baiting us

576
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
They don't really mean it

577
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,392
Who is a couple of important points about the video Alex is talking about

578
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,696
The first thing is that the Men's Chorus

579
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
Did not remove

580
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
The video from the internet

581
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,816
It's still very much up on their YouTube channel and you can find it

582
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
Incredibly easily

583
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:54,752
Alex is claiming that they took it down because that makes it seems like there's some sort of guilt or it's suspicious in some way

584
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
What is audiences

585
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,640
I watch the whole video I'm just going to play you the first verse here bike down

586
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,224
You can hear it

587
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
What they're doing

588
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
As we celebrate

589
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
Fight on the progress we've made over these

590
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
Last year is there still work to be

591
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,928
Still working against equal rights

592
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
Read the message.

593
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:25,728
Respect

594
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:33,920
Corrupt

595
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:42,368
You're correct

596
00:28:54,656 --> 00:29:00,800
Making

597
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,224
Will make them tolerant and fair

598
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
If they're doing there

599
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,856
It's a hundred percent meant to f*** with people

600
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Yep yep

601
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,672
Yep

602
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
Mad

603
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,512
Did the response though people like Alex or the right-wingers

604
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:26,912
Just so it definitely predictable and it's a little embarrassing embarrassing

605
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,728
Bigotry it's actually hear what's being said leads to shortcut

606
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
It's in the big shortcut here

607
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,288
Is it

608
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,592
This song is actually about cruelty to children

609
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,408
At the lazy hateful it's also just

610
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:43,808
Dumb also it leads Alex to desperately try to pretend not to be a homophobe because he wants to attend

611
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,624
This

612
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
Specifically Hazel

613
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
Okay

614
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
So how am I going to do this

615
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
I might have to dance around this

616
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:56,864
I guess I'll use identical rhetoric to the stuff that Nick Fuentes was saying on our last episode

617
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,936
Oh no no no

618
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,336
People who are

619
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
Homosexual in the world

620
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,920
You're not tell molesters and

621
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
Not bad people

622
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
Recycle child molesters in there

623
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
You need to not let

624
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
The pedophiles

625
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,672
Claim that they run your boo because they do that

626
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,768
We're getting threats

627
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,072
Perceptual

628
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,680
Choices because

629
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,520
A bunch of creepy men singing a song about your coming for our children

630
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,944
Elementary students how to masturbate

631
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
That was

632
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
What teachers need

633
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,928
The peanut

634
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:01,632
Alex was lying about Jocelyn elders and she said

635
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:08,032
You know what that has to do with her just tossed in there for some reason he was grasping at straws

636
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,616
That's not good they should just sing

637
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,040
Anytime he says something like that turn it into a song

638
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,624
Glen Elder

639
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Peaches York

640
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
Children who masturbate

641
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,488
I feel like it would be tough to get Alex's

642
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
Voice in

643
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,304
Any kind

644
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Note

645
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,120
Downloaded song

646
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
Yeah I think

647
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,216
This is another one of those

648
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
Assertive

649
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
To strawman

650
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Arguing

651
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,384
It's the same sort of thing that Alex does with

652
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,432
You know at times with Muslim

653
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
Sounds like why won't Muslim groups

654
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,504
The cry

655
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,088
Tons and tons of examples of it that he has just ignored

656
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
And it's

657
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,696
The same thing with lgbtq + community

658
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
Having to fight

659
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,024
Do not be associated

660
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,816
With people

661
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
Who like children

662
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,376
Trying to game

663
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Level of

664
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
Acceptance and

665
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
Association with

666
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
That Community they have to

667
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
Hush

668
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Against that

669
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
That Association

670
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,944
Because if that co-option is always

671
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,784
A part of it it goes back here years and years

672
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
And Alec

673
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,600
Will not accept the

674
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
Multitude of voices

675
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,464
Love people in the lgbtq

676
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
By a community

677
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
This is not

678
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,072
This is not part of our thing

679
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,400
They just pretend to feel like I'll run by

680
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,680
I know.

681
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
That's your

682
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Smear

683
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,336
Exactly that's that's what you've decided to accept

684
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,872
In order for you to

685
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,176
Pretend to not hate gay people

686
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
Wellbeing again

687
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
Any

688
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
Modicum of

689
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,576
Right that the community

690
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:00,416
And this is this is just ridiculous because it's essentially sharing an onion

691
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,488
I mean that's basically what it is if you being like

692
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,144
I can't believe that died that this publication

693
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
This is a f****** onion article

694
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
Do your f******

695
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
Stupid

696
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah I was watching it and I'm like this is a little bit

697
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,896
Maybe

698
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
It's a fun song in

699
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,504
And what have you been

700
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,832
It white when you're making it you kind of have to know like

701
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,904
This is really going to piss off

702
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
So

703
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,744
Unbelievably tailored

704
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:40,864
Just for these people they're the only

705
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
Show me people who listen

706
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
Do it more than once

707
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:49,312
Everybody else was listening to in their life

708
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:54,944
Give me an anger boner

709
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
Thinking about while I was

710
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
I don't think that they

711
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
A wrong

712
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
To make this song

713
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
Worried about like

714
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
Review make

715
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Something that is this

716
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,000
Kind of pointed of aperitif

717
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,816
And satire and like

718
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,376
F*** you and whatever you're stupid

719
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
But beliefs are about

720
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
What's coming to corrupt

721
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Your children and stuff

722
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
If you do that

723
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
That could be

724
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,568
Put people in danger like

725
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
I would not be surprised if

726
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,760
It leads to an increase in harassment of Cisco gay men's chorus

727
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:33,856
Or whatever I hope it doesn't escalate to violence

728
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,648
It's it's

729
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,696
In the landscape that we're in right now

730
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Seems like

731
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
Rave movies

732
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
Even more than it is like

733
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Interesting

734
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
Funny video movie

735
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
It would be

736
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,008
It'd be like if comet

737
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Pizza like

738
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Built

739
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:59,456
But seller under their place and then made a recreation of all the conspiracy theories

740
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:05,856
The ball pit exactly the same that people were expecting to find out there

741
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
They gave tours

742
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
Maybe like yeah

743
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,488
Okay you guys maybe have gone too far with the center

744
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
I get it.

745
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,816
MMA like a music video of them

746
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:21,216
I'm creating the bass Hillary Clinton

747
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Whole thing

748
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
But Sir Alex is pretty mad about this

749
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,152
The entire show on it cuz there's other

750
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,688
Equally less important

751
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,272
Things to deal with

752
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
Best footage

753
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,880
A comet

754
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Running around in

755
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
California

756
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,096
Up the side of

757
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
A building

758
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,264
And setting

759
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,104
The cross on fire

760
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,176
And then jumping

761
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
From building

762
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
To building

763
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
Someone out of

764
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,720
Dr. Jekyll

765
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
What

766
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
I would have gone with Spider-Man

767
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,728
Spider-Man dad and if Spider-Man

768
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:32,128
Climbs up a church building building

769
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,528
So this week

770
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
Just boxers and socks

771
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,344
Fox climbed up a church Roofing

772
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,624
Set a small fire

773
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,952
Hero hero

774
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,024
It's probably someone on drugs

775
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,328
Newsweek quote the Los Angeles Fire Department

776
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
Confirm that these small Church

777
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,424
Rupphire was fully extinguished in the LAPD

778
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,472
I'm sorry lafd arson

779
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
Is currently

780
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
Conducting a fire-related

781
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,592
Navigation to the guy was apprehended in other real.

782
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
Details are known about it

783
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
This time

784
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
This could be

785
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,688
Be a story that

786
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
Includes a whole bunch of

787
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,296
Different details like

788
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
Baby

789
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,368
Who knows what the actual story

790
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,720
I think it's pretty clear how Alex is going to cover it is like this

791
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,256
There are

792
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
Hundreds of churches

793
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:26,656
A week in Europe main burn the majority have been burned to the ground

794
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:34,080
Wow the Muslims and a Consortium of devil worshipers just spiritually

795
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,176
Go and burn them down the news covers up

796
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Oh

797
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,808
Other media coverage

798
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,880
So after the 2019 fire at Notre Dame

799
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:51,232
France embarked on a two-month investigation which determine the cause of the fire was an accident

800
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,536
With the leading suspect the cause of being an electric

801
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:59,936
Short circuit or an errant cigarette the most likely things to happen to one of the most protected landmarks in for

802
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,008
There's no evidence whatsoever that this is a target

803
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,080
And Alex couldn't defend that claim if his life

804
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
Ended on it

805
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,128
Reality

806
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
The fire that happened

807
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:12,992
The Notre Dame could have possibly been a miner event but there were a series of mistakes

808
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,528
That were made that led to the fire become

809
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
The crisis

810
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:20,672
The first issue was the attic where the fire broke out at no firewall protection and no sprinklers

811
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
In place

812
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,000
The second issue is that the person who worked at

813
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
The cathedral who is response

814
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,608
Communicating with firefighters about where the fire was quote

815
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,680
Was only on his third day on the job

816
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:38,848
Smokey been detected but quote according to the report when the fire alarm went off at 6:18 p.m. the guard sent to

817
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,384
Check on the Fly

818
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,176
Went to the wrong building

819
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,224
The Sacristy not the Attic

820
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
Seriously delay the response effort

821
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,856
These variables are unfortunate and they combined

822
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:54,464
Blood result in a really bad fire but none of it proves any Foul Play behind it

823
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,560
I remember watching the show Infowars that is around the time of the fire

824
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,144
The only evidence I remember being offered to prove that it was arson was the

825
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,776
Paul Joseph Watson black people with Muslim sounding names reacting with heart emojis

826
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
Auto Facebook

827
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
Book stream of coverage of the fire

828
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,224
Is unconvincing stuff but Alex knows that his audience doesn't remember that he never proved that one so now he can do

829
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,552
Is playing the media covered up that Notre Dame was an RC

830
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,088
Whatever

831
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,112
Just sofa

832
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
Funny

833
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:28,256

Brutal real world

838
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,640
That's a nightmare I'm sorry I don't want no turd

839
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
What happened on our first or second days of work and just imagining global news story

840
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:57,696
Awful nightmare

841
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
JCPenney's

842
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,304
Stole a couple shirts and it was like a big deal of it

843
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:09,472
But that did not make the news not not Notre Dame fire

844
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,520
Square your boss your training bus

845

It's your first few days

00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,920
It's going to take a little while to settle in everybody makes mistakes

848
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
But it's Notre Dame on

849
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,528
You are so fired

850
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,320
We're putting you

851
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,624
In the burning building that's what we have

852
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
Have to do.

853
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,232
Turns out these people like the guy who climbed

854
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,536

Winning that lowered state

860
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,616
Conscious mind

861
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,920
Spirit has been removed from the control

862
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,480
Nothing more than Avatar

863
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,272
Driven by a force

864
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,368
That desires to burn down churches and rape children

865
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,000
And if you go to any Democrat event you go to 185 and are even go to a main line

869
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,264
Start sticking their tongues out and licking their lips

870
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
That sounds true

871
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Countless times

872
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640

You know it's it's a little bit

876
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
I resent

877
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:40,096
The idea of demonic possession has become so boring

878
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,144

Suggested that somebody was possessed by a demon

894
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,863
It would be

895
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,399
Amazingly huge

896
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,935

898
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,591
Alex is like oh it's

00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
Add

933
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:04,991
By shaking their butt naked man and the looks on their faces and how they act

934
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
They are enslaved

935
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,367
There is a spirit in control of them

936
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
And it's hideous

937
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,279
Doesn't wife on this Earth

938
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,119
How to make sure the children

939
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,143
Buy chickens

940
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,959
Swallowed into a satanic

941
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
Best Buy

942
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,335
So please remember that any signs of

943
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,895
Femininity

944
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
Andaman

945
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,503
Is definitely

946
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,831
Wow. Remind me when I used to run an open mic

947
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,367
Early on

948
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:47,743
You know the always have trouble with people running the light for whatever reason you do people sometimes

949
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:52,095
My Gmail

950
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,727
Every time that would happen you know I've seen so many shows where people would walk up and it be

951
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,287
An altercation or they would just not

952
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,055
Take people up

953
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
The stage you know Inlet

954
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,663
Certain people go for 20 30 40 minutes you know that kind of thing

955
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:10,783
I always what I would do is I would slowly start dancing through the middle of the

956
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,807
The crowd and just kind of

957
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,207
Get everybody paying attention to me and just dancing really loud not being mean or anything and then by the time I got to

958
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
The stage

959
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,255
The comic would just be like

960
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,559
And then just leave

961
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,375
If you know sir that is how you get rid of Alex Jones

962
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Cops involved

963
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,959
You get a bunch of people to just shake their butts

964
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,751
Sit him until he goes away

965
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:37,151
But you can't you can't make a demonic video where it's just a bunch of dudes shaking their butts and your likes

966
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,551
I see it as being like you get to like a March

967
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
Yao Ming height

968
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:49,183
Big conga line I'm just like are at work we're done with this b*******

969
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,719
I just follow Alex

970
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,535
Susan couple tuba players goat

971
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,119
Auto rental ban

972
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,983
Totally just do that

973
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:08,383
So I would say I don't know who these people shake their butt at Alex R I don't know

974
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,663
That happened if they did his own

975
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,687
Almost certainly

976
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
Without me

977
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,247
I hope I don't know they look like

978
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,295
But I do know from the video of

979
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,831
The San Francisco Court

980
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
Those people do not look anything up

981
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:25,023
A group of a lot of men who look very different

982
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,815
I don't know what

983
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,839
Unites them

984
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:34,239
Except for they're all gay gay choir is responding to

985
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,311
Lakeview allege demonic

986
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,847
Possessed

987
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,383
But shakers

988
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,687
Is Austin experience

989
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:48,831
F***** up yeah I think you might just not be able to perceive reality in any given way so

990
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
Anything he just likes

991
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:56,255
Just turned gray Mass he hides his intense bigotry behind the presentation of not being a

992
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,303
Experience reality Kelly Trail

993
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,887
Living in an alternate reality is less

994
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,215
Socially abhorrent then I his actual belief

995
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:10,079
Kind of it is really really sad that's a really sad thought

996
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
You just had

997
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,735
So this this is this is very on

998
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
Unacceptable

999
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,623
Organization of men

1000
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:27,999
Meeting and saying we're coming to corrupt your children were coming for them were coming to go

1001
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,775
Highest rate of suicide highest rate of hurting each other

1002
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Because of the

1003
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,871
The culture in and around it

1004
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,895
That is so

1005
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
Incredibly

1006
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,455
Disgusting and Anti-Venom

1007
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
Add

1008
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
View

1009
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,999
Give the FBI rated the

1010
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,559
Gay San Francisco

1011
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
I would bet that

1012
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
A large percentage

1013
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,983
CalPortland computer

1014
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,543
A large percentage of them

1015
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
Sex offenders already

1016
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
Wow.

1017
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,383
Just made that up

1018
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,431
I mean that's

1019
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,711
That's actionable

1020
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,271
I guess you can I guess saying I

1021
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,551
That is such a

1022
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,647
Speaking very intentionally

1023
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,439
Seems like it wouldn't be

1024
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,231
It's something you get sued for

1025
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,839
I think you should call the FBI because they're all pedophiles

1026
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
Yeah that's

1027
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,887
Look

1028
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,679
I guess you can say I bet in

1029
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,959
Between there but your

1030
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,239
Because I think the

1031
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
The context of what he was talking about

1032
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
Before

1033
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
He's like

1034
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,175
I think what you saying is a pedophile armies talkin about all like LGB

1035
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:56,575
More specifically he's saying the chorus is probably

1036
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
Sex offenders

1037
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,159
I just

1038
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,207
I can't I can't I can't I can't

1039
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,511
Anyway acceptable

1040
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,327
Now this is an outrageous level of

1041
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,607
Incitement towards

1042
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,887
Homophobia

1043
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:15,263
Drawing a conclusion based on the only information that you have

1044
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,335
Is it someone is gay and you've decided that there probably is

1045
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:19,871
I just

1046
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
I can't

1047
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,431
I can't I can't say

1048
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,759
But is it strongly or cleanly enough

1049
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
Is explicit

1050
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,159
Yeah I mean there's no other way to

1051
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,207
Deal with this other than to say

1052
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
If they get

1053
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
Hey

1054
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,071
Significant amount of power and continue with it

1055
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,167
We will eventually have laws again where you can't be gay in your own home

1056
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:46,751
You know cops can knock on your door open it and if you are

1057
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:53,407
Quotes engaging in homosexual activity you can just be put in jail obviously wants it

1058
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,943
Alex's having naked

1059
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,991
He has Nick on his

1060
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,783
His show at the on his Network

1061
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
And

1062
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
You know

1063
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,647
His rhetoric is really not that different

1064
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,183
They're compatible rhetoric

1065
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,231
But anyway

1066
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,511
Oz of meatloaf

1067
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
Well

1068
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,375
Lesbians because I like women

1069
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,423
I've been around the block a few times

1070
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,703
Ladies and gentlemen

1071
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
The women

1072
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
Black women

1073
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Chip on the shoulder

1074
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,599
Okay so if you're a lesbian you support the police

1075
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
Apparently

1076
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,903
That does not

1077
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
What sound verified

1078
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,231
No

1079
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
Is it sound like something

1080
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:45,119
Can or will be verify it doesn't actually even seem like some of the makes sense for Alec

1081
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
80

1082
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,447
Seems like something that he's just

1083
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
I get

1084
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,519
I get the sense that he's address

1085
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:56,383
You know he doesn't even know it's stereotypes anymore he's make

1086
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
Picking them up now

1087
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,223
Just suggest but

1088
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:03,551
Even even weirder like just being like a

1089
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:09,183
I don't know why but all black people like Luxembourg like that's not a stereotype I don't even know what that means

1090
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,487
I think that you had this

1091
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,023
Sisqo gay Men's Choir

1092
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Chorus

1093
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,095
Play come out and make this video that is

1094
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,655
So a meatball for hallux

1095
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
Tekitsu

1096
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,703
He can't resist

1097
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:26,591
The way that he wants to respond to it or they way he'd have to respond to it is

1098
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Bees

1099
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,919
F****** gay people

1100
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:34,527
Can't really do that please try to find a way to have that response would be

1101
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,087
He knows that the audience needs

1102
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,159
Try to do it without being like

1103
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:44,255
Ital gave you wants to say

1104
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,815
Gay people are making fun of me and I hate them

1105
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:52,703
Then pour it like that's what you why are you going off about pedophiles you're just mad that you're getting mock

1106
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,799
Yeah cuz your child they're taking this smear campaign

1107
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,823
That I have

1108
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,199
And making fun of it in a way that is embracing of like

1109
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,991
We recognize what the f***

1110
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,575
You say about

1111
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,623
To flip it on its head

1112
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,903
Power away from

1113
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,439
And

1114
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,975
I think Ikea

1115
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,279
Take that is largely what Alex is wrestling with

1116
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,839
Bigots usually don't like it when they have the power taken away for

1117
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:26,239
From them in my experience you end up calling people a pedophile Armada

1118
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,287
Maybe a little dance a little bit

1119
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,079
Continue to do so

1120
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,383
These are just blast

1121
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,431
Beyond hell individual

1122
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,967
Spider-Man

1123
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,271
Weather Juneau like

1124
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
Alfred Hitchcock

1125
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,183
Like his mother

1126
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,143
And now

1127
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,703
The schools are having talks with your Elementary students

1128
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,799
You're really a girl where are you you want attention because you are going to send you

1129
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,687
In most jurisdictions doubt that they will take

1130
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,223
Your children from you

1131
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,247
The CPS will

1132
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:14,111
Another home with a bunch of these perverts don't just want to stay

1133
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:16,159
Their members in your children

1134
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
Top

1135
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:18,975
Testicles

1136
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,047
Shop little girls breasts.

1137
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,863
Because the end goal is to mutilate

1138
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,655
What God created

1139
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,895
Got cut off by the breaker

1140
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:42,015
Very similar to the rhetoric

1141
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,575
Nick was putting out in his video where he was advocating

1142
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:47,135
Before the criminalization of lgbtq folk

1143
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,975
This is not any this is

1144
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,255
This is a mess

1145
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,791
This is incredibly

1146
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Inciting

1147
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,351
And an awful

1148
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
Yeah

1149
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,655
Yeah it's fun

1150
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,959
So you know

1151
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,751
This is all satan

1152
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
Really

1153
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:07,103
And Alex comes back from that break that he got cut off

1154
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:09,919
F*** it

1155
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,711
I'm going to discuss Satan's plan

1156
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,879
All the news and tied together here the satanism.

1157
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
Pedophilia

1158
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,463
Declaration of war against humanity

1159
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:26,815
Externalization of Satan's plan here on this planet the spiritual battle

1160
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
The church is rolling over to doing nothing to fight it

1161
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:33,471
Very very

1162
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,543
And just how hellish things are going to get

1163
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:42,943
We have free will

1164
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,551
Only further please remember it is viewers in Lester's that key

1165
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
This independent

1166
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,159
Media operation hours

1167
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:58,559
I got a plug before I get to Satan's plan

1168
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,119
The tease you guys Satan plant coming up but

1169
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:07,519
Before we do that it is your viewers like you get into all of the nitty-gritty

1170
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,823
What the devil is up to

1171
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:14,175
We have some pills

1172
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
So

1173
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,735
Apparently

1174
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:19,551
I mean you know we have a lot of people who are possessed by the devil

1175
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
Running around

1176
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,599
According to Alex

1177
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,159
And two of them you made a wreck

1178
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
Recognize

1179
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,975
The news

1180
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:30,815
Possess

1181
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,119
And also Michael avenatti

1182
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,423
Devil possessed

1183
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,983
I would have thought about him in a while

1184
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,031
They want to destroy innocence

1185
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,311
Like a man in the desert

1186
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
Water

1187
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,895
Like a starving man needs bread

1188
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,479
When you see

1189
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,015
Michael avenatti

1190
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:55,135
And you see Hunter Biden you see these people and they look like these

1191
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,719
Look like

1192
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,047
Not them

1193
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,583
Gone

1194
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,399
Something something is repulsive about them

1195
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,495
Because your Humanity fees

1196
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,335
But nobody's home

1197
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Chestnut

1198
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
So

1199
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,991
There isn't a place

1200
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
That you can buy

1201
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,527
Products

1202
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,063
Where

1203
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,087
Dynamite

1204
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,879
Iron products

1205
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:34,303
I am hurt isn't it remarkable that that was in the middle of his sales blog

1206
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,583
I think I

1207
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,143
Broke my neck broke my neck on that

1208
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,423
Sudden left turn

1209
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:46,079
I bet I forgot to wear my seatbelt and I went straight through the side door window

1210
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,103
Bearing sales pitch

1211
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,383
Said he's doing any sometimes

1212
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,663
Gets back into stuff

1213
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,199
It sounds like it's

1214
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:57,599
Contact calculator

1215
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
What

1216
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,647
Alex

1217
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,695
Is plug and this is the

1218
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:06,303
First time in a very long time that I'm about to

1219
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,375
Secure my voice

1220
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,655
Okay

1221
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,959
All right I know

1222
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,239
What was going on

1223
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,007
As like

1224
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:21,407
This sounds like if there was ever a way that Alex would end up using our content

1225
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,175
Could be at

1226
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,503
Spoiler alert it's not I was a little bit nervous

1227
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,807
Did you guys find that comedian face

1228
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,855
I don't just run on you

1229
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,391
Comic relief

1230
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,439
I guess someone hearing this

1231
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,743
Is like wow this sounds crazy but

1232
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
It's really true

1233
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,607
What's in high in fish oil in Anaheim

1234
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,679
This will give you the Fishburne

1235
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,703
I don't like

1236
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,263
But if you're not getting fishberg folks it's not the world

1237
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,615
What is an out there that stood it's telling us the real deal.

1238
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,895
Guinea Pig BBQ

1239
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,063
Bring Darkness good

1240
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:14,399
Never Say Never picture like this

1241
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,551
Alright here

1242
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,575
Gold

1243
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,159
Believe me look it up

1244
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,399
Baby

1245
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,167
Please do it just you

1246
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:50,751
I like that

1247
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Yeah what

1248
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,847
Okay

1249
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,127
I got a couple of

1250
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
I got a couple

1251
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,687
Okay one

1252
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,247
I have never heard fish burp

1253
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,271
What's before in my life

1254
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,319
Yeah we even talked about it

1255
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:10,719
Still refuse to hear

1256
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,999
Outside of here

1257
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,559
Is Penney's fishburg something that other people say

1258
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,095
Maybe

1259
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,399
Maybe I guess I have not really spent too much

1260
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
How much time in the

1261
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,215
Comparative fish-oil game

1262
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,031
Comparative omega-3 product

1263
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:24,799
Conversation

1264
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,335
Maybe they do talk about just burp

1265
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
I it's not

1266
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:30,687
I've taken omega-3 before and it's certainly not something that I

1267
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,711
I've seen as like

1268
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,295
I need to be mindful of

1269
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,087
N2

1270
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:37,855
You just can't

1271
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
You can't parody

1272
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,159
No can't do it

1273
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,951
That's that honestly

1274
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:46,047
That would have been like a low-level Alex

1275
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
It's not a parody that now

1276
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
That would be that's

1277
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:53,471
Any day he could have said exactly that reason why

1278
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,823
It's safe to use this as you know like something he can use in his address

1279
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,895
Talk about comedians

1280
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,943
Stalking

1281
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,759
Oh no

1282
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,319
Anyways we get to

1283
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
Plug-in plug

1284
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,695
Commercial

1285
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:17,791
Because of course now two minutes of plugs

1286
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,351
One minute of commercials

1287
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,679
Now you get to the nitty-gritty of the devil's play

1288
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:26,495
Apparently it has something to do with

1289
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
Ali wants

1290
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
To get into space

1291
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:33,151
By the way folks I've always wanted to do, nicho Rogan tells me I really need to do it

1292
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,687
And I guess

1293
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,759
Y'all get to go on Church

1294
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,551
So

1295
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,623
I've got to go ahead do it

1296
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,695
Is a joke CNN

1297
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,559
I'm supposed to tell you who you can talk to me

1298
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,119
Brian stelter

1299
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,399
Will get jealous

1300
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,191
I open up

1301
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,727
Say you're from now for Joe Rogan

1302
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,263
30000

1303
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,847
No he will not

1304
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,295
Are you ready

1305
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
Review

1306
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
10 minutes

1307
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,439
In the works

1308
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,023
See because I decided the stuff so serious

1309
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,303
Authority control

1310
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,119
That we also need to really screw it

1311
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
Fun

1312
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
At the same time

1313
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,751
What the f*** is happening

1314
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,055
Anymore

1315
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:39,199
The stand-up Eddie opening for Rogan will make smelter jealous

1316
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:44,319
Weird people for my time doing stand-up

1317
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,391
Who had various reasons for wanting to succeed

1318
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:51,999
And I will say that that's the most unhealthy one I've heard

1319
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,023
Bull boy

1320
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,559
Unhealthy ones

1321
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,351
I want to fuel a Coke habit

1322
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,167
I want to get my parents love

1323
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,983
These aren't normal motivations compared to

1324
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:08,383
I want stelter to be jealous even I want to crush my enemies in comedy is less destroy

1325
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:14,783
I want to make stelter mad my dude 15 up top 40 Brian stelter

1326
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:21,183
He was doing

1327
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:21,951
Average

1328
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:26,303
Eventually start to realize

1329
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,095
How little

1330
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,887
Goodwill

1331
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,935
Being a video figure

1332
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,727
Cuz once you actually start

1333
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:40,383
Presenting yourself as a stand-up stand-up with Doug Stanhope you would think I got him two in Austin

1334
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,407
Years back

1335
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
That video is

1336
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,711
Grimm hello man

1337
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,479
Yeah I think

1338
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,295
Coast for about a minute and a half

1339
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
2 minutes

1340
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:52,415
Whatever you're saying eventually audiences will be like

1341
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
I want a joke

1342
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
Right

1343
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,743
I've seen this happen

1344
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,279
It's the last time

1345
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,559
So many time

1346
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:01,631
Diagnosing to happen at local shows when people have dropped in

1347
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,959
And it says it can be a real

1348
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,495
Surprise

1349
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:10,591
For folks who aren't used to do inside out

1350
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,127
And indefinitely not used

1351
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:16,991
Easter failing in front of that many people all at the same time

1352
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:17,759
Unique

1353
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,319
Schadenfreude to see somebody

1354
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:25,695
Infinitely more famous than you at ASAP like for year in comic and do five viches wipes

1355
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,719
It's the floor with that

1356
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,743
It's a weird shot

1357
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,303
Can you f****** imagine

1358
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,631
A double-bill of Rogan and Dave Chappelle with Alec

1359
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,167
Hosting our opening

1360
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,703
I can't imagine it laugh

1361
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:42,335
I can't imagine there not being massive protest outside and broken in Chappell both

1362
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,615
Standing up and being like

1363
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:50,015
No we can do whoever we wanted our shows and a few weeks later he's gone forever Grogan in Chappell would both be

1364
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,063
Wise enough

1365
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,343
To know like oh

1366
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:57,695
Yeah if we do this this is all about a like oh yeah and we have

1367
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,463
Serve

1368
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:04,095
Used our position to allow him to use us

1369
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:04,863
Yeah

1370
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,911
I think they're smarter than that

1371
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,703
DeBrands a little better

1372
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:11,263
I don't know I don't even know too many Road hacks

1373
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,591
Who wouldn't lose their f****** mind if they're opening a

1374
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,151
Got more press than them every show

1375
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,223
Yeah you know or if they're openers

1376
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,015
Droid of the audience

1377
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,831
Before you even got up stage

1378
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:30,463
No no it's almost like if if they do that that would be Rogan's in Chappell just trying to

1379
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:33,023
The flex and see how deep a hole maker

1380
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:33,791
Could dig out of

1381
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,071
Have you helped remember back

1382
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:39,167
Wayback show I pitched a reality show called

1383
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,799
Somebody is on stage

1384
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:51,199
They intentionally ruin the audience you have to try and get on stage next

1385
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,503
If you can save the show

1386
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,271
I think a whole

1387
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,063
Season of that could be Alex Jones

1388
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:56,831
Is doing opening

1389
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:03,487
Totally see if you could get the audience laid back to a place where they're laughing at things

1390
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,559
Change too much in 20 years that we suddenly fit pillow

1391
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,351
Pull that off with a sixty-year-old Ali

1392
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,935
We can't do that I don't know if you'd have the

1393
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
The Vim

1394
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:17,055
60

1395
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,871
I don't know another 5-10 years

1396
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,407
Is going to do to him it's true

1397
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,687
Especially if he

1398
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,967
Consider this plan of

1399
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,503
Fighting on Pay-per-view

1400
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,855
I don't even want to I don't even want to engage with that

1401
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,159
You know what my first thought was when he said that is like

1402
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,487
Money is bad

1403
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:46,751
This is a real Dustin Diamond vleck Golden Corral

1404
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,383
Bitconnect

1405
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:57,503
How long until we get that

1406
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:01,343
I'm sure it's I'll say that there were very few folks

1407
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Who don't

1408
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,647
Seem to be desperate

1409
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,719
Who do did these are the celebrity

1410
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
Fight

1411
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:13,887
Things are changing a little bit now with the Logan Paul and Jake Paul's

1412
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:16,447
I also think

1413
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,215
Because of that

1414
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,311
And they're able to get a fight with like Floyd Mayweather

1415
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,847
Floyd Mayweather

1416
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,871
Is like

1417
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,663
Add appointment is career as nothing

1418
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:30,271
Approve a giant paycheck is something that

1419
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:35,391
You could see him doing he also did like WWE

1420
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,439
He's somebody who's open

1421
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,719
2

1422
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,487
The booking

1423
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,279
The idea that Alex think

1424
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,303
Him fighting

1425
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,071
Ten little

1426
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,607
People is something Vick

1427
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,375
Could be

1428
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
Like

1429
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,983
Interesting or funny or what

1430
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,799
It's kind of sad and it feels like a desperate

1431
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:56,639
MoneyGram in 2002

1432
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,431
It's like when we

1433
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
We can't poop

1434
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:05,855
We can't be doing this if nobody's remaking Revenge of the Nerds man do the past needs to stay in the past

1435
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
But I would seem like he's actually serious

1436
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,767
Are you really going to fight

1437
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,631
And the interest

1438
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,543
They want me to do something like this for a while and I and I said what about

1439
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,455
The fun of the thing

1440
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,783
I am so it was for charity and stuff it's also good thing

1441
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,599
This is no joke

1442
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,791
Competition

1443
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,351
This is not a joke

1444
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,679
Brian stelter is going to

1445
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,959
Challenge by myself

1446
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,615
I

1447
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,943
2 extra minutes

1448
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,967
I'm Blown Away

1449
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,855
I am in in the match

1450
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:14,207
I thought we were going to get to the Devils playing

1451
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:18,815
Alex is going to delineate breakdown plug and now he's

1452
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
Drink to

1453
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,351
Promote

1454
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:25,471
A pay-per-view that is not going to happen and his burgeoning stand-up career

1455
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,263
Apparently that he's going to do

1456
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
Because

1457
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,847
Things are so wild with the globalist

1458
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,895
We need to f*** with their brains and have

1459
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,663
Fun

1460
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,687
Or

1461
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
Trying

1462
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,063
Cheaply kashian and make some money really fast

1463
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,951
Blown Away blown away that you said that out loud to another person I want to fight ten little people

1464
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,023
Using that word and nobody went

1465
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,559
Hey man

1466
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,095
Okay

1467
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:58,239
You said it wrong one time over and over again time I'm in your earpiece just don't say that word again just

1468
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,775
Do different words

1469
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,055
Okay you said it again

1470
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,103
2 *

1471
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,663
Okay we're on 5th

1472
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:10,015
I sincerely

1473
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,063
You can't interpret this any other way than like

1474
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,855
Money is tight yeah

1475
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,623
Money is tight

1476
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:19,743
I am being like I really hope Brian stelter would agree to this

1477
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,071
I don't know why anyone would

1478
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,607
Like if you were Brian stelter

1479
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,655
You have to based on Alex's

1480
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,423
Like Pablo

1481
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
Good presentation

1482
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,495
You'd have to be worried that you wouldn't

1483
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,799
Stop punching you

1484
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:37,919
Because Alex has said that he's a demon in a sanctioned boxing match

1485
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:41,759
He's going to try to send arella Manning

1486
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,551
Photo of course

1487
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:50,207
He might trade up trying to Million Dollar Baby

1488
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,279
Think that he's totally full of s*** or he's going to try and

1489
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:54,815
Haein

1490
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,095
Either way

1491
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,911
What what is it what's in it for you

1492
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,679
Totally

1493
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,983
Anyway I was really wants to

1494
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
Baby

1495
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,103
I'm a manager of midgets

1496
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,663
God dammit man

1497
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:17,599
You know what I'm doing right now I don't really want to cover this news

1498
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,647
I have responsibilities at no s***

1499
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,927
Really genuinely freaked out

1500
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,695
Are we now

1501
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:28,095
Enjoy that moment there where he's like I realize it is getting a little too transparent that I'm not doing my

1502
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,631
A job

1503
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,447
Bulshit that I'm going off on

1504
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:39,871
Yeah look I don't want it in my job so I'm going to on air fantasize about promotional stunts I can do to make money

1505
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:48,575
It has the feel of somebody coming in late to work for like the fifth time that we could be like Leslie Mann

1506
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599
I slept in

1507
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,159
I got a nice cup of coffee I didn't get her on time

1508
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,695
Because you got me

1509
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,743
I don't know what to tell you I just don't care

1510
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
Yeah

1511
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,815
To head to the Hills

1512
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,095
Because this news is so

1513
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,631
Severe

1514
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,911
It's so terrifying

1515
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,959
I don't know if he'll be able to do

1516
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,983
Do Pay-Per-View boxing

1517
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,519
From the woods but

1518
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,871
Fly fishing

1519
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,431
I just forget any of this ever happened years ago

1520
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,479
Not going to let you do that do you know

1521
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,527
When the contact tracers in all this

1522
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:21,087
But they're going to come under political enemies houses

1523
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,647
Already said we're going to Republican areas

1524
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,183
Because they're the ones refusing

1525
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,487
All being done that one

1526
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,535
Strike forces

1527
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,607
Horses

1528
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,447
We're going to hunt you down quotes

1529
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:43,871
We have all Bloomberg elated

1530
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,991
Quote and we're going to come to your house

1531
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,319
Whether you like it or not

1532
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,599
Would you like me to play the video

1533
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,367
He doesn't

1534
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,439
So I don't I don't know

1535
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,463
I don't know about

1536
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,071
Trace down what I could but

1537
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,607
I don't know

1538
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,191
And who cares

1539
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,751
When he gets into a specific

1540
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,287
It's a little bit

1541
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,567
It's a little bit of a mess

1542
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,127
By the way even the Times of Israel reports

1543
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
80 + percent

1544
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,711
I know I sent that

1545
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,247
I think I lost it

1546
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,015
My stack

1547
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,343
Kentucky

1548
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,879
Photo of the Downriver

1549
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,463
4% 85%

1550
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:35,839
All the people in the hospital with covid and those dying

1551
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,631
Covid

1552
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,423
Have had the vaccine

1553
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:45,823
People are dying of covid vaccine killed you and then they say it's covid

1554
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,591
Comprende

1555
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,615
Comprende

1556
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:50,943
See this is where we got the inversion of us at yeah

1557
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,735
I have no idea what Alec

1558
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,527
Is referring to to this article in the

1559
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,319
The Times of Israel but interesting Lee

1560
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:02,719
CNBC had an article that came out on July 8th that I was the headline quote virtually all new covid deaths and hospitalizations

1561
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,767
They're among unvaccinated people White House

1562
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,863
There are breakthrough infections that are being seen and it's inevitable C

1563
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,887
No vaccine is a Hyundai

1564
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,167
Percent effective

1565
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:16,287
Apparently almost nobody who's been vaccinated fully is seeing illness that requires hospitalization

1566
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
United's

1567
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,151
This reality that vaccines are not 100% effective is

1568
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,991
Being exploited by anti-vax propagandist by using real statista

1569
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,271
6 in a manipulative way

1570
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:29,087
There was a conversation last month

1571
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:33,439
About how the proportion of vaccinated persons within the group of people who died

1572
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:35,743
With covid-19 is rising

1573
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,535
That proportion is rising

1574
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,815
This sounds scary

1575
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,095
And it's kind of statistic

1576
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,143
Could be very useful for someone like Alex

1577
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
But all you do is think about

1578
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,703
Things for a few minutes

1579
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,751
And you'll come up with possible explanation

1580
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,775
For this phenomenon

1581
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:52,383
The first is that data shows that people who are older are more likely to be vaccinate

1582
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:59,039
People who are older also are statistically more likely to die than younger people so the unfortunate reality is

1583
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:03,647
Happy pool of vaccinated people skews toward containing people who are more likely to die

1584
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,183
Unrelated to the shop

1585
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,743
The second reason is that the vaccine

1586
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,535
Cannot be a hundred percent effective

1587
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,839
An article in the guardian really well

1588
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,119
Expresses this dynamic

1589
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,143
Quote

1590
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:18,239
Consider a hypothetical world where absolutely everyone had received a less-than-perfect

1591
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Vaccine

1592
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:23,103
Although the death rate would be low everyone who died would have been

1593
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,127
Fully vaccinated

1594
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:31,039
In that scenario that's being painted total numbers of death would be low but if you only focus on the relative

1595
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,343
People who died who had been vaccinated

1596
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,903
You come up with an easily distorted narrative about the

1597
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,535
I find it incredibly hard to believe that the Times of Israel is reporting anything close to what Alex is saying

1598
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,071
On July 8th

1599
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:46,911
They reported on the first two covid deaths in Israel in the past 2 weeks

1600
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,959
So the number of covid deaths

1601
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,775
I don't know how you get that number that Alex's saying but

1602
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,639
One of them was a 48 year-old unvaccinated man and the other was an 86 year-old man who had

1603
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
Been vaccinated

1604
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:03,039
That same day they reported only 37 seriously ill people with covid

1605
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
In the entire car

1606
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:04,575
Country so

1607
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,623
I just don't I don't know where these

1608
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,647
These are the stats

1609
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,487
Yeah I just I mean

1610
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:18,143
It is such that vicious cycle of you convince people that the vaccine is evil

1611
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,167
They don't get the VAC

1612
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,703
More people die

1613
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:23,263
And vaccinated people are like we can't let you

1614
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,287
To continue doing

1615
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,615
You're dying and to your incubators for

1616
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:34,015
The eventual immune viruses we can't let you do this in the only

1617
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,039
Way to do that

1618
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:41,439
It's a coming to your f****** homes and try and convince you and then they're like Seether coming into your arms and trying to convince you and you like

1619
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:46,047
Like not forcing people but

1620
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,327
Doing Outreach

1621
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,887
Yeah might involve knocking on doors

1622
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:56,031
There are a number of people who probably would get vaccinated but don't I have the resources

1623
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,079
Play horror have some kind of a block

1624
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,103
Towards

1625
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,383
Access

1626
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,943
David and door-to-door

1627
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,759
Awareness campaigns could help with that

1628
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:08,575
And unfortunately they will end up probably

1629
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,623
If they do put that in

1630
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,391
2 plan

1631
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,415
Into effect

1632
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,951
Probably will be attack

1633
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,767
Yeah that the door will

1634
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,327
The shift kicked out of them by

1635
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,351
Somebody

1636
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,143
I foresee that

1637
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
It is

1638
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,191
It is like that

1639
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,055
Talk to you and the administration or talk

1640
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,103
Talking about that creation of to America

1641
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,639
Cuz you know the vaccinated in the unvax

1642
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,919
Estimated

1643
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,711
That's just the literally

1644
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,247
Expression of the two Americas

1645
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,039
Vaxxers in

1646
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,111
The horrible anti-vax propaganda that existed before

1647
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,647
We're just seeing it happen

1648
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,719
Physical life you know what I mean like it's just a

1649
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,743
It's the same

1650
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:50,047
It's the same thing we're just seeing it play out

1651
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:54,655
Yeah it's at and the other thing too is that the vaccination

1652
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,959
Opposition or whatever has

1653
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,751
Metastasized unattached

1654
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:02,079
It's up to so many extraneous political position

1655
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,359
That it's being

1656
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,895
Co-opted as a

1657
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,687
Signifier like

1658
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,223
Right-wing politics

1659
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,015
And that's that's the dangerous

1660
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:14,623
Reality I felt like a good proportion of anti-vaxxers used to be new age

1661
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:17,183
Oaks and now even new-age Jose like

1662
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,463
I did not see the Great

1663
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,255
God dammit man

1664
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,607
Ships to the prediction about these plans

1665
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,399
About

1666
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,423
You know I don't know

1667
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,495
Door-to-door awareness campaign shadow

1668
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,519
The nation

1669
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,335
Keep keep this prediction in mind for the next

1670
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
A few years

1671
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,639
See if this comes about

1672
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,431
So

1673
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:43,039
Rolling out the contact tracers that they've already done it in Europe is it in Australia

1674
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,695
Your neighbor said you were coughing

1675
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
No I'm fine

1676
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,303
My house

1677
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,863
Well under the emergency code we don't need a warrant

1678
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,631
Come outside

1679
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,191
L

1680
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,215
What's your name

1681
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,311
They stick Lord knows what up your nose

1682
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,615
Machine 2 months later says

1683
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,015
Sorry

1684
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,439
Excuse

1685
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,719
The disappearing

1686
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,511
Used to Vans driving around

1687
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,327
Grabbing people in all the Democrats and all the leftist

1688
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,607
It went to college

1689
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,423
Everywhere

1690
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,727
Certified School

1691
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,775
Social workers

1692
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,567
Americorps

1693
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,615
Or to be in the Peace Corps

1694
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
Now that's that

1695
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,943
Set civilian domestic Army Obama talked about

1696
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,991
Military

1697
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,903
Make sure you take the shot

1698
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:55,487
See if you're sick and go in your home and take you out take you away

1699
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,303
Ago

1700
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,655
Such thing as velox

1701
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,935
What's that planning

1702
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,471
Just making all this up and

1703
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:08,543
Repeating is paranoid fantasies doing imaginary

1704
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:11,615
Yeah I was born I was thinking it was a little hard

1705
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,919
To believe that Obama's

1706
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,967
Civilian Army matched up

1707
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:20,575
Equally with the 900 billion dollar a year United States military but I could be wrong

1708
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,599
You could be

1709
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,487
This is just a fantasy that is not going to come

1710
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,255
Come to fruition

1711
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:34,655
Just a just a little like keep it keep this in mind for all the people who like Alex's predictions always come true

1712
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,239
Can you imagine

1713
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,287
People in Vans take

1714
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,567
King people away

1715
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,103
And everybody being like

1716
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,639
It's just

1717
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:48,479
Pandemic

1718
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:53,599
It's so awful it's so awful this scenario where someone would

1719
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,647
Have a neighbor that hears you cough

1720
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,671
That would be off

1721
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,439
Now

1722
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,743
If somebody had a neighbor that hears you were gay

1723
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:03,327
Of course the cops should come to your door and rip you out of your house that make

1724
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,095
Perfect sense

1725
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:07,935
That makes perfect sense these are people who have consistent belief

1726
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,959
Stan

1727
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:13,824
I mean let's talk about the implications of the desert of the Texas abortion law

1728
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:21,760
Alex doesn't cover that so I have no idea about that I haven't actually heard about it

1729
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,808
So he does get to another bill though

1730
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,600
And this is actually the bills

1731
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,136
66-63 was talking about

1732
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:31,488
Did it actually was one of the bills that I already talked to her

1733
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,304
Bhrc

1734
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,328
66

1735
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,120
Racism in

1736
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,144
Public Health

1737
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,704
Oh my God

1738
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,032
It says here

1739
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:46,336
Analyze data in research

1740
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,616
And bring program

1741
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,664
Racism the impact

1742
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,944
Health and well-being

1743
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,992
With all of your medical record

1744
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,040
From the CDC

1745
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,576
Center

1746
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,976
So

1747
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,840
Big 666 velvet Alex's chocolate is that a auto Presley bill

1748
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,144
The anti-racism the public health Act

1749
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:15,008
For some idea about the bill govtrack gives the prognosis of 4%

1750
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:18,848
Ozio Panthers better than I would have expected on time

1751
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:21,408
Alex hasn't read this bill it would

1752
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,016
Create a new entity within the CDC called the national Center on anti-racism and health

1753
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:31,904
The Entity would be tasked with looking at an address in the healthcare implications of our country's history of structural racism

1754
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,744
Ranging from issues related to infectious disease to pregnancy-related conditions

1755
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:39,328
Which are two instances of health issues that intersect heavily with race

1756
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,400
Additionally the bills whatever CDC coordinate with

1757
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:45,216
The doj to address police violence as a public health

1758
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,496
A related matter

1759
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,800
The bill was introduced on February

1760
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,592
1st and

1761
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:53,408
Like even though it does have imported

1762
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:56,736
Points in it as it stands even Alex knows damn well this isn't

1763
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,504
Antipas

1764
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
More important

1765
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:01,088
Just making up major parts of his analysis

1766
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:01,856
To the Bell

1767
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,392
There's no discussion about it

1768
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,184
Accessing anyone's medical records

1769
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,720
That's part of this

1770
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,744
Free associating

1771
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:12,608
Also the national Center on anti-racism in the bill is trying to create

1772
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:18,496
It's not something that is as Alex's reporting it run by the abl in the Southern Poverty Law Center

1773
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:24,128
That's a knee-jerk reaction that Alex has whenever something that sounds like it might be a social positive

1774
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,688
This thing says that it's Auntie racism

1775
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,480
Silver to make sure my Audis does

1776
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,016
Field races for opposing it

1777
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:36,416
I can't be sure to say It's associated with the ATL in the fpl-c I've already convinced the audience are Evil based on

1778
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,184
Ganda

1779
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,000
Street from white supremacist to the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1780
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:44,352
It's a load of s*** but you can see how he needs to do that to cover his bases with the audio

1781
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,376
Keep them in

1782
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,144
In check

1783
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:49,216
Also this bill is identical to

1784
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,776
4533 the anti-racism in Pueblo

1785
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,312
Look Health Act of 2020

1786
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,592
Which was introduced by Elizabeth

1787
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,384
With Warren last year and died in committee

1788
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,200
It's also the same as HR 817

1789
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:03,296
8 which is the house version of that bill that a auto Presley introduced last year

1790
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,320
Which also died in

1791
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:05,856
Bunch of bulshit

1792
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
I would like

1793
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,648
To know more about that

1794
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,416
4%

1795
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,976
I think that's a made-up

1796
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,048
There's no way that you can come to

1797
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,328
4% like it was

1798
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:20,192
Like what did they 538 and they ran up million simulations and in 4% of them it passed

1799
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:22,240
Any of those situations what happened

1800
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:23,776
I want to know

1801
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
I don't know

1802
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:31,968
I need more information on their methodology I'm not sending it actually has a 4% chance

1803
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:34,784
Things that gum track

1804
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,088
I want to know that

1805
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:41,440
I would like a widow would be interested in how accurate those predictions are historic

1806
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,744
One percent by 3%

1807
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,072
The number of co-sponsors

1808
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:51,936
Like the number of people who have

1809
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:52,960
Express

1810
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:57,312
Support for the Bell the history of the bill as

1811
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,336
It's sand

1812
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,384
I think probably going to get her to Bill quite a bit.

1813
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,920
Is the fact that we did this last year

1814
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:08,320
Cuz we already have a running of this right right right you can see that it probably has about as much

1815
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,600
What chances it did last year

1816
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,160
It's it's a bit

1817
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:12,928
But nonsense

1818
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,512
So Alex tries to read this bill and even seem sort of riffing

1819
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,536
Little bits

1820
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,608
I was kind of confused by that

1821
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,448
The Centers for Disease Control and prevention

1822
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:27,520
Racism in health

1823
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,848

01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,280
ATL

1842
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,072
Where the Southern Poverty Law Center

1843
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,888
Northern Human Services

1844
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,680
Local Health Department

1845
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:29,728
Seymour surveillance control

1846
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:33,056
Legalizing the surveillance State they've already had for decades

1847
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:38,944
Alex is clearly cold reading this bill because if he read it before getting on areas

1848
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,224
Conspiracy would be

1849
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:44,064
He's having to make up all these extraneous details that aren't in the bill to make the

1850
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,136
Square peg fit in a round hole but if you actually read it

1851
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:53,792
He could do this as a white identity narrative without even thinking like yeah you can tell

1852
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:57,632
Because he's trying to force it into a space that doesn't really belong

1853
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:01,472
He doesn't actually know what it said cuz I was reading over the Bell like oh my God this is

1854
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,752
This is

1855
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,032
Pharrell

1856
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,616
That's that

1857
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,640
Do you know what that

1858
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:13,504
Sometimes it really bites you whenever you never prepare for your job it's certainly it can really come back and

1859
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,528
Hit you in the ass

1860
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
Yep

1861
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:17,344
Hr666

1862
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,368
X-rite this thing

1863
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,392
It's what it really is

1864
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,416
Is an attempt

1865
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,464
Chick-fil-A

1866
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,000
Decriminalizing all

1867
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,024
All the things that

1868
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
All these evil global

1869
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,328
Must've done

1870
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,096
Right

1871
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,912
Even from what he read

1872
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:31,680
No no

1873
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,800
And I know it's all coming out

1874
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:39,360
Legalize It All

1875
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,408
That they don't all go to prison

1876
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,224
Horses

1877
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,528
House resolution

1878
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,184
Covid-19

1879
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,280
Reaching and contacting

1880
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,888
What is sake

1881
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:02,912
Misaki

1882
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,984
Bad drink a bad person

1883
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:06,752
What's

1884
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,824
White forces

1885
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,616
Horses

1886
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,016
So hr-666

1887
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,576
Six did not become law Alex just made that up

1888
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:26,464
Also press secretary sake relationship with the term Strikeforce

1889
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,768
In a press conference on July 8th

1890
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:29,792
Did she use the term

1891
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,352
It was in response to a question about Biden

1892
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,120
In talking with

1893
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,144
Chicago mayor Lori

1894
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,984
Lori Lightfoot about the gun situation in the city

1895
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,264
Question

1896
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:43,872
How is the doj Strikeforce going to specifically interrupt the networks that are traffic

1897
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,640
In those guns

1898
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,408
Answer

1899
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,456
They work they're going to work with

1900
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:52,320
The city they're doing them we're doing these strike forces in about five cities around the country

1901
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,880
And they want to work directly with them to use legal authorities

1902
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:59,232
The Crackdown on illegal gun trafficking and work in partnership with law enforcement authorities in the cities

1903
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:02,304
And that add additional 2:30 and additional resource

1904
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:05,376
In a press Gaggle the previous day's use the

1905
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,656
The term again in relationship

1906
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,192
The gun trafficking in Chicago

1907
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:11,264
But on July 6th to discuss

1908
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,824
Communities with the low vaccination rates and said quote

1909
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:17,152
That's one of the reasons we initiated the strike forces to go into

1910
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,432
The communities and work with them

1911
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,712
The determine what they need

1912
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:21,504
To take localized specific

1913
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,784
Approach that work

1914
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,576
Works with elected officials and community

1915
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:31,744
Picture doesn't like the combination of those word ambulance

1916
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,048
Hey weird take that straight

1917
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:38,656
Forced out to 24th and Main because we've got a details like everything's a strike for

1918
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:42,496
Certain people certain people have

1919
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,520
Momentum with

1920
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,288
Terms

1921
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:47,616
She has like we have a

1922
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
Team

1923
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,456
Strikeforce or whatever I don't know I don't

1924
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:55,040
I don't take this to be a sign that she's going to send it

1925
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:55,808
Squad

1926
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:58,880
The people who don't want Patxi's or something

1927
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,416
Phrases that's how we caught the Unabomber

1928
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:08,096
So the rest of the show is Alex interviews Michael malice who I don't care much for

1929
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,400
A couple reasons I just got really bored listen

1930
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,680
Be there in a few and I just turned it off

1931
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,216
His name is Michael malice

1932
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,752
His name is Mal

1933
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:21,152
How is that not as equally as 666 his name is Malik

1934
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:26,272
I should be I don't know the reasons why I don't care too much about him

1935
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:30,368
He has his own show and he fairly regularly has comedians as gas

1936
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:36,256
I've no idea if that means he's trying to do a Rogan type thing and if that's the case I don't know like

1937
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,024
How much

1938
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:41,120
I can accurately assess where he's coming from and what's meant to be take

1939
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,144
Seriously

1940
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,960
I don't want to I don't want to engage with something that might

1941
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:46,240
B a b troll

1942
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:51,360
Scroll through his guest list however does reveal that he's friends with a bunch of real idiots

1943
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:53,152
He seems to like having them on his show

1944
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,432
I don't look great

1945
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,832
The second issue I have is that Michael is there in studio so one would assume that he's heard the show leading up to this point

1946
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:06,976
If you're aware of the bile that Alex has been spilling up to this point and you still decide to associate yourself with it

1947
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:13,120
Then I don't really care too much about what you think your decision not to leave is a massive editorial decision about what you stay on

1948
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:15,168
If you don't if you

1949
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,704
Caribbean

1950
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,776
A part of the same episode where Alex

1951
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,056
He's talking about

1952
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:24,128
The gay men's chorus in San Francisco

1953
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:28,480
Probably being pedophile

1954
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:35,648
Who talks about his pay-per-view fighting aspirations all of this nonsense if you still are like yeah.

1955
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,928
I'm going to I'm going to keep this booking

1956
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,208
Then I don't

1957
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:42,560
You know there's nothing about your own individual career that I think could even rise.

1958
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,096
To the level of like wow you have

1959
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,888
Made yourself discounted

1960
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:51,008
Whoops I was booked to this Nazi rally and I'm the fifth

1961
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,032
Speaker but

1962
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,056
Listen

1963
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:59,200
You got to do your time I was raised up in Chicago comedy you got to do you're a professional

1964
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:04,832
I think the most important thing though is that in 2018 Riding High on Trump energy

1965
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:07,136
Michael malice was one of the speakers at at night

1966
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
For freedom

1967
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,488
Did you go back and look at the list of speakers 8 losses with

1968
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:14,560
Poorly disguised monsters just waiting to be allowed to see

1969
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,328
Speak freely

1970
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:22,240
Princeton's Owen Benjamin was on the panel this was while he was still just pretending to be an edgy comedian who like to sing song

1971
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,520
Songs that the n-word in them

1972
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,824
And just before he came out as an actual knots

1973
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:28,384
And started making his career about doing live streams

1974
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,688
Yard complaining about the Jews

1975
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,224
Gavin McInnes

1976
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:37,344
Still in that sweet spot where the proud boys were is still being seen as a harmless joke by most people

1977
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:40,928
Ganador in Colton things I'm gone South to the pirate after

1978
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:44,256
Pretend you didn't mean any of the violence stuff you wasn't really

1979
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:50,400
The leader of the group and honestly they were mostly just about having a beer together away from the old ball and chain

1980
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,680
Okay

1981
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:58,080
I started a violent street gang and then they became violent streak I didn't have any intention of

1982
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:04,480
Doing that whenever I told all of them that I'm starting a violet gone bad

1983
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:11,136
What about Stefan molyneux ground being a

1984
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,928
The creepiest libertarian cult leader

1985
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,696
Prior

1986
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:17,280
Dim going to Poland and realize the news actually white nationalist all along

1987
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:24,192
Goofy losers like Jack pasovic and Mike cernovich were there to talking about how they were the Vanguard of culture

1988
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,728
What a bunch of losers

1989
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:32,384
Jared Holt cover the event for rightwingwatch in Hindi

1990
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,224
Is article has a

1991
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,784
Quote from Michael malice his speech haha

1992
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,624
Quotes one of the ways the left is 14 decades is by beating the fun-size

1993
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:45,696
That's where the parties are that's where the cool people are

1994
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:49,280
And it's important if you want people to agree with you and come over to have a vent

1995
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,048
Like this

1996
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:53,888
Tonight at the social cost of being on the right and do enjoy life in America

1997
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:59,520
One thing I take away from that is that Michael malice and I have very different ideas of what sounds like

1998
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
Fun

1999
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,592
Personally I don't think hanging out with a group of

2000
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:06,432
Pathetic thinly-veiled bigots sounds like a good time

2001
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,456
Apparently for him

2002
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,992
It does let's not forget

2003
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:11,296
Very unfunny bigot

2004
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:14,368
Also Jared's article include something

2005
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,392
Hilarious

2006
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,184
Cernovich should take

2007
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,976
Campaigns to rid the event of something

2008
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,536
Explicitly alt-right media personalities

2009
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,816
Leaving Pam hat

2010
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:25,888
To prevent a sea of red make America great again hat

2011
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:31,776
He created a space for a series of decidedly not family-friendly speeches that took aim at feminism tram

2012
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,056
People and immigration

2013
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:37,408
Turtle Beaches night of Freedom relied on cancel culture and banning articles

2014
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,712
The clothing so they could create the right kind of

2015
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,992
Text Buddy was looking for

2016
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,552
He was that they like to have fun with a bigot

2017
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,136
You can often tell a lot about someone by the company they choose.

2018
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:49,696
Lucky Penny 2018 Michael miles is hanging out with the

2019
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:51,232
The grossest pack of losers

2020
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:54,560
And this week he willingly appeared on Alex's Show when he was doing

2021
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:56,096
This kind of content

2022
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:59,424
No matter what he does or says I don't think they might have him

2023
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:02,240
And I was pretty bored by the

2024
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,032
Beginning of the interview and

2025
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,056
I just don't

2026
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:05,824
Character

2027
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:10,432
Rise the level of like interesting Danger

2028
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,200
It's almost like

2029
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,224
Nick Fuentes

2030
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,504
Eddie doesn't

2031
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,344
These social capital of Someone Like A Joe Rogan

2032
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:20,416
That make them like a we should talk about that yeah

2033
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:22,720
He's just kind of in that middle ground of

2034
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,096
Audience

2035
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:28,864
Spite

2036
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:32,192
Pictures of s*** had great you're an a******

2037
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,728
Yeah you

2038
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,776
Surrounded yourself with more assholes

2039
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,664
We have four for today

2040
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,688
Just remember

2041
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,576
Friends family neighbors acquaintances total strangers about the show

2042
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,440
Pre-World news.tv right on the back of the card give it the folks and tell him here

2043
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,464
Is it suppress truth

2044
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
They don't want you to see

2045
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:59,328
Can you imagine the conversation you would have coming if you told somebody wasn't nuts

2046
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:02,656
What's the listen to this show and said it was the suppressed truth in the universe

2047
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:07,264
Can you imagine how worried your friend would rightly be if you did that

2048
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:12,896
It's one thing to TuneIn and somebody like Bill Cooper is boringly going over hoaxed

2049
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:16,992
Discussing conspiracies

2050
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,088
It's completely another thing of your friends has to listen to Infowars and get the

2051
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:24,416
Truth and you're confronted by a complete idiot yelling about us a

2052
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:26,976
Francisco gay men's chorus or probably pedophiles

2053
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:30,560
Rambles about doing a Pay-Per-View fights Ten Little People then,

2054
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,840
Instantly makes up details

2055
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:34,912
About every real thing he covers like these bills

2056
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:35,936
If your list

2057
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:39,008
English it in three accidents yearly recommending it to someone

2058
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:42,336
A rational response would be for them to be very worried about you

2059
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,616
Also

2060
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:46,944
Did he say write down free world news. TV

2061
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,248
I think so I think that's one of his new URL is

2062
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:55,648
So part of that conversation would be you handing somebody free world news. TV and then being like what's this and you saying

2063
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
Infowars

2064
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:58,208
Well then why didn't you write info

2065
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,232
You know why

2066
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,256
I did write Infowars

2067
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:03,072
We both know why I didn't write it

2068
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,376
Free world news. TV

2069
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:06,656
The Trojan Horse

2070
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,960
This a little bit even though it's

2071
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:14,080
I guess I'm suppressing it a little bit

2072
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:19,712
You have a little bit of awareness of this dick hole is

2073
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:23,296
Yes what I found I found this episode to be

2074
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,064
Disgusting

2075
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:24,832
Honestly

2076
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,112
Just overall pretty

2077
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,136
Disgusting

2078
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:27,904
Yeah

2079
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:31,744
Especially coming off the heels of a Fuentes episode and hit

2080
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,512
This is just

2081
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:36,608
This is turning into a real free speech

2082
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,656
Bigotry

2083
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,424
Speak freely

2084
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,752
Some things that I think we're going to learn

2085
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,800
In the next week or so to is

2086
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,848
How does the relationship

2087
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,128
Nick getting

2088
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:50,176
Kicked off Twitter affect Alex

2089
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,712
Relationship

2090
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:53,504
Nick Fuentes has with Infowars

2091
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:58,624
Now Infowars maybe one of the larger platforms that he has access to

2092
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,696
There may be a need for him to invest

2093
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,464
More

2094
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,744
And his prizes

2095
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,304
Since on Alex's banned. Video

2096
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,840
His ability

2097
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,864
Need to come on the shows

2098
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,888
Play Maccabeats

2099
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,656
Rubble

2100
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,704
For someone like Alex because

2101
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,472
Nick

2102
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,008
Pretty slick

2103
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,288
I mean you know

2104
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,568
Harrison Smith suck

2105
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,616
Nick's not busy

2106
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:23,456
Maybe you know and then

2107
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:27,552
When does the show becomes more popular than Alex's and he has to kill him

2108
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:28,576
Fuentes

2109
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,344
I don't think

2110
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,368
Is somebody who is

2111
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,648
Comfortable being

2112
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,440
Third banana on Infowars

2113
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:37,280
I know absolutely not not think you would

2114
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:40,864
Be fine being in the sad sad roll the Harrison

2115
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:50,080
I am lucky to be so tired

2116
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:55,456
Like I could do it on my own f*** out of here

2117
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:01,856
Moving up and taking over

2118
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:05,952
Yeah yeah we'll see I'm I'm very interested to see how that dynamic

2119
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:06,720
Mcplayz out

2120
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:09,536
And whether or not out so I have to cut bait

2121
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:13,632
I don't know maybe maybe he goes pjw

2122
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:16,192
You know maybe he just produce

2123
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:20,800
Maybe that way I would like that get the f*** out of Chicago

2124
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:25,408
Schleich videos in the place among the main they honestly also think

2125
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:28,480
Picnic as a bit more ambitious then Paul has ever been

2126
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:32,576
Paul I think also knows where his bread is buttered

2127
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,368
Although he will probably

2128
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,392
Every now and again

2129
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:39,488
And give voice to support of her like Nigel farage are you kept candidates

2130
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,512
Nick

2131
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:41,792
Is

2132
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,328
Somebody by the political project

2133
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:47,424
True be the stuff that he does does involve

2134
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,448
Action

2135
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,216
Towards

2136
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,240
Politic

2137
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,544
Action towards bills

2138
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,312
Towards

2139
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:55,104
Organizing

2140
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,896
And disrupting

2141
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:58,688
Do things like Charlie Kirk event

2142
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,992
Things like this are things that have

2143
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,016
Real

2144
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:05,088
On the 8th the real-world implications hidden folks

2145
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:06,624
Like Paul and Alex

2146
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:10,464
They don't really do as much of

2147
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:14,048
That's a good point people like Paul and Blake Harrison

2148
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:18,144
The kind of understand that sure they want to sway opinions on things

2149
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,680
In the Infowars

2150
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:21,216
Or whatever but

2151
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,264
More about like

2152
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,288
Creating your beauteous

2153
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:26,080
Nick is up to

2154
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,104
You got a good point

2155
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,176
What are the reasons that I find Nick to be more of a dangerous

2156
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,200
Person been

2157
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:34,016
A lot of these other folks

2158
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,808
You know I don't cover his

2159
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,856
Show even though he does a show

2160
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:40,160
Is because I don't think he's the same

2161
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,440
Type of person

2162
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:45,536
I think he is a bit of a grifter and he's scamming a little bit obviously

2163
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:48,608
I'll put an ideologue yeah yeah I think you would

2164
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,400
Sacrifice

2165
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,448
Selling America First shirts

2166
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,984
For political action

2167
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,032
Yeah I think he probably would

2168
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,336
But I think it's a someone like Alex I don't

2169
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,104
Think that

2170
01:39:59,360 --> 01:39:59,872
I don't think that's

2171
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,408
Yeah it seems like

2172
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:03,712
Princesses trying to get to that kind of norquist

2173
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:08,320
Place where he can somehow convince all of it cuz he's never going to actually make it into

2174
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,344
Like Congress or something.

2175
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:13,952
But he can convince them all even be like the white nationalist pledge of likes

2176
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:14,720
Hey

2177
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,512
No new people

2178
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,304
You know like that kind of s***

2179
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:22,144
Empire biotrack in the support a folks

2180
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,216
Like Paul gosar and Michelle Malkin true

2181
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:26,752
You end up drying

2182
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:28,800
To expand the influence

2183
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,080
Ants that human is

2184
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,872
Groyper is having

2185
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:33,152
Hit some

2186
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,456
888 it's a bit of a different thing

2187
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,992
Then what were used to cover in

2188
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:38,528
Not to say that it's

2189
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:42,112
The last serious because I think it actually is probably more serious then

2190
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:44,160
Fun yeah

2191
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:47,232
Maybe it is something that is worth

2192
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:51,840
Exploring a bit more I know that his particular brand of content is a little bit more

2193
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:53,120
Unpalatable

2194
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:59,776
431 in audience maybe there is some value

2195
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,312
U2

2196
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,336
Maybe covering

2197
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,384
A little bit more of his America first

2198
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,152
Joe

2199
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:11,296
An end one another one of the reasons why we haven't is because there was a limited amount of it was on it for what

2200
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:13,600
And if it starts to leave more on Infowars

2201
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,368
Then it becomes

2202
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,904
More in our sphere

2203
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,928
Directly

2204
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:19,744
So we'll see we'll see how things play out but but

2205
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,048
For now I just think this episode sucked

2206
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:24,096
And I also think

2207
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,376
But that too

2208
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:30,496
Disco gay men's chorus oh I'm just pretty catchy

2209
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:34,848
But until then Jordan website

2210
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,384
Also on

2211
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:43,808
Twitter

2212
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:48,672
If you could please find a local charity or Bellefontaine your to help out people doing God's work

2213
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:52,256
But until then I'm Neo I'm Leo mdzs

2214
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:54,304
Text Clark I'm Daryl

2215
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:59,680
Honestly if there was any justice in the universe Rupert should have won that season 2 survivor

2216
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:06,080
Animated times he did actually seem like a little bit unhinged and he was screaming at people for voting at 4 then maybe

2217
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:10,944
Maybe there was a dark side to him that wasn't fully captured in the show and that's entirely possible

2218
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,248
I accept that's possible but

2219
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:18,112
What a bright ray of sunshine. Dude was anyway

2220
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,160
Rupert

2221
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,976
Holding

2222
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:28,608
