1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan pipes sweat it

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge babe I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

4
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,136
Stripe.com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:08,864
Little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
What's up Jordan

7
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
Really

8
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
This is weird

9
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
I want you

10
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
A big part of me

11
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,480
It's a very specific question

12
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
But I don't think you're going to have

13
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,344
I'm going to go with

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,208
An infinite number of questions

15
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
But

16
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:39,328
Look directly into my eyes

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,824
No I have no idea what do you want to talk about

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
And told them to their

19
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,176
Probably

20
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,480
Yeah probably

21
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,344
Texting story

22
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,000
This is a foregone conclusion

23
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,144
I need to just tell you about this Jordan

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
Yeah probably

25
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:22,592
Friend in the morning before we record

26
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,664
Waiting for you to show up Studio

27
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
And

28
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
A few things

29
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,088
I think I've discovered genre of music that might be

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
The right in my wheelhouse

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
At this Jordan

32
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
Probably

33
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,840
Reimagining the Phil Collins

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
The cannon

35
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,728
It's fantastic

36
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:56,128
Disturbed Land of Confusion know everybody is great

37
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Take me home

38
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
Really feel like I talk

39
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
It might just be a rediscovery

40
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,560
Who's real

41
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
Disturbed

42
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,472
Fusion

43
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,312
And then Bone Thugs-N-Harmony did take me home

44
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:33,504
He's in the video and walking around with crazy lazy and wish

45
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
Rabbit hole

46
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,208
Good as I remember

47
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
Pretty good stuff

48
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,936
Man I started me going down the road of life

49
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
C-Murder still in

50
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Prison

51
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,968
The new trial

52
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
Anyway

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,880
Surly

54
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Alright

55
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Another look out

56
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375
Another look at it

57
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
Hurley

58
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
No longer Simard

59
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,831
They claim that they did not see a murder

60
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
The questionable musical taste

61
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
And I know a lot about that was just

62
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,303
And I regretfully have to participate

63
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,935
Addresses record this early in the morning we are we are

64
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
But snoke

65
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Better Business

66
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,759
I can't do Mondays

67
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,855
Between episodes

68
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:19,231
To do all the required

69
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,095
Aldi's Normal Day episode

70
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,239
Narratives and silver pretty easy

71
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
Especially

72
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
The bombing.

73
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
That is stuff that we're like

74
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,223
Might take me an hour and a half

75
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
He'll lie about something that requires a

76
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
So

77
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:50,975
For Monday I consider the coast to coast episode

78
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Episode of the week

79
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911

80
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
Ivar understanding

81
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Wednesday

82
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,015
Stuff going on

83
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,879
Both of his lawyers

84
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:27,071
I'm not sure I've seen an episode

85
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
Pat's calls in

86
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
Norm

87
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
And barns

88
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
He's even more eager for The Fray

89
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
Not busy

90
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
Although

91
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
I do

92
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
It's

93
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
We're going to have

94
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:55,487
On way

95
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
Underscoring the show

96
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,983
Jackie

97
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
What's Montello

98
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
Brent podcast

99
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,135
Brent

00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
Appreciate it

101
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,215
You took up the people who signed up on an elevated level

102
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,775
So first of all Josiah

103
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,663
Reverend Peter anomaly

104
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
You are now attacking

105
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
Heroin

106
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,351
Freakishly large

107
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,263
Thank you so much

108
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
To the both of you

109
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,591
Sounds like a Phillips

110
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,407
Character

111
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,063
I'll be right there listening

112
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Going to go website

113
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:37,631
Perhaps one of my contacts

114
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:43,007
Drops going to be.

115
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,079
No this is this is a rare type

116
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
This could not be better

117
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,551
There's a microwave

118
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,207
Is the ideal form

119
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:08,863
How to say

120
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
I'm just stating the facts I own a chainsaw

121
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,503
I'm just stating the facts

122
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
To fight

123
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
I know

124
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
Who owns one

125
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,191
I'm here this is

126
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
The old ball rolling

127
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
Predictable

128
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
Oops I just

129
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,919
Give me back on Facebook

130
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,367
We obviously have the latest developments taking place

131
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
A lot of different fronts

132
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
And we have the latest rerun of

133
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
Whistleblower dogs

134
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
The ambassador to

135
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
Heard somebody say

136
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:32,063
Was quid pro quo just like the other fake whistleblowers whose names we can't know

137
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
Why'd you said that as well

138
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
Justified

139
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
Bill Taylor

140
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
Had to admit

141
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,167
We got a call for the EU ambassador

142
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Beterbiev

143
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,151
You may notice that

144
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,551
Ukraine business specifically

145
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
What are you open to

146
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
The show like that

147
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:13,279
We are the new doesn't start off the show talking about Mick Mulvaney press conference

148
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:22,751
Trump asked for a quid pro quo we do that all the time

149
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,895
It's the reason is that

150
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
Really hard to go

151
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Mulvaney's

152
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Conehead

153
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,279
Maligning Bill Taylor

154
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,143
Diplomat

155
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
For the u.s.

156
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
House committee members privately

157
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,359
Hasn't been released

158
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,199
Page opening statement is very public

159
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
You give your first indication that Alex

160
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,903
Dismissively calling this testimonial bobsheaux

161
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,743
Alex is very scared of what this guy

162
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
The first application is on

163
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
1

164
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
It's like me saying hey.

165
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
Our national security

166
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
Remain strong

167
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,831
However in August and September of this year

168
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
Increasingly concerned that our relationship with Ukraine with being fundamentally undermine by an irregular informal channels

169
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Policy-making

170
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
And by the withholding of vital security issue

171
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
For domestic political

172
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,983
Bill Taylor was the u.s. ambassador to Ukraine

173
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
2006

174
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,311
2009

175
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
Situation in the country

176
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,663
He's absolutely no slouch

177
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
Testifying on official foreign policy

178
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
State Department

179
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
It's a real serious charge

180
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
And it becomes even more serious when you realize the charge Taylor is making is it this second unofficial channel was contradict

181
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,607
Real official Channel

182
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
Of US foreign policy

183
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Namely strong support

184
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
For Ukraine

185
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,031
Taylor's opening statement involves very clear

186
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
Like the following

187
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
June 27th

188
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
Ambassador sondland told me a phone conversation

189
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,527
The president is a queer to President Trump

190
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,367
President zelensky wasn't standing in the investigation

191
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
I don't understand

192
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
That doesn't sound like

193
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:57,119
Taylor provided conversations with ambassadors

194
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Resilience

195
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
Need to say you will help him

196
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,751
Asians and address personnel

197
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
If there are any

198
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
You can play

199
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,431
Sure WhatsApp

200
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,247
On July 20th the representatives olenski

201
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:18,111
Told Taylor the u.s. re-election

202
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:24,255
Calls into question the idea whether people on the Ukrainian side were aware

203
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,327
Of the machination

204
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Put that

205
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
Question

206
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,983
Taylor Skype conversations with ambassadors

207
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,055
Explicitly tells them

208
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Zelensky

209
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Publicly saying

210
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
They were going to do

211
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Investigation

212
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
President zelensky

213
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,551
In a public box

214
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
Shirts

215
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
You can't trust

216
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Sure

217
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,863
The inability of any Us official to respond Ukrainian Ukrainian

218
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Question

219
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Security systems

220
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
Problems m

221
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,799
LED idea that they ask what's going on

222
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,615
You don't sound exactly like how Trump

223
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:18,271
The operate like a mobster you know what you're supposed to do and you're not going to get me to

224
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,855
Say it so just do it or they'll be problem

225
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Criminal

226
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:31,583
Enterprises

227
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
Iverson

228
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,471
Call I would like to buy some drugs

229
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Illegally

230
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:45,151
I drive over with cops behind

231
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
And then I buy my weed

232
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
That's how it works

233
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,527
By the books

234
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,183
It is true that Taylor's opening statement does include a passage about a conversation that he had with Tim Morrison

235
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Security Council

236
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,535
Morrison spoken with Trump

237
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,863
He was he was not asking for a quid pro quo

238
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:12,287
Go to a microphone and say

239
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
Election interference

240
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
And the president's events

241
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
Should himself

242
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,223
Right

243
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,575
I guess the Trump did technically pro quo

244
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,391
Describes

245
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
II

246
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
Now you have

247
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,583
Otherwise it doesn't count

248
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
Magic

249
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:45,311
It's very hard to read this opening statement and get the impression that there was not a quid pro quo going on

250
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
You could read it and take

251
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,943
The parts that say there was no

252
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Those are

253
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
From

254
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
I am the evidence

255
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
Dmkc

256
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
Contradict

257
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
There was no

258
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
So I am offering

259
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
Actually

260
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
I am withholding Aid

261
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,775
In order for you to do something that I would like you to do

262
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
Yeah and then when you do that I will give you that a

263
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
I don't understand

264
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
Arizona

265
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,759
A big deal

266
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
YouTube ideas

267
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
It's hard to know precisely what

268
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
But if this

269
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
It was very like

270
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
F****** damning stuff

271
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
Just from this one person

272
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
In this opening statement

273
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,775
You have multiple named people like vulcar Sunland

274
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
Among other people

275
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
Who had Direct conversations with Trump

276
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,967
Just from this there's a clear roadmap

277
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Do an investigation

278
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,575
The people you need to ask questions about to get on the road

279
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,135
Furiously

280
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
Seriously thinking about turning on Trump

281
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Right now

282
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
Now is the

283
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,327
But I'm not going to do it ever has

284
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,631
For a while now

285
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,215
And if you're about to enter an area where

286
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
There's nothing you

287
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Good luck

288
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,711
But look man that's just assuming that there's openings

289
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Was real

290
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,807
There's a possibility

291
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Expect

292
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
There's a possibility

293
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Is that going to

294
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Discussed here

295
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Rizal

296
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,631
Open Patel Schiff wrote this latest statement this guy put out of it it's so obvious of the fake letter

297
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
Chef redhead let's do that

298
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
Chef

299
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
Reading the fake

300
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Letter

301
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
It was supposedly the fake transcript

302
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,783
The last month Adam Schiff read what you might call a parody version of the restaurant

303
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,159
Where

304
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,207
In the mobster quality

305
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:18,911
Some boneheaded move but others might think it's a worthwhile strategy

306
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
Creatively make

307
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
I've noted the matter other than that when I first heard about shift doing that I knew immediately that Alex

308
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,551
Layout quotes

309
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
The essence of what the present

310
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
Do you have to be an idiot or Shameless propaganda

311
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
Set off as a real doctor

312
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,071
How about both

313
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Did the big pizza

314
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
Kaiser like Trump

315
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,471
Defenses are real

316
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
Easterby

317
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,127
We get through that little segments

318
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
Real serious

319
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Teasing

320
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
Real serious

321
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:11,135
In major Wars

322
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
Try to stabilize their economy

323
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Trying

324
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Reboot

325
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
American Spirit

326
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,399
But under Trump's nose

327
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
There's some things going on

328
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
I think you should know about

329
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,871
I think we should talk about

330
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
To do that

331
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
On the other side

332
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:43,391
What's going on with Bono

333
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,279
F****** it's not going to be I support the homeless and we should

334
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
Socializing

335
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,471
It's not going to be Let's help people get access to

336
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,055
Like to discuss what the best options are for public housing

337
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,847
For mental health assistance

338
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Or

339
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:10,271
None of that we don't know what he

340
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,367
Take on it is going to be at what the story is

341
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
So Alex

342
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
Leave that alone in ghosts

343
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
Break a promise

344
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,816
To get back to it later

345
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
This isn't going to be good

346
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,960
Whatever it is whatever your Alex bring up a vulnerable population

347
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,264
You know it's somehow going to be

348
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
You know it somehow

349
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,176
Adding to the possibility of them being further victimized

350
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Exploited

351
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
Pretty confident in saying

352
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
If that is the case

353
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,464
He brings up something to do

354
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Distract

355
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
The larger

356
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
Issue

357
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
And then

358
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Pepper's it with

359
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Cruelty

360
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
So people get that

361
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,472
They don't

362
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
Sure

363
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,176
Dehumanization

364
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Just started

365
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
That kind of mentality

366
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,088
It kind of lead

367
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Towards

368
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
Criminalizing

369
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
Possibly

370
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
Rounding up

371
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
People are not homeless

372
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
Because they failed

373
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
They're homeless speaker

374
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
Because the rest of us

375
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
Because Alex Costa

376
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
He comes back

377
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Is it a real weird

378
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,712
Broadcasting worldwide

379
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,040
I want to let you know

380
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:52,672
I am aware of information going on inside the Trump campaign

381
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,024
That is very very dangerous and very very scary

382
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,376
To the president to this country into all of you watching

383
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
And listening out there

384
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,984
You may have noticed that the Brad parscale

385
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,104
Earlier this week had a huge lavish cover story in the Sunday New York time

386
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,456
About what a wonderful person he is and what he is

387
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
Well

388
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,600
There's better things going on with Brad

389
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,160
Parscale that I'm going to reveal

390
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,464
Later the broadcast today

391
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
He doesn

392
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
Relationship

393
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Administration

394
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
I'm starting to notice

395
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
There's a trend where you

396
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Seems to keep

397
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,264
Finding out about how certain members evolve

398
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
Working against the resurge

399
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
Legends of America

400
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:47,200
A lot of this Falls squarely into the genre of what you might tend to see in a Thor attarian system

401
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,992
Where the media bootleggers

402
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,528
Dwell on Palace

403
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,344
Where the storm of Suspicion

404
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
Is always raging

405
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
Threatening

406
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,696
Appeared to be loyal enough to the leader

407
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,536
Without some starting to notice a slightly different character

408
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
Particular type of Paladin

409
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,424
Namely that all the people he seems to think our threats within the administration

410
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,752
Or specifically people who apparently don't like Alex enough

411
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,664
We saw this generals McMaster and Mattis globalist infiltrator

412
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,296
Which was how Alex communicated direct messages to Trump

413
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
Which is weird on its own

414
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
Similar problems with

415
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,160
The former Chief of Staff

416
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,488
And now the crosshairs are fixed on Brad parscale

417
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:38,144
It should be mentioned that Alex has recently complained about

418
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Who is Alex Jones

419
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,984
Hard to hear Alex now uncovering

420
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,800
Some kind of scary and dangerous information about Park

421
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,872
You're not thinking maybe his bruised ego is somehow involved

422
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
Really wants to get back on Facebook

423
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
Publix

424
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
Demonization campaign

425
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
Essential Personnel in Trump's Administration

426
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
In order to get there which is

427
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,208
Funny on one level but really just sat

428
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
Really wants to get back on Facebook

429
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:12,192
The context of the testimony from Zuckerberg yesterday

430
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
Yeah

431
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,008
Give us

432
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,104
Clearly a happy

433
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,200
It is strange

434
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
It is

435
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,576
Yeah but you know what whatever

436
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Alex doesn't think he's

437
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,232
Brad parscale butt

438
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Quite frankly

439
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,840
The man he is

440
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,656
Not the sharpest knife in the drawer

441
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,960
And as a serious weak link

442
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
So is dumb

443
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
I guess

444
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,408
Doesn't get to talkin about what is dangerous and

445
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:56,480
Scary information about Brad parscale

446
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
This episode

447
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Huge gap

448
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
Coming up on Friday

449
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,952
And later in the show he does so to connect these two things

450
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,256
That this Gap has some information

451
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
About

452
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
And the Trump campaign

453
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:16,960
And I was really Alex overselling Friday show

454
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,592
He's going to get killed over this interview

455
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,664
Again I probably got butterflies

456
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,016
10 times the 25 years I've been on air

457
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,576
@donaldtrump

458
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
Butterfly

459
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
I got sick

460
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,720
I get butterflies when I think about

461
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
I guess we're going to have Friday

462
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,120
It's a big gas filter Rogan had

463
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,680
Edward Snowden on

464
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,984
Yesterday but they released a few hours ago that's Graves

465
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,544
Wards.com

466
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,832
This is a really important big interview

467
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,160
And it's it's an emergency message to the president

468
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,744
Listen to

469
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:17,376
Interview where I'm looking under my car literally now for bombs when I

470
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,264
Interview

471
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,104
Coming up Friday in the second hours work schedule

472
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
You're going to want to tune into this

473
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,760
And if something happens to me interview still got to go out

474
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,088
Hotel by the way I don't hide stuff

475
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,136
I tell you how big something else

476
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
Straight up deliver

477
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,560
Before that

478
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,352
The only make us interview large

479
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,192
Anybody would do that

480
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
Nametests

481
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,288
Snowden Edward Edward

482
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,384
If I know what is life

483
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:11,136
He does later like I said give a few close by to it is to do with the Trump campaign to Brad parscale

484
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:15,232
In a normal world

485
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,024
It could still literally

486
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Idea

487
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,424
It could be

488
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Sure

489
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,288
If you weren't in custody I would say that it could be

490
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:33,152
Rogan Vega Alex that have snowed in on

491
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
Assange

492
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,248
Outside of being Augustine is not above going

493
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
He may have been

494
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
A few years ago

495
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,208
I was trying to think of a big name Alex

496
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,488
Could get who's in

497
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,328
Need to pretend

498
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,888
And I just couldn't think of anyone really

499
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,472
Like Rodger Stone coming on is only a danger to Rogers

500
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,800
I thought it could be Steve Bannon for a second

501
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:05,664
But I could never pull that off everything so much time in the past, Steven

502
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Trader

503
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,712
Possibly a globalist

504
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,296
Just started a podcast called war room

505
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,696
Clear infringement of copyright

506
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
Let er Rip

507
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
Yeah that could be a breeze coming out

508
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,912
I thought possible place where he could have

509
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,264
After their unceremonious falling out I thought they probably never speak again

510
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
Turn on it

511
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,104
Steve's YouTube channel has been coming along

512
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,384
Gathering

513
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,456
Justin trying to poach

514
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,528
And I could see him trying to put water out of brass

515
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:47,904
Now you know he was wrong about the Las Vegas but he's one of the greatest

516
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
Are beneficial

517
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Patriots

518
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:54,816
I will give up literally anything to get 1000 more listeners

519
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,352
I could I could see him

520
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
Trying

521
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
Rehab

522
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,264
Yeah for sure possible

523
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
People who ICS

524
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
Fraternity male

525
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,320
Listen to As Much Alex as I have

526
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:26,304
He teased that he had the biggest gas ever coming on later the week and it turned out to be the Obamas

527
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:31,168
So I do not know where Alex's

528
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
That one

529
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:36,544
That one was brutal

530
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
Flushing

531
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:49,600
So Jordan here's a random list of people that I think it might be and I'm mostly putting this list out there in case it's one of them

532
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,720
Turkish prime minister

533
00:30:54,976 --> 00:31:00,864
Joey salads Congressional camp

534
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,264
John McAfee I think that one might be like a real FrontRunner

535
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,992
Just for Longshot points

536
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:23,392
Bubba Sparxxx

537
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:29,536
I'm just putting a dollar on that

538
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
Interview

539
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,568
And it's hard not to get a little excited about

540
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
Could be

541
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:47,712
Everything I own this is going to be

542
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,296
0

543
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:58,208
The Obama Phone Lady again at two possibilities

544
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Yeah

545
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
So

546
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
Right back

547
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,656
The news about people experience

548
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,216
Alex

549
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:19,200
That's good operation

550
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
They've already or wired up

551
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
Let me tell you something

552
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,376
I did some digging this morning

553
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,704
Austin for it

554
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,824
Is doing it through a microchip

555
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
The homeless

556
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,432
Austin I'm already done it in Mexico

557
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,480
Guatemala and now

558
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
It's here

559
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
Took my first thought about this is it

560
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,368
Strange of every nefarious

561
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
Same area Alex lives in

562
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Eddie's

563
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,144
Just keep coming up over and over again

564
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
Keep happening in Austin

565
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
Likely

566
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Almost

567
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,408
Proximity

568
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:26,016
Novels are set

569
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:31,136
Statistically doesn't make sense

570
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Plus

571
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
If you are the globalist

572
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,560
Crusade

573
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,352
The thing that keeps uncovering your plots

574
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
Cities home City of Austin

575
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,448
Looks like you might move your operation somewhere else

576
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,984
Go to Cincinnati

577
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,056
Austin give a s*** about Cincinnati

578
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,640
Globalist

579
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,968
Talking about

580
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
Twist just making

581
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,272
Stuff up

582
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,808
There is an organization that

583
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,136
Working with people experiencing homelessness

584
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,672
Implantable form of

585
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
Application

586
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
The argument goes like this

587
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,328
In order to access many of the benefits

588
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,376
You survived

589
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,424
In order

590
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
Need identification

591
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,800
However these same people are precisely

592
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
Is the store these documents

593
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
Yeah what are they going to

594
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Carry around

595
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
If you live on the

596
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:37,440
Out of a backpack away from losing your Social Security card

597
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,328
Possibility that just living in the

598
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,120
Elements Mike Destroyer

599
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
Jason card without any incident

600
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,752
This leads to people in that situation

601
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Having

602
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
Constant state of

603
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
Applying for the

604
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,896
Which becomes an awful cycle

605
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
You end up in

606
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,552
And you can only imagine what kind of like that would cause a

607
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
Horrible psychological experience

608
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Trapped

609
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,672
Been unable to get to the next step

610
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Constantly

611
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Reset

612
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,536
These sorts of barriers are a frustrating part of life

613
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
For people in these circumstances

614
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,376
And a golden problems like this one in Austin

615
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:22,240
Is to eliminate some of those barriers

616
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
Getting back to heaven

617
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Secure life

618
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Right

619
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,360
I don't know how I feel about this program as a whole

620
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,200
Obviously I scored the goal behind to be done to help

621
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,736
Homelessness

622
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,296
And that is developed with input

623
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,088
Is something that is worth being a

624
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Explored

625
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:41,696
There's some concern about data security

626
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,792
Programming promise

627
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Technology

628
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
In order to

629
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
To service

630
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,168
Yeah so

631
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
Curly under the control

632
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,776
The individual

633
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:02,176
Call only to have access to that medical

634
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
Information

635
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
There is some

636
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,248
Compartmentalization

637
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
The data

638
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
Blockchain

639
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
It's very interesting

640
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
The way they're trying to set this up

641
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,976
And like I said show some early promise

642
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,512
On that front

643
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
If those are took

644
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,840
Considerations are adequately

645
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,864
It's shown to help

646
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
The community at the

647
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,568
Whatever your position is on the issue 1

648
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
Presenting this like it's breaking news

649
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:37,760
And that's because Mike Adams just ran a story about this on natural news

650
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,064
Sound the alarm

651
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,880
But don't get it twisted this is not news

652
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,208
I've been stories about the beginning of this program dating back to

653
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
April 28th

654
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
26-28

655
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,656
Harvard's datasmart law Grand Apizza

656
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
2018

657
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
The Austin American

658
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:01,568
Statesman covered a new grant for the program back on August 2nd 2019

659
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
Local news in Austin

660
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
KXAN

661
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,688
Covered the program on July 31st

662
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
2019

663
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
This isn't something it's like

664
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,320
It's just been developed in secret

665
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
It's not hidden

666
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
Plain Sight

667
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,416
It's a program that aims to alleviate the

668
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,952
Under-recognized

669
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Apple's of

670
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
Homelessness

671
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,792
Many outlets have covered

672
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,096
Disgust for a year-and-a-half now

673
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,912
Alex's team is just super bad at news

674
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
Let no idea to Pismo

675
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,496
Microchipping program was

676
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
City that they live in in

677
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
Opera

678
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,848
Who's just embarrassing stuff

679
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,432
The severity of like

680
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
Crack the Case on

681
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
Is is a mass

682
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,624
Discovering we didn't know about this for a year-and-a-half

683
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
Key issue for them

684
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,744
Like it should be squarely in their wheelhouse

685
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,792
This should be something we've been talkin about

686
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,120
I mean it's literally

687
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,704
Way that he describes the mark of the beast

688
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
So if you are adult

689
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,312
To news that is not

690
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
Local news

691
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:14,016
Susan Austin you should definitely have been aware of it it suggests the really bad news.

692
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,320
Considering

693
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:20,672
All sorts of other places have B very openly

694
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Is Joyce's

695
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,520
Disallows

696
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:41,920
Possibly have a better chance of breaking out of the cycle of a fly

697
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
In order to

698
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
Get the ball rolling

699
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,064
It's one thing to keep them trapped in the system

700
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
Which Alex's

701
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
Whether or not

702
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
Function of

703
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,512
Supporting

704
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,536
Based on everything I know

705
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
Pretty much active

706
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
Supporting

707
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:06,752
Well

708
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,592
His conception of people who have chips in them

709
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
AI

710
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
We can take over them or something like

711
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,904
Not even people anymore

712
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,000
Minions of the globalist why even bother

713
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,536
Crushing leaves

714
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,584
People who are

715
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,400
In a very vulnerable state

716
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,424
Enlight

717
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,472
Because of their circumstance

718
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:42,080
I did the ideas if you would want to approach that

719
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
Situation

720
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
Social problem

721
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:48,224
And look at it to make it worse for them

722
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,296
Let's make more suspicious

723
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
As opposed to

724
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,368
How can we work together to

725
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Rise

726
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
We could

727
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Homelessness

728
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
Or

729
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,024
We could end the homeless

730
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,864
Those are the two out that is a good way to put it

731
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,168
At least at least it seems like

732
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
Prefers that

733
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
Approach

734
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
Profoundly spot.

735
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Play bulshit

736
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,296
I don't care to hear him over and over again

737
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
Fluoride

738
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,928
That's also kind of boring

739
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,720
But I wanted to play

740
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
Because I think

741
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,048
This is an interesting rare

742
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
Good

743
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,584
Pivot

744
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,680
He's in the middle of talking about fluoride

745
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Bulshit

746
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,776
The actual content

747
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
Wonky

748
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,712
Kind of smooth

749
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Fluoride

750
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,952
Good halogen the iodine

751
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:07,584
Can I get up here and Sensational at all out of the government document the periodic table

752
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Add

753
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
Try to launch a movement against it

754
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,728
Tell the people understanding before I doubt that's a good idea

755
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:17,056
We sell the best cleaners

756
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,360
Relationship

757

Get the best packs to the best x-33 braids for kids

758
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,320
That's a little smoother is because it is just

759
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:34,208
Normal content in the same spot

760
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,304
There's there is an A to B

761
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,656
Before you know it

762
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,680
He should be doing

763
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,264
It's almost a little scary

764
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
Because on some level that is like

765
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:55,455
You hide this better bothering to try and hide

766
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,063
Manufacturing stories

767
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,439
About specific product but I kind of do

768
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:12,095
Demonstrated that a little bit in the past

769
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:22,847
Line by line I going down your Victory job

00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,783
It could

773
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
If you were smart

774
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
Much better plan shows

775
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,511
So the break is at 16 of the hour

776
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,535
So bye

777
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,559
Bennett 40

778
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,655
Of the hour I've got to be in the middle of a rant about fluoride

779
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,471
I need to be able to

780
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,567
Make it appear him

781
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,383
Right

782
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,343
Commercial

783
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
It goes to commercial

784
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,159
Alex

785
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,743
Has a weird commercial for his commercial

786
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,047
Cover the commercials

787
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,887
These days too much cuz they're mostly like this Alex

788
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,447
This one I think was a little bit worth

789
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,495
Checking in on

790
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,519
Again

791
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:29,919
I'm not talking down to the Infowars audience but I've been banging my head against the wall for a long time

792
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:42,719
What's the old Glastron boat have a lake to put

793
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:55,519
What is a gentleman bad halogen is fluoride that's why in every Western Nation they put in the water

794
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:01,919
Precious light on a Dodge

795
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:08,319
Because it's the good outweighs everything else

796
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:14,207
String of commercials

797
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,255
That is weird

798
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,703
I'm not talking down to you I own you need water for a boat

799
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
Never heard

800
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,287
Professional ads

801
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
People going like

802
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,335
Let's play

803
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
In

804
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,127
An overly comp

805
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
Placated

806
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,687
Doesn't actually make any sense

807
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:41,343
It's not if not I want to talk about

808
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,255
Comparing the human need for oxygen to boats need for water

809
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Hind

810
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,071
Like we need to be in a Knox

811
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,119
Enriched environment to survive

812
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,399
Needs to be in water to do what

813
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
Supposed to do with a boat

814
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,007
Take a submarine

815
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:04,895
Apparel

816
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:09,503
Metaphor working for iodine in the body

817
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:14,367
We do need iodine like you know

818
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,903
Atmosphere

819
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,951
We just need to take a little bit of it

820
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
Function properly

821
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,279
I would say his metaphors has been

822
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,839
They take the fuel of the boat needs to run

823
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,935
Food is food

824
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,751
Mineral that helps the body work

825
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
Who be like

826
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
Antifreeze

827
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:38,175
Are babies a piston or something

828
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
That's all

829
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,087
There's more important

830
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
Alright

831
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:55,071
My first comment is today that the global put fluoride in the water in the West

832
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,911
Is maybe making his Christian identity ideas a little bit to over

833
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,239
That is not a dog whistle that's a f****** siren

834
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055
Keep in mind that this is how Alex is trying to bark

835
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
Products

836
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,127
I don't feel like it

837
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,663
Used to be the early that blunt

838
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:18,623
I'm trying to sell to a specific audience

839
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,415
Edward Edward

840
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
Maybe

841
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:24,767
Alright

842
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,119
So

843
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
My first glaring problem with the

844
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:36,799
I'm about fluoride to their water

845
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:42,687
Austria Belgium Croatia Estonia France Germany Greece Italy

846
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
Fluoridation

847
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,503
Are plenty of Christians in those countries

848
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
Considered

849
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,343
Well parts

850
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,927
Do the problem 4 oz narrative

851
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,999
The teachers Christians to lay down and die

852
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,143
Put fluoride in all the holy water.

853
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:08,799
Answers for China and fluoridation Alex's correct

854
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
Contacts

855
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:16,479
China and India both don't have fluoride water partially because they exist on top of it

856
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,527
Naturally occurring fluoride

857
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,087
This belt contains 85 million

858
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,111
Tons of fluoride

859
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,719
Has the expected effect of making their water supplies naturally high in fluoride

860
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:33,631
There be no point in naturally occurring levels are higher than any place in the United States

861
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,191
Even after we've added to the water

862
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:42,591
This is a public health problem that's cause increased rates of dental fluorosis and even fluoride toxicity

863
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:48,735
The world it's very heavily discussed issue and the real issues in the world related

864
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Would understand this

865
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,599
All Alex knows of the China doesn't add fluoride to their water

866
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,927
That's all you needs to know about a big butt

867
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:04,095
I could find I can't find any information about China adding to their water

868
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
Elations in 1995

869
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,167
Iodine

870
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,727
To address the high prevalence of iodine deficiency

871
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Population

872
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:16,639
Well us hasn't made a law about it we've been to table salt since 1924

873
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,407
Anchoring test

874
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:21,247
About 70% of all salt iodized

875
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:26,367
Probably be higher but we don't have as big of an iodine deficiency problem

876
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:31,231
Most likely due to varying

877
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,767
Natural water supply

878
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
Who cares

879
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,863
So what you're saying is the globe

880
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,959
Time and put all the fluoride in the Earth

881
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,263
In order to get rid of the Chinese

882
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,847
I guess Alex good make that argument

883
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
The time-traveling Patriot web

884
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,015
Globalism

885
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,295
Fluoride

886
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,951
No Bridge Too Far browse to go

887
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:06,815
Why not just the world issues

888
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,983
This is an attempt to attack

889
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
Little Alex

890
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
Kind of mad that

891
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Hasn't in

892
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,639
Globalist

893
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
Perfected

894
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,455
He should be there by

895
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
I think it's implied

896
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,415
In stupidity carries over

897
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:38,815
Starting to sound a little bit like an open appeal to White Christian victimhood narrative

898
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,095
Way more than normal

899
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:40,863
Yeah

900
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,703
Is new line of Infowars branded

901
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:50,591
This indicates to me a bit of a lack of interest in any other demographic

902
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
Which kind of makes sense

903
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:56,223
Like when you talk to your marketing that selectively it's not a good sign for your business

904
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:00,831
Because you're alienating people who are outside of that possible

905
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
Market

906
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:07,487
When you're doing that while you're also running an Everything Must Go sale it kind of feels like you're circling

907
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,815
Would you really go in these with it trying to

908
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,143
Theoretically make it longer

909
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,359
Surprise me if the only people buying it

910
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
So why even bother

911
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:29,247
Like is it really nice or is it just his

912
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,855
Sort of touch.

913
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,463
In the same way that like

914
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,255
Sort of content

915
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
Hidden

916
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:46,911
Is we should have been doing all along

917
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
He's built like

918
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,823
I have a broader appeal

919
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,919
Do you imagine your casting this why

920
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,783
At least these are the indications that I started

921
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,183
Christians being under attack

922
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,975
In the commercial

923
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:17,375
The number of commercials

924
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,679
But I don't remember hearing

925
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,983
Little bit

926
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,031
Surprise

927
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,079
Previously

928
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,103
Like back when he was on

929
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,967
To pretend

930
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,783
You know in order to in order to

931
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,599
And that he is only speaking

932
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,159
Even though he knows he's only

933
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
He still has

934
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,535
In order for

935
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,239
Wear all-white Nashua

936
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,799
Let's put on rogge Lane

937
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Go for it

938
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,943
So I need a news headline

939
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,527
Reinforced

940
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
Doughboy

941
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,255
Alex is muselk

942
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:19,583
Excuses for their beloved all they want but

943
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,607
And doing so

944
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,655
All they do is reveal what they really support

945
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:29,567
Alex can get on his show and here and Report the news these two proud boys are being sent to jail after being found guilty of

946
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,591
Gang salt

947
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:36,479
Brawl in New York

948
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:40,831
You can say all know that all they did was defend themselves from an antifa attack

949
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
True

950
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,135
If you was in any way

951
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
In reality

952
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
You know that

953
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:49,535
Alex is operating off of 1 videos widely-circulated better

954
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,095
Pure to show one of the victims of the

955
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:59,263
If that's the argument goes the Cowboys are just defending themselves antifa started it

956
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:03,103
Subsequent videos of come to the surface that shows very different story

957
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:09,759
Is a water bottle thrown but the person who throws it is doing so in response to the proud boys literally charging

958
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
Hiscox

959
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,831
These are children

960
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,367
One of the men who is sentenced

961
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,903
39 years old

962
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
And he joined group

963
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,279
The only way to get the name cereal

964
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,119
I'm kind of sick of the bulshit so I'm just going to put this simply

965
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,191
The organization that is based

966
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
Environment

967
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:32,799
Ritual is based on

968
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:39,199
Gavin created the game with tiered structure of membership where the only way to get to the fourth level of initiation

969
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,735
Is to get into a violent confrontation

970
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
Temptation with ants

971
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,319
From the second you join with the proud boys

972
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,111
Your way up the ranks

973
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,903
Everything is centered around either

974
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,719
Implied or real political and physical violence

975
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:56,607
If I had a leader who had said specifically they created

976
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,167
The fights guess people are politically disagreeing

977
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Inmates

978
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:04,287
I made submitting to an active group violence necessary to join

979
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,847
And create a hierarchy

980
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,615
The Climb

981
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,919
I promised you I would not find that acceptable

982
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
Even if I come to

983
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,503
Completely agreed with what they stood for and we're working

984
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:18,367
For in the case of Gavin in the proud boys stand for repulsive

985
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,695
And their entire structure is indistinguishable from a gang

986
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:25,023
Mostly centered around misplaced feelings

987
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,583
Nonetheless

988
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,935
Anyone carrying water for the proud Boys in 2019 knows exactly what they're doing

989
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:37,311
Extremely right-wing white men have free reign to assault people they politically disagree

990
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,359
That is what Alex wants

991
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,663
And that is why he's presenting

992
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,199
Their incarceration is

993
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:47,551
Pureed

994
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,831
Make America great again

995
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,367
About what

996
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,415
We used to always have

997
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,951
Roving gangs

998
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
Hurting and murdering

999
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
Defending

1000
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,047
Proud boys

1001
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,399
Is only like

1002
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Protecting

1003
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:10,079
That's the only thing

1004
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
Being,

1005
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:19,551
Like I could see that as

1006
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:25,951
That and not actually wanting Road and kings.

1007
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,743
Alex

1008
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,511
If

1009
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,047
For him

1010
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,327
He needs to get off air

1011
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,119
Because he is so stupid

1012
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,167
So unable to

1013
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,215
Present information

1014
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,239
He's doing is

1015
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,335
Accidentally misleading literally everybody listen

1016
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,127
Well you know I know

1017
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,663
I know he's not

1018
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
I know he knows we

1019
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,991
Cuz that clip

1020
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,271
The guy throwing the Water by

1021
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807
Obviously

1022
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,831
The right-wing

1023
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
Edited

1024
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,391
What they did was

1025
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,415
They started it

1026
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,463
With

1027
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,487
Peter Griffin

1028
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,023
Running shirt

1029
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:04,095
Yeah

1030
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
Very self-conscious

1031
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:15,359
Phil Collins songs

1032
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,663
Me for a blanket

1033
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,711
Jordan 14

1034
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,503
It's fine

1035
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
We all right

1036
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,671
Easy Lover is a great song

1037
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,487
Easy love

1038
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
What are you at

1039
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,703
Kidville,

1040
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
For sure

1041
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,591
Talk about just got another

1042
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,871
A big

1043
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,639
Story

1044
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
Fetty WAP

1045
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:53,503
Literally talk about this too much but it's definitely like a touchstone

1046
00:56:56,063 --> 00:57:02,207
Also trying to pass laws the word b****

1047
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:06,559
Manchaca Wes is going to be f*****

1048
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,167
No one is trying to ban the word b****

1049
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,983
Actually that's not true there's one person who is

1050
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,519
A random person

1051
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,287
Massachusetts

1052
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,127
In the Statehouse in Massachusetts representative Dan Hunt

1053
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,943
Introduce spell Outlaws

1054
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,295
But it was because he was trying to censor people or overturn free speech

1055
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,855
Most of the right-wing media would have you believe

1056
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,671
It's because he was following Massachusetts law

1057
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:37,791
Massachusetts has what's known as the

1058
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
Built-in

1059
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,351
The state constitution

1060
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,655
Predates the founding of the United States

1061
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,935
Which allows citizen

1062
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,495
Send bills to the representative

1063
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,311
It's the responsibility of State reps to give their

1064
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,591
Constituents

1065
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:53,407
Government and that's exactly what happened to you

1066
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:59,295
An unnamed Massachusetts residents that Dan Hunter build introduced that would outlaw the use of the word b****

1067
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,879
Did what he was supposed to do

1068
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:07,487
According to the guardian at least 6,000 bills get introduced through the right of freedom

1069
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,255
Massachusetts

1070
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,863
This is a kind of a perfect example of why Alex Jones f******

1071
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
Sucks

1072
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:17,215
It's so interesting how Massachusetts has this right of free petition

1073
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:23,615
Yeah never heard of that one of his listeners I'll probably get a lot out of learning

1074
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:27,711
Country state government

1075
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:31,295
There's a lot of opportunity for some much-needed Civics education

1076
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:35,391
The perfect way in for that

1077
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:40,767
Alex could talk about how this Quirk of Massachusetts boys allowed real direct action to take place

1078
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:44,607
Like how in 2013 and 8 year old kid with pushing for a bill

1079
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,399
To put restrictions on shark Finning

1080
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:53,055
Or else could go the opposite direction and talk about I went 2011 someone tried to request their representative do something about how

1081
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,615
Football games were pre-empting Jeopardy

1082
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:02,015
It's the yin and the Yang of people actually having a boy's I think about it the more I realize I know why

1083
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,039
I don't know about this

1084
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:07,391
How many how many how many of those 6,000

1085
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,415
Petitions are

1086
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,463
Buck Dave

1087
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,791
Discount Pascal

1088
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,143
If everybody knew about this

1089
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,959
Circumstance

1090
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:22,751
Maybe not

1091
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,311
Known

1092
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,871
I want you to send a bill to your representative

1093
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,919
Make knowledge fight the state

1094
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:35,039
Podcast I lived in Boston for a number in Cambridge

1095
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:46,047
We don't need to be the official state podcast but I would like a parade

1096
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,079
Like this is this is the sort of thing

1097
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:02,431
Maybe we're abusing the system a little bit here but there's a lot

1098
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,199
The conversation

1099
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:07,295
What is behind this clickbait story

1100
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,343
Civics Works in one of the great States

1101
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,903
He just ignores

1102
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:17,023
You can see the headline about someone trying to outlaw the word b****

1103
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,351
And he just takes it that's good enough and building it outrageous

1104
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,399
Cycle

1105
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,959
Free speech in the global storm control how you talk

1106
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,495
It's pathetic in Trivial

1107
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,287
It's pointless to even critique

1108
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
Because

1109
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,871
What he's doing is uninspired

1110
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:32,895
Except

1111
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,199
Movie hopelessly lost among his audience

1112
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,551
What makes it so insanely dumb as to imagine that what he saying

1113
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,831
Is true

1114
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,367
Imagine if he's right

1115
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:46,207
Imagine that someone in the Massachusetts state house was trying to ban the word b****

1116
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,487
Who gives a s***

1117
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,023
Bill would never pass

1118
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,863
Massachusetts ACLU

1119
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,911
Would get struck down so fast

1120
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,495
This is right wing Outreach clickbait pure and simple

1121
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,335
And what you really get down to it that's most of what Alex has left

1122
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,431
Right

1123
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,199
You know

1124
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,759
He was bigger than this

1125
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,551
The earliest you pretended to

1126
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
To be bigger than this

1127
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,111
Tireminder

1128
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:15,647
It's just

1129
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,183
Too often

1130
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,023
Reality is

1131
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,815
Starkly against

1132
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,143
F******

1133
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,423
Headstrong against

1134
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,959
The concept of reality

1135
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,007
Itself that what else do they have the

1136
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,639
They have to make it up I think it I think it's one of those things we had like a really good

1137
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:39,199
Good but you have a sustainable balance

1138
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,991
Between the Yukon

1139
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:47,391
The rest of the world

1140
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,415
It was a kind of

1141
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:52,255
You know adversario like alright close to the Sun

1142
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,791
They took the game

1143
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,583
To too high of a level where

1144
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,375
Is it like everyone is now like

1145
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,655
Okay you're a problem

1146
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:04,287
Good plan under the radar for quite a while

1147
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,079
$10 a day

1148
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
Easy

1149
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,895
60 of 100

1150
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,431
In one day you'll get caught

1151
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
You wait

1152
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,991
Spread out over 10 days

1153
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,783
Ecco hundred dollars

1154
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,599
Noticed

1155
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,647
Every workplace

1156
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,671
Like they could have kept

1157
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,207
Stealing $10 a day

1158
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,743
But they wanted that hundred

1159
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:26,303
This is the consequence

1160
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,607
One last job

1161
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,191
You know you're you're running the the you're robbing banks

1162
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:35,007
You know you're not going for the you're just going for the cash

1163
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,287
You're doing great

1164
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,335
You do the one big job in the

1165
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:39,871
Atoka

1166
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,943
So you know this is the only free

1167
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,503
Free Speech issue that Alex has to talk about words

1168
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,039
He's got another headline

1169
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,623
Short clip

1170
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,439
Who was shot by the person that complained

1171
01:02:54,207 --> 01:03:00,351
Dangerous for Americans once

1172
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,679
Are walking along

1173
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,959
Weather

1174
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,079
Verboten word

1175
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,639
Navigation

1176
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,199
All right now.

1177
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:40,543
Mountain said the okay symbol that law enforcement uses the

1178
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,079
Divers used

1179
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:50,783
Mama dishwasher

1180
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,599
Okay and of course the NBA there's a proper

1181
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,879
Clothing line

1182
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
Your symbol

1183
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,023
380 eldercide

1184
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,583
You're going to lose your house going to go to jail

1185
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:07,935
There are boxes

1186
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:12,031
Arrested for speech

1187
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,431
Couple of white students were repeatedly yelling the n-word on the campus of Uconn

1188
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,455
Student dorms

1189
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:24,063
Illegal to say the n word

1190
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:24,831
Be taken gear

1191
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:29,183
Who's on campus property

1192
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:32,767
Such a public manner that someone on the in one of the buildings

1193
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:39,679
This does create an environment if you're black student in one of those

1194
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,495
Like it not making you feel unsafe

1195
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:46,079
Make you feel unwelcome

1196
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
It doesn't even

1197
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:52,735
If you are they were out there just screaming

1198
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
The same

1199
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,295
You be like that we got to get you the f***

1200
01:04:55,551 --> 01:05:00,415
Well yes.

1201
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,719
But it could be some other

1202
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,535
You're not a priority

1203
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,071
It's V

1204
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:12,703
Factor of is less the word itself in the behavior

1205
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:18,335
The word exercising the word is bad

1206
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,639
Behavior is the problem

1207
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Just problem

1208
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,967
The big problem to

1209
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,783
If you're the school administrators you have to do some

1210
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:33,695
If you don't do anything you're sending the message

1211
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,463
Unwelcome

1212
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,255
Because of their race is okay

1213
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,303
Very dangerous normalizing

1214
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,399
The fact to just let students run around campus Edward from a school admin

1215
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,167
Perspective

1216
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,519
The real option to either kick them out of school or in for some kind of punishment

1217
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,151
These records were charged with ridicule based on race

1218
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:53,919
Which is a crime

1219
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
Connecticut

1220
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,991
According to the general statutes

1221
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,271
Connecticut

1222
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:02,111
The punishment of up to $50 or 30 days

1223
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:07,487
These kids will definitely not get any jail time for this so if I had to bet I would say that they're going to

1224
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,839
This is really actually what I think

1225
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:15,935
And maybe I'm wrong on this and willing to be told that I'm wrong

1226
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:18,751
But I kind of feel like this is a good processor

1227
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,287
For dealing with a point Behavioral

1228
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,591
Particularly in a college

1229
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,383
There needs to be a Punisher

1230
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,175
But it shouldn't be overly harsh

1231
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:32,063
And the door needs to be open for them to learn about why they did this thing it's awful

1232
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,111
What do you have a punished

1233
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:34,879
Not like this

1234
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,415
It's a negative

1235
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,207
That's good

1236
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,511
And it also opens up the possibility of

1237
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,583
People who are different

1238
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:48,703
Perspective miles for conversation

1239
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:51,007
To become

1240
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,359
It is

1241
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,383
Healthy

1242
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
Process

1243
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,199
They can go on

1244
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,735
And that process is

1245
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,039
Completely disrupted by people like Alex

1246
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
And all this

1247
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,599
Outrage driven right

1248
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:10,207
Because of their framing of the case people like Alex have created the illusion

1249
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,999
Two kids are involved in a very important

1250
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
Free speech

1251
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Case

1252
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:17,375
If they're so inclined

1253
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:21,983
Just because of the exposure

1254
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:27,871
In essence what the right-wing media does is create countervailing forces

1255
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
Against the process

1256
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:31,967
Run its course without people like Alex

1257
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,735
Call

1258
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:36,063
It's not to save these kids are going to do this

1259
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
No

1260
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:41,183
Start a GoFundMe

1261
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,463
$50,000

1262
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:48,607
Easy like that's f****** capitalize on this

1263
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,239
It gives cases like this

1264
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,359
Is that possibility of another path to go down as opposed to learning

1265
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:04,991
And I think it's some people might say like a you should kick them out of school

1266
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,551
An egregious examples

1267
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,343
In this case

1268
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,927
I think that you have the opportunity for

1269
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,511
Conciliation

1270
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,791
Have the

1271
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,559
This is

1272
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:21,887
I know that they were screaming the n-word on

1273
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,679
An examination of it

1274
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,471
Circumstance

1275
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:30,079
It seemed like they were yelling other words as well

1276
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,871
Targeting black people

1277
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,895
And we're just trying to

1278
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,431
Play a game where they yell defense

1279
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,759
Okay

1280
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,575
Sure you guys just keep

1281
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,487
Did the issue

1282
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,279
Okay

1283
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,815
Given those circumstances

1284
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,399
The effect on people who are in those dorms

1285
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,959
Behavior is not change

1286
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,007
Yeah but the possibilities

1287
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
They

1288
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,311
Could learn from

1289
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,175
And try and terrorize better erase

1290
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,711
So you need to make it so

1291
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,247
Isn't Sosa

1292
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,807
Severe that it inhibits the possibility

1293
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,087
Learn

1294
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:19,999
I don't know I'd be interested in other people's perspective on it but from where I am looking at it like trying to imagine

1295
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,791
How you would handle this from

1296
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,839
Superintendent

1297
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
Perspective

1298
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,399
That seems like the most

1299
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,215
Likely to get the desired outcome

1300
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:29,983
What you want

1301
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,799
By my lonely

1302
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,079
Like

1303
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,103
What you're looking

1304
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
Forest

1305
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,639
Something that's

1306
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,455
You want something that

1307
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,247
Equally

1308
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,271
Treating

1309
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,575
The problem

1310
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
And

1311
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,367
And that kind of stuff

1312
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,415
And that's another thing that the right wing

1313
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,439
Media is

1314
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,255
Right

1315
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:58,655
Treat the problem and also honor the people who are being Behavior

1316
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,703
You need to balance those two things

1317
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,335
Yeah that sounds good

1318
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,639
Pregnant

1319
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,407
Taking those two

1320
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,223
Considerations are looking for the best way forward

1321
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,015
In

1322
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,367
Possible white like actually

1323
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,183
This behavior from the right wing

1324
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,463
Media is not

1325
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,231
Particularly

1326
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,303
The right-wing media is

1327
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,095
Participating in

1328
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,375
Protecting what is a

1329
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,959
When they f****** love

01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:38,335
Galaxy S8

1331
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,639
Tyranny

1332
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,663
This is it all runs

1333
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,687
Track

1334
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,503
About this because of

1335
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:50,623
They just wants white people to be allowed to yell racial slurs and create hostile faces for non-white people

1336
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,671
Let's be doesn't think that that's a problem

1337
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,511
Norm pattis

1338
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:01,887
Amazon

1339
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
Connecticut

1340
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:04,959
Norm

1341
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,007
Be there lawyer

1342
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:11,615
In talking about why he wants to be there

1343
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:15,199
Norm Norm music

1344
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:15,967
Oh no

1345
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:22,367
Because I think this paste is right for a constitutional challenge

1346
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:26,975
Which country is always had

1347
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:30,815
And the n-word is one of those words with B contact brick

1348
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:37,471
If I walk up to a black person say yo n**** what up

1349
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:42,847
And so what makes this word offensive is the contact

1350
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:46,943
Offended the ability to

1351
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,991
Norm

1352
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,527
Norms

1353
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:58,719
No more

1354
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:10,495
Really just trying to shoot an arrow at a bar and he doesn't miss miss to the side

1355
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,359
Never going to

1356
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:19,711
They just never going to get it

1357
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:20,991
Supposed to

1358
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,015
I hate him

1359
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
It's

1360
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,087
It's so stupid it's very weird

1361
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,135
It's very

1362
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:33,535
There's no need for Norm to say that earlier

1363
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,583
There's no reason

1364
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:41,471
Hey hey

1365
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:45,567
Well I'm not hitting too hard

1366
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,151
Come out

1367
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,431
I'm

1368
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:57,087
Elementary

1369
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,135
Simple most language

1370
01:12:59,391 --> 01:12:59,903
Does work

1371
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:04,511
Circumstantial

1372
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,303
If that's not any kind of like

1373
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:12,703
Interaction

1374
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,239
Penis head

1375
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,287
Text of what

1376
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,359
Absolutely

1377
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:22,687
Are you serious you don't understand that Norm

1378
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,223
It is funny how he's like

1379
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,271
See if a context

1380
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,807
And now I'm going to use it

1381
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,831
In the precise

1382
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:34,719
Use this word

1383
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,511
Oh yeah yeah

1384
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,839
I may be a verb

1385
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,887
I don't know if I've heard the n-word on

1386
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:42,911
The show

1387
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,471
In the past

1388
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:50,591
Yeah

1389
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:59,039
Could get him in FCC trouble

1390
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,111
Like I really I do

1391
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:07,231
Messages

1392
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,815
I don't know

1393
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,607
I don't know what the rules are

1394
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,887
It seems like that

1395
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:20,799
The rules

1396
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,335
Say that and preferably

1397
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,615
Stop speaking in Pratt

1398
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
It's wild

1399
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,551
Might be a false

1400
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,831
This whole thing

1401
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:38,207
Probably

1402
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:44,607
No no you shut the f*** you're being willfully obtuse

1403
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:49,471
Accused of anything bad

1404
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:56,127
Norm just false flag event do we know these guys didn't Jesse Smollett something

1405
01:14:56,383 --> 01:15:00,735
Pentwater folks to do this

1406
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,015
Muji

1407
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,599
What

1408
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,119
Tigers are people just trying to tease folks

1409
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,911
False flaggers

1410
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,727
Damn he's trying to pronounce

1411
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:28,639
Albany

1412
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,759
Don't look or act White

1413
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,295
Yeah

1414
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,343
Holyshit Alex

1415
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:43,743
Totally fine send a text

1416
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:47,327
No larger meaning whatsoever

1417
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:07,039
After Alex has like his lawyer said the n-word a couple times

1418
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:12,159
Which implies there is a way

1419
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:17,279
Leaving alone the entirety of like a being like they don't look white

1420
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:22,399
No not that

1421
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,703
Angry meme

1422
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,543
You guys

1423
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,567
You guys are gone

1424
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,711
At the beginning because

1425
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,015
You know it's okay to microchipping Alma

1426
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
Cruel

1427
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
Holyshit

1428
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,719
Wow this is

1429
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:50,815
This is unbelievably

1430
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,863
This is such like

1431
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,167
This is two white dudes who think

1432
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,967
After a show and tell him like you want to hear a joke

1433
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,783
And then tossing and racial slurs in the joke cuz he's like

1434
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,087
Your white-on-white we know how funny

1435
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,111
It's like dude

1436
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:17,439
F*** you Alex

1437
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,719
Kicked off social media

1438
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:24,607
And all that one of the things that I speculated was a possible outcome

1439
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:28,191
A lot of the stuff that might have been there

1440
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,471
Subtly

1441
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:32,543
And under control a little bit before going to come up

1442
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,127
Goddamn

1443
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:40,223
Alex's adds this fluoride

1444
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,271
News about attack in Christian

1445
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:47,391
See little bit more this is coming through

1446
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,719
Allowed to speak freely

1447
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:54,815
This whatever all social media for this long

1448
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,095
What time is it

1449
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,143
But whatever

1450
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:05,055
Alex's just like a cool font truth-teller

1451
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,847
He's entertaining it's like that

1452
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,151
The stuff

1453
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,807
And also remember that

1454
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,903
Norm is also the guy who posted a video or a picture

1455
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
I mean

1456
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,743
Of like A3 white beer can

1457
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,791
Surround sound

1458
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,815
That's right Crewcuts

1459
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,351
Corzo router

1460
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,239
Yeah

1461
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,007
Truly

1462
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:39,615
I just messed up

1463
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,175
Computer chips

1464
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,967
We can always know where they are

1465
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,831
Norma's gone

1466
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,903
Alex wants to talk about why

1467
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,951
He wants to stick around on air

1468
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,303
And I'm so glad my lawyer drop and Edward

1469
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:04,703
I'm so glad that we've been around for as long as we have doing this show because like this

1470
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,471
Ambitious

1471
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:09,311
If we had no idea

1472
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:12,127
This takes on as mayor of hilarity

1473
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:24,927
Berlin Wall

1474
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:31,327
Show me big story. A lot of corruption and told

1475
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:35,423
Broadcast shutdown

1476
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,983
I don't want to just

1477
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:45,151
Continue on

1478
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
Bureau

1479
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:54,367
Nothing will go wrong this where in reruns

1480
01:19:54,623 --> 01:20:00,767
Right after the election year Jerome corsi setting up a DC bureau there's just in his f****** apartment or whatever

1481
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:12,287
Euro with Jerome

1482
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,872
Of course

1483
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,016
Let's do this again

1484
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,552
Alex let me tell you why

1485
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,856
Jerome corsi

1486
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,720
I think

1487
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,512
First of all

1488
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,304
I would assume

1489
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,352
He did do that it was why he was at

1490
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:40,192
Right after the election was on top of the world

1491
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:48,128
The audience

1492
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:54,528
Outlet

1493
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:58,368
Rentals at the White House

1494
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,928
Like profit Drive off of that

1495
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,488
I think he probably wants to see if he can do it again

1496
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,256
Not going to work

1497
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,024
Nope

1498
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,048
Second

1499
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,608
Whatever

1500
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,632
Ribeiro

1501
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,400
Would be

1502
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,960
Very easily achieved by having

1503
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,752
An enterprising listener indeed

1504
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,544
That person

1505
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,568
If there are

1506
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,616
If they were insane

1507
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,408
And had a flip phone

1508
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:25,248
Even if you can record on you could have

1509
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,272
In a second

1510
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:30,112
Yeah or let's say hey I don't know

1511
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:36,512
6 unpaid interns running the show now so why not you got another one of your audience members would

1512
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,280
Do it for exposure

1513
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,072
Yeah 100

1514
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,120
100%

1515
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,192
Maybe an iPhone is

1516
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,728
Good enough to record

1517
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,264
You're special reports on

1518
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,312
Yes

1519
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,080
Dollars

1520
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,896
It would take almost

1521
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,200
Nothing to get a dumb listener in

1522
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,760
Step Up 2

1523
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:04,160
Play conference

1524
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,000
You don't need a DC Bureau

1525
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,048
If no one listens

1526
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,352
So

1527
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,168
We already had one

1528
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:21,056
That's my that's my reason

1529
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,896
I do think it'd be really fun to work it out

1530
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,664
Infowars

1531
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
Just as Lief

1532
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:29,248
Contrarian

1533
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:32,064
In d.c.

1534
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,624
I don't know my parents live in Austin

1535
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,952
Physically around

1536
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,256
Really fun for it to be like Courtney

1537
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:47,168
Like the fairness Doctrine comes back

1538
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:50,240
Alex you could do your show but Darren has the co-host

1539
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,688
You're so dumb

1540
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:03,040
I would take that job

1541
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:08,672
I really believe there are

1542
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,696
That is one of them

1543
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,976
I would absolutely do that

1544
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,560
At this point Alex already had one

1545
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,888
Knock it out of the park

1546
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:21,472
Edward doorbell

1547
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,264
Edward Paddock

1548
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,824
Edward Asner

1549
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,872
Another gas

1550
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:30,688
Is the guy who was

1551
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:34,784
Whistleblower project veritas

1552
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:47,584
She is in studio with us

1553
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,656
Information last week

1554
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:57,056
More and more is coming out

1555
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:01,152
What's sorts of news stories

1556
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:06,784
Actually really nailing down the CNN Styles down

1557
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:13,696
Care too much about that

1558
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:21,888
You were saying

1559
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:28,544
Alice 44

1560
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,200
I love me

1561
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:45,696
Let's talk about you

1562
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,280
Want to talk about

1563
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,072
Name the song

1564
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,096
Toby Keith

1565
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,680
What

1566
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:00,288
Girl don't want no maintenance

1567
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,592
I really don't like this

1568
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:08,992
This is uncomfortable and I'm more uncomfortable now

1569
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,320
Whiskey

1570
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,904
You are singing the n-word

1571
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,184
Song

1572
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,976
Why do a lot of my karaoke

1573
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:23,072
Yeah should have been a cowboy and ride

1574
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,120
No it is not

1575
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,888
Anyway

1576
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,920
Project Veritas video on everybody knows

1577
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,712
Early hopefully

1578
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,064
Toby Keith

1579
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,856
I do like

1580
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,624
Oh that's nice

1581
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,976
Carry the porch

1582
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,304
I'm not sure

1583
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,888
Bright House

1584
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,936
You carry the porch

1585
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:04,032
Is Kerry the verb

1586
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,408
Porch

1587
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,432
Him

1588
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,784
Who's on first

1589
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:20,672
I thought the noun you were talking about is the thing that you sit on

1590
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,952
Lakers

1591
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,720
Right

1592
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,536
Can I record this

1593
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,632
Alex

1594
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,656
Even

1595
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,448
According to his own telling of the story

1596
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,472
He is not

1597
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,496
An important person

1598
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,520
I'm again

1599
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:39,104
I wasn't a journalist I was just on the back into things very low level

1600
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,944
Musica Uplink satellite

1601
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,224
Guy

1602
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,832
Start talking around

1603
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:53,184
Alex

1604
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,256
Oliver Darcy

1605
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:12,896
Here's a guy tried to work here and now he goes to see in and joins the dark side

1606
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:14,432
And it literally goes around

1607
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,712
Police

1608
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,760
Everyone on the internet

1609
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:19,552
You know it's f***** up

1610
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:21,344
It be true

1611
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,648
I don't know if it's true it's

1612
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,672
Seems like I would still need

1613
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:31,072
Conservative-leaning

1614
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,608
Dude years ago

1615
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:35,936
Amazon

1616
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,960
30 under 30

1617
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
Conservative

1618
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,008
Media that he was on

1619
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:42,592
Years ago

1620
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:43,616
Complete and total

1621
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:48,480
I don't I don't know

1622
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,344
I don't I don't know if that's

1623
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:58,208
The truth I don't know I don't know I don't know

1624
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,024
Do you have

1625
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,792
Automatic

1626
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,840
Someone position

1627
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
Or the third

1628
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,680
Artificial reefs

1629
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,704
I think that's

1630
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,264
Totally doing that but I think it's

1631
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,592
Just saying someone used to be

1632
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,128
Conservative

1633
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,176
Invalidating

1634
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,480
I find that to be a little bit

1635
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:22,272
It's a dangerous lies

1636
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,040
However

1637
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:23,808
If it's

1638
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,112
Are you working at 4

1639
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:29,440
Conservative that he tried to work at 4

1640
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,464
That's a little bit of it

1641
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,536
Yeah possibly

1642
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,328
But I also think that if it's like

1643
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,352
2012

1644
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:41,472
Has as much awareness of it other than it being a

1645
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,496
Conservative

1646
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,544
Ron Paul type

1647
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,848
Libertarian organization

1648
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:49,408
It's

1649
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:55,040
It's tough because we know so much about it.

1650
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,720
2011

1651
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,488
2012

1652
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,352
You can make a better argument for it not being damaged

1653
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:14,496
Right unfortunately if you didn't realize that the only way to get hired there

1654
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,776
Cell

1655
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,640
You got screwed that one up

1656
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:26,784
I don't look at any of the f****** resumes the people sit

1657
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:33,184
You got to you got to save Bill Clinton's a rapist on TV

1658
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:38,304
Cover letter resume

1659
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,400
Complain some more about

1660
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:47,520
Is old girl singing reporter used to mock Network

1661
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,872
He's a big boy

1662
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:57,504
Can we say

1663
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,832
Bright

1664
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:07,232
More instances of Alex picking up people's physical appearance in applying for

1665
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:10,048
Not good

1666
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,144
What do you talk about yours that like Fox News.

1667
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,704
Old tweets of Oliver Darcy before he work

1668
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,264
CNN's coverage

1669
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,056
I can't remember the last time it was

1670
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,080
Breaking news

1671
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:31,296
But it's also important

1672
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:32,832
Media criticism

1673
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:37,696
Oh really it's almost feels almost feels like what he was doing

1674
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,560
No I don't know

1675
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,584
Nowadays

1676
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,352
He doesn't

1677
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,632
Critique

1678
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,680
But I don't

1679
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:50,752
I don't know if that's a dragon

1680
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:52,288
Decreased

1681
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:01,248
The company at all but a little bit

1682
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,296
Basically I'm doing

1683
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,320
On the job

1684
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,344
He's a company man

1685
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,768
It is just sort of like

1686
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,096
We've got to have a

1687
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,120
We got to have some

1688
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:22,496
Moratorium

1689
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,520
I get it

1690
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:27,616
Let's let's start from here

1691
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:30,688
We start now any b******* from then

1692
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,992
Now

1693
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:35,552
Undercover Journal

1694
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:40,160
Lying about your identity or whatever

1695
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:40,928
Needs to be

1696
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,720
An actual reason

1697
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:43,744
Xxxx

1698
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,560
Ethically

1699
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,608
Use deception

1700
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,888
In order to thales

1701
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,912
To get a new story

1702
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:53,728
Story is such important

1703
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,264
The public

1704
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,872
Withhold

1705
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:03,200
I think that there is

1706
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:06,272
A public interest when it's like someone who's

1707
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,320
Trying to Rebrand

1708
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,600
Used to be like

1709
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:13,952
Fascist

1710
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,000
The public

1711
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,288
Take out of context

1712
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,312
Joke tweet

1713
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:35,200
Cedar Fire

1714
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,992
Those sorts of things are all just like

1715
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,320
You need for the moratorium

1716
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,344
But

1717
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,392
I don't know I just suggest

1718
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,440
Everybody

1719
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:46,976
On the planet

1720
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,768
Should delete all of their old

1721
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,840
Everybody

1722
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:54,656
Sure

1723
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:57,216
Self-destruct button

1724
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:57,984
Just built in

1725
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:02,848
Your tweets go away after a week

1726
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,872
You can

1727
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,432
You should

1728
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:08,992
So anyway

1729
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:09,760
Sponsors

1730
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,576
But that doesn't mean he's not going to give some companies

1731
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,112
A free ride

1732
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:15,904
Is it your first time

1733
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,744
No I've been through Texas many times over my life

1734
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,096
I can't say I have

1735
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:24,864
Okay

1736
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,888
Supergirl

1737
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:29,728
Play unpaid plug for Topo Chico

1738
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:36,128
Probably don't want

1739
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,152
Baby

1740
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,456
Send Alex

1741
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,064
Booze

1742
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:51,232
When was that

1743
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:55,072
Champagne

1744
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:02,240
Yeah

1745
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,520
Come on Alex

1746
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:07,872
That's about putting together

1747
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:14,272
There were just too busy watching videos

1748
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:20,672
It's ridiculous he was like I'm going to go pee on that tree or when he was out

1749
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:26,560
Cupcake

1750
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,352
Cupcake

1751
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,704
Wrong

1752
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,472
Drink

1753
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:36,544
Even if

1754
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,360
Super irresponsible to do Alex

1755
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,808
Gives a s***

1756
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,600
But they don't pretend

1757
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,392
You don't as if

1758
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,184
Maybe he's not drink

1759
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:53,952
Now

1760
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,976
Great

1761
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,512
I bet you will soon

1762
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:02,400
You're going to get so drunk and have another breakdown screaming on

1763
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,216
Abusive dad

1764
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,496
That like

1765
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:08,800
Tell me when I get drunk

1766
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:12,896
Don't make me Hasselhoff

1767
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,176
Jesus

1768
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:14,944
Christ

1769
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,528
Yeah so are they discussed this

1770
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,552
This video

1771
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,576
The Carrie help

1772
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,112
Project Veritas

1773
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,392
And

1774
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:26,976
He was

1775
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:29,024
Still working

1776
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,816
The first video was going to be

1777
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,584
Be released

1778
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,352
He was going to

1779
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,120
They put

1780
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:33,888
Easy route

1781
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:38,752
He was there at work

1782
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,872
Project Veritas

1783
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,152
And flee the city

1784
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:47,712
Overly dramatic

1785
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:49,248
Least

1786
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:52,832
It really overly dramatic stuff

1787
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:56,416
So Carrie talks about that you're a little bit

1788
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,464
Experience

1789
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,536
Project Veritas video in the van

1790
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,168
He articulates the word very well

1791
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,984
Trust the guy the CNN nobody's down they know that

1792
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,032
Now they know that I was the only one there

1793
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,568
So there was

1794
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:15,104
Are there people there on Ark

1795
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:15,872
Accrue

1796
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,920
Yeah we just found the back of the

1797
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:21,760
An old ass U-Haul Van and just washed it on iPad it was kind of cruel

1798
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,296
Got a cruel cruel

1799
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,368
Cool cruel

1800
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:29,696
I mean it's kind of crew

1801
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,632
Project Veritas on an iPad

1802
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,400
He was

1803
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:42,240
So Alex has the guy carry porch

1804
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,520
Whistleblowing

1805
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,824
The pizza project

1806
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:49,920
Carrie is not the chatty store

1807
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,272
He's too into Alex's sense of humor's kind of like

1808
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,552
Cast deep mud

1809
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,112
Carrie is trying to be humble and accurate

1810
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:00,672
Constantly refers to himself as a low-level employee

1811
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:04,256
Perception

1812
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:07,584
Betrayal has to keep correct

1813
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,680
View a bird's-eye view from the ground

1814
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,472
Rhapsody

1815
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,752
It's a mess

1816
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:20,384
And to be on board with Alex's worldview entirely

1817
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,920
But the two of them have zero

1818
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,760
Preoccupied

1819
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:27,040
The carry that your light bulbs

1820
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:27,808
Respond

1821
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:30,624
And the Trump was probably being spied on by lightbulb

1822
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:34,976
Carrie's impolitely interested in looking into it like

1823
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,792
But Alex because he's such a dud

1824
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:40,864
Because hyper focused on proving it to him

1825
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,888
Goes off the rail

1826
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:45,984
Yeah that sounds

1827
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,040
Watch the project video

1828
01:37:59,296 --> 01:37:59,808
About that

1829
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:10,304
You know it's really crazy

1830
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,352
Part of this interview with their doing

1831
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:14,144
I just don't understand

1832
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,192
Covering up this project

1833
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:17,984
Maybe history

1834
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,104
Sure

1835
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,176
It's a four-part series but I only watched

1836
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:31,040
The first one because that seems focused on Carrie

1837
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:33,344
The first one

1838
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,368
That is enough

1839
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:39,232
This boils down to some employees saying that CNN's

1840
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,024
CEO Jeff Zucker doesn't like

1841
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,304
Personally

1842
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,096
Editorial decision

1843
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:48,448
Negative stories about Trump

1844
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,056
The entire Institution

1845
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:56,128
Profit-driven news or political commentary

1846
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,664
And probably needs

1847
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,736
Please please

1848
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:04,576
Don't think that I'm here to go to bed

1849
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:07,392
These folks deserve plenty of criticism

1850
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:10,208
It's just that the valid kind is never going to come

1851
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:10,976
James O'Keefe

1852
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:14,560
If the main criticism your primarily lodging

1853
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:18,400
Is it a head of a company.

1854
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,448
It seems like the situation.

1855
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:22,752
Is if everyone liked the president

1856
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,544
Which sounds pretty authoritarian

1857
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:28,384
If your criticism is that the network is chasing rating

1858
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:32,224
But then why is your whistleblower going on Infowars

1859
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:39,136
Website

1860
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:43,744
But he's so much more guilty of this

1861
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,536
No one else

1862
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,304
Yeah

1863
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,656
Honestly all of James who keeps expose the complete trash and embarrassing

1864
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,192
Particularly

1865
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:59,360
You have a guy who works at CNA talking to his co-workers about stuff like

1866
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,128
The election

1867
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,456
They think they're just having a conversation with a friend or an acquaintance

1868
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:08,320
They have no idea you secretly recording them so he can give the tape to a s******* propaganda

1869
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:11,648
It's a pretty messed-up violation of their trust

1870
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:14,464
It really doesn't reflect well on the character

1871
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,536
It's just kind of bums me out

1872
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:21,888
Like I can't even begin to quantify the number of times I've talked to him

1873
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:25,472
The workplace has an environment where nearly everyone is something

1874
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,240
Complain about

1875
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,264
Everyone's got something

1876
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,312
Say about what's wrong with the bosses

1877
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:33,408
Coworkers often build rapport with each other off

1878
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:37,504
In order to

1879
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,272
Make this video

1880
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,320
It feels dirty and invasive

1881
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,856
But I guess it

1882
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
Cary poarch

1883
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,952
And the right-wing media

1884
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,488
Useful to his dark money

1885
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,512
Patron cell

1886
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:49,792
I hope it's worth it

1887
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:50,816
I bet

1888
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:53,120
So hard to real bummer

1889
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:53,888
That is

1890
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,168
That is dropping a bomb

1891
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,192
That's now

1892
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,216
Every time I

1893
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,776
Is somebody

1894
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,544
Videotaping

1895
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:04,384
God that's

1896
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:10,784
Question like now every single time that you talk to this guy before then would be just butter

1897
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,976
A state where you can record without the

1898
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:23,328
New York is a one-party consent state

1899
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,608
Be having this conversation

1900
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:26,400
Cuz he couldn't just record other people

1901
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:28,192
He actually had

1902
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,264
Google order for it to be legal

1903
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:32,800
There's another layer

1904
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:33,824
Negative

1905
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,360
I understand that you think

1906
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:37,408
You're doing something big here and showing

1907
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,296
And all this

1908
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,576
And in order to do

1909
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,112
You have to really violate

1910
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:46,880
Peoples

1911
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:49,696
I mean just

1912
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,304
It is. It's the sort of thing that like

1913
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,864
If you sit back for a second and think about it

1914
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,656
But you should be so ashamed

1915
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:02,240
And this will never will

1916
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:04,032
This is something that can

1917
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,848
Shity person

1918
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,384
Who believes lies

1919
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,200
An amazing person

1920
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:13,248
Is actually

1921
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,856
It's it's

1922
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,208
He's willingly

1923
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,304
Can salad like listening

1924
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,352
Interview

1925
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,632
He's not like

1926
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:33,728
Some guy who got rope tonight

1927
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,800
James O'Keefe

1928
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,824
Couldn't get

1929
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,592
These

1930
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:41,408
People to say what they say in the video

1931
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,456
Someone who you think

1932
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,992
Your friend at work

1933
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:46,016
You might talk to

1934
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:49,344
Just kind of s*** around them

1935
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:52,672
Such an invasion of privacy

1936
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:53,696
Engrossed

1937
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:55,232
Like for people who can't like

1938
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:04,960
Is turn around and act like this

1939
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,240
Is just

1940
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,824
Stupid

1941
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,360
Guys just don't get

1942
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,128
Set the grift

1943
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,920
More important

1944
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:15,200
The new and you will be

1945
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,784
Alex

1946
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,952
In a much larger

1947
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:26,720
Oh yeah

1948
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,512
Even if trumps

1949
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:32,608
Even if Trump solidifies his power becomes like a dictator

1950
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:36,192
Doesn't matter what circumstance

1951
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:38,752
You will be chewed up and spit out

1952
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:39,520
Is

1953
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:42,336
You don't want Alex

1954
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:45,664
You want somebody who gives the veneer of

1955
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,688
Reality

1956
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:49,504
Alex could make his brand

1957
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
Continually

1958
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:52,320
Worth Wildwood Beach

1959
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:53,856
Opposition

1960
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:54,880
To whatever

1961
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,952
Choosing to go along with Trump

1962
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:58,976
Is the

1963
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:01,280
The second he just died

1964
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:04,096
It's all these consequences

1965
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:05,120
We're inevitable

1966
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,680
We set it on like what

1967
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:09,984
Second episode of the podcast

1968
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:21,504
Yeah I guess you could make it drop had lost

1969
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:25,088
Everybody

1970
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:29,184
Everybody

1971
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:34,560
The decision to support Trump

1972
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:39,936
Supported Ron Paul for all those times again.

1973
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,520
Portal

1974
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,360
Years

1975
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,384
Material

1976
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:53,504
All the same narrative

1977
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,808
In a much more effective

1978
01:44:56,064 --> 01:45:00,160
You can make excuses for why you're not getting the changes you want to see in the world

1979
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:03,488
Everything works better

1980
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
I'm sorry for like

1981
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,376
Cardigan

1982
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:14,496
Do that

1983
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:18,592
It's kind of backed into a corner ownership over the election

1984
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,128
Made it happen

1985
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,408
That's a real

1986
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,968
Bucked up box

1987
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,760
Cuz you think you did

1988
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:30,368
And if you check

1989
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:32,416
And if you change that

1990
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,184
You have to admit

1991
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:33,952
That you were wrong

1992
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:35,488
Great at doing

1993
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,024
I guess

1994
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:39,328
So this next

1995
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:41,632
Because Carrie claims that used to

1996
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:51,104
He discusses his f*****-up political alignment

1997
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,152
In this that next question

1998
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:54,176
Is this doesn't mix

1999
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,992
Can you call yourself a liberal in

2000
01:45:57,248 --> 01:46:03,392
Fourier on the inside of the

2001
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:07,488
So yes send

2002
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,072
I use that term loosely with liberal and everything but

2003
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:16,960
And I supported Bernie in the 2016 election voted for Hancock it's for him in the primaries and then voted for Gary Johnson

2004
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:21,056
And the general this cuz I didn't like Hillary and I didn't like Trump so

2005
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:26,432
I just went third-party and nobody said my vote mattered until obviously the next day

2006
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:32,320
But I would actually say I would mourn the term of left sister far left when I got to CNN

2007
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:34,112
And then

2008
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:38,208
From what I saw the two-and-a-half-year journey I basically

2009
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:42,304
Basically got the red so myself on YouTube while I was in the bureau

2010
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,840
And I would say

2011
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:49,984
I mostly center-right libertarian, right now but definitely leaning more and more conservative with each passing day

2012
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:53,056
I spoke at a turning point

2013
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:54,848
Aventon

2014
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:59,712
College Station last night a bunch of great kids they're great people and a lot of fun to me lot of people that

2015
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,992
You know just wanted to know

2016
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,552
Know what happened well you'll get

2017
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,576
Scarlet Letter

2018
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,624
Put on you

2019
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:15,072
Of course

2020
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:18,144
Smartcom

2021
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:34,528
Stuff that a guy who's his parents cuz I want to work

2022
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,464
Just makes me think that maybe I

2023
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,744
I could get that job

2024
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:45,536
Call Jose

2025
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,584
Buttermilk

2026
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,120
Alex

2027
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,656
Describe

2028
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,728
That would be hard

2029
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,008
Barely sweet

2030
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:58,080
Yeah this is sad

2031
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:00,384
I think that what you see here

2032
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:01,920
Expressing

2033
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,832
You know like you just watch a bunch of dumb

2034
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:11,904
Propaganda videos on YouTube

2035
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,184
Oh my God

2036
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,720
You probably over

2037
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,000
Estimate house

2038
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:21,632
If you were to begin with you can make it seem like I came out of the cold

2039
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:25,216
Compelling

2040
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,752
Looks like Alex

2041
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:32,896
I watched a bunch of food on YouTube it warped

2042
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:35,968
Hannah under

2043
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,064
Launch videos on YouTube

2044
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:42,624
I just don't get

2045
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,160
It's strange it's just

2046
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:46,720
Crazy

2047
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:48,768
YouTube videos

2048
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,328
And the algorithm will will do that

2049
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,376
Yeah yes

2050
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:56,960
Waldo

2051
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:59,264
Takes too much effort

2052
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:03,104
Comprehend well

2053
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,640
Well

2054
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,224
Possibility

2055
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:11,040
Time is a block

2056
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:13,856
Alex

2057
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,136
It's offering him a

2058
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:19,744
My lady and I were entertaining everything that's coming our way we're not

2059
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,560
Ruling out anything I'm sure you'll appreciate

2060
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:31,776
More people for 2020

2061
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:38,944
How are you going to hire people you're having an Everything Must Go sale

2062
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:42,016
Your shows falling apart

2063
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:46,112
Live radio

2064
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,392
This is a mess

2065
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:53,280
What kind of ideas do you tell me what kind of ideas

2066
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:58,912
Here's an idea

2067
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,960
Used bikes

2068
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:04,800
To steal whatever you got

2069
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,944
But here is a clip

2070
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:13,248
That I believe invalidate

2071
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:15,808
His credentials

2072
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:19,392
More of is Project veritas

2073
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,304
The only group

2074
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:31,680
Well that's just a testament to James and his team like he is very

2075
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:37,056
Very particular with who he hires and vets and everything like he and I talked for almost 2 months

2076
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:39,360
December wedding me

2077
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:45,760
Quietly making sure that I wasn't a CNN Plantronic herbicide

2078
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:52,672
I mean even when I was a leftist i

2079
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:53,952
Didn't like James

2080
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:56,768
But I respected him because

2081
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:57,536
Habitat

2082
01:50:58,048 --> 01:51:00,608
Do you know a corn in this that I'm like

2083
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:03,936
You know my people at the time of them like you can argue with tape

2084
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:07,520
You can't argue with a man that is

2085
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:09,312
Either you were Alexa

2086
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:14,432
And you're the dumbest

2087
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:20,832
Still the dumbest human it is it is a possibility that he was inclined towards the last

2088
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:27,232
He was just profound lease-to-purchase. James O'Keefe was actually people who don't read also

2089
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:29,280
It's not like

2090
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:31,584
To Alex's

2091
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:35,168
If you're somebody

2092
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,192
Incline

2093
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:36,960
Towards

2094
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:37,984
Last position

2095
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:40,032
And you think

2096
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:42,080
Is accurately portraying

2097
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:43,104
Videos

2098
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,456
Quite frankly

2099
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:48,992
Because otherwise

2100
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:50,528
You would look into it

2101
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:52,832
Complete b*******

2102
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,744
Masks to protect

2103
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,352
The James O'Keefe was wearing the pimp outfit

2104
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,376
Alex

2105
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,144
Even

2106
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,704
Doesn't realize the manipulation that you

2107
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:09,472
Subjected to

2108
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:10,496
So

2109
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:12,544
F*** all this s***

2110
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:16,896
I imagine

2111
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:18,176
He considers him

2112
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:18,944
Self

2113
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:20,992
Are you considered himself a left

2114
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:23,552
Because he had basic human

2115
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:27,904
Then chances are you're going to say you're

2116
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:30,720
It's possible that in hindsight

2117
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:35,840
So he watches those videos and he's like well this overrides

2118
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:40,448
These are giving me a reason to ignore me

2119
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:49,408
Maybe there's some perception that he has

2120
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:52,224
That was accurate but I don't

2121
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:55,296
So he's already said that YouTube videos

2122
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,320
Got it

2123
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:02,720
Skyrim

2124
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,488
Able

2125
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:07,072
Even Satan ran playing but at least

2126
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:09,376
Yeah so he's

2127
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,912
Complain about people who sing

2128
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:12,448
That YouTube radicalized

2129
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:17,824
But he's already

2130
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:26,272
I mean I went before I torched my Facebook the morning of obviously but you know how they do the memories thing like 8 remember this 5 years ago

2131
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,576
With me doing like some

2132
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,344
You know

2133
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:33,440
Crazy far-left ideology post and what not like that unlike

2134
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:37,024
A total crankshaft sound like

2135
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:38,816
Process

2136
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:42,400
It was this process of where you coming to work in DC

2137
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:48,800
I'm kind of seeing how the sausage is made slowly but surely you know watching an ecosystem of videos here and there and just being open

2138
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:52,128
Start you actually entertain other ideas

2139
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,152
You know what

2140
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:59,808
Accepting of that time but just being open and it's okay let's see what the other side has to say and there was a whole ecosystem

2141
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:06,208
On YouTube where I could go from one day to the next I know they're going to take this out of context that see this YouTube radicalize of people you remember

2142
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:10,560
New York Times article but it just got me where I can start watching pieces

2143
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:12,608
Several different people's videos

2144
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:14,656
And was slowly but surely kind of

2145
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:17,472
Red tailing me in the process

2146
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:19,264
I did

2147
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:23,104
Is he the manipulation of the self

2148
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,384
Yeah I mean

2149
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,152
This is

2150
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:27,200
So woefully transparent

2151
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:30,272
Somebody who fell victim to the algorithm

2152
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,808
Probably started watch

2153
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:34,368
Like Stefan molyneux videos

2154
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,904
Dave Rubin

2155
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:45,120
This is a story over and over and over again

2156
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,168
And

2157
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,472
Good luck

2158
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:53,056
That's listening

2159
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:53,824
Pluck

2160
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,128
This isn't

2161
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,408
Yeah the problem is it

2162
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:58,176
So

2163
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:58,944
Like they do it's okay

2164
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:00,992
Cuz you know if you were talking

2165
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,272
Somebody and you hadn't been

2166
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:05,856
And they took a big swig

2167
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:08,928
Say you are as somebody who voted for Bernie

2168
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:10,976
You're like

2169
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:12,256
Consider myself on the left

2170
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,304
YouTube video where it's

2171
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:16,096
White people are under attack

2172
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,632
You're going to be like

2173
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,192
Just like

2174
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:28,128
What's the function of people like

2175
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,200
Man

2176
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:36,576
You need to raise the temperature gradually

2177
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:37,856
That's why people

2178
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:38,624
Lancaster

2179
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,952
Steven Crowder or

2180
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,256
People down towards

2181
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:45,792
More radical ideas

2182
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:47,840
Terrorism

2183
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:52,192
Why you have people like that

2184
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,728
Katie Hopkins

2185
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,544
F***** up

2186
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,824
Any presents

2187
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:00,384
Leads to

2188
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,920
A greater ability

2189
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,688
People to

2190
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:05,760
End up considering the people

2191
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:14,208
Kill all the Muslims

2192
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:15,488
Genocide

2193
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:20,608
Whistleblower

2194
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:21,632
For a long time

2195
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,680
And he finally gets around to it

2196
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:25,984
In the shower

2197
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:28,288
Call

2198
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:31,104
Immediately go to a friend of Carrie

2199
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:31,872
Call Dad

2200
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,432
Overseas

2201
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:35,456
In the service

2202
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:41,088
Go to Carlos, go to Johnny solo Ryan Michael and Chris

2203
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:48,768
Let's go to your buddy Oz

2204
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:56,960
Chinese dragon

2205
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,672
Jordans

2206
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:17,440
I was

2207
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:22,816
Your jaw was wide open

2208
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,096
I just

2209
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,632
I just I can't believe

2210
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:26,912
This show

2211
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:33,312
Would also have a guy say the n-word a couple of years

2212
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:39,712
It's it's

2213
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:41,504
These videos where he does this

2214
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,040
Offensive Chinese voice

2215
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,576
On a Dragon cartoon

2216
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:46,624
The audience response

2217
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:47,904
They like

2218
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,352
Laughing

2219
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:58,912
Jesus f*** you

2220
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,216
If you were on the left

2221
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:02,240
We don't

2222
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:04,544
It's a funny guy

2223
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:07,616
This turns

2224
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:11,968
I was talk to you

2225
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:17,600
I talked to solo dance

2226
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:35,008
October 14th ABC Air 2 footage from Syria

2227
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:37,056
Nighttime machine gun demonstration

2228
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:37,824
Confirm shooting range

2229
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:38,848
Kentucky

2230
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:42,688
Ever since this point right-wing media figures like Alex have latched onto this Esme

2231
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:47,040
Excuse to pretend to Northern Syria

2232
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:51,136
ABC apologize for the error and investigating how the mistake was made

2233
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:54,976
Is it a big mess up appropriately

2234
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:57,280
How do the operations are supposed to work

2235
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:58,304
They f***** up

2236
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,328
They apologized

2237
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:00,096
Animator correct

2238
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,632
It doesn't matter though

2239
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:04,448
People like Alex can suck up in a million time

2240
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:06,752
Never apologize never correct anyting

2241
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:11,360
If you slip up on over and over to portray you as

2242
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:12,128
Go party

2243
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,152
The lame

2244
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:13,920
Childish game

2245
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:14,688
Yep

2246
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:16,992
I personally don't care too much about the stupid game app

2247
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:20,320
Truth is that ABC did fuk up and

2248
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,088
The big one

2249
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:23,648
And in doing so

2250
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:27,488
Genesis justify

2251
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:28,512
Potential genocide

2252
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:31,584
Senator John cornyn

2253
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:35,680
If he was planning on coming into Northern Syria

2254
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,960
Liquid cleanse the Kurds

2255
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:38,752
A US troops were caught in the middle

2256
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:42,592
I'm not completely convinced that it was a bad idea to get them out of Harm's Way

2257
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:43,872
Last week

2258
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:47,200
Talkin about Northern Syria

2259
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:49,248
Cleaned out

2260
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:54,112
In the immediate aftermath of Trumps withdrawal Turkish forces moved in and started attacking

2261
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:56,672
Tens of thousands of civilians were displaced

2262
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:58,464
For their lives

2263
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:01,536
On the 13th it was reported that turkish-backed millet

2264
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:03,328
Executed 9 people

2265
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:05,120
Including the secretary-general

2266
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:07,424
Future Syria party

2267
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:11,264
Who was the leader of democratic

2268
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:13,568
Anita far from the only civilians

2269
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:14,336
Overkill

2270
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:19,456
Pointing to one video that ABC News got wrong doesn't undo have wrinkled ass execution

2271
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:21,248
Nor the deaths of all these other people

2272
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:23,552
All it does is give Alex a crutch

2273
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,320
To feel right

2274
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,600
When he all he's doing

2275
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:28,672
Is supporting an unjustifiable foreign policy decision

2276
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:29,440
But it's Doom

2277
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,464
Countless people

2278
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:33,280
The displacement life under a dictator or death

2279
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:35,072
F*** Alex Jones

2280
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:39,168
These are the sorts of moments that you need to fully understand when people say that Alex is

2281
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:40,704
It's funny your this is just entertaining

2282
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:44,800
Where the host of the rtlm in Rwanda

2283
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:46,336
Was it just entertainment

2284
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:48,128
Was Lord haha funny

2285
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:49,408
Is that just entertainment

2286
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,688
Is this entertain

2287
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:55,296
Alex is carrying water for Trump abandoned while doing a racist Chinese

2288
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,088
Funny

2289
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,112
It's not funny

2290
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:58,880
Not entertained

2291
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:00,928
It's cruel and malicious propaganda

2292
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,768
And the only thing I can really take solace

2293
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:09,120
Is that I believe he'll probably live long enough to extremely regret his ass

2294
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:12,960
That's the only thing I can really hang my hat on

2295
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:14,240
He's at this point

2296
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:18,080
Like there's just there's just no words for how

2297
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:19,872
He's doing

2298
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:25,760
While

2299
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,064
Defending

2300
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:28,832
A genocide

2301
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,600
So

2302
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:30,624
I don't know what else

2303
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,904
If you can't

2304
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:32,672
If you can't recognize

2305
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:33,440
Is that is

2306
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:34,720
Not just

2307
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:36,000
Immoral but

2308
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:37,536
Like some level

2309
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:44,960
Next level is history

2310
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:46,496
Understand

2311
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:50,336
The problem that I have is I don't think that Alex is very

2312
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,104
Relevant

2313
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,408
Affecting famous

2314
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:57,760
Nearly to the point that people like the broadcasters on the rtlm

2315
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:00,064
Alex's

2316
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:02,112
Is causing any

2317
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:10,560
But not to the extent that

2318
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,608
Yeah but his intention is very similar

2319
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,704
These very serious situations that deflect

2320
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:20,544
Anybody being concerned about it in service of

2321
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,568
Supporting Trump

2322
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:24,640
Isaac Hayes

2323
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,480
He's going to be very complicated I actually

2324
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,248
Take what he

2325
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:30,016
He's doing

2326
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:33,088
Seriously

2327
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:35,904
Which is pink with a lot of people

2328
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,208
You

2329
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:45,120
I don't understand how I really am

2330
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:45,888
Amaze

2331
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,656
I'm not

2332
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,424
And I do

2333
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,448
That's the problem

2334
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:49,728
Let me put it that way

2335
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,520
It is so normal

2336
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:53,056
That John cornyn will face

2337
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:53,824
No

2338
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,616
For literally saying

2339
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,896
I'm fine with

2340
02:02:59,456 --> 02:02:59,968
Of course

2341
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,272
That's how awful it is

2342
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:07,904
They're like

2343
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,440
And it said that that's what we got now

2344
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:12,256
And you know it

2345
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:17,120
10mm

2346
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:21,216
What's been going on

2347
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:22,496
For so long

2348
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:23,776
Gordon should be

2349
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:28,384
Literally

2350
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:30,432
I don't want harm to come to anybody

2351
02:03:30,688 --> 02:03:31,456
But his knees

2352
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:32,480
Should be blown out

2353
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:35,040
Fucken prick

2354
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:37,088
Support the use of violence

2355
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:43,232
Political gains but I understand why you expressing yourself that way

2356
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:51,424
Just trying to push back on your violent that's all I'm doing

2357
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:54,240
I hear you I hear you

2358
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:58,080
Hate to say

2359
02:03:58,336 --> 02:04:01,920
Haha our show is important cuz I don't know if it really is

2360
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:06,528
Really is the balance

2361
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:08,576
This is this like

2362
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:09,600
This dude

2363
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:11,136
Like way out of line

2364
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:11,904
Here

2365
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:17,024
But at the same time he's also running commercials where he brags about having a chainsaw

2366
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:20,864
There is a farcical aspect

2367
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:24,960
If he had the opportunity to

2368
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:25,728
He would

2369
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:26,496
Defender John

2370
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:29,824
Because that's the behavior that you

2371
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:33,920
Consider because should

2372
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:35,712
Things ever get bad enough

2373
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:38,528
In this country where we're talking about

2374
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:40,320
Like let's say getting rid of

2375
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:41,088
Country

2376
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:44,160
He would be for it

2377
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:52,608
Not not relevant

2378
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:53,888
Enough

2379
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:55,936
31 myflip here and Barnes

2380
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:08,480
See this is where it gets into a really interesting conversation

2381
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:10,784
Pataskala

2382
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:13,856
Now we're going to hear with Barnes

2383
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:16,416
Challenge

2384
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:18,976
Answer me

2385
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:27,424
Who is the worst lawyer on the October 23rd episode of Alex's show

2386
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:34,080
Directions in particular because of the sort of

2387
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:40,480
Thanks

2388
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:50,464
Pushing us towards Islam

2389
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,072
Askew

2390
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,120
Richard

2391
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,168
It is more f***** up

2392
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:03,264
The guy coming in and talking about

2393
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:05,312
Or the lawyer who comes in

2394
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:10,432
And very bluntly declares were at war with a religion

2395
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:12,480
Man

2396
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:15,552
You know I want to say congratulation

2397
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,576
Both our competitors

2398
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:19,648
You guys you guys really left it all out on the field

2399
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:20,416
Today

2400
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:26,816
Anyway cause any kind of like

2401
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:27,840
Worse

2402
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:32,960
And there we have it I am and I'm going to

2403
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:33,984
You know

2404
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:37,056
Just pure number

2405
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:41,408
But

2406
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:42,944
I'm going to

2407
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:47,808
While you're thinking let me give you my thought on

2408
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:48,576
Okay

2409
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:49,856
I think

2410
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:50,880
Viscerally

2411
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:52,416
Norm takes the win

2412
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,024
I think

2413
02:06:57,280 --> 02:07:00,864
Probably we might be worse

2414
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,656
Right it is much as

2415
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:08,032
You sort of declare in the holy war is a lot more

2416
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,360
That worlds

2417
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:18,528
What you would be looking at is probably

2418
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,576
Very least

2419
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:22,112
Like a very

2420
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:23,136
Very f*****-up

2421
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:23,904
Campaign

2422
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:27,232
Trying to rid the world of Islam

2423
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:29,280
And I think that probably has

2424
02:07:29,536 --> 02:07:30,560
Far worse effect

2425
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:31,584
Then

2426
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,656
Nor being allowed to say the n word

2427
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:39,776
Norm say the n word

2428
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:46,432
Came out instead

2429
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:48,480
The war against Islam

2430
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:52,064
I applaud your honesty

2431
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,344
A norm only

2432
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,024
You know

2433
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,328
Which which one you're going to

2434
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:04,864
The Warriors

2435
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:08,448
I don't want to

2436
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:14,848
Position of relative

2437
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:18,688
1 implies a World War

2438
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,016
Guys are

2439
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:26,624
I feel like a bar should be harder to pass

2440
02:08:32,512 --> 02:08:35,584
Is it is it normal

2441
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:48,128
I've just really done a great

2442
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,664
Illuminating

2443
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:50,432
How

2444
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:51,456
Every

2445
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:55,296
I cannot believe how shocking

2446
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:57,600
Episode 1

2447
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:02,976
It's staggering

2448
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:07,584
Just alone

2449
02:09:08,096 --> 02:09:11,680
Yeah that's crazy

2450
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,448
The Shootist

2451
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,032
Raising

2452
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,568
Crazyshit

2453
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:24,224
Indian word and the other declare in the war of islamophobia

2454
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:24,992
Also

2455
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,272
These two dudes

2456
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:29,600
Perfect examples of why this show is

2457
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:30,368
So

2458
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:31,904
The the weekend

2459
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:34,976
How many people

2460
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:37,792
In their in their quiet

2461
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:41,120
No one's listening

2462
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:41,888
Just ask

2463
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,936
How many people would say

2464
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:44,960
I applaud you for

2465
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:49,824
Public

2466
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,872
In public

2467
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,944
But when it's just us guys

2468
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:57,760
It's good that

2469
02:09:58,016 --> 02:09:58,528
You're finally

2470
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:04,928
I don't think it's too far off base from Alex's

2471
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:06,976
But it's weird for his lawyer

2472
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:11,584
Yeah I mean that's what I'm saying if if I if I heard Alex

2473
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:12,352
Just say it

2474
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:16,960
Exactly

2475
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:19,008
You know

2476
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:22,848
Alex

2477
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:28,224
His lawyers coming on there being like I'm glad now that it's just us

2478
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:30,016
We all know what week

2479
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:34,368
Yep

2480
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:41,792
I do believe that a lot of these signs that we're seeing means

2481
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:42,816
Alex's Fox

2482
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:45,376
So please like

2483
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:47,424
Comfort in the fact that

2484
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:48,960
This isn't going well for her

2485
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:54,848
Still

2486
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:56,640
He is circling the drain

2487
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:57,920
But

2488
02:10:58,176 --> 02:10:58,944
Hey man

2489
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:03,296
You know what that one day it will be a brag for him to say he has a chainsaw

2490
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:05,600
Really think

2491
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:07,648
If you had

2492
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,976
And by Juliana as the two lawyers

2493
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:11,744
This Converse

2494
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:13,536
Laid out in the

2495
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:17,120
It might be a little bit less

2496
02:11:20,704 --> 02:11:22,752
Same script to be played out by those three guys

2497
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:25,824
At the dark.

2498
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:30,688
We live in Thor the Dark

2499
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:34,016
You didn't miss much

2500
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:34,784
Good

2501
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:43,488
If you don't go to a website

2502
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:47,072
Our website

2503
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:48,352

Hiiraan

02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,592
I've heard that where you could download

2507
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:00,640
Review

2508
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:03,968
With your friends to the whole thing we love it

2509
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:08,576
Until then I'm meal

2510
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,856
Dzx Clark

2511
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,392
This chainsaw

2512
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:13,696
Holding

2513
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:19,328
