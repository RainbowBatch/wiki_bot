1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge like I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's fight.com

5
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,816
Alex

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
I've been a little bit in the in the weeds this weekend

7
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
I don't know

8
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,176
Whatever

9
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:27,296
There's a lot of things they probably contribute to that soda think I think that's

10
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,624
The others pressures their stresses of this that the

11
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,416
Do work-related stress has theirs

12
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,232
The anniversary of the six is

13
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
You know certainly not a pleasant time to be in this line of work not a great day for us

14
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,032
Who covers people who lie about you all the time

15
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,640
It was like

16
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,712
Painfully sincere and uplifting

17
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
And I think

18
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,600
British baking show telling you man good Lord

19
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,648
Seemingly sincere and uplifting

20
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,952
I think that the there's nothing

21
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Vicooda

22
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
Amor

23
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
Cozy and happy

24
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
Then that

25
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,704
Lathrop they're competing with each other but they're not mad at everybody wants them to be the best

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,312
Right people people leave and they're happy for the experience they had

27
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128
Never talked about like what they're competing for

28
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
Cuz it's just a plate

29
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,184
American reality shows are contest Roseville challenging for fries

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,000
Thousand dollars

31
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
The outcome there is obsession with

32
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
The process

33
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
And

34
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
Noticed

35
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
IWatch

36
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680

37
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
Is that like

38
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,032
The people sincerely seem to think

39
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
Viticcio other arf

40
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,896
You know something that goes a long way

41
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
All evidence

42
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,736
Zodiac

43
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,552
I think I think a lot of times it all shows

44
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,648
People don't really seem to enjoy each other's company

45
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Beat the host

46
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
The Preserve.

47
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Noah was great

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,072
Little is oncemil took over solid 10

49
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
A weird Elementary chaos

50
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
Absurdity

51
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
M5

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
He's always funny

53
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
Every time I watch

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,944
Watch that Edmund be like

55
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,248
You know that guy on The Mighty Boosh she likes

56
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
20 years ago

57
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,320
You get ahold of the Great British Bake

58
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Yeah

59
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
That works well to Steve Harvey's at judge now it's all of it make sense

60
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,888
Court TV show

61
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
Legally buy tickets on TV

62
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
It is today we're recording this on

63
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
Sunday the 9th

64
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,944
Let's be official kickoff for awesome Games Done Quick

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,344
2020 once I saw something about that

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,488
Bunch of weirdos getting together and having a grand old time doing fun stuff and it's running

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Great finding

68
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,095
Glitches to jump through in the game

69
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:27,007
I don't enjoy that as much as you do but I get it

70
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
But there's a lot of fun too that honestly I think it's more just I am so excited about like Mario and meggy

71
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
Megaman speed runs because it is like playing

72
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
An instrument

73
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
You know

74
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
It's all rhythmic it's all timing it's all if you

75
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,415
If you see the level music

76
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,463
It's really kind of beautiful to watch

77
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,095
What's an interesting take on it I guess I've always had such a different relationship with video games

78
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Cuz I like

79
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
Enjoying the story

80
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
Yeah that's what's so

81
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
Such a big part of video game store

82
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
I bet it did

83
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,407
Kind of confuses me speedrunning is getting rid of the only thing that you enjoy breaking the story

84
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,831

92
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
Little bit of time

00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543

Three to six months

109
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959

From today to the gravitas we're dealing with

112
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
Set the record straight

113
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
Ted Nugent about what really happened

114
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,527
On January 6th

115
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
Set the record skirt

116
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,159

Where do I live in this timeline

118
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,583
It's a thing for Alex to

119
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Want to happen on the show

120
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:06,751
Please explain all of momentous occasions in American College

121
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
Ted Nugent

122
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Cool

123
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,199
So the January 6th episode of a show as a pretty severe title

124
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
The title is

125
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
Wake the f****** or die

126
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,671
The article headlined

127
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:31,071
Full full spelling or no no no no no no

128
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,375
Alright well then

129
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Actually think

130
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,031
Something was very noticeable about this episode starts off the show being honest

131
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
And upfront about the fact that

132
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,383
He has to leave early to go to Family Court

133
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
Cuz I did have

134
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
Later in the day yeah hearing it like

135
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,015
Coup in the afternoon so you had to leave

136
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
Owen Shroyer did the third

137
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,647
Skating save some kind of weird stuff which I

138
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,279
Bravo-six weird I mean he should be taken away by the evil global

139
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Stop

140
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
Instead it's just Family Court

141
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Is almost humanizing

142
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
I guess

143
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,983
So he starts off the show

144
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,543
Deep In The Weeds mad at Ted Cruz

145
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
Court because Ted Cruz

146
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,663
Has tweeted the January 6th was a terrorist

147
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
This is before

148
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,319
He gets humiliated by Tucker Carlson man so funny and so Alex's is a little bit mad about

149
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
It is January 6th

150
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
2022 on this Thursday

151
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
At this time

152
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,839
I was sitting there watching Trump give a speech

153
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Down the road

154
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
Kids were busy

155
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Attacking

156
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,615
Thunderman police and was just a few dozen men

157
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,783
Breaking through the first barricades and the rest is history then the police standing down waving everybody in so they can get some Patsy stupid

158
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
Set the precedent

159
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
For chinese-style torture

160
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
America

161
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,791
Mia Ted Cruz praising at all yesterday obviously that's just

162
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
What's wrong with Ted Cruz is he smart

163
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
What's going on

164
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
You'll stab me in the back

165
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
I just can't help it

166
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
Ted Cruz is smart but

167
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
I can't

168
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,663
Get over how fantastic it is

169
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
How funny it is

170
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
Is and how complete of a coward you would have to be

171
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,599
To be in a building where you could have been murdered and then a year later

172
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
Browbeat

173
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:36,511
Tucker Carlson into pretending that you weren't going to be murdered yeah it's it's

174
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
Is fun thing in this dystopian world we live in to watch that utter humiliation but Ted Cruz had to go through

175
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
Rudolph

176
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:53,151
But he called the storming of a capital A violent terrorist attack in immediately the extremist pundits that essentially guide the

177
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
The GOP now

178
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Swarmed

179
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,087
Showing videos absolutely no backbone Cruz went on Tucker show on Thursday the evening of this episode

180
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
To beg for forgiveness

181
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023
It's almost as if he was worried about being canceled by a right-wing mob I wish I had been shot by you

182
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,423
Do people that would have made me a hero it would be a shocking display of cowardice except I remember the 2016

183
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,799
When Trump called his wife ugly and put his dad kill.jfk Cruz ended up phone bank

184
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,919
This dude's a total loser mean that's amazing I'm

185
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Stabbed yeah

186
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:33,087
When you be sad if you would have left if I voted for Ted Cruz even if I believed in everything Ted Cruz believed in it's just like

187
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:39,487
You're such a worm worm

188
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
Jesus

189
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,351
Christ go f****** get tossed off a ledge by Sarah Manion

190
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Watching

191
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
Tucker not accepting cruises

192
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,775
Apology was also really fun but underneath that there's a more troubling reality

193
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:57,919
Ted Cruz isn't some dumb-ass media personality he's a senator representing one of those populous states in the country

194
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
He has no ability to express himself if he thinks he's wanted to express happen to run counter to the narratives that underpin too busy

195
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Models

196
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
This group of white nationalist pundits

197
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,999
It really doesn't bode well for the GOP and their politics moving forward

198
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
Let me they were good before but the idea.

199
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
The people who are elected officials

200
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Need to pass an a******

201
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
Tucker's purity test

202
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
That's a sign that things are going to get worse

203
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Oh yeah

204
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
Another thing that shocking about this is that

205
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,287
These people like Alex

206
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,895
Some Tucker they're pretending that this is the first time Ted Cruz called storming the capital terrorists

207
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
Daniel Dale at CNN

208
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,759
Find at least 17 other times

209
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
The cruises you that wording in the past

210
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
It's a consistent pattern

211
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:43,487
But they're sort of pretending that it's a one-off thing because that allows them to humiliate him and make this public just

212
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Play of life

213
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,327
What happens if you go against the narrative

214
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
What's what's so funny about it to me

215
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Is that

216
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
This is happening

217
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Like I watch

218
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
That just happened

219
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
And then you read stuff

220
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,847
Like I was reading stuff today about how the GOP is

221
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
Officially trumps

222
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
Party and all that stuff

223
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
And the more I

224
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
Think about it the more it's like

225
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Trump is

226
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,015
Not involved

227
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
There's it that you they don't need Trump trump

228
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,975
It's speaking is on the way by likely involves he's not the leader of

229
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,071
Needs to be made clear of is that the GOP is an inch

230
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
Hayirli media run operation

231
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
It seems hard to believe anything else

232
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
Yeah it's it's

233
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
It seems to be meteor

234
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Threatened

235
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,639
Easily influenced

236
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:38,527
Speaker says you have to say is our social media trends

237
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
And stuff like that seem to be like

238
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
Really potent

239
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,951
In terms of of guiding stuff obviously I don't think

240
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
What's someone like Mitch

241
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
McConnell

242
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,327
Would be subject to that

243
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:56,959
He's losing power and relevant

244
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:02,335
I mean it is what it is it's just going to be a different brand of

245
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
Ted Cruz use that language

246
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
Calling January 6th

247
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Terrorism

248
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
No reason

249
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
And I was there

250
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
Okay knows what the reason is not what you think

251
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
Alright it's an elaborate plan

252
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,535
The whole new system holding cosmology

253
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
Is it the American people are all terrorists

254
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
And that

255
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
Round up everybody

256
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
And shut down and populist movement

257
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,335
Ted Cruz knows that Purge is coming

258
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
Do you want to position himself

259
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
Pecan appointed

260
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,063
I'm not with the Patriot terrorist

261
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
The other shows that the false flag

262
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,255
Emotive need to stop them staging a false flag

263
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
Time the next 300 days

264
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,375
What 306 days out for the midterm

265
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
And if you don't feel

266
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Danger

267
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
If you can't cut it

268
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
You're not dialing

269
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
To get that understand what you saying

270
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
I guess we're all terrorists now

271
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Sure

272
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,039
VSP global

273
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,367
The Patriots when I put America

274
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Everlast

275
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,207
And so in order to signal to the globalist

276
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
He's on their side

277
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,863
He will help persecute the the good American

278
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Terrorist

279
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
Describe January 6th

280
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Ted Cruz

281
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
Joined the globalist

282
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
You know

283
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
They've been waiting to welcome him with open arms

284
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
Yeah it seems it seems like this

285
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,503
The entry and exit of that group is

286
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
Super

287
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
In-N-Out

288
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
I have been part of this team

289
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
For like 30 f****** years

290
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:58,047
And I said terrorism one time and I have to get my ass flogged Jesus Christ

291
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:04,191
I did everything I bent over backwards for Trump

292
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,751
I could not have been less metaphorical

293
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
Yeah it's this is

294
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:16,479
Wow but I think that Alex does recognize that there are probably going to be right wing attack

295
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Between now

296
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
AM PM

297
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,903
There is a high likelihood that that could happen

298
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,719
And Alex's preemptively writing a script

299
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
In order to make it

300
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Very clear to people

301
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
That he had nothing

302
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
Things to do with a

303
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Inspiring

304
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,495
So other supplies that I was asked about that covid measures around the world

305
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
This is a nightmare

306
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
Shallow rated

307
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
Takeover and so you've seen them in New Zealand

308
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
In Australia

309
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
You're not allowed to go out

310
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Nothing honesty

311
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Meaning was

312
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
What God created

313
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,207
Sun's not God but it's got dark

314
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
What

315
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
What

316
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,375
Talk to your neighbors

317
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
On billboards

318
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,287
Signs in the UK

319
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
Government Health ministers

320
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
Going

321
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,271
Because we don't want

322
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,135
Talk to each other

323
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
During a transition

324
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,535
That's a month old narrative

325
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,167
There was one comment that a person made the deposit of side effect of limiting large Gathering

326
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
Slow covid

327
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,263
Was the people who are spreading misinformation would also not be gathering

328
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
It's kind of a dumb comment

329
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,639
Particularly considering the fact the most of this misinformation get spread digitally.

330
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Impersonate

331
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
That's what that other stuff

332
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
That's all just a load of b*******

333
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,903
I think about sunsets in Australia is a misrepresentation of comments made by Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews back

334
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
I can August

335
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:06,047
He was specifically responding to a question about a bunch of people gathering at Rye Beach on a recent evening

336
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
He said quote

337
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,911
I'm sure it was a beautiful sunset but that's not in the spirit or the letter of the

338
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
These rules

339
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
He didn't say that you can watch

340
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,543
The sunset or even that you have to stay indoors all the time just

341
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,103
The state of things in terms of the pandemic back in August

342
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Victoria

343
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,919
Having Beach Gatherings is a bad idea

344
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
According to Victoria's covid

345
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:29,599
The case tracker they were having in the neighborhood like 2250 new cases a day

346
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,183
Hi January 20-22 there up to about 20,000 new cases

347
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:39,583
The thing about looking at people in the eyes that's that's a case of the even sloppier work on Alex

348
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,167
This was a meme that was making the rounds back in

349
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,495
September which showed up bar in London haven't posted a list of

350
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
Restrictions they're putting in place

351
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
In order to limit covid

352
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Spread

353
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
What are the rules was quote

354
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:56,735
No handshaking high-fiving or extended eye contact with anyone not at your table

355
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
This was a joke

356
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,903
The bar in question is London field Brewery and there isn't manager Paris

357
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
Capone told Reuters

358
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,023
The health and safety of our customers and staff is our number one priority

359
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
And we're strictly adhering

360
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,607
2-all latest Public Health guidance

361
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
Inside The Tap Room

362
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,703
The reference to no eye contact was intended to be in

363
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Engaging way to

364
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
Encourage customers to read and take

365
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,847
Notice of the broader guidelines but we've since removed it

366
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
In case it was distract

367
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
From the overall series message

368
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,967
Around safe safely enjoying the Taproom

369
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
None of the examples that

370
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
Alex has Europe

371
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,879
He's using to like illustrate the nightmare tyranny that's coming

372
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
None of them are real

373
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,047
His argument is so weak that one of his examples that he has to use as a satirical list from a bar that he saw into meme

374
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
Any never looked into

375
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
Nothing you saying means anything

376
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,983
I was thinking about that you know in Australia you can't even look at

377
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
Sunset

378
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,055
And I was just am really looking

379
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Looking forward to the office

380
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
Australian Open next week

381
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:00,735
Where does a little bit later

382
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,319
If you have any feelings about that

383
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,159
Can't look at the suds

384
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,559
I see you trying to avoid talk about Djokovic

385
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,863
Moron

386
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,007
Alex's either using

387
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
The people make

388
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,615
Or misrepresentations of things in order to

389
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,175
Pretend that ohmygod tyranny is upon us

390
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,735
It's also in Australia

391
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Cat exercise

392
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
Uno

393
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
Australia

394
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,879
But you can't go outside

395
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,743
Exercise if you don't have your little travelpass so there it is

396
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,303
Now you can't leave your house unless

397
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
You have the digital ID

398
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,399
And everything it takes to get that ID

399
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,935
Social credit score you must

400
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Why would

401
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
And you are now in a Prison Planet

402
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,151
You might notice some like popping of the audio that's on Alex's on okay

403
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
It's

404
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,503
I don't know what's going on but he's already always been a lot worse

405
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
Fairly Reese

406
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
No I'm not mad

407
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,135
Alex is actually fairly right about the

408
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:16,767
This headline there was a comment made by the chief minister of the Northern Territory Michael

409
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,839
Gunner and he did say that going to work or exercise

410
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,679
That's not a legitimate reason for an unvaccinated person to leave their home

411
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,287
This decision was made because their new case numbers jumped about 60%

412
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,127
From Tuesday to Wednesday and then over doubled from Wednesday to Thursday

413
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,431
Until they were putting in this like for day

414
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
Pretty tight lockup

415
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,575
The reason for the vaccine requirements for entry to most public places

416
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Just a matter of logistics

417
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Steaks at this point for the Northern Territory

418
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Has Gunnar put it

419
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,231
Quote we know that at home and in

420
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
Fatality settings are they

421
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
32 highest risk settings for catching

422
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
Can covid

423
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
We know that the unvax

424
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,191
Estimated are greater risk of needing a cute clinical

425
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,543
That's why vaccine pass will be necessary for entering high-risk Hospitality set

426
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
Not even bike

427
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
I'm saying we're trying to spread

428
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,759
If you're on vaccinated you're probably are more likely to end up in the hospital

429
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,319
And I be me what you want from us

430
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
Like that's that's the other cuz that's the question

431
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
Okay so now what

432
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
You hate that that's taranay

433
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
So what do you want then

434
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,912
Okay the comment about not being able to go out to exercise it kind of seems like it's actually a reference to unvaccinated people not being allowed to go

435
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Go to gyms

436
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
With the even with a vaccine past system in place there's no way the Northern Territory has the police capability to check people

437
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Vaccine status out on the

438
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
I guess someone's going for a jog

439
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,224
And while we're at it that's not even how this work

440
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,528
The police are enforcing this at all

441
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,624
Health Minister Natasha files was talking to ABC radio Darwin

442
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
And about how this place

443
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,952
Has an added responsibility on service workers

444
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
And she said quote

445
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
The onus is on the

446
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,304
Community to abide by the requirements

447
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:00,960
That doesn't sound at all like a tear anything but come on

448
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,264
Like I don't know maybe I'm not the best expert on this

449
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,128
Because I don't have a knee-jerk reaction to every me my see that makes me yell about how the devil is upon us

450
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:13,504
Spell I said that barely right there because the bar is just so low for him

451
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,808
The fact that he is just basically making

452
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,136
Recognition

453
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,208
Listen to it a couple other important correct

454
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Company to make

455
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,072
This isn't for all of Australia and the rules still allow you to leave your house

456
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:32,704
Casper essential items and everything those are just from his imagination

457
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Does nothing to do with the story

458
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,616
Just I just seen somebody

459
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:44,992
Walking outside of their house in Sydney just like slow looking both directions

460
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,576
Crossing the street putting their headphones into go for a jog and then

461
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,928
30 Scotland Yard people with billy clubs just show up out of nowhere just start

462
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,584
Territory

463
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
That's just what I'm seeing

464
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:06,240
Going to send all our Australian walk

465
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,056
The CDC has some evil plan

466
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,920
Which they have evil plans better than what

467
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
Which is a 0 plan

468
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,016
Look like

469
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,576
I need a citation my dude

470
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,648
Call prism

471
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,464
What was a Prison Planet

472
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:31,840
And then once everybody's in the prison planet in 15 shots

473
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,656
Government says it's the on injected

474
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
They're the reason you're sick

475
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,520
We've got to finally put them in camps

476
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,104
Let them be lazy I have to work

477
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,944
How do I know that well as historically have

478
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,672
It's also in the CDC documents

479
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Here

480
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,768
We're going to put people that don't take the shots in camps

481
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
And we're going to make you work

482
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,424
I'm going to need the CDC document about putting people in

483
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
Cancel

484
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:15,360
I can believe that you would have to work also because apparently you have to work even if you're not

485
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:23,552
I just got to say this is a stupid plan actually it's completely in complex with the other aspect

486
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
Conspiracy that Alex has been trying

487
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,624
Motorbike open the vaccine

488
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
The kill off everyone to the globalist

489
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,536
Can enjoy the Earth without all of us getting the way but I guess the plan to put Alex

490
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
His friends at the camps

491
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
Then they have to oversee

492
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,448
Kill Everybody

493
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
At button

494
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Instead

495
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,288
You create a Prison Planet

496
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,312
2

497
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,664
Okay you're right this is a bad plan got dumped you know what's weird like

498
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,784
When you go back through Alex's career the seems like there's an intense preoccupation with him and his friends being put into

499
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
FEMA camps

500
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,600
So many different Generations

501
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
The show that

502
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,208
A big fear that he's promoting but if you actually track the storylines that he uses to

503
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
Sell that beer

504
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
They don't match up at all

505
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,864
In 2009 it was owning a gun that was going to get you thrown into FEMA camps

506
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,912
There's going to be large-scale Gunn

507
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,728
Confiscation efforts and if you resisted you be sent to the camp

508
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,800
Then a little bit later when Obama was in office

509
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
He was always

510
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,384
Just about to pull the trigger on the FEMA provisional government

511
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,224
Which would make him the king of America which was planning to turn into an Islamic caliphate

512
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,040
And if you resisted is power grab you'd be sent to a Feen

513
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
FEMA camp

514
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,136
Vaccinated you're going to get sent to a FEMA camp

515
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,208
Don't lie a little bit boring for me at this point but I

516
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
I guess it work

517
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Trial of the audio

518
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,560
That's the only explanation for why you just

519
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
Keep going back to that detail and all of his fear p***

520
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,984
Another reason is a super boring for me is that if the government ever did get the idea to start doing this

521
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
Is rounding up on vaccinated people descended to work apps

522
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:53,152
The people who are going to be on the Forefront of fighting against that or the very people Alex

523
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Things are demons

524
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,760
Leftist bacou politicians like AOC

525
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
They're going to be

526
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
To this on principle what Alex

527
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
His favorite politician

528
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
Shrivel up like Ted Cruz and go along

529
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
To get along

530
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
Total nonsense

531
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
I'm tired of this b*******

532
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:14,656
Yeah you know it's it's really easy to drum up fear of being put into a camp if you're

533
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Scare white people

534
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,008
Because historically it's never been White

535
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
People who get put in

536
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,664
So there's going to be a situation where it from

537
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
In the future

538
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Next year

539
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,088
I made sure to say that it's a big bio-weapon release

540
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,672
Which I don't know why they would say that

541
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
That I have no idea

542
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:45,120
Obviously so much easier for them it's another very

543
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:50,240
Nothing we're already dealing I guess Alyssa going to say there's another bioweapon release

544
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,520
Another one

545
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
By the way is

546
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,592
Is murky language difficult to sell

547
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,896
But it's actually just going to be the vaccine killing you

548
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,736
Unless there's one way

549
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,600
They're going to claim a new bioweapons released in a year or two that's going to kill billions

550
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Really it's a shot Utah

551
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
I'm sorry

552
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
Value unless we find how to reverse this order

553
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,656
Globalist Personnel are given the sailing shot

554
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:23,008
They're all in on it

555
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,592
The property they wanted

556
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
And show you

557
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
You see it all happening

558
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,320
See it all if you got an actuary I believe it sure

559
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,976
I mean can you show me one of those actuaries though Alex says actuary so goddamn much

560
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,560
As much as he says he's not mad at the crew

561
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
Why not

562
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,632
They got tables

563
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,936
Yeah so probably we're all going to die unless Alex

564
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,776
Can figure out a cure for the night

565
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
Alright

566
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,616
Okay so their plan is to vac

567
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
Vaccinate everybody and then neck

568
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Steer

569
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,224
Announce that a bioweapon

570
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,064
Hit but really they're just triggering the vaccine to kill you

571
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,624
I don't even need to trigger the vaccine

572
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
According to Alex why do they need to add the bio-weapon

573
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
Seems like

574
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
It's a hat on a hat

575
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
That's an area I feel like

576
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
Disagree

577
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,888
I think it's I think it's all unnecessary

578
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,288
Very dumb. Dumb Alex has a guest

579
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,360
Is Ted Cruz in the year

580
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,152
Ted Nugent

581
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,992
In the year 2022

582
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,296
Show mr. Nugent

583
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,928
Well green see Alex and I got to tell you I sincerely wish everyone a happy

584
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,232
New Year 2022 but it's going to be

585
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Be quite a challenge

586
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,584
This is a low-energy Ted Nugent coming in

587
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
I was expecting at least

588
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,520
30 more words to be programmed

589
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
Topman come on

590
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
Yeah I usually hear him

591
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,664
Chomping at the bit

592
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,064
So he does have some thoughts

593
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,904
What's the correct the record

594
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
Set the record straight

595
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,792
About what really happened on January 6th

596
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,680
You know how often repeat the obvious that I'm just

597
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,240
Guitar player but I'm actually a weed the people

598
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,800
Experimenter in self-government guitar

599
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
Player which means I'm

600
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,128
The world around me especially

601
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
And here's what happened

602
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
On January 6th

603
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:48,160
President Trump give a speech in a presentation in Manhattan rally

604
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,952
With good conservative

605
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Families

606
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,072
Supporting God family country Constitution Bill of Rights declaration into

607
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
Did Ray apps

608
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,056
And a bunch of other saboteurs

609
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,104
A bunch of other provocateurs

610
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Federal

611
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,688
Provocateur

612
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,248
Organized a rally on

613
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Supposed to be a piece

614
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Protest

615
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
Those that created

616
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Violence

617
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
Those that turned it into work

618
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Riot

619
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,488
Those were blacklivesmatter Punk

620
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
And knows where

621
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,864
Investigation

622
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
James Comey

623
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
J Edgar Hoover

624
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,240
Perpetrated all the violence

625
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:38,336
All the violent activity

626
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
Rest in Trump regalia

627
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
Who

628
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
Doesn't know this

629
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
Number of people

630
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Okay

631
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,600
So now and hold on

632
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
Let's just throw this one out there

633
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
Okay

634
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:59,840
Did antifa or BLM ever say hump the air with their gun and threatened

635
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
Cyndaquil the

636
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,448
So many times

637
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,104
The guy who's threatening to help there with a gun and kill the president

638
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,504
They're more likely to be the ones who were going to be

639
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,880
Pelosi I got one of these for you

640
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,696
You just don't get metaphor

641
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,304
Also got a really suck to be someone like Daniel Rodriguez who was the guy who tasered off

642
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
Officer Michael fanone on the six

643
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:38,496
That's gotta suck to hear how easily disavowed and disowned You Are by the very people who whipped you into the friendly where you thought

644
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
Be necessary to taze a cop

645
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
In order to save America

646
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,872
I have to assume it be really disillusion

647
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,408
To see this kind of thing where

648
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:49,248
Because you took action in the way that these people were clearly indicating that you should

649
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,064
You now have to be cast off as a left-wing provoke

650
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Tour just to make

651
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
The noble Patriots

652
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Book bag

653
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,208
Turn you into that because you did what they wanted you to

654
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,280
Some sleeping sciatic and it's also disrespectful to the

655
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,840
Events that people like Alex and Ted and radicalized

656
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,144
Alex always says that you can tell a tree by its

657
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
It's fruit and I think it's a disgrace

658
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
For these guys to disown their fruit

659
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,288
In order to protect their tree isn't as shity as it clearly is

660
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
Nonsense

661
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,992
I I mean I hate to appeal to like hate have sympathy for this dude who played

662
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,880
My God if I was one of these if I was one of those dudes I'd be like

663
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:33,536
I'm going to sue Tucker Carlson for libel because I was f****** there and I did that s***

664
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,840
You have to know that

665
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Do you work

666
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:42,752
Can you you have to see these people trying to cover their asses by pretending it was all false flag o'ree

667
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,288
Yeah whatever

668
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:49,408
Confusing I miss you fully understand actually that why there

669
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,224
Well good on them recovering the rain

670
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
It's like

671
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
You're sad too

672
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,552
Everybody involved in this

673
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,344
Said I would feel more sympathy

674
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,464
If I hadn't read in every novel about this type of thing happening

675
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
Every time

676
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,048
Yeah but did those novels include Ted Nugent

677
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,448
A and that's what my friends when they went to the government

678
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,848
Very peaceful fun-loving enjoyable American

679
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:22,688
It was all blacklivesmatter pumps

680
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,248
Oh my God you are

681
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:30,112
Dad really into denying January 6th

682
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:34,976
YouTube bully your your people in Congress

683
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
To do the same

684
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
America

685
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,304
Take a deep

686
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,704
And be sure you let your mare your Senator your Congressman your governor and the White House no honor

687
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,752
Regular basis

688
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
Autoweek

689
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,616
Epaces communicate with your elective

690
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Employees

691
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,200
And let him know that you know January 6th

692
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,736
What's not in any

693
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
Directions

694
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
It was not

695
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Pearl Harbor

696
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,368
And it was not 911 it has

697
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,184
Nothing to do with any of those horrific events

698
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
I don't think this little rat make

699
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Makes a lot of sense

700
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,328
911 or Pearl Harbor

701
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
Insurrections however

702
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,264
Ted is currently talking to a guy who thinks both of those things were false flag

703
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,312
Horrific events

704
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
From January 6th

705
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,504
Nugent a f****** a****** but this strategies probably ineffective want to put pressure on the GOP politician

706
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,576
It does seem like bullying g into denying reality is

707
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Been shown to work

708
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,648
So I wouldn't be too surprised if overtime

709
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,440
We don't end up seeing an entire political

710
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,720
Cool party that's fully embrace

711
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,304
Is that conspiracy version of January 6th you need to do

712
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
To prove

713
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,376
To our elected

714
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,424
Did politicians that this was a

715
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
School

716
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
Demonstration

717
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,384
Is to violently intimidate them until they agree with you either harass the shoes you need to really

718
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Get into their faces

719
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,712
Maybe even commit a little violence

720
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,368
Take a turn for the worse in this club

721
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,672
No actually without him

722
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:13,280
Because I'm speaking in riddles

723
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
For me I think

724
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,144
Carlson or the model of America

725
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,472
You're just populist believe our basic rights and freedom

726
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,776
Unified people around all that

727
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568
Ted Cruz

728
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,664
Chucky Schumer the Democrats

729
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
They're also Ally

730
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,528
Is super dangerous

731
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,160
If we know the Democrats or bad but if we didn't have Republican

732
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,464
Continually stabbing Us in the back

733
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,768
We would turn this country around what's your view on that

734
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Ted Nugent

735
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,224
How do we create a populism in America.

736
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
You got me alright

737
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
Can you punch his phone backup for me in her

738
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
Are you sure you can hear me

739
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,728
I'm having phone system issue in here

740
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
The truth

741
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,600
We shall know

742
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
The truth

743
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:48,000
It doesn't report to a biking

744
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,096
That's shocking because I mean like the phone problems

745
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:55,680
Whatever a remarkable about this Tech glitch

746
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
Is that

747
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
Alex is like

748
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,776
It keeps cutting off

749
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,592
He said whenever he's trying to talk

750
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,872
End up going out

751
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,152
And then just him

752
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
Just leave

753
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
Not even

754
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:12,320
Like it's maybe his mic was off when he screamed that he's going off to rebroadcast for nothing

755
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
Yeah do anyway he leave

756
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,952
That was that was a f******

757
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
70s

758
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
That was

759
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,840
What's his name

760
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
To be the one-sided phone

761
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:32,032
I'm terrible what's the point of knowing if you're saying who's the person who's similar to Bob Hope

762
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:38,432
I'm going to let you go on that one I think it's time to that's not on home comedy

763
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Alex comes back

764
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,528
And he's got that explained that he had phone is

765
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,808
Switch.

766
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
We know

767
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,928
Going on here

768
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
I only seem to happen

769
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,024
In clusters

770
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,608
It's been happening as you saw earlier in the week with my cutout

771
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,424
It's this system right here I was talking to Ted during the break

772
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
Hit the button

773
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,520
People building

774
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,640
I just learned not to argue

775
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,880
Hello

776
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,208
Hello

777
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,912
Just not doing it not happening Alex is known for not doing that amateur bulshit

778
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
5 minutes

779
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:36,544
I only did that for two and a half minutes but also I would say

780
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
More amateur is

781
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:44,480
Screaming at everybody last storming out

782
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,296
Yeah it's

783
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,344
I don't know if you take the high road on

784
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,112
Professionalism

785
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,184
That boat has sailed my friend

786
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,256
Chabad Alex is a competent broadcast

787
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
That's what we all know

788
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
511

789
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,632
God do you got it all figured out

790
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,448
Ted Nugent's gun phones still aren't working

791
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
But Alex

792
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
Who's Mike is back

793
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
And you've got the big news to report

794
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Today

795
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,480
1 + 70

796
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
Private school

797
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,416
1 and 70 vaccine instead December microdot is

798
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,976
Private school

799
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,376
Her dad is at a private Children's Academy in Calif

800
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,520
Estimate

801
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,056
So first things first

802
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,104
Stephen Curry is not a pathology

803
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,152
He's a guy whose background doesn't

804
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
Computer science who lost

805
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
This f****** mind during the pandemic

806
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,600
He's pretending to be a pathologist selling dangerous bulshit to the segment of the media that a Critic

807
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
Thinking

808
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
Like Alex

809
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,440
But based on the story on Infowars just

810
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,488
Open case ain't the only link

811
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,280
But it has in this entire article

812
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,816
Is just to Steve kirsch's sub

813
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
Stack block

814
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,680
This is legitimately becoming one of the primary places Alex's pulling covid

815
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,216
Conspiracy content from

816
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,032
Like so much nonsense just traces back to that blog

817
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
To the Post

818
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:17,664
Substack has links to exactly zero primary sources

819
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,688
There is none

820
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
Nothing

821
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
Your

822
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,296
With your tone of voice is suggesting that that's a bad

823
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:32,000
But it goes to a previous article that curse wrote on his blog

824
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:37,120
Proof of any of his clients but instead relied on reporting based on something someone told him

825
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,656
Allegedly apparent

826
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:42,240
And told him the three children at Monte Vista Christian

827
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,520
I've been diagnosed

828
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
With myocarditis

829
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,616
I'm not saying that this didn't happen but I am

830
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:52,736
I am saying that this is something that you need to do some more leg work on if you're going to report it as a definitive claim

831
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
This is sloppy

832
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
But this it gets so much worse

833
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
So the ratio and literally every

834
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,184
Conclusion the curse comes to is just the result

835
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,464
Him guessing things

836
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
From the original post

837
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,072
Roughly half the Schooler boys

838
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:10,144
There is no never been a vaccine mandate at the school

839
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,216
So I'd estimate conservatively the two-thirds of the kids

840
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,752
Could have been vaccinated by that

841
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,592
So 855 / 2 * 2/3

842
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
His 200

843
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
85 vac

844
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
Vaccinated boy

845
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:27,040
So the rate of myocarditis at the school by my estimate is three out of 285 which is

846
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
Is 1 and 95 boys

847
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368
That's me original article

848
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,928
They didn't have an updated because he's heard of 1/4

849
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,512
I've never been so shaken to my core

850
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:42,656
Damn that type of evidence

851
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,448
0 guessing dad

852
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,336
Three children at myocarditis he can't demonstrate that vaccination rate

853
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,663
He's even just guessing with the roughly half the Schooler boys thing

854
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:58,271
This 195 number means legitimately nothing he can't back this up at all

855
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
So then

856
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,599
His new post is about how he's quote

857
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,999
Heard that there's another case of myocarditis at the school which of course would make it one in about 70 using the same made

858
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,535
Numbers that he used before

859
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:14,399
It's hard to believe that someone could write a blog post like this and hit publish without feeling

860
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
Intense embarrassment

861
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,983
Listen to this utter horseshit

862
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,543
These are just the cases we know about

863
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:25,151
There could be other cases that we simply don't know about it because the families decided not to

864
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
To tell anyone

865
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:32,063
There could be subclinical cases where the damage is being done so slowly over time

866
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
And I bet

867
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,231
The boys of myocarditis are all recently vaccinated what a coincidence

868
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:45,631
Something happened and then say it's a go with what a coincidence

869
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,191
Clue that this isn't just bad luck

870
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,495
Which is not what you did prove

871
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
Bingo

872
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:56,895
Doesn't know what the vaccination rated the school is but he's decided that all of the alleged

873
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,199
For children who he's heard got myocarditis

874
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,247
This must be recently vaccinated

875
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
Richie condescendingly

876
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
Here's here's what I'm happy about

877
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
Alright

878
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
Local news has been dying

879
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:16,351
So I'm grateful at least one person is on the only one private school in California beach

880
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,167
Okay those Street

881
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:23,263
I would argue he's not a bad job of pounding that one

882
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
Nobody

883
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
Local news

884
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
Okay fair

885
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
He's not going to get a job with some

886
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,175
Sinclair tell you that right now

887
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:37,343
We contacted the deed of the school who said that they don't just give out medical information about students to random people

888
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,231
Which of course proves that this is a conspiracy and a cover-up

889
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,303
Everyone's in on it from the administration to the parents

890
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,399
Most of the parents apparently agree with the secrecy

891
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:54,751
They could speak out but chose not to say a word to anyone outside the community

892
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,567
Even the parents of the injured kids are remaining silent

893
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,847
Why not speak out

894
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:05,247
It reminds me of the fairy tale The Emperor's New Clothes all my God

895
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
Silent did the right thing

896
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
To do here

897
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,367
Suppose half the school died after taking the vaccine

898
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,903
What the school say nothing

899
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:17,023
They could save hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide if they spoke out and others followed their lead

900
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:21,119
It would destroy the credibility of the CDC and freak people out of their hypnotic

901
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,167
Plants doing whatever the CDC says

902
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
Wow

903
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:31,615
I a weirdo Without A Child Called up with school and ask for all of the kids social

904
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
Security numbers

905
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,991
And the school wouldn't give them to me does that mean they're working with the governments and honestly like

906
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,343
This sounds like it's written by a f****** angsty teenager

907
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
Coat of this is

908
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,671
So first of all unprofessional

909
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,463
Football chest

910
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
Whining

911
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,839
It's it's embarrassing I wouldn't give it a high-grade if I were great

912
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:57,983
No theories about why nobody is talking out no other.

913
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
How come you have fairies

914
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
How to clear conspiracy

915
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:04,639
So the first is that some alleged students at the school told him that the

916
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,687
B-school administered vaccines on April

917
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
30th

918
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
To the school

919
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
Must be afraid of getting

920
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Sued

921
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,831
Apparently curse went on to bother the dean about

922
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855
Quote

923
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:20,255
She stated in an email to me on January 5th that quote Monta Vista Christian School has never administered covid-19

924
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,047
Vaccine students or anyone else

925
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,119
Monte Vista Christian School has never hosted

926
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,423
At its real property or anywhere else

927
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,519
Any clinic or other event that which covid-19 vaccine

928
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
Where's my booster

929
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:37,407
Okay that means someone's lying why would the kids lie about that

930
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,943
Isn't that a spoon

931
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:46,623
Get the f*** out of here manojob

932
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:51,231
His other theory is a parents don't want to hurt the school and think that God will heal the the stew

933
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,815
This is primary source Alex is using to report at this

934
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
Conspiracy claim

935
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,167
It's nothing new really but this is particularly shity work

936
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,727
Suppose Maxine Clinic

937
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,031
At the school allegedly had on April 30th like

938
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,823
If that was when the students

939
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,615
Supposedly got vaccinated

940
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:14,015
Why is in the face of curses other made-up point about how they were all recently vaccinated with you'll remember he made up early

941
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:20,927
All this stuff that he's making up isn't internally consistent

942
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:28,095
The claim is going all over right with media and social media and the only support I can find for it in all of the articles is

943
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,423
This stupid blog post written by a grown man who sounds like a tween

944
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,519
These people are reporting this story based on this they should be deeply ashamed

945
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,055
Themselves they've done no

946
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,895
Checking in on the source or they're willing

947
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,943
The stand behind this stupid blog post

948
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,735
Can I find that accept

949
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
I got to say

950
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,063
I'm sorry I don't mean to

951
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,855
Keep it up

952
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,647
I find

953
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,183
That overtime

954
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
I have a very different

955
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
Kinship to a couple of Alex

956
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,047
Yes okay like sometimes

957
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,839
I find them abhorrent

958
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
Kind of funny

959
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,655
Like a Leo zagami

960
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,471
Sagami is crazy he did 9/11

961
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
All-time Hall of Fame

962
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
The pope is Jesus

963
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
He did 9/11

964
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
He's got it all

965
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,383
Obviously there's problems

966
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,943
I disagree with him on about everything

967
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,551
Back to an older time of Illuminati

968
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,343
Vatican conspiracy

969
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:26,975
Kind of with 70's house music at the same time I kind of can put up with Leo zagami

970
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,047
We can have an uneasy truce

971
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Steve Kerr

972
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,655
I hate

973
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
I hate this dude

974
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,495
Happy pig personalized blog poorly-written

975
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,543
Information that he's putting out

976
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
Is Sophia

977
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,103
Do undocumented

978
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,711
Allows people like Alex

979
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,503
Sensationalize it even further

980
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
+ 8

981
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
It's just deeply dangerous

982
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,343
I think

983
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,391
It's really hard for me to joke

984
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Even about how bad

985
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,719
Because I recognized

986
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
The dangers that are inherent

987
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
In it

988
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,583
And that makes me not enjoy

989
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
Covering his s***

990
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,911
Yeah his maybe Leo zagami

991
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
I mean

992
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,215
It sucks me up the most

993
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
Whenever it is this kind

994
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:17,407
Situation where you go back in your like there's really only this one dude who is saying this s*** and everybody's just running with it

995
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,967
What f**** me up about that is just like

996
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
That is

997
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
He's such a

998
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,575
Positive reinforcement type reward

999
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,599
For just

1000
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
Gall

1001
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:30,207
Just having the gall to say something

1002
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
This.

1003
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,255
When the straight face

1004
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,279
Is rewarded

1005
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,815
Beyond Your Wildest Dream

1006
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,351
That's f***** up

1007
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:42,239
That's not that's not good or not is like let's put that inside even just like

1008
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
People

1009
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:43,775
Do it

1010
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:48,127
Making so many assumptions in terms of justifying

1011
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,919
The claim that you want to make

1012
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,991
Supposed to get in the actual information

1013
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,271
That you can verify

1014
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,807
I think that

1015
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:59,135
Did the rewarding of that is got it

1016
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:06,559
Give you all kinds of endorphin rushes if you're that guy why wouldn't you do it again

1017
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:11,679
Underworld dumbass up stack I'm sure

1018
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,007
So Alex talked about this a little bit more and

1019
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
This is just

1020
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
Pathetic

1021
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,687
On Wednesday

1022
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
Proceed report

1023
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
From a concerned parent

1024
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,367
Fourth student at the

1025
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,415
Monte Vista Christian School

1026
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,695
In Watsonville

1027
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,487
Been diagnosed

1028
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
Personality

1029
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,559
Documented cases

1030
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,655
At the school with an enrollment of about 855 students

1031
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
Last month

1032
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,239
Go to the beginning there Alex's correcting

1033
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
Because he had said

1034
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
Steve Kerr shoes

1035
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,567
Apologist and now he's saying

1036
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,871
So it's not apathy not a pathologist

1037
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,151
But I want to still a liar

1038
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:57,247
No wearing purses articles is he covering anything that a pathologist told

1039
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,527
That is a loadable

1040
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:04,415
Also Alex is reading an article from his own website that was written by a dawn Salazar

1041
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,463
Does say that Steve Kerr's is a pathology

1042
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,255
It's so weird

1043
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:12,607
Almost like a Don wanted to try and give these stupid claims more weight by lying about

1044
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
Credentials

1045
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,983
Also another major Point here is that curse has in no way documented any of these

1046
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
These cases

1047
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,823
He's heard a rumor about them and he's repeating that rumor

1048
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,127
But this isn't documented or proven in the

1049
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,687
Every element of hikers report to the

1050
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,735
The story is an attempt to create certainty out of

1051
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Insinuation

1052
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,063
And then when Alex and a dawn cover

1053
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
His blog post

1054
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,903
They do the same thing all over again

1055
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:38,463
Any point where it kind of becomes clear that curse

1056
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,255
Blog post doesn't prove anything

1057
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
It's fudge

1058
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
In order to make it

1059
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
Looked it up

1060
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,607
Adan calls him a pathologist

1061
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:51,007
Alex accidentally does because he's just reading add-ons article but then he realizes he can't justify saying something like that

1062
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,079
3 scale the Pakistan get the second hand from a pathologist

1063
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
These cases are documented

1064
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,663
It's all intentional

1065
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,199
Most of the stories

1066
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,735
Meetup by Steve Kirsch

1067
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,551
Or just things he's assumed for no reason

1068
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:09,439
But it helps push the narrative in 4th profits from pushing so it's critical to keep the audience from realizing

1069
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
But this is Steve

1070
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,487
Curse fanfic

1071
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,303
Which is why they dress it up like it's actual reporting

1072
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,607
Stupid this is actually getting people killed

1073
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
Because otherwise dunking on it could be good clean

1074
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
Fun yeah

1075
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,519
How much does it cost to

1076
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,799
Subscribe to that

1077
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:29,151
I mean it's like $10,000 you got

1078
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:36,831
I don't know if there's like a premium subset but I was able to find this article for free I don't know what he's

1079
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,855
Doing all boy

1080
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,903
So Aaron Rodgers

1081
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
Got a job

1082
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:45,535
Quarterback quarterback Aaron Rodgers

1083
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
Very beautiful

1084
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,863
Football football

1085
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,143
And this is a tension

1086
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,239
He's a bum Aaron Rodgers calls out NFL MVP voter

1087
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
Texas social credit score

1088
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,127
Who's the best player

1089
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,455
It's about to be submit

1090
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,479
To the social

1091
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
Credit score

1092
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,783
That's what the

1093
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,599
Do social credit score that Alex has been screaming about is

1094
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,951
Who's the guy

1095
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,023
When was some kind of like codified and centrally run

1096
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:20,607
Something where the government takes points away or gives points based on your behavior

1097
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:27,263
That's a pretty scary but I'm not sure I even care about the prospect of people making moral decisions when they're voting for the NFL end

1098
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,663
Let me tell you something I hope Alex never hears about the Hall of Fame and Barry Bonds oh boy really out of hand

1099
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,943
I'm sure you would care a lot

1100
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,271
Probably if you actually think about Alex's saying than anyone

1101
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,111
Actually on their conscience is kind of an instance of the social credit score

1102
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
That's weird

1103
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,487
Imagine a situation where a guy was running for a County Treasurer position

1104
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,303
He's awesome but the actual work being a treasurer

1105
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
Unfortunately

1106
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,911
He's also pretty public about his belief that white people are superior to other race

1107
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,983
What are voting against him because of that be

1108
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:02,847
The social credit score company absolutely what you treasurer

1109
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,943
Just let me do the treasury job I really don't even understand

1110
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,735
Buy the stuff anymore like it

1111
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,503
It's it's

1112
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,807
It's so thin to the point of its

1113
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
It's on Define

1114
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,671
Why the picture in my head of a government system but now that he's saying that it's just

1115
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,719
Something as meaningless as MVP voting

1116
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,255
I am really lost

1117
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:23,839
Also I can make a very strong argument that even if Rodgers is

1118
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:26,143
The best football player in the NFL season

1119
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:31,519
Him being an open anti-vax weirdo in the middle of a pandemic kind of reduces his value as a player

1120
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:35,359
It may take him out of the running for most valuable player in my mind

1121
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:40,991
I would rather have a quarterback is just slightly less good at football than him but it also isn't

1122
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,319
The total a****** is probably going to get a bunch of my team's fans killed

1123
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:48,415
I think I would have more value and having something at someone like that on my team than Eric Rogers

1124
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:53,023
Man I wonder if I wonder is NFL stat people have tried to

1125
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,303
Put that together like

1126
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,583
Aaron Rodgers

1127
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,119
Infected like a dove

1128
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
His teammates

1129
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:04,031
What is wins above replacement value subtracted by them being gone for a few games

1130
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:10,687
Because of him you know what I'm saying we got to get the fantasy nerd father how much damage Rogers

1131
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,223
Into his team by spreading the disease

1132
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,039
Most Valuable Player commits a lot of difference

1133
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,343
Thanks a lot of consideration

1134
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:23,231
Highway this is all convoluted nonsense Alex's rambling about but it's cool to see that he cares a lot about football now

1135
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,767
Super call him

1136
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,095
Constantly talk about dumb football isn't a distraction

1137
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,119
Divert men's insta

1138
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,191
Think towards War absolutely because they want to fight the globalists

1139
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,007
Feminize an entire generation

1140
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,799
But I guess it matters a lot now that's

1141
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,847
It's super boring Aaron Rodgers doesn't like Alexa

1142
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
Fun

1143
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:44,735
So I'm sorry I can't

1144
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,807
I'm still struggling sometimes whenever we get to those

1145
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,831
Different steaks

1146
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,879
One Clip ago

1147
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,695
Everyone's going to die from the vaccine next clip

1148
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:56,255
Somebody's not voting for Rogers for.mvp

1149
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:01,119
This is also a big probably wait till we get to the 7th

1150
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,679
Is a roller coaster crazy

1151
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:10,079
There's a massive Riddle That I can't wait for you to try on the ramp angle on the 7th

1152
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:13,407
Alright another bit of a riddle hear that Alex

1153
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,967
It gets it he's trying to introduce this clip

1154
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:18,015
Of Robert Kennedy Jr

1155
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
Who's

1156
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,087
Talk about wife how she wants to back to

1157
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
Peopleshare

1158
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,903
Bourbons go off the rails

1159
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,351
Robert Jr explains why salty is

1160
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,287
Crime and Scandal end of a shelf butt

1161
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,079
That's only one level

1162
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,615
This is not about money

1163
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:48,223
Drug rep for the company has the people following directives it's all about money

1164
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:52,063
But for the group's above it it's about sterilization depopulation

1165
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,879
Playing God

1166
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,903
What they say

1167
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,463
They want to merge with silicon to become gods

1168
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,999
Only way to do that

1169
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,559
Enough people these shots

1170
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,863
And then test what's happening and see

1171
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,423
What

1172
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
Play what

1173
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,239
Immortal cell lines

1174
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:14,079
Emergency biological Immortal cell line

1175
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,871
With a human

1176
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,919
Synthesis

1177
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,199
That is able to merge

1178
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,503
Where did these nanotech

1179
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
Synthetic

1180
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Matrix's

1181
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:30,207
Alright

1182
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:36,863
That they admit all this was carrying a lot of water

1183
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:44,031
Put your weird move on Alex's part to play clip of Robert Kennedy Jr talking about how fat you wanted to vex

1184
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,311
Snakeheads

1185
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:48,639
Introduces it by saying that the clip you're about to listen to actually it isn't

1186
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
I'm through

1187
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:53,759
Tickets of Alex's goal is to make Kennedy's argument looks saying in comparison to his own

1188
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,039
This is not a good job of that

1189
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Okay

1190
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,087
Alright so yeah

1191
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,391
I mean obviously for the CEOs and

1192
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,415
It's all about money

1193
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,975
But they don't even know that what they're trying to

1194
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:09,375
To do is combine so if I understand now the vaccines aren't even also about killing people it's about mad

1195
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,143
Anticipated

1196
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,007
Gene's can connect with a mortal

1197
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:19,103
Cell line and I guess

1198
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,199
Call people who are going to die just as a side effect of

1199
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,735
I guess of The Killing

1200
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,295
The population actually isn't the primary objective

1201
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:32,671
It's trying to figure out whose bodies can I merge with it let me throw this out there

1202
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:39,327
Is there a chance that one or all of us a bunch of us might have those perfect genetics and then you know

1203
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,887
Well now they're probably kill you

1204
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,191
And take yourselves

1205
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:50,335
I forgot man every tired so I was listening to take it real slow

1206
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:55,711
One thing I noticed for sure that Alex is struggling to figure out how to emphasize

1207
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,247
It's fascinating how you can

1208
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:00,319
Feel the gears moving in his head knowing that what he saying is

1209
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,111
Bulshit word salad but

1210
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:06,463
Still trying to figure out a way to not sound like he's making it all up for sure

1211
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,487
Matrix's

1212
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,279
It's kind of like seeing

1213
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:14,143
Somebody try and adjust well falling the air

1214
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
It's basically the albino lion.

1215
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,239
For the globalist

1216
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,543
Relaxing about sterilization depopulation

1217
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,359
Playing God and engaging in quote mad scientist

1218
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,895
This Behavior did you think should be

1219
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,455
Honestly though so far so good

1220
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
I'm not

1221
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,015
But I don't think we're off the rails yet

1222
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:36,927
The plan is to merge with silicon and become Gods which I don't believe is anyone's playing but I'll allow it so we can move forward

1223
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
However

1224
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,511
How does merging with silicon make one a god

1225
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:45,887
I guess there's a possibility of like it wouldn't die of old age maybe but that's not the only future you need to be a god

1226
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
I don't think

1227
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,191
I think you should probably be able to lift

1228
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,519
Help your muscles

1229
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:55,103
Emergency

1230
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
I believe that Alex think

1231
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:00,223
What's the vaccines contain like AI nanotech robots

1232
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
So this is all a big

1233
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,271
Take test to see whose bodies

1234
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,575
You can merge with the vaccines and then from this they hoped

1235
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,343
Define immortal

1236
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,623
Cell line the converge

1237
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,415
With vaccines cuz that'll help them

1238
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,975
Merge with Gaston

1239
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:16,351
Google auto nonsense and for one thing I really don't think Alex has any understanding of what an immortal cell line is

1240
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,655
I suspect that he actually

1241
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:26,335
I just felt never died actually the Mortal selves last for

1242
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:29,151
Wherever there's a limited Supply you have to pay

1243
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:32,223
Each one individually out if you want to do an experiment

1244
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:37,087
One of your things like this I really wonder if the listeners recognize how ilex keeps adding

1245
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,367
New wrinkles to his

1246
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Conspiracies

1247
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,695
I have the plans of the globalist seems to change

1248
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,975
Constantly but like

1249
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,511
I hope I didn't I say it like

1250
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,327
They all it dammit all that

1251
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,375
Man the way he ended that sin

1252
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,399
And two would like those

1253
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,959
The last four words were just shopping

1254
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,543
Not sure where he's going to land and then finally he was like

1255
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,335
No one's going to buy that s***

1256
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:04,991
That's cuz I'm just saying they admitted it so no one's going to believe this b*******

1257
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,831
To hear some of you like citations but Alex provides

1258
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,879
Little fish

1259
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
Mention some of this earlier

1260
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,279
Oh look

1261
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,863
Technology wants Levi Global Elites will save you

1262
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,887
60 minutes

1263
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:26,239
Can we become gods

1264
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,519
It goes on from there

1265
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:32,383
The headline about human history ending when people become Gods isn't some kind of an evil statement

1266
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,151
Threat

1267
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:38,527
It's a headline of an interview from 2017 with an Israeli historian named Yuval Noah Harari

1268
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,623
It's basically trying to just discuss his new book

1269
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
Homo Deus

1270
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:46,975
Which argued that with the Advent of technology that we've created

1271
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:50,047
I was beginning to wield powers that we previously described only

1272
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,351
Like the ability to create life

1273
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:59,007
You speaking in a somewhat poetic way to express that when we are able to create inorganic life like a sentient AI

1274
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,287
We can quote go to

1275
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:03,103
The Earth Spirit and say what do you think about that

1276
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
We're equal to

1277
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,151
The spirit we understand

1278
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:05,919
Not you

1279
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,223
Ferrari has some very interesting thoughts

1280
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:13,087
This is a futurist Theory and he's definitely not saying that humanity is going to end

1281
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,391
Just it will take on an entirely new

1282
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,671
With the world around us

1283
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,463
That has been the case

1284
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,999
Since human history has begun

1285
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,559
Who's the meeting with Citation for the argument Alex

1286
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,327
Macon

1287
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:29,727
Interesting Lee the other headline from 60 Minutes is another interview with Yuval Noah Harari

1288
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:34,079
From 2021 both interviews with dispatch

1289
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:38,175
Is Ray Kurzweil not said anything freaky for Alex

1290
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,711
Upset about lately

1291
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,783
Futuristic is secretly telling everyone what's coming

1292
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,343
Wild Alex's they admit all this

1293
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,183
Guess what he's actually saying is that he has a couple Sensational headlines for articles

1294
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:53,023
About interviews with a futuristas making predictions about where technology is going

1295
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,863
Susan admitting anything in the things that are being predicted aren't even in line with Alex

1296
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
Cuz bulshit

1297
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,703
Stupid yeah that's

1298
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,727
That's I mean

1299
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
Fine

1300
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,543
Some guy said something

1301
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823
And I'm like what

1302
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,199
Totally

1303
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,479
77

1304
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,295
I'm Blown Away by

1305
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,831
Okay

1306
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,599
Is

1307
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,135
One of the weirder things I've heard

1308
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:22,207
Quite a while so we had a five-year anniversary

1309
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,255
Kind of

1310
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:28,095
Weird in a way that's a little different than our usual weird

1311
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:32,447
Familiar themes website

1312
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,263
Listen to this s***

1313
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,079
Imagine how excited I was when I heard them

1314
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:44,991
Alright next person

1315
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,551
World

1316
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,599
American Eagle

1317
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,927
Horton

1318
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
Ian

1319
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:58,047
The world in the reason that's important is

1320
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,863
You understand information

1321
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,911
Understand

1322
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,727
Everything else this is a Rosetta Stone

1323
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,799
If he is

1324
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,431
This is the understanding of everything if you can understand this

1325
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:19,807
Ironic ass

1326
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:26,207
The it's a mirror and that you are the most popular Time Magazine

1327
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,023
Yeah I kind of thought there was a chance that was what was going to happen

1328
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,863
Your guesses

1329
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:38,751
And I'm not going to say yes or no I'm not going to give it away cuz it's a fun game

1330
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,335
Alex is going to announce the most important person in the world

1331
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
It's

1332
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,687
Here's some clue that okay

1333
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,503
Person in the world

1334
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,855
Oh really Hamming it up to huh-uh

1335
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,927
It's why we're going to reveal

1336
01:03:59,487 --> 01:03:59,999
Why

1337
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,583
Person is the most important

1338
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
Persona world

1339
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,423
Soon as the most important

1340
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,447
Curtain

1341
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,983
Important person in the world

1342
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,775
Understands that

1343
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,711
The New World Order

1344
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:24,831
So the most important person in the world does not know that they're the most important person right right right

1345
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:29,695
I mean I would like a little bit more parameters on that do they know that they are an important

1346
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:36,095
Person or do they just not know that they're important at all doesn't really clarify but we can say for sure that they don't know

1347
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,119
They're the most support

1348
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,447
We have week

1349
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:43,263
Cross one person off the list, it's Starbucks

1350
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,031
No

1351
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
Still could be

1352
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,359
Novak Djokovic

1353
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,175
Courtney park in the world

1354
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,223
And the spirit of what he's doing

1355
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
Is the essence of what we're about to

1356
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,599
Is it a little question who this motion

1357
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,975
Call Joseph Watson has happening in the land of tyranny

1358
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,583
It's not Djokovic

1359
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
Well that's good

1360
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,887
Cuz I do think Djokovic

1361
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:16,543
I believe he is the most important person in the world

1362
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,335
What he's doing

1363
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,871
Requesting

1364
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,895
A place where he can

1365
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:21,919
Train

1366
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
They like

1367
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,783
He's not asking to not be in like a quarantine

1368
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,831
He's just asking for a quarantine where you can

1369
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,111
I'm praying for the

1370
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,159
The open you want the Billionaire's quarantine

1371
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,719
Basically I don't know why Alex

1372
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999
Labeling data hero

1373
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,279
But whatever

1374
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,559
I mean I assume that

1375
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:44,191
These labeling got a hero because right now they're keeping Djokovic in a notorious Refugee Hotel

1376
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:44,959
That have

1377
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,519
Has been the housing people for upwards of eight years

1378
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:51,871
And what was very funny is that the pro Djokovic protesters

1379
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:55,711
We're right next to the anti-refugee protesters

1380
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,735
And they were like

1381
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,503
Hey man

1382
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,039
Guess what else

1383
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:04,927
These guys are protesters were like this problem first

1384
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,767
Expected

1385
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,559
They were like fuk Djokovic

1386
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,119
People trapped in there Frankie

1387
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
Chucky videos

1388
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
It was amazing

1389
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,263
It was a huge surprise

1390
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,287
So

1391
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,823
What is

1392
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,103
Less on expect

1393
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,383
Is it Alex

1394
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,711
Get sidetracked before he tells us who the most important person in the world

1395
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,807
Nothing more frustrating than knowing we have

1396
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,599
Cancers and the key

1397
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:38,207
To defeating this evil takeover and stopping at dead diss tracks

1398
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,791
But instead I just can't get people conscious

1399
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,839
Focused Eye Care

1400
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
Get the message

1401
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
Ashley

1402
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
Finally finished

1403
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:53,055
That means we're going to go along hellish nightmare

1404
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:58,431
Most people listening and watching will be dead in 10 years

1405
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:03,039
He's sworn to kill you and your family

1406
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:09,439
Lockdown shutdown

1407
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,975
Brown cyber shutdown

1408
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:15,839
Completely been totally overrun on the streets

1409
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,887
Electricity

1410
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,775
Who's the most important person in the world Miami

1411
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:28,383
I mean I don't know muscle memory him doing these rats

1412
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663
Come on man

1413
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
You started this off

1414
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
Beauties

1415
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,783
You can't you can't do this to me

1416
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,063
Djokovic

1417
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,087
Well if it's

1418
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,111
5 years old

1419
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,159
Then I suppose

1420
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
It is

1421
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:44,255
It's probably still Netanyahu right cuz he was the canary in the coal mine

1422
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,047
And it's time to pray

1423
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,583
Right it's not

1424
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,631
I can't slip

1425
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,191
It's not that guy

1426
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,519
But I'm not going to say yes or no to any further

1427
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,799
Possible person

1428
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,127
Alright I'm pissed off

1429
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,759
Because

1430
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,903
I have this weight on my shoulders and I know I'm right

1431
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,927
I know it's going down

1432
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:15,231
Documents

1433
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,863
Comfort zone

1434
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,447
The enemy's going to win

1435
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
Because they're going to

1436
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,311
Criminal Society while posing as the saviors the whole time

1437
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,735
Go to deliver the most important information ever

1438
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,759
Wow okay

1439
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:41,343
There's one thing people aren't in right now it's their f******

1440
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,367
Comfort zone

1441
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,159
That's opposite

1442
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,719
For most people know I don't think of any people are in there

1443
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:51,583
Alex has dark many times in his career but have his job is to wake people up out of the transit

1444
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:55,167
That's why he yells and has a gravelly voice instead of the soft-spoken

1445
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,191
Kinfolks at MPR

1446
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,519
You're trying to lull you to sleep

1447
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,543
Steak and Shake you out of that

1448
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,311
Sleep course

1449
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,359
When I'm looking for someone to admire I can

1450
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,919
Tell you that it's going to be the person who gives themselves

1451
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,455
The job of beagle

1452
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,759
Can wake people up to the globalist blocks around them

1453
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:13,855
Only to lament that they can actually wake people after the globalist plot surrounding

1454
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,695
When Alex is he can't get people to wake up isn't

1455
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,719
Sleeping person

1456
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
Asphalt

1457
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,303
It's that there's something wrong with the person yelling at them to wake up

1458
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,119
What Alex says stuff like this I just hear him saying

1459
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,935
I can't do my job which is imaginary to begin with

1460
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,471
Woohoo

1461
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,751
Now it's important

1462
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,031
That we

1463
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,055
Never

1464
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,615
Take responsibility for our own actions

1465
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,919
Or hold anyone responsible for their

1466
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,199
That's what is

1467
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,479
He's going to move us

1468
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:44,319
I will say though I'm excited to hear what the most important information ever is

1469
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,087
I mean

1470
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,623
Got to be something really

1471
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,671
Deflating

1472
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,463
Constantly builds things up to be the most

1473
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,255
Important information ever or house

1474
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:55,839
Reset Wars with the most important work he's ever done and then it's always a bust

1475
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:00,703
It means nothing to do with him.

1476
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:05,311
Maybe people are sick of the bulshit

1477
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:11,967
I can't say f****** if it's raining.

1478
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,015
In the world to reveal

1479
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,831
Go to deliver the most important information ever

1480
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:23,231
People actually understand

1481
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,351
All the southern credible news I've got in front of me it's very important

1482
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,655
You's a byproduct

1483
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,191
V

1484
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,263
Disease that is the New World Order

1485
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:58,047
Window dressing

1486
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,191
Oh God

1487
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,751
We're not going to find out who the most important

1488
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,799
Thursday

1489
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,127
Everywhere you remember where I was when I was doing stand-up you know

1490
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:12,895
Sometimes

1491
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:16,479
To keep things interesting or keep things fun they bill at we be like you know what

1492
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,063
I'm just going to do none of my picture I'm just going to do nothing but crowd work tonight

1493
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,599
And then maybe you keep a clock

1494
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,135
Can somebody and be like I usually do

1495
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,927
210 out of 20 exactly

1496
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,231
Has anybody ever put Alex on a clock

1497
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,279
For like how long he can just

1498
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,095
Build something up for it you know like how many segments

1499
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:34,655
Can you go just saying nothing

1500
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,679
But how

1501
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,215
The next thing you're going to

1502
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,031
And you can't even do your job anymore

1503
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,335
I mean he would he would

1504
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,895
Solo

1505
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,711
Yeah brutal see if he actually does

1506
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,271
I mean obviously

1507
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,295
That's for sure

1508
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,087
You can restart the show lineup

1509
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,415
Nasty stuff

1510
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,935
We got a lot of really good reports here

1511
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,319
That was a really really important

1512
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,367
Was it

1513
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:30,719
Grieve are something we've already aired because I can't do my job

1514
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,743
Wow

1515
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,535
Admirable

1516
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,119
I mean you know I like

1517
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:42,495
I've sometimes been emotionally incapacitated to the point where I cannot do my job however

1518
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,519
I tried it

1519
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,311
Not do it while I was doing my job

1520
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,847
You know what I'm saying

1521
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:51,711
I totally understand people needing to call in sick or take a me day

1522
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,759
Totally totally

1523
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:56,575
Think it's worse if you go to your job and then

1524
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:01,695
Complain about how you need to take a me day

1525
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:05,791
The purpose of what your job is

1526
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:09,631
Can you throw a hatchet at the wall you're in trouble

1527
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,911
Yeah that's not good

1528
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:15,775
No I was going to go walk around the parking lot

1529
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:20,127
Recent report around the parking lot

1530
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,687
And that's that so

1531
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:26,271
My God will be back I guess after this break

1532
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,063
I want to show you today

1533
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,599

01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,639
Wow what an intro

01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,991
What It intro for Gregory

1539
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,783
Goddamn

1540
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,831
You just don't get it other place

1541
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,111
There's nothing

1542
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
Corporate

1543
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:07,231
That will allow you to do that you're fired

1544
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,047
That you don't get you don't get multiple those

1545
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:15,935
You get one of those in that you're gone let alone is happening over and over and over again

1546
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,215
And honestly I think I would be

1547
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:23,359
He totally bored of this if it wasn't within the context of him teasing who's the most important Friday so funny

1548
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,407
I just don't I just don't know how you

1549
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:26,943
I mean

1550
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:32,063
An actual broadcaster honored to be like I got to go walk around the parking lot

1551
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:38,463
I guess what you all deserve to die earn to die before I said that

1552
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,023
Comes back

1553
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,559
Tries to restart

1554
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:46,655
The show everybody shouldn't he's going to get to who the most important personnel

1555
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:50,495
Who is the most important person in the world

1556
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,591
Start of the show I told you I'd come back and do it

1557
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,687
I told you you all deserve to die

1558
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,647
Here's a problem that it's harder Harmony the show

1559
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,927
47

1560
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:13,023
My knowledge base is very

1561
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,863
Everything I look at every

1562
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,959
Jeep multi-faceted and multi-dimensional understanding of it

1563
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,847
Not going to reveal the most important person

1564
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,615
Complain

1565
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:31,455
His job because he's so smart it hurts that is

1566
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:33,759
I mean

1567
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,855
Yeah I mean wow amazing wow just wow

1568
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
It's that

1569
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
Good stuff

1570
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:42,719
Really you're going to look me in the face

1571
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,511
And tell me why

1572
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:48,607
He's not going to look you in the face cuz there's rules against session 2

1573
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:53,215
But he is going to tell you I'm so smart it hurts

1574
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,007
Apple Home Improvement related

1575
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
Japan

1576
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,079
Can talk over

1577
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,383
So Alex

1578
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
Manslaughter

1579
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,199
He just needs

1580
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,991
To be able to say the right words

1581
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
I quit

1582
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,319
That was great

1583
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,623
Logos already

1584
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:13,183
The way he's describing like

1585
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
His

1586
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,999
To do when you don't know.

1587
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:19,839
Defeat the globalist it almost sounds like he's like if I can get the spell right

1588
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:24,191
The word order in the incantation correct

1589
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
It will work

1590
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,727
This is just

1591
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:26,751
Ridiculous

1592
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,943
My mind and

1593
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,527
Moment of understanding all those points I want to make

1594
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,623
It all just dissipates like

1595
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,391
Gas

1596
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,927
Into The Ether

1597
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
Explain the song

1598
01:16:54,143 --> 01:17:00,287
Will grasp also absorbent and understandable

1599
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:06,687
More frustrating

1600
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:12,063
Don's because you are weak about myself

1601
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:23,071
Killing everybody enjoying

1602
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,863
I can't say a fun doing all the time

1603
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,319
For the children

1604
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:50,719
Who's the most important person you are a fucken monster

1605
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,351
Do you understand this

1606
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,399
He will defeat the globalist

1607
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:04,543
That this is the most important person in the world are we in right now

1608
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:07,615
It was a short walk there's a parking lot

1609
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,151
But we're still

1610
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,175
A fool

1611
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,991
This is at least 45 minutes into the show

1612
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:17,855
No problem I'm probably alright

1613
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,647
Okay

1614
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,719
No it's multiple segments

1615
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:26,303
This was supposed to be done already

1616
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,071
So much

1617
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,607
Yeah okay

1618
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,887
Gases

1619
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:30,655
Warrior heads

1620
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:37,311
I mean you know I've obviously I think my guess right now I'm sticking with Rand Paul

1621
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:40,127
But that also seems really dumb

1622
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,431
Which is also why I kind of think it might be true

1623
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:47,039
Paul a little bit more

1624
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,319
These are trying to bully him

1625
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:53,183
Right so that kind of would be somebody

1626
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:57,791
It could also be somebody who's like the most important person in the world

1627
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,095
Target

1628
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,399
This is the most important person in the world

1629

Making out

1631
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:08,287
See now that's fascinating because there are multiple

1632
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:13,919
Simple ways that you could interpret most important

1633
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:18,015
Justin Bieber I'll just say don't worry about that okay

1634
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:22,111

1635
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:22,879
We are

1636
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,159
This will pay off

1637
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,439
Schlafly

1638
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,719

01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,799
I can't say

1643
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:46,687
Alright so here's a list of Alex comes back is a little big

1644
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:53,087
The most important person

1645
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:59,231
In the world today

1646
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,511
I know

1647
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,215
Understanding where we're going

1648
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:09,983
Real quick

1649
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:16,384
I know you're yelling about cuz it's frustrating it's a little bit frustrated how repetitive

1650
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:22,272
Little bit of a thick skin buildup because I know how repetitive his bulshit is over and over again

1651
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,296
But in this case

1652
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,160
Incredibly grating

1653
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,184
Adenoids

1654
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,816
It's almost paradise in it no it's

1655
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:41,216
18 more infuriating comparison to be putting this off

1656

Protests

1657
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,616
Too much does not even come

1658
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,640
Close to cover

1659
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:51,968
Who is this

1660
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:57,600
Elon Musk

1661
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,648
Is it

1662
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,000
Maybe is it

1663
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
Maybe

1664
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,704
The current pope

1665
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,984
Give five more exam

1666
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,664
Novak Djokovic

1667
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,248
Who is it

1668
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:32,672
Who is the most truest in the most understandable way

1669
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,256
Kraneshares left and right

1670
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:39,584
Can actually speak to people in a human

1671
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,888
Don't tell me it's f****** Joe Rogan

1672
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,168
On this planet

1673
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,032
You know the answer to

1674
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,824
The rest of the story

1675
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,616
Wow this is

1676
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:56,736
Getting to bees moving it around a little bit now means

1677
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,272
Like communicating

1678
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,552
I don't know

1679
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,320
Look

1680
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,600
The riddle

1681
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:02,880
Did the Grand River

1682
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,952
I know

1683
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:13,120
Is someone important because they were

1684
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,912
President of the United States

1685
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,496
Yes she's someone important because

1686
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,056
Movies are handsome

1687
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,360
What you got about Brad Pitt

1688
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
That is

1689
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,688
Somebody the most important

1690
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:31,808
So where you define who the most important person is

1691
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,880
Says to you are there's a big study

1692
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:43,840
Is that the more celebrity-obsessed you are the lower your IQ and the less money you make

1693
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,776
The more you believe in the system

1694
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:56,896
The more you go along with its propaganda

1695
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:05,344
The more disease and dumb down and poor you are

1696
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,392
What get to the point what are we talkin

1697
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,208
Well that study would like a Hungarian

1698
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,488
Study

1699
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,096
Small guy couldn't even if it doesn't even

1700
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:19,168
Cloosiv

1701
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,704
You being a causal relation

1702
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:25,824
Celebrities in

1703
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,848
Whatever

1704
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,688
How much is Just obsessed with going off on side bars

1705
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
Just like this

1706
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
Right now

1707
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,784
Talkin about this study and celebrities being dumb

1708
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,576
Or this

1709
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:42,720
Did you see the establishment wants you to be alone to be dumb

1710
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:46,304
2B disease in Dodge

1711
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,608
Garbage

1712
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,192
Consciously is garbage

1713
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,472
What

1714
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:03,968
You're ugly Hubbell in your ugly face and your ugly kids in there do you finally be free cuz you won't be

1715
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,736
Be around

1716
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:12,160
And just because you got the general mass of people dumb down not aware out going to get themselves

1717
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:21,376
Globalist

1718
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:26,496
Crap all over other

1719
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,360
You talkin about you man

1720
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,272
So I ask you again

1721
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:45,440
Who is the greatest living person in the world has the greatest

1722
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,464
Potential

1723
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,536
This is such a mess

1724
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,560
Alex has been

1725
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:56,704
Teasing rambling is whole episode so far about a healing with the most important person on earth is but now he's moving the

1726
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:00,800
Apparently now it's the greatest person on Earth are the person with the most

1727
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,336
Potential to empower Humanity

1728
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:06,176
Alex thinks those things are interchangeable that's fine but it also speaks

1729
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,712
To his subjective beliefs

1730
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,016
Someone else could easily believe the most

1731
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,600
Important person and the person has the most potential

1732
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,624
Are two different people

1733
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,976
Like you touched on a very strong argument could be made that you can make these separate

1734
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,792
Most important person could actually be a force of evil

1735
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:27,168
Important to the volume neutral concept so if you were terrifying dictator who was working against

1736
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,704
Cause of Empower Humanity

1737
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,800
You are a threat to everyone that person could easily be the most important person in the world

1738
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
It's interesting

1739
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:38,176
To see how disorganized Alex's thoughts are even about this

1740
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,224
Clearly intentional

1741
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:46,624
I mean I just get caught up whenever

1742
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:51,744
We are gone they'll finally be savings like Alex you think whenever you get rid of all of

1743
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:58,656
You just talked about you man that was you it was you dude

1744
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:03,776
What happens when your enemies are imaginary and their plans are things you imagine them doing

1745
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,544
It is

1746
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,824
Coming from inside the house

1747
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,592
It is

1748
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:07,616
So Alex

1749
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,176
Dipset explaining his criteria

1750
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,456
For what makes a person

1751
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,480
The most important

1752
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:16,576
See now I've done now I'm interested is a little bit helpful

1753
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,904
A somebody's movie star

1754
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,720
Somebody play football

1755
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,048
Earbuds

1756
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,608
Give give you

1757
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:31,424
What you did in the in the corrupt system

1758
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:36,032
How much you care about you married

1759
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
Northstar

1760
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,552
Is my

1761
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:56,512
Expelling us out and laying out with his criteria for the most important person in the world

1762
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,536
Who doesn't make it

1763
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,584
Clear of

1764
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,888
Make it clear to me that this is a subjective

1765
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:02,912
Canyon Alex has

1766
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:06,496
Does really mean anything when ever he gives this honorific

1767
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,032
Title it just means Alex

1768
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,056
Likes this person

1769
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,336
Yeah I mean

1770
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:13,920
Really when he said he's going to clarify what it takes

1771
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:14,688
To be the most

1772
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
Important person

1773
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,248
And he's just created more Quest

1774
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,832
Directions for me to ask about what it is his new subjective measurements

1775
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:21,600
Actually me

1776
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,904
Well I think that you should

1777
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:27,232
Keep in mind but also throw it right the f*** out the window

1778
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,512
Cuz Alex

1779
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,304
It's shifting around a little bit

1780
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:37,728
Who's the most famous who's the richest that's not the winners

1781
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,056
What is the proper demanding

1782
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,224
A lot of snacks to get you mad

1783
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,248
Real

1784
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,784
Focused

1785
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,344
Christ-like way balanced

1786
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,440
Who's the most

1787
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:00,768
What

1788
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,848
Is the most important

1789
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,896
So I guess now the most important

1790
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:19,968
Person title that Alex is giving out his really better described as

1791
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:26,624
Person disseminating ideas that Alex likes who is also not a well-known lunatic or bigoted so they fly on

1792
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,160
Under most people's radar

1793
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:32,512
Is that how we describe the most important person

1794
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,560
So who do deer make other gases

1795
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:39,424
Is it cuz we're getting more information

1796
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:42,240
Now that the bar is set so low I almost want to say

1797
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:47,360
James O'Keefe or something to draw Spyro

1798
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,432
That's enough

1799
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:55,296
James O'Keefe

1800
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,344
Now give me another game

1801
01:28:57,856 --> 01:29:00,928
I want to try and get a galaxy of thought

1802
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,696
I mean

1803
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:05,024
God I'd want to say it's Steve pieczenik but I just can't

1804
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:05,792
I just can't

1805
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,840
Alex's

1806
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:11,936
That time I was going to last a little bit longer then

1807
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:18,336
Is it even worse is that curse himself is it at shity sub stack that's most important person in the world

1808
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,104
Alex

1809
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:23,200
Isn't reading actively a Steve Kerr's headline he forgets who he is

1810
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:25,248
But also interesting Lee

1811
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,016
Another

1812
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,064
Steve's are terrible on a Corolla

1813
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,600
Gerbils on a Wire

01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,952
It's about the most important

1816
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,304
Who's the most important

1817
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:45,216
Humans going to be a model for us

1818
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,824
Because Sinead O'Connor music

1819
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,640
We are that person we realize that

1820
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,408
We have the key

1821
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,432
Destiny

1822
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,040
Because I've seen it

1823
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,088
Understood

1824
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,440
First tell you about the person

1825
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:11,840
This person does not want to be president of the United States person cannot stand Hollywood

1826
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:12,608
Okay

1827
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:13,888
Slime

1828
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,936
I wanted I want to tell you something

1829
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,704
Yeah

1830
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,752
I actually knew who it was

1831
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:19,776
Immediately

1832
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:27,712
I thought I did

1833
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:30,016
Do the only person who knew immediately okay

1834
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:33,088
I don't want to Pat myself on the back too much

1835
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:38,976
Locate time there's a new clue if you can no no I don't

1836
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:39,744
I doubt

1837
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,072
Play this game because I don't get to know the answer in advance

1838
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:48,192
You know what I'm saying but I think if I didn't know the answer I'd still have a couple of thoughts

1839
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:54,592
CG my hat because when you have those around your head I'm not behind you being like

1840
01:30:54,848 --> 01:31:00,992
Trying to embarrass you

1841
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:03,552
Alright

1842
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,832
Here's some more clues

1843
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:07,392
This person cannot stand New York

1844
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:13,536
Hollywood rich people

1845
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:18,400
You don't want to hang around with the system they don't want to be embraced by the system

1846
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,192
Are disgusted

1847
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:22,752
By the system

1848
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:33,248
Schmidt

1849
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,672
Turner Ted Turner

1850
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:46,304
Depopulation

1851
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:51,936
Islamic side of Patriots now

1852
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:56,032
This include him because of all the talk about billionaires

1853
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,568
But he's a blue blood

1854
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,384
True I mean

1855
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:03,712
But that makes me think it's Tucker Carlson

1856
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:07,296
Maybe this will help

1857
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,088
We can disclude 1 /

1858
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:12,160
John F Kennedy junior he still alive

1859
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:17,280
Alex isn't going to publicly comment on that

1860
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:20,352
Elon Musk just not the most important person in the world

1861
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:22,400
Agree

01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,824
Person in the world

1865
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:35,200
Can you understand that it is now moving towards that

1866
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,016
Crochet gravity

1867
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:40,064

1869
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:44,672

The most important person in the world

1871
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,288
We must recognize

1872
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,592
From amongst our people

1873
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,640
Who is the best

1874
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:05,920

01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,248
Take on

01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:13,088
Somewhere between

1877
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:16,160
Sacrilegious at this point

1878
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,720
To do the Andy Daly podcast pilot

1879
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,744

01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,368
Fuchsia

1888
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,392
Yeah

1889
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:50,464
It is a little bit little bit

1890
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:56,352
Playing handball with the curtains as they say you like trying to figure out like right who is this person

1891
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:03,264
After the break before he goes to break

1892
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,288
Sacrilege

1893
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,592
Come back I'll tell you who

1894
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,640
Most important person

1895
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,432
In the world is

1896
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:13,248
I want you to understand it

1897
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,856
Burning yourself

1898
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,160
Ask yourself

1899
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:23,488
Is this true to God the Holy Spirit

1900
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:26,560
And it has the same thing I am you'll get the answer back

1901
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,608
Absolutely

1902
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:35,008
Like this is the example for all of us

1903
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:36,032
We got it we got it

1904
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:37,312
Live like

1905
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:43,456
This person who's the most important person in the world at the mold ourselves after them because that's what God wants us to do

1906
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,736
So I assume it's

1907
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,504
Jesus Christ

1908
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,808

Give other people some bad news

1916
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,456
You are not the most important person

1917
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:20,320
Long and hard about this and

1918
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,088
I know I'm right

1919
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:28,000
Who is the most important person in the world. Donald Trump Kate McKinnon

I could be at but he's not.

1924
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,328
Would he have gotten like a letter

1925
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,120
From somebody if you just said Russia

1926
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,144
And not Russia

1927
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,936
The largest landmass of the world

1928
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:12,032

01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,824
A real shot at

1940
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,640

Forget the world populace I was waiting for it

01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,464
I honestly I thought it was

1995
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,000
I couldn't imagine

1996
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:16,768
Tucker's too much

1997
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,560
A dick I think he's

1998
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:23,168
Exactly who Alex wants to associate himself with right now

1999
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,192
But also like

2000
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:26,496
I don't want to

2001
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:30,336
But I ain't from the job it was Taco

2002
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,360
F****** course

2003
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,384
Second

2004
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:37,248
Thought that I have is like Alex's so little to talk about on this episode 3 spending

2005
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:40,832
Our building up to saying the Tucker is the most important person in the world

2006
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,368
It shows so dumb

2007
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,208
But God that's great that was refreshed me

2008
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:50,304
That reinvigorated me on my you know I mean

2009
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:57,216
A couple couple weeks ago Alex was talking about how the anger is just say it's all juice

2010
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,752
That's what it is that's what fuels

2011
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,824
This has been one of the more infuriating

2012
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:05,408
Hours of Alex content in my entire life

2013
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:08,992
That's what makes

2014
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:15,904
I've traded muted my anger into for the people

2015
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,208
As manifested through your engine

2016
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,512
Great Plains

2017
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:24,608
Alex talks a little bit about why Tucker

2018
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,912
Get this little bit of a title

2019
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,960
Somebody like Tucker Carlson

2020
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:30,496
Nose

2021
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,264
Zetas

2022
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,544
Cruise

2023
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,824
Got a talking point

2024
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:37,152
Slenderman Dead from the establishment

2025
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:43,296
Are preparing to claim that the American people

2026
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:49,440
Stop and bring in martial law

2027
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,464
And the lawyer

2028
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,256
The bush minion

2029
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:55,328
Please reposes is a patreon all these years

2030
01:41:55,584 --> 01:42:00,192
Who is a wolf

2031
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:02,752
Has to be cut out

2032
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,032
And destroyed

2033
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,128
A populist

2034
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,408
Tucker Carlson

2035
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,176
Just

2036
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,200
Forrest Gump

2037
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:17,856
So it's all just a reaction to Tucker's interview with Ted Cruz

2038
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,880
Irene

2039
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:23,488
That is it is such a huge at that really is like a huge interview

2040
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:25,024
The idea to me

2041
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,816
Of being alive

2042
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,608
The building

2043
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:33,984
For the first time in my life and my entire political career really being afraid

2044
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,776
That a mob with

2045
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:38,592
Tear the walls down and kill me

2046
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,640
And then a year later

2047
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,920
To have to sit

2048
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,456
Across from that

2049
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:46,784
Whiny sniveling piece of s*** Tucker Carlson

2050
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,320
And lick his feet

2051
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,344
That is

2052
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,928
I mean like in the body of me right now

2053
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:55,488
I'm ready to kill Tucker Carlson if that was me

2054
01:42:55,744 --> 01:43:01,376
Ted Cruz I would have leaped across the table and started strangling him

2055
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:04,448
You have to recognize how week

2056
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,752
Ted Cruz news

2057
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:09,056
Track record is pretty shity

2058
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:11,616
But that's bad man

2059
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:16,736
So Alex talked a little bit more about this that interview actually is slightly different take on it than you do

2060
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:21,600
Terror attacks are coming

2061
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:31,072
Trying to stop it

2062
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:33,376
Fox News Republican

2063
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,424
Stop putting up

2064
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,960
Who is Mitch McConnell

2065
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:42,336
Ted Cruz

2066
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:45,152
Poison

2067
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:50,016
Call yalom

2068
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,344
System

2069
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,904
When they better start

2070
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,744
Charles is God

2071
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:07,680
To get actual Free Will and have his own voice on Fox

2072
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:11,008
Slip their what actually makes

2073
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:13,312
Something to Tucker's the most important person in the world

2074
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:20,224
It's the in Tucker Alex he's a person who actually has the ability to humiliate senators and essentially sway power

2075
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,248
We're on the right wing

2076
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:27,904
DC someone who if he can piggyback it Alex can use to re-establish the illusion that has any effect on the real

2077
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:28,672
World

2078
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:34,560
If Tucker can humiliate Ted Cruz and Alex pretends to be totally in line with Tucker and secretly his best friend

2079
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:37,120
Then it's kind of like Alex inspired Tucker.

2080
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,144
Humiliate Ted Cruz

2081
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,936
Enough Alex is really the one

2082
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:40,960
The power

2083
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,496
This way politics

2084
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:45,568
The final game for Alex to play and though I think it's

2085
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,848
Stinks of desperation

2086
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,408
It may well work a little bit for a while

2087
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:52,736
There is no Central problem with this though and it's

2088
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:54,528
People should ask themselves

2089
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:59,648
If Tucker and Alex are such good friends and on exactly the same page

2090
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:02,464
Why is Tucker never had Alex on any of his shows

2091
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:04,256
Like lately on any of these

2092
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:07,584
He has multiple shows you the radio show you how

2093
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,608
TV shows

2094
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:15,008
Why doesn't Tucker show up as a guest on Infowars periodically if they're couple of the very few comrades in this fight against

2095
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:21,408
Possibly more bitingly why wasn't Alex interviewed for Tucker's documentary about January 6th

2096
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:26,272
He was at the Capitol and clearly Tucker and no problem interviewing Shifty weirdos

2097
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,576
We had Ali Alexander interviewed in it

2098
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:33,952
The fact the Tucker seems to have a staunch resistance to being publicly personally associated with Alex

2099
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,256
Show me something that causes the audience asked

2100
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,280
Some salsa.

2101
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:41,120
Is this this is Trump all over again basically

2102
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,424
Pokemon allister show wants to

2103
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,192
Kelly's book

2104
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,752
In December 2015 and he never came back

2105
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:50,592
He never publicly Associated himself with Alex and anyway

2106
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:51,616
The narrative

2107
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:55,456
We're on the same page came almost entirely from Alex's story

2108
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:59,040
And in the end I think it's pretty safe to say that most of them were made up

2109
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:03,904
Now looks at the jettison that mainstream avatar for him to live vicariously through but

2110
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,440
Because Trump likes the vaccine

2111
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:10,816
Seems like maybe Alex is trying to lean hard into glomming onto Tucker in order to preserve some

2112
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,376
Image of relevance in the actual world

2113
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:17,216
Also there's absolutely no chance that Tucker makes almost no money at all

2114
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:19,008
According to CNN back

2115
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:23,872
In 2020 he was making ten billion dollars a year largely based on the fact that he showed drugs

2116
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,152
16% of the channels

2117
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,432
Entire ad Revenue

2118
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,760
That number probably went up a bit but maybe it's dipped sent

2119
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,064
That's because one of his main sponsors was my pillow

2120
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:35,136
A Mike Lindell might not be shelling out as much as money these days

2121
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,904
If he was

2122
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,928
Family fun

2123
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,976
Salad Days

2124
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,792
Yeah I mean with Tucker though that's that's

2125
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,352
He's at that type of money that you don't eat

2126
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:46,400
His salary 10 million dollars

2127
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:47,680
It is not

2128
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:48,960
Wrap it up

2129
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:49,984
Like he owned

2130
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:50,752
Part of fox

2131
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:56,128
News he's got a billion dollars

2132
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:00,736
Is an error to a two large Fortune so

2133
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:01,760
Death

2134
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:02,528
But you know it's not

2135
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:07,136
Cialix an hour

2136
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:08,928
About this

2137
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,720
That was an amazing performance

2138
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,488
Truly

2139
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,256
There is

2140
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:15,072
There's a part of me that respect

2141
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,352
How hard

2142
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:18,400
It's a commitment to a bad B

2143
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:19,936
It's not

2144
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:25,312
It's a commitment to imagine there's a difference between somebody who really muscles through for a bit that's

2145
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:26,848
And then there's

2146
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:28,640
Best glitches just like

2147
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:34,272
Yes uou will keep saying failure after the break and then rambling about bulshit

2148
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:36,064
Yeah I mean it's not Neil hamburger

2149
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:37,344
No but

2150
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:38,880
Boy it's

2151
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:39,904
At no point

2152
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,720
Time did he ever think man I got to stop doing this

2153
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:47,072
I just got I just can't do this probably not and I think a big part of it too is that Alex

2154
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,608
Keenly aware that

2155
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,888
Like if I do this

2156
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,168
Maybe

2157
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,472
People will report on me doing

2158
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:56,288
Our butter Tucker's the most important person in the world

2159
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,056
Which

2160
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,592
Associate me with him

2161
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:00,896
And get me more attention and I

2162
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,920
Exactly what he

2163
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,688
Start stalking

2164
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:09,600
Glisters understand

2165
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:11,904
Pickup

2166
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:19,840
Brazen. Carlson real estate Alex Jones

2167
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,008
That's not what I did

2168
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:32,640
He's just he's begging for them these headlines

2169
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,688
Please

2170
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:40,064
Subway map that's very sad very very

2171
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,600
Enjoyment I had

2172
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,904
Yeah and I think there's a reality

2173
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,952
So you got to got to wrestle with but at the same time

2174
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:47,488
Man fun

2175
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,256
Very fun

2176
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,280
Very fun

2177
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,816
You just got to leave the subject

2178
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:53,376
Stop text man y'all make this up text Tech

2179
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,656
It's just a

2180
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,680
Simple rule

2181
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:58,240
Alex is something I really weird

2182
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:00,288
In this next clip that I think

2183
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,872
I don't think he actually believes

2184
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,944
Celebrate the people that tell the truth

2185
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,480
We need to promote the pie

2186
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,760
Populist

2187
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:16,160
People that are fighting for your whatever gay marriage

2188
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:22,304
Play human future. For everybody

2189
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,144
Talk about group is attacking Mountain

2190
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,472
Talks about

2191
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:33,312
Humanity as a whole and believing in ourselves and coming together

2192
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,848
Is the good guy

2193
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,384
So if you talk about group

2194
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:39,968
You're the bad guy or good

2195
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:42,784
People all the f***

2196
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:46,624
I put this together in 5 minutes

2197
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:50,720
But boy there have been plenty of hate crimes against

2198
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:53,536
Ladies and gentlemen

2199
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:55,072
Because the leftist

2200
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:55,840
Judges

2201
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:57,120
And the leftist media

2202
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,656
Atelectasis

2203
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:00,192
Time and time again

2204
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:01,984
Hugo free

2205
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:03,520
Before election

2206
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:10,176
Hear the lamp the saying if you're white especially

2207
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,344
Bumper stickers

2208
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:25,280
There social workers that ask him questions under desk or Mommy and Daddy

2209
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:30,400
Because foster home especially of your blonde-haired

2210
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:32,192
This little girl

2211
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,472
She better be careful

2212
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:38,592
Have the height

2213
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:46,272
Use white people

2214
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:47,808
Data minutes just

2215
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:49,600
From five minutes of looking

2216
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:52,672
Anarkali miscut that because

2217
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:54,464
The Whitney says there's bumper

2218
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,512
Stickers of it's okay to be white

2219
01:50:56,768 --> 01:51:00,352
The next thing he says is I'm going to make a shirt

2220
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,632
Yeah

2221
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:03,424
He doesn't care

2222
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,472
It's a red herring when it's

2223
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,008
Sort of non-whites

2224
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:13,408
When it's proves that he is not erect

2225
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,688
You know advocating

2226
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:15,712
Sing for their outright

2227
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:17,504
When it's white people

2228
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,040
It's not really even a group

2229
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:20,320
Bright or

2230
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:21,344
The alternative

2231
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,624
Is that Alex does a

2232
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,416
Don't think that people who are not white

2233
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:26,208
Are not part of the totality

2234
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:31,328
Humanity

2235
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:34,400
Alex kind of realizes

2236
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,448
I spent an hour of my show

2237
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,472
Doing that talker thing

2238
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,264
I was bad

2239
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,568
Wanted cover other thing okay

2240
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:44,384
How do you spell all the time on that

2241
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:49,248
Tech CEO on

2242
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,576
White when they're Platformers exploding

2243
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:54,368
I just got launched sound

2244
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,888
Alicia's coming up next segment

2245
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:09,984
Yeah so Jason Miller the CEO of get her used to be a part of

2246
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,008
The Trump Administration

2247
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,544
You got some

2248
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,592
Flotillas to bring about

2249
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:15,616
So many flotillas

2250
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:18,688
Jason

2251
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,456
Tossed about

2252
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:22,016
Yeah this is just pathetic Alex's just trying to

2253
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:23,808
Piggyback on what Rogue

2254
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,112
Grove Transit

2255
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:26,880
Fix a guitar

2256
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:33,536
Welcome back ladies and gentlemen we have Miller with us she's American Communications

2257
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:39,936
Advisor spokesperson

2258
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:45,312
Presidential campaign

2259
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:48,896
Marcia 21 Miller became a contributor

2260
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:50,944
Newsmax Miller levings position

2261
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:57,344
Trump spokesperson in 2021 to become the CEO The Social Network Jetter getter

2262
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,928
Been on there a while at hundreds of thousands of followers

2263
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:02,720
Friend Joe Rogan

2264
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,768
Promoting in

2265
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,560
Over there

2266
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:10,912
Independent groups out there

2267
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:14,496
Got the Joe Rogan stamp-of-approval so now we're going to promote it as well

2268
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,800
Supposed to be this free speech

2269
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:18,080
Platform bed

2270
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:21,408
In December they kick Nick Fuentes off the site

2271
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,200
Christ after that

2272
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,736
Get her also banned user

2273
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:26,016
Composing the word groyper

2274
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:29,600
Because Fuentes his fans were posting too much about how he got kicked off

2275
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:37,280
Also just after get her launch we should not forget that their API was so weak that hackers were able to scry

2276
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:39,072
Personal information off a ton of user

2277
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:40,864
They got hacked immediately

2278
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:47,776
So also there's like the Stanford andradite Observatory cyber policy Center they did

2279
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,568
A review of debtors operations

2280
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:50,592
In August

2281
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,360
21

2282
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:53,408
They found some

2283
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,176
Kind of

2284
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:54,944
Some fun

2285
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,480
Stopping and also some.

2286
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:58,784
Fun stuff quote

2287
01:53:59,296 --> 01:53:59,808
Dinner markets

2288
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:04,928
Itself is a non-bias social network where users are able to post content more freely than Twitter

2289
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:11,072
In some ways however get her is more restrictive with content policy than the platform and contrast itself with

2290
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:16,448
Example in the app but not on the website users were initially prevented from posting

2291
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:17,216
Expletives

2292
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:19,008
Presented with an error message of

2293
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:22,336
Sorry we don't allow abusive work

2294
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:25,408
You fundamentally don't understand your audit

2295
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:27,200
Search

2296
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,736
Abuse is the point

2297
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:32,320
More troubling less funny

2298
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:34,624
That this report also found quote

2299
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,184
Very few if any mechanisms for detect

2300
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:37,952
In spam

2301
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:42,048
Violent content pornography and child exploitation imagery are present

2302
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:46,400
Get her instead appears to be relying on community reporting model

2303
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:47,680
Which has not proved

2304
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,448
Successful

2305
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,008
Essentially there is a program that

2306
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:51,776
I can just

2307
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,568
Entirely block

2308
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,616
Images that are in the database

2309
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:56,384
The child explode

2310
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,688
Sites like

2311
01:54:58,944 --> 01:54:59,968
Twitter have that

2312
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:00,992
Software horse

2313
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,528
And there are

2314
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:05,856
Crile images that are child exploitation images

2315
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:12,256
That are in that dataset right are used by researchers like people at the cyber

2316
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:16,608
In order to test if people are using that saw fryer

2317
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:20,704
Use these tests images on Twitter and they were able to post them

2318
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:23,264
Right but they don't have the sort of

2319
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,032
Standard block

2320
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:25,312
Right on this

2321
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:28,128
So if I understand correctly their first thought was

2322
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:28,896
No swears

2323
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:31,200
And then their next thought was

2324
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:33,248
Child exploitation

2325
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:39,648
I don't I don't know if they would be saying it's fine but they didn't do the requisite steps that most people use in order to

2326
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:46,048
Safeguard against the concept weird that somebody from the Trump Administration would just go off all half-cocked without a full

2327
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:48,608
Support structure in Flames very strange

2328
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,496
There's some fun stuff in this interview

2329
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,568
Large question is like I do. You worked

2330
01:55:57,824 --> 01:56:00,384
For the Trump Administration why isn't Trump on guitar

2331
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,712
That would be a big

2332
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,760
Why is it Trump

2333
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:06,784
Promoting gender

2334
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:13,696
Dancer Alex and bedroll just be very blunt

2335
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:17,536
Even before I formally launch get her I was in negotiations with

2336
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,632
And obviously he has a big name

2337
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:24,960
President Trump's ratings Gold Everything

2338
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,984
Turns into something

2339
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,776
Exciting

2340
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,312
Big

2341
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,152
Inga by sports franchise

2342
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:36,224
Somebody else came along and made

2343
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:40,576
The dealmaker and cheeks

2344
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:43,136
Trump is buyable

2345
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:44,416
The thing about

2346
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,952
The person you want

2347
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:46,976
To be your

2348
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:48,256
Commander-in-chief

2349
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:49,536
Chief is a cup

2350
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:50,816
Complete lack of loyalty

2351
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:52,352
In the face of a larger offer

2352
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,376
Yeah

2353
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,144
That's

2354
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,424
Chest

2355
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:56,960
America

2356
01:56:57,216 --> 01:57:02,848
Trumpets indoor Center vaccine how should water bug get her I mean

2357
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:05,152
Free Speech platform

2358
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:06,944
Except for the kicked off Nixon

2359
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:07,968
Well

2360
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,528
Pictures of Kelso

2361
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:14,112
Proposition

2362
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:19,232
Nobody is going to get canceled or sent to digital jail or

2363
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:21,280
Algorithm

2364
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:24,864
Making your political opinion

2365
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:27,168
Pornography

2366
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,192
Do not allow

2367
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:30,752
Twitter

2368
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:31,520
Taliban

2369
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:39,200
What

2370
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:50,464
Mention climate change

2371
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:59,168
Then you can have free speech my dude all those things are widely discussed Twitter

2372
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:03,264
Is climate change denial vaccine denial

2373
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:04,800
Election denial

2374
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:05,568
Spell

2375
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:08,128
Yeah it's interesting the way that he's

2376
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:10,176
Is defining free speech

2377
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:11,456
No pornography

2378
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:14,272
Whatever is the family site

2379
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:18,880
Yeah yes that's no muslim

2380
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:19,648
Extremism

2381
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,184
But you're

2382
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:23,232
Really going to just cater this to why text

2383
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:29,632
Exactly that's what we're trying to say free-speech meeting white people only people who

2384
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:30,912
Bird is Nick Fuentes because

2385
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:32,704
You're running a website

2386
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,240
Could get in trouble listen

2387
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:38,592
We want a white supremacist website that doesn't have any overt

2388
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:41,920
Supremacist on there we don't want to be storm fronts come on

2389
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:44,224
Creepiest thing

2390
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:50,112
That caters to people who kicked off Twitter but they were going to have to kick them off if they behave the way that they did when they got kicked off

2391
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:54,464
Seems like you got a good business model got it

2392
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,000
Anyway you also

2393
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,280
Can't use

2394
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:58,048
Some words

2395
01:58:59,072 --> 01:58:59,840
What is long

2396
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:02,144
Is your able to

2397
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,472
Control yourself and illegal activity

2398
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:07,776
We're going to the racial and religious

2399
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,872
Then what's free speech mean

2400
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,152
What does it mean

2401
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:13,920
To you

2402
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:17,760
It just means that I can't say capitalism's bad that's what free speeches

2403
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:18,784
I think I

2404
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,832
I think

2405
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:24,160
They want to be able to be in charge of

2406
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:25,440
The social media platform

2407
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:27,232
Be able to restrict

2408
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:28,000
Things that they want

2409
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:31,072
To the things that Twitter Caesars

2410
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:32,864
Things I like things I don't like

2411
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,144
I have thoughts

2412
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:34,912
My notes

2413
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,216
It's alright to be

2414
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:38,496
Incredibly boring

2415
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:39,520
Prospect

2416
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:41,824
Wolf do not believe that this website is going to be

2417
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:44,640
Over and over again

2418
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:45,920
Parlor Gab

2419
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:48,736
All this stuff the whole reason they like

2420
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:49,504
Twitter is

2421
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,296
Is because there are liberals for them to

2422
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,064
To b**** at

2423
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,856
To argue exactly

2424
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:57,952
But if you put them alone they won't like it

2425
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,232
There's no one to b****

2426
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:02,048
That's the whole point they just recording at each other

2427
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,584
Antagonize because that's

2428
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,352
A sport

2429
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:06,400
Yeah I know that's

2430
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:09,216
The game absolutely we would love you to stay on better

2431
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:12,800
Social media experience

2432
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:14,080
It's 44 a lot of folks

2433
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:14,848
Is

2434
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:17,152
Based on trying to rile other people up

2435
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:18,176
Because it's funny.

2436
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:20,480
That's a whole thing and I think that sucks but

2437
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:23,808
In a vacuum where it's all people trying to f*** with

2438
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:24,576
Each other

2439
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:26,112
It's just not as effective

2440
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:28,160
Anyway you're so close to gutter

2441
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,184
True

2442
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,976
Choice

2443
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:35,328
Alex

2444
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,608
Alex comes back

2445
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,680
He's quite a while interviewing

2446
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:40,448
Get her

2447
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,984
He's minding our talking

2448
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:45,056
I've changed my mind about who the most

2449
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:45,824
Important

2450
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,384
Be steadfast on that

2451
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,664
Batman

2452
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,968
He is not done a whole lot on his show

2453
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,112
Modeling hours

2454
02:00:58,624 --> 02:00:59,392
I got to talk about something

2455
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:04,000
Warchant

2456
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:14,496
I know a lot of ways to reach more people I know a lot of ways to get more information out

2457
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:23,968
And yesterday I plug 30 seconds in

2458
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:29,856
Not plugged

2459
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:31,648
Everybody knows people don't do it again

2460
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:33,696
Well I meant let's see

2461
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,280
Entirely accurate I wasn't really paying attention but like

2462
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:40,864
You don't get to give yourself credit for not blocking when you storm out

2463
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:43,168
Yeah there is that

2464
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:47,520
Really big

2465
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:51,360
Long plug for Tucker Carlson really

2466
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:54,432
So this is Alex

2467
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:56,224
His response

2468
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,784
Essentially to the news breaking

2469
02:01:59,040 --> 02:01:59,552
10 post

2470
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:02,880
Sebastian Murdock released an article

2471
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:06,720
That's a company financial documents

2472
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:07,744
Turned over the process

2473
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:08,512
Discovery

2474
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:11,072
In the face of the Sandy Hook case

2475
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:16,192
Alex Jones Infowars store made 106

2476
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:18,496
55 million dollars over three years record

2477
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:24,896
Show which is fair but it also leads to a number of inaccurate and possibly just Hasty conclusion that I'd like to touch on

2478
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:26,688
Before Alex even gets into

2479
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:30,016
The first thing is that this spreadsheet that I was covered in

2480
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:32,576
In the story it only reflects sales number

2481
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:36,416
This is nothing about profit or actual money brought in by Infowars above

2482
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,184
Expenses

2483
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:42,304
It's very unclear from the available information what kind of profit margin Alex has on these sales

2484
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:47,680
The actual amount this money reflects Infowars bring in a number that's within a range

2485
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:49,984
And it's really hard to determine where we are

2486
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,008
Or inside that ring

2487
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:53,056
That being said

2488
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:53,824
Alex

2489
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,872
He's making after the

2490
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:56,640
Expenses

2491
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:58,688
Still a very high amount of money

2492
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:01,248
This number has 106

2493
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:04,064
85 million so split up over the course of three years

2494
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,112
And Alex probably has a massive overhead

2495
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:09,696
Add from payroll to lawyers to business-related tank expenses

2496
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:11,232
He also constantly runs

2497
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,000
Free shipping

2498
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:12,768
Specials

2499
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:15,584
And there's a column in the spreadsheet that is sales shipping

2500
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:17,632
Is that reflects

2501
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:20,192
Some expenses he has to cover from free shipping

2502
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:24,544
They could be looking at a decrease over 7.5 million dollars in this time.

2503
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:28,384
The impression that I get from these numbers is that I actually would have

2504
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,152
Expected them to

2505
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,176
Higher

2506
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:32,736
165 million actually seems low

2507
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:33,760
Yeah based on

2508
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:37,088
What what's going on

2509
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:41,440
People don't engage in this kind of s*** head grifting that Alex does if it's not massively profitable

2510
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:45,536
So I'm not sure that any of these sales figures really surprise me that much

2511
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:50,912
Another thing that really confuse me about the discussions surrounding the spreadsheet is the impression that it was like the

2512
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,704
The sudden massive jump in sales

2513
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,240
In November 2015

2514
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:57,824
The beginning of the spreadsheet is for September 8th

2515
02:03:58,336 --> 02:04:00,896
2015 and it shows $15 worth of sales

2516
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:06,272
The next entries for October 5th 2015 which owes $81.90

2517
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:07,040
Some sales

2518
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:09,856
Which kind of implies that there weren't any sales in between

2519
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:14,464
Then by late November you're looking at sales over 30,000 a day

2520
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:17,536
It just goes up from there occasionally topping 100,000

2521
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:19,328
Until April 2016 or

2522
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:21,632
It's pretty routinely 100,000 per day

2523
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,656
That pattern

2524
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:27,520
Some people have suggested that he started making money on the shop around this time but that's just not pause

2525
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:33,920
The Infowars store Viet primarily operated in for store.com or enforce shop.com

2526
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:37,760
Is existence of at least 2010 and an article from 2010 Intex

2527
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:38,528
Texas monthly

2528
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:40,576
Discusses the claim from Alex that he made one point

2529
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:42,624
Point five million dollars in Revenue

2530
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,160
And sales from the store

2531
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:44,928
In the past year

2532
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:48,512
Inconceivable that he could be getting

2533
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:51,072
Periodic sales of less than $100 a day

2534
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:57,216
And some days apparently not bringing in any sales at all in this. Prior to September 2015

2535
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:59,520
Then you have to consider the money bomb

2536
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:01,568
Already did and it's done over the years with

2537
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:04,640
Predate the time. This spreadsheet cover

2538
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:06,432
Money isn't reflected anywhere

2539
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:08,224
I can't

2540
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:08,992
Prove this

2541
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:14,624
But my best guess is that this Saturday to reflect the migration of sales to a different account than they were

2542
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,648
Previously counted in

2543
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:17,952
I can only theorize on this point but

2544
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:20,256
This document begins

2545
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:22,304
Literally at the exact same time

2546
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:26,144
The 10% the owner of Midas resources in Genesis Communications

2547
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,936
Which syndicate's Alex's show and was it

2548
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:32,032
His primary sponsor was in court dealing with a case that would lead to him losing his license

2549
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:33,056
So precious metals

2550
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:36,640
Began on September 11th 2015

2551
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:40,224
Announces money bomb in 2015 was on September 16th

2552
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:45,344
Azerite it's very difficult for me to believe that this timing isn't a coincidence

2553
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,136
Plausible to me

2554
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:49,696
The prior to Ted's legal problems coming to a head

2555
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:52,768
Their finances might have been more intertwined than you would expect

2556
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:55,840
And after Ted was no longer able to engage in his primary business

2557
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:58,656
Infowars started keeping their finances much more stepper

2558
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:05,312
Very basic level they raised about a million dollars in that money bomb and that money is absolutely not reflected

2559
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:06,080
Cinema spreadsheet

2560
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:07,360
Even though in theory

2561
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:09,664
It does cover the time. After

2562
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,968
It should be

2563
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:16,320
Another thing that's important to remember is it's a spreadsheet is barely labeled at all

2564
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:18,880
And it's really up to the person looking at it trying to do some

2565
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:20,416
Exactly what these numbers show

2566
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:24,256
Princeton's one column says total sales but nowhere in this document is

2567
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:26,304
Explain what this is a total sales of

2568
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:31,680
It's assumed that this is the total sales from the Infowars store but that's not concretely shown in the document.

2569
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:32,448
Itself

2570
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:35,008
It's a pretty good assumption that this is showing Infowars

2571
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,544
Store sales

2572
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,080
It's still a little bit of an

2573
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:41,920
One point I want to make about the Huffington Post article is that

2574
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:42,944
Context is

2575
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:46,272
For instance the article contains this paragraph

2576
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:49,600
The gamble of backing Trump appeared to pay off

2577
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:56,256
Of the more than three years of data reviewed by HuffPost Infowars most profitable days happens around the 2016

2578
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,280
Presidential election

2579
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:02,400
The day of the election November 8th and forced or more than doubled its sales from the previous day

2580
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:04,704
Making a total of $660,000

2581
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:10,336
Next day after Trump won more than 8,700 orders were placed in the Infowars website

2582
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:11,872
Totaling nearly 850

2583
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:12,640
$2,000

2584
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:16,736
It's fine to connect the surgeon sales to supporting Trump

2585
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:18,528
But it's also important to point out the

2586
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:19,808
The Infowars did a.50

2587
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:21,600
You two hour marathon over the course

2588
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:22,368
Those days

2589
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:24,672
Which probably has an increase in sales

2590
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:26,464
I bet you know what that have that impact

2591
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:27,744
That is unimportant

2592
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,792
Context to why the sales are so hot

2593
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:30,816
Yeah it is

2594
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:35,424
Is it is it was weird cuz I couldn't read the I mean obviously the

2595
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:36,960
Conceit of our show bike ride

2596
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:41,568
He couldn't avoid seeing some of the numbers and then going over like

2597
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:44,640
We talked about him during that time.

2598
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:48,992
And seem like little things that don't quite make sense in in that

2599
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:50,528
You know

2600
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:52,064
I think that's

2601
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,344
No

2602
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:57,440
Scents that I get from it is

2603
02:07:57,696 --> 02:07:58,208
Like

2604
02:07:58,464 --> 02:07:59,744
Okay this is interesting

2605
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,792
Probably a minimum

2606
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:07,936
Yeah but it's a minimum but then also there's there's obviously expenses that are taken out

2607
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:13,824
Translating glimpse

2608
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:15,872
But I also don't think it

2609
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:18,176
I think it raises more questions than it answers

2610
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:20,224
I mean your

2611
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:20,992
You're right

2612
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,528
It seems low

2613
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,064
It seems low

2614
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:27,136
Time. Before this you still making it

2615
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:33,536
Imani group in the supplements was going back to at least 2013

2616
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:36,608
Remind I remember

2617
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:37,632
Actor Group B

2618
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:39,424
Very happy

2619
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:42,752
I think there is a broader picture

2620
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:44,288
That that

2621
02:08:45,312 --> 02:08:46,336
Is not available

2622
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:48,128
From the information that right now

2623
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,920
And I would be interested

2624
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,736
More information as it comes out

2625
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:56,576
I do think that the timing of this document starting

2626
02:08:57,088 --> 02:09:01,184
Lost his license

2627
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:08,864
If it's a coincidence it's an amazing coincidence

2628
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,400
A very lucky one

2629
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:11,424
Into

2630
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:13,216
So Alex

2631
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:14,496
Rant about money

2632
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:15,264
Of course

2633
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:18,080
Look

2634
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:19,104
Really want

2635
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:26,784
Last year we sold $30 worth of food

2636
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,064
What's the

2637
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:29,088
Million

2638
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:32,160
Doesn't matter what we're doing

2639
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:33,952
Show my house

2640
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:37,024
Coupon the money into this

2641
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:44,448
Ashamed of money

2642
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:55,200
My mission is not to just have a bunch of money

2643
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:01,856
My mission is to build an infrastructure to resist the New World Order

2644
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:08,256
I only want to make money to build an anti New World Order infrastructure

2645
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:10,816
Like Alex having to distinguish between which of his multiple

2646
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:12,608
Houses he allegedly had to sell

2647
02:10:12,864 --> 02:10:15,424
To stay on a property let's

2648
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:20,544
Literature that we all know that it was money he spent on a home no one could live in

2649
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:24,640
The fact that he was able to sell this house is clear evidence that he never actually needed it to

2650
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:26,944
Begin with but there was something about having both

2651
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,480
People houses that was appealing to him

2652
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:32,832
Maybe was the luxury of it maybe was a convenience or like easy

2653
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:34,368
The investing aspect of it

2654
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:35,648
But whatever the case

2655
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:39,232
This was achievable only because of the money he brings in from the show

2656
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:42,304
That money could easily have gone towards this infrastructure he's

2657
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:46,656
Pretending to be building but Alex prioritize things like having multiple homes or buying a tank

2658
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:49,472
For having the ridiculous gun collection that he has

2659
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:56,128
You can claim that he wants this building a new world order infrastructure that's great but honestly it's just a way to keep the audience pacified

2660
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:57,152
About how much money you got

2661
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:57,920
We bring in

2662
02:10:58,176 --> 02:11:00,992
No it's not going to an anti New World Order infrastructure

2663
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:02,528
Unless it's code for his lawyer

2664
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:04,832
You know it's just

2665
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:08,416
It's just great when you're populist leader as a room

2666
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:09,696
Where everything's made of

2667
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:12,000
If gold it just makes you feel like yeah

2668
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:13,280
On brand

2669
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:16,352
Alex

2670
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:19,424
Is kind of spiritually correct

2671
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:21,216
I have heard him

2672
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:23,776
Say that they make like millions of dollars

2673
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:31,456
I don't think he has like 50 million a year

2674
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:32,224
Close to what

2675
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:33,248
Excited

2676
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:36,064
He has said the dates a lot of stuff

2677
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:43,232
But at such a discount you're still getting high quality products

2678
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:44,000
Yeah

2679
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:45,536
I don't know

2680
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,352
There is a middle ground

2681
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:50,144
Is accurate

2682
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,168
You still lying a little bit

2683
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:55,264
How honest he is been about

2684
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,800
He's not lying totally

2685
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:57,568
He has

2686
02:11:57,824 --> 02:11:58,336
Talked about

2687
02:11:58,592 --> 02:11:59,360
But bring in a lot of money

2688
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:02,176
Defensively had

2689
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:03,712
Say

2690
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:05,760
Listen I do have a s*** ton of money

2691
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:07,040
But it's cool

2692
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:13,952
This is the first time I think I've heard him say that he hits his second home

2693
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:16,256
You just say I'm selling my house

2694
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,536
Yeah yeah

2695
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:21,888
Yeah anyway I'll be gets into the actual Huffington Post story itself

2696
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:23,168
And he gets a

2697
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,448
Few details wrong

2698
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:34,944
Big Tex has trillions in spies on you and sells your data and sensors you

2699
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:36,480
Good big Shaq

2700
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:38,272
Was there jumbo Jackson

2701
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:42,880
Google has more than 20 people worth over 50 billion dollars

2702
02:12:43,648 --> 02:12:45,184
That's okay

2703
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,560
Look at this

2704
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:55,168
Made

2705
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:56,448
They think you're so stupid

2706
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:00,544
You mean the word is gross

2707
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:04,896
165 million over 3 years

2708
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:06,944
Little exaggerated

2709
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:12,064
Jones has 165 billion dollars

2710
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:16,416
I'm curious about

2711
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:18,720
Fairly accurate

2712
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,256
That's it that's interesting

2713
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:22,304
I don't know if I believe that

2714
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:24,864
These are the numbers that I gave them

2715
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:26,400
And they're fairly accurate

2716
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:32,800
Fairly accurate considering it's the information that you gave

2717
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:33,824
Is a little strange

2718
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:36,384
Also the article doesn't say that

2719
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:38,688
He has 165 million dollars that's

2720
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:42,272
Hawaii that Alex is using to a straw ban if you will

2721
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:44,832
And also it doesn't you needs to give it

2722
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:49,952
But also look this article has some unintended

2723
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:50,720
Sconces

2724
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:52,512
And here's one of them

2725
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:55,328
Servitude Christian broadcast

2726
02:13:55,584 --> 02:14:00,192
Run businesses in a million dollars

2727
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:01,728
10000

2728
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:16,320
Oh my God

2729
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:17,088
Ariel

2730
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:18,880
Unreal

2731
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:35,520
Like Scrooge McDuck in DuckTales diving into gold

2732
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:40,128
Vizzini's money anybody knows if he's got your money

2733
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:41,408
This is how you do it

2734
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,688
Yeah yeah

2735
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:45,248
Like this comes out he's like oh yeah

2736
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,040
F*** you I'm going to Alberta

2737
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:52,160
But why why would you think that this would affect him like

2738
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:56,000
Yeah what point do you see a televangelist with their own

2739
02:14:56,256 --> 02:14:57,024
Jet

2740
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:03,168
Before you go oh they don't care if they're rich

2741
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:04,960
The Post article was till like

2742
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:09,568
Information

2743
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:16,224
That response if you want to make more money though it says

2744
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:20,576
To be outraged you bestowed are you

2745
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:21,600
Crush me with

2746
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:22,880
Response

2747
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:24,928
I'm going to raise more money

2748
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:26,720
That's cool

2749
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:27,744
Alex

2750
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,280
Goes out to break

2751
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:30,304
This is disgust

2752
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:33,120
Message great part about it is

2753
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:35,936
There isn't any money

2754
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,752
That's why they're so pissed

2755
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:52,576
I'm look

2756
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:54,880
Essentially laughing

2757
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:55,904
At the Sandy Hooks

2758
02:15:56,672 --> 02:15:57,952
That's that's basically what

2759
02:15:58,464 --> 02:16:03,840
He's laughing now you're never going to get any money even

2760
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:07,680
Emancipated

2761
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:09,728
Is this a bad mentality it's

2762
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:11,008
It's a mark of a disgusting

2763
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,800
It is it is

2764
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:13,568
Super villain

2765
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:20,992
It is really really f***** up it's it's literally in a movie whenever you finally get to the bad guy

2766
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:23,552
And they've stolen all your gold and then they're like huh

2767
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:27,648
I scattered to the Four Winds you have lost your life

2768
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:29,184
That's it

2769
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:33,536
So look Alex is going to take a week off

2770
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:35,328
I thought you going to take the rest of his life off

2771
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:38,144
But he's

2772
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:39,168
But this article is

2773
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:39,936
Changed

2774
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:47,872
I'm not taking off down I'm not coming in here and I'm not wanted

2775
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,808
Home sales pay that officer sign

2776
02:16:57,344 --> 02:16:57,856
Projects

2777
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:10,144
Televangelism

2778
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:17,056
Seriously

2779
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:21,408
Exhausted

2780
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:31,648
Wow no vacation

2781
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:35,488
Classic Jim Bakker I'd like those were the days when Jim Bakker would be like

2782
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:43,936
You're going to give me more money okay fine man

2783
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:47,008
Committed fraud you guys got to give me money to come in

2784
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:48,032
Yeah

2785
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:49,568
It's pretty fun

2786
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:50,592
I would say that

2787
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:51,360
Based on

2788
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:54,944
Is the temperature around Infowars prior to this

2789
02:17:55,200 --> 02:18:01,344
And how Alex was quitting a bit and storming off air and he started this episode off by saying everyone needed to Diane

2790
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:03,136
Walk around the park

2791
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:08,256
Vacations probably not the best idea

2792
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:10,816
He forces himself

2793
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:12,864
To come in to raise this $3000000

2794
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:13,632
He might be

2795
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:16,448
Everyday is that next week it could be a struggle

2796
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:17,728
I could be a struggle

2797
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:18,496
Bible

2798
02:18:18,752 --> 02:18:22,080
Irene is he's kind of a little bit like

2799
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:25,920
While you're listening to this you have to be like I better give Alec

2800
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:27,200
Like some money otherwise he's go

2801
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:30,272
Keep telling me I deserve to die

2802
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:34,624
And that makes me feel bad but I don't like being told I deserve to die

2803
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:35,392
Flies

2804
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:36,160
Something out

2805
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:39,488
I don't want to be a dick I'm not saying this article is bad

2806
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:41,024
At all

2807
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:44,864
Criticism

2808
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:51,264
Are perhaps interpretations of information from this that I've seen on Twitter and on social media

2809
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:54,592
You're nitpicking

2810
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:55,872
No that's it

2811
02:18:56,128 --> 02:19:00,224
There is an accuracy in the article and I have to give it up to Alex he is

2812
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:01,504
Totally correct

2813
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:06,880
As much as I do we can barely pay the bill Jones told the caller on Thursday during a segment

2814
02:19:08,416 --> 02:19:08,928
Prompting

2815
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:13,792
Not going to stop

2816
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:16,096
I need your help Frank

2817
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,120
I need your help

2818
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:20,192
Oh okay

2819
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:26,592
That's absolutely correct.

2820
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:33,760
That's why I said that on Thursday

2821
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:35,296
Play that commercial

2822
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:36,320
Yeah that's alright

2823
02:19:39,904 --> 02:19:46,048
Breaking bad but still not saying Thursday I mean you didn't say it Thursday but he did say it

2824
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:50,144
I have to give it up when Alex says something that is actually

2825
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:52,960
So look

2826
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:53,984
Trump

2827
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:57,056
He's trying to eat you know he's trying to make you social media thing he raised

2828
02:19:57,312 --> 02:19:58,080
The billion dollars

2829
02:19:58,336 --> 02:19:59,872
Imagine what I want to do with them

2830
02:20:00,128 --> 02:20:00,640
Billion dollars

2831
02:20:01,408 --> 02:20:03,456
$400,000 in my bank account

2832
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:06,016
Which operation is biggest

2833
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:10,368
The future in operate

2834
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:16,256
Social network

2835
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:20,608
Dollars

2836
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:24,192
I don't have money

2837
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:32,384
Can have them give them

2838
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:43,136
Weird voice

2839
02:20:48,256 --> 02:20:52,096
Got to get pissed

2840
02:20:52,352 --> 02:20:55,680
Billion dollars today

2841
02:20:56,192 --> 02:21:00,800
Familiar

2842
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:13,088
So the first hour of the show is an outburst

2843
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:14,112
And then

2844
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:15,392
Teasing too

2845
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:18,464
Announce the Tucker Carlson's the most important person in the world

2846
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:22,048
Then the second hour is largely an ad for Gap

2847
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:24,096
I'm sorry not gator

2848
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:26,400
Don't start with G and do the same thing

2849
02:21:26,912 --> 02:21:29,984
November 3rd hour has become

2850
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:30,752
Alex

2851
02:21:31,264 --> 02:21:34,848
This article by screaming about needing money

2852
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:38,688
This show is worthwhile

2853
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:39,968
I'm starting to think

2854
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:41,248
That the reason he took

2855
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:46,112
Such a long time in that first hour was because you really it's it's kind of thin

2856
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,928
I think it might be a little thin

2857
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:52,512
I wonder if almost like this news broke

2858
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:53,792
HuffPost

2859
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:55,840
Thank God

2860
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:58,912
I could see him being like that I'm about this

2861
02:21:59,168 --> 02:21:59,680
Material

2862
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:01,984
To look we we make jokes

2863
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,032
Redo

2864
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:04,800
That's something we do

2865
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:10,944
And storming off his show

2866
02:22:11,456 --> 02:22:11,968
Then look

2867
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:13,248
There's only one reason that

2868
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:15,552
Cuz of you

2869
02:22:16,064 --> 02:22:16,832
Cuz of the greatness

2870
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:21,696
It's cuz he loves the crew

2871
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:29,376
Show many deals lined up and so many big

2872
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:30,400
Things ready to go

2873
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:36,032
You ain't shut nothing up

2874
02:22:37,056 --> 02:22:37,824
You not shut

2875
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:38,592
Jack

2876
02:22:39,616 --> 02:22:41,152
God

2877
02:22:41,408 --> 02:22:42,944
Besides my heart goes out

2878
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:44,992
I can't imagine

2879
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:49,088
Anybody having an offer for Alex like what he's going to get a shoe deal

2880
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:49,856
Have no idea

2881
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:50,624
What are you

2882
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:56,256
You talking about unemployable by anybody else he's not even allowed to visit

2883
02:22:56,768 --> 02:22:57,792
His best friend

2884
02:22:58,048 --> 02:22:59,584
It the Fox News Studio

2885
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:02,144
You're not allowed in there he's also

2886
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:05,984
Apparently not able to be on his other best friend

2887
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:06,752
Chocolate

2888
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:09,056
I don't do the people who love him

2889
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:15,200
I don't think he's employable YouTube I like oan no absolutely not

2890
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:18,528
He's not employable he can only beat his own boss

2891
02:23:20,832 --> 02:23:21,344
The worst

2892
02:23:21,856 --> 02:23:23,392
I don't think it would be interesting

2893
02:23:23,648 --> 02:23:29,792
For anyone to like give a book deal no I can't imagine

2894
02:23:30,304 --> 02:23:33,632
The only thing you could do is if you're like a venture capitalist billionaire

2895
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:34,912
Who wants to be like

2896
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:35,680
Alright

2897
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:39,776
There's a lot of money you be weird

2898
02:23:40,032 --> 02:23:42,592
Yeah it has to be like I hate no-strings-attached

2899
02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:44,896
Figure out what you're going to do because

2900
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:49,504
You can't and if you was going to do that why wouldn't you do that within the

2901
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:51,552
Reset

2902
02:23:51,808 --> 02:23:52,576
Talk about that

2903
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:56,928
Even though it was the most important thing he's ever done. It ran out of

2904
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:58,208
Steam real quick

2905
02:23:58,464 --> 02:24:00,256
We'll get to that eventually I promise

2906
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:03,584
January 6th

2907
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:05,888
Bad the daily interest

2908
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:06,656
Expatriates

2909
02:24:06,912 --> 02:24:07,680
Beautiful people

2910
02:24:08,192 --> 02:24:08,704
Happily fam

2911
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:11,520
Did you know it's also Alex's wedding

2912
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:12,288
Anniversary

2913
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:13,568
I did not know that

2914
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:16,896
Globalization

2915
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:20,480
Democratic party all dressed up as right now

2916
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:23,296
There when I got married

2917
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:24,576
On January 6th

2918
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:29,184
My new wife was pregnant with our wonderful daughter this morning

2919
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:35,328
I want to be out of enforce in 5 years

2920
02:24:39,936 --> 02:24:43,264
God has really touched my heart

2921
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:45,312
The other leaders

2922
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:49,152
And just people that are going to stand up and wake up my wife look

2923
02:24:50,432 --> 02:24:50,944
Big Island

2924
02:24:51,712 --> 02:24:52,224
Bad job

2925
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:55,040
Four Seasons

2926
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:55,808
Oh my God

2927
02:24:57,088 --> 02:25:00,416
Joe Rogan

2928
02:25:01,184 --> 02:25:02,208
The Joe Rogan

2929
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:04,000
It is going to be the guy

2930
02:25:04,512 --> 02:25:06,560
Havana Joe Rogan will be my successor

2931
02:25:06,816 --> 02:25:08,608
So if I understand correctly

2932
02:25:09,632 --> 02:25:10,144
On

2933
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,424
His fourth

2934
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,704
Wedding anniversary

2935
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:15,264
He was at the overthrow of the cap

2936
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:18,336
From what I understand I think his wife was there too

2937
02:25:18,592 --> 02:25:19,616
The Great

2938
02:25:19,872 --> 02:25:24,992
I might be off on that breaker

2939
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:26,272
Her being there

2940
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:28,832
But look good and also let's not forget

2941
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:33,184
The day we started our show was it was his wedding day

2942
02:25:33,696 --> 02:25:39,840
This is too weird this is getting too weird.

2943
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:41,120
Simulation as f***

2944
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:45,728
5 years ago freaking me out man it's freaking me out

2945
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,264
So

2946
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,312
Is

2947
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:50,592
Man

2948
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:52,384
What it what what are we doing

2949
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:54,688
No idea

2950
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:56,992
So look and wanted you wanted to quit

2951
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:01,856
Because Rogan will carry the mantle

2952
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:04,160
And so I told her I said

2953
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:05,952
I said within five years

2954
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:11,840
One film a year

2955
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:14,400
Cuz I really want transition out of this

2956
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:16,448
We're five years later

2957
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:18,240
Book a year anniversary

2958
02:26:23,872 --> 02:26:24,384
A lighter

2959
02:26:28,992 --> 02:26:29,760
Is that cuz you guys got married

2960
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:32,320
Promises

2961
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:34,112
I don't know

2962
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:34,880
But

2963
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:36,672
We're winning

2964
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:37,440
Okay

2965
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:39,232
What

2966
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:45,632
What was that you said I never break my promises and then use you if you revealed that you broke your promise

2967
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:46,400
My wedding

2968
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:48,960
Wow that was

2969
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:49,728
That was

2970
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:54,848
Weird that was a deeply personal moment that I did not need to know him

2971
02:26:55,872 --> 02:26:57,920
The Patriots

2972
02:27:02,528 --> 02:27:04,320
Yeah it's been 5 years

2973
02:27:04,576 --> 02:27:07,392
And that's when his timeline

2974
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:09,952
Was that he was going to quit right they told his wife

2975
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:11,488
Opening never breaks promises right

2976
02:27:11,744 --> 02:27:14,048
Implication here is I'm f****** out of here

2977
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:17,120
Yeah that seems to be the application it's the only of

2978
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:20,704
Let's try and Trace the emotional

2979
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:22,752
Through this episode

2980
02:27:23,008 --> 02:27:28,640
You're all going to die again all deserve to die I got to walk around the parking lot

2981
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:32,992
Tucker Carlson's the most important person in the world and if you understand this

2982
02:27:33,504 --> 02:27:34,784
You understand everything

2983
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:36,576
Gator is very exciting

2984
02:27:36,832 --> 02:27:39,648
It's super exciting

2985
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:42,464
The globalist publishing this article about how I make money

2986
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:46,816
I'm going to make a lot more money but also I got a quick I got to get out of here

2987
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:52,704
So we're going to be plugging non-stop for the next week I'm quitting this show I promised my wife I would

2988
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:57,824
We are going to be doing nothing with plugin for the next week and there's no one to give the

2989
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:59,872
Show to just Jo Rogue

2990
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:02,944
He's not going to take a shower

2991
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:06,272
Somewhere else in house everybody stop everybody sucks

2992
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:14,208
Going into something big

2993
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:16,512
Metamorphosis just happening and I

2994
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:20,864
Quite sure until I go through that psychic wall when it is but I know it's bad

2995
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:23,168
I know it's a big cat

2996
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:24,448
And I'm going to follow

2997
02:28:25,216 --> 02:28:25,728
I'm going to do it

2998
02:28:26,496 --> 02:28:27,008
But it

2999
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:28,544
Picture word of mouth

3000
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:31,872
Your financial support

3001
02:28:33,152 --> 02:28:36,992
Tweet today I'm unfortunately the last time

3002
02:28:44,672 --> 02:28:45,440
Well above

3003
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:10,784
And don't worry though I'll fake cry

3004
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:15,392
As their houses burn down

3005
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:16,928
Just like a f****** decision

3006
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:22,816
We're don't don't do this we're going to be gone and be gone in a year

3007
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:24,352
I'm so tired of this game

3008
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:25,888
He is in and out game

3009
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:28,192
So many corporations that would

3010
02:29:28,448 --> 02:29:33,312
Kill to be able to get away with an ad pitch that's just if you don't buy this you're going to

3011
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:35,872
To die if you don't eat dinner

3012
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:42,272
Second we go off the air the lights go out in your f****** death

3013
02:29:42,784 --> 02:29:43,552
You're going to die

3014
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:46,880
The only reason that the globalist are at Bay

3015
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:53,280
I'm not killing you and your family is because I only two sitting right here which you won't be in a little bit

3016
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:56,096
Just walk around the park or things

3017
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:58,912
He's not going to be there to protect

3018
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:01,472
And I mean he did plan to take next week

3019
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:06,592
And he's not doing that he's not so you can buy more things now to keep him from

3020
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:07,616
Leaving

3021
02:30:08,128 --> 02:30:09,664
We have one last clip here

3022
02:30:10,176 --> 02:30:10,688
And

3023
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:13,760
This is so much of a bummer

3024
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:16,320
I told my daughter

3025
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:19,648
Particular

3026
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:21,184
Play some

3027
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:25,280
You want to go to this kind of music

3028
02:30:35,776 --> 02:30:37,824
I'm going to go home tonight I'm going to tell her sorry honey

3029
02:30:41,408 --> 02:30:42,176
Because

3030
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:46,016
And we're going to come in here with a focus

3031
02:30:50,368 --> 02:30:52,928
For like 2 hours and shove that up the New World Order

3032
02:30:56,256 --> 02:30:59,072
What happens when you mess with Alex's he disappoints his daughter

3033
02:30:59,328 --> 02:31:00,096
My

3034
02:31:00,352 --> 02:31:02,144
If you don't buy my products

3035
02:31:03,168 --> 02:31:04,448
You're going to die

3036
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:06,496
But more importantly

3037
02:31:06,752 --> 02:31:08,288
If you don't buy my products

3038
02:31:08,544 --> 02:31:14,432
Have a good day also would think that this story flies always keeps

3039
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:20,832
Promises

3040
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:24,672
I mean I can't imagine

3041
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:28,000
Dad can we go to the music but you know what

3042
02:31:29,024 --> 02:31:35,168
Yes and then a little bit later so I have to fight the devil

3043
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:38,752
Butterfly daughter

3044
02:31:39,008 --> 02:31:42,336
That's okay that's just the way it is

3045
02:31:42,848 --> 02:31:46,688
What a what a whirlwind of a couple days

3046
02:31:48,480 --> 02:31:50,016
Emotionally spent

3047
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:53,856
The track of these two days

3048
02:31:54,624 --> 02:32:00,768
Definitely won't be remembered nearly as much as the previous January 6th

3049
02:32:03,072 --> 02:32:04,352
Stupid in its own right

3050
02:32:04,608 --> 02:32:06,144
Is it it's not

3051
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:07,680
The capital Has Fallen

3052
02:32:08,192 --> 02:32:09,984
But it is

3053
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:13,056
The most important person and my daughter said

3054
02:32:13,312 --> 02:32:14,848
Your fault

3055
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:18,176
Only people that bought more products

3056
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:20,224
I'm sorry

3057
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:23,296
We have

3058
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:25,600
Website

3059
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:32,000
Dot-com

3060
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:33,792
Bell Ruckus

3061
02:32:35,328 --> 02:32:36,096
What the sex robot

3062
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:44,288
Alexandra Thurston color
