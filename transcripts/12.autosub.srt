00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,872
Too much Alex Jones in particular

3
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,664
And I have no idea what the

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:19,968
Rango

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,552
Much like a wrestler out there on the on the plane

6
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,464
Clips from Publix Wild

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,560
And that brutal

8
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,376
Discuss the implications of the insanity

9
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,984
To be found therein I'd like to thank everybody who is following us on Twitter

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,712
Statistically speaking yes lost them all whatever you did that last bit right

13
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
What language is that from Kansas

14
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,536
I tell you what

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,704
Slack-jawed Hillbillies I used to do karaoke with

16
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,288
For what episode

17
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:22,688
In the whole time not once just put up the episode in character the next

18
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
Episode again

19
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
Never mentioned that donate to patreon a picture

20
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
Fire hillbilly episode

21
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
News radio episodes were suddenly they were on the Titanic

22
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
Hillbillies season finale to a knowledge fight

23
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,728
Cuz we're not sure we're getting picked up for another season

24
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
Well we might die

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,848
Neither is America America's not sure yet whether or not we're going to do things

26
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
Until FairPoint

27
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
The studios

28
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
Still talkin

29
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
It's

30
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
It's going to be a fight

31
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,064
But much like Billy episode special episode

32
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,696
The David light episode that we did had no Alex in it

33
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
No no tragically

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
There's a little Alex

35
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,936
Magically have no Alex in it

36
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,312
Denoted is a tragedy no matter how good this goes

37
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128
Okay that's a good point

38
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,688
This is a situation where

39
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
Alex everyday

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
I've mentioned this before every day

41
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
Leaves

42
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,368
During 4th hour

43
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Someone else

00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,448
Who is hosting the fourth hour called No More fake news

50
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,240
Dot-com

51
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,104
Why would you can go to and it looks like an angel cities paid

52
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,456
It looks like something from their Myspace

53
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,272
Like a very old clunky bad looking site

54
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
D-Link

55
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,904
To a number of things or you know they're fake news

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
This is

57
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
Underground

58
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
Reality coming directly

59
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024

HIV causes AIDS

65
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,360
He's a guy who has some literal belief in The Matrix

66
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,224
These sorts of things are you can pay $125

67
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,296
And he will send you a huge 10-hour presentation

68

On any of these

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
For an hourly rate

70
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
That's not good

71
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Labor to bring you these

72
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Conspiracy theory

73
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
Do you like

00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:21,375
Lest we go down this path Flushing

00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
Fire website

86
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,263

00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Broadcast

88
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
Into Alex's show I'm going to post

00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:35,199
A picture of what it looks like when he's broadcasting over on our new Tumblr

00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
I'll post a picture of Jon rappoport

The bottom

94
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,975
Left hand side of the screen

95
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
There's a picture

96
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
A framed picture

97
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,423
And it's been sitting for about 9 months

98
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
If you watch

99
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,031
If you watch him regularly

100
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
The same place

101
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,175
The entire time

102
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
You just dismembered put it up

00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,999
So anyway John Rappaport gets in there and he

That is being broadcast on the air

124
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
Is a parable

125
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
I feel like I'm going

126
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
Figure it out real quick

127
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,311
I think it's time now we've established our format

128
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
And you know we're pretty comfortable

129
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,431
That it might be time to start dipping our toe into

00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711

Offended by stuff

00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,215
And then what's going to happen is you're going to have to

185
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
He's describing

186
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639

00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
So I'm assuming

194
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
It's I think it's amazing

195
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,847
Making about only spelling bee related issues on

196
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:28,735
I think maybe he was in a spelling bee years ago or whatever

197
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,063
Based on this report he was not good at spelling

198
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:36,159
It's something it's a mix between the comfort room that you're describing in like a chill out

199
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
It's somewhere in the middle there buddy

200
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Nothing

201
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Also

202
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,959
Even if it did it's not a bad thing it sounds pretty awesome

203
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,055
I was like wait

204
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
You know what

205
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Instead of getting angry and

206
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:59,711
Projecting this outward I'm going to go to this room over here where I get my

207
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
Ya know I've been

208
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
This whole thing is invalidated I want those before we go any further we will them

209
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
A higher institution of learning

210
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
Many colleges

211
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:21,215
Corsica

212
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,823
You know people are just boggled by this

213
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,127
What are you stupid

214
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
Did you ask that all the time don't you

215
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,551
Yeah that's

216
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
No longer

217
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,951
What is this

218
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
What it what is this rap

219
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:48,863
Character of it

220
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,287
6070 year old guy

221
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
The changing evolution of culture

222
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:05,247
Like people having a greater understanding of each other to angry old man on a rack

223
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
We're about to dive into

224
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,975
Spirit but it's being presented as

225
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
Yeah it's the truth

226
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
It's not a light

227
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:25,215
Like if on your local news channel instead of meteorology was just as old dude

228
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Just gone

229
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,055
Well my joints are swelling up so we all know what that

230
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:35,455
Mandalorian for a good so probably going to be wet later and we're getting closer and closer

231
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
Billy dad.

232
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
I have a difficulty getting

233
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,695
Hillbilly pocket and not going to the Bayou close

234
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
It's real touch-and-go but so

235
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
The thing that offends

236
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
Give me a little bit about

237
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Just the beginning of it

238
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Is that

239
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
He's not a

240
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
He should be

241
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,263
If he believes what he saying

242
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,383
He's at he is going to reading it like one of those 60 Minutes producer

243
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
He's giving you that like

244
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
Screen of abject

245
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
Activity

246
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
The passion listen

247
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
Observer reporting that other

248
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
By what Young

249
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:20,767
Yeah it is cowardly Dodge

250
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
But you still

251
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
It's still a little vague what he's trying to

252
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,775
Space space

253
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
How did it start

254
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:43,295
White people in the shadows for a couple years

255
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,927
Have yourself is lurking around of the Shadows

256
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
Shut up

257
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,815
We know he's not dressing up as like

258
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
Excuse me fellow College

259
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
How are you today

260
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,775
Normal Age based Soul Man

261
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,359
But also it's never been kissing

262
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,175
He's doing the Never Been Kissed thing also

263
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Rapport

264
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:17,599
Stop lurking in Shadows put that goddamn picture also if you've seen what he looks like

265
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,719
You know you don't want him lurking Shadows anywhere

266
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
No

267
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,839
Metaphorically but Tuesday

268
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Rapport

269
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,543
Is better for openly starts out evil

270
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
Piling up information on Dish

271
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
And I needed a few final pieces and I finally got them

272
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,647
NFL lunch place so I'm going to tell you

273
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
Play where all the stuff came from

274
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,559
National Alliance on Mental Illness

275
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
Comes this

276
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Statistic

277
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
20%

278
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,335
Of all college students in the US

279
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,687
Have either been diagnosed with a mental disorder

280
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
Or treated for a mental disorder

281
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
Before

282
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Across the u.s.

283
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
In college or College

284
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
Okay I have a number of things

285
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
To do bunk that

286
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Yeah

287
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
I can't

288
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
That National Association of mental illness

289
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,127
But I can't trust their sourcing

290
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
I have no idea

291
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
But like

292
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
You I don't know where you're going to get that information

293
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
From number one

294
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
Number two

295
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
Can't you knock

296
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,647
It seems like a lot of it would have privacy issues

297
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:02,047
What would you go to

298
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Because here's the bigger picture

299
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,167
That number if it does exist for statistic

300
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,983
Hacks to by definition includes

301
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
People who are seeking behaviors

302
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
People who were going to try and get

303
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,615
Adderal and s*** like that

304
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,199
Yeah I have to include that subset of the population

305
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,759
Yeah it also has to include anybody who

306
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,575
Gone and gotten

307
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,951
They just go in and get my health center and then don't pursue it

308
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
That one in four statistic is meaningless

309
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,631
No it seems like it's very very scary I was going to go with its back

310
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
Let's flip this one in four

311
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Dorian Ford

312
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:47,871
Which who the f*** are those kids getting through that s*** every ever been to college

313
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:54,271
So like this

314
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,831
Creepy man lurking in the shadows

315
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,671
Paranoid delusion about that

316
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,255
Xanax to get through the rest of your life after you see this man

317
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
It's a meaningless

318
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
Statistic for those reasons

319
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
VIP of people going to

320
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
To try and get pills

321
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
I know what number of people

322
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
Did my college days

323
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
After college days

324
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:24,991
Yellow days of me who is constantly looking for pills

325
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,783
Crazy meme

326
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Who that girl

327
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
Is included in that 25

328
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,207
It's like you need to be a little bit more specific

329
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
With your numbers

330
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Or else your

331
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,119
To be as big as possible in order to scare as many people as you

332
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,679
You can't exactly

333
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
No more fake news

334
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,567
Sell like Survival Products

335
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,615
Spells

336
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,759
Continuing to get polio vaccine

337
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,343
Sinclair

338
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,007
Universities have been turned into psychiatric clinics

339
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
Shaky

340
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
That conclusion does not follow from the premise

341
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:34,111
All colleges

342
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Are psychiatric

343
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Okay

344
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:42,047
Great Jon rappoport colleges should have

345
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,959
Now if you are turning all colleges

346
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
To psychiatric

347
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
The clinic

348
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,871
I don't think so either but

349
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,991
I think he thinks it's like

350
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
Arkham City

351
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,087
All colleges are Arkham

352
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
If he is

353
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:12,767
Continuing

354
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:18,911
Call dr. Hugo Strange in Batman

355
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
I mean come on

356
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
That's the story

357
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
That's the underlying story

358
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,735
For clinical depression or bipolar

359
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,783
Or you know whatever it is

360
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,391
And the treatment was highly

361
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,207
Highly active toxic trucks

362
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
Back in my day we used to

363
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Hit people

364
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
How to get a spanking

365
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,679
Jimboy's

366
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
The p****

367
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,799
That's why I that's why I

368
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,783
Tell me I shouldn't hit my kids no you don't see the problem

369
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,927
When those boys came back from World War

370
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,511
I mean to kill themselves and never spoke about it again already

371
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:22,911
Everything like that matter

372
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
Superman in there were fewer of

373
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,895
That creates a complete culture of victimhood

374
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,711
I don't care what Hillary Clinton

375
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
Advocates or

376
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,319
Creepy laugh

377
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:45,695
Consider themselves

378
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,535
And so what's the next step

379
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:55,423
Because

380
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
Wait was that him staying

381
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
Use roleplay

382
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
Alright but it's also a little chicken egg

383
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
You know the man

384
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
It's like

385
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,991
What does diagnosis and now you're a victim so you can excuse all your behaviors like

386
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Maybe

387
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,599
Knossos was I suffered from panic attacks we couldn't leave my house

388
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
Does he think

389
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,720
People are being triggered without having anything to trigger

390
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
I'm like the whole point of

391
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,072
Let me know that trigger warning is

392
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,264
And this will bring up those bad memory right it's the idea of you you were sexually assaulted and

393
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,544
Hear some graphic content

394
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Describing a sexual assault

395
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,944
You don't want to preserve spaces are like

396
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,784
You don't have to deal

397
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,344
You're in a situation where

398
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,904
People who are on

399
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
You weren't on the level

400
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
We're going to just get in the way

401
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Exclude

402
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,608
0 train cars that are safe space

403
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
Let's put it that way

404
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Absolutely

405
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,472
I don't know look I don't want to sit here it understands

406
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,032
The entirety of safespace trigger warning culture

407
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
But I know that it's based on something

408
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,664
And it's not crazy people know based on people being oppressed

409
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
It's based on

410
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Taking

411
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
Things that are being forced

412
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Stop on other

413
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,136
The people most against that whole concept

414
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
A trigger warning

415
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
Generally cause p

416
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
I'm off the hook

417
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:34,496
Problems studying don't know who or how to introduce myself

418
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,640
Kid doesn't know what to do all of this

419
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Got the answer

420
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,576
Because these problems

421
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:53,184
Or the infirmary whatever in the first place and then all of a sudden before he knew it

422
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:59,072
Fourth we ask you a few questions

423
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
Or psychologist

424
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,288
Always a good idea if you feel like you need to see if the house or psychiatrist

425
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
Go see one Church of good idea

426
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,896
It's never a bad idea

427
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,944
Which is never the case

428
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,552
No one ever unless you're like suicidal or you're threatening to hurt somebody

429
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,136
No one ever forces you to go see a therapist

430
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
Yeah

431
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
Literally illegal

432
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:31,328
Idea about therapy and psychiatric help that is like

433
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:36,960
You go in for a little minor problem that's when they Shanghai

434
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,056
Is it can basically you're being kidnapped

435
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,872
No the only way that anybody can Forza

436
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
To do anything is

437
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,968
If you present a legitimate danger to yourself or others

438
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,320
And even that it's really hard

439
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,856
Yeah because

440
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
Scary

441
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,208
Otherworld system if you could just be forced into

442
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,256
It would be

443
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
To go back

444
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,864
All the way back to like 30 years ago when you

445
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
Could do that too with

446
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,936
Yeah for being hysterical

447
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
To those time

448
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
Stay out so Fargo

449
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,920
It's right there you can play it anytime you want to well I couldn't turn in the assignment

450
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:21,248
Mental disorder

451
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,064
OK Google

452
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,464
For your skull

453
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
Get it through your skull

454
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
But that number is meaningless

455
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
Grayscale

456
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
Otherwise

457
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
See I mean that there is

458
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
There is an interest

459
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
In conversation

460
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,592
Possibly to be had about

461
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:52,480
Idea people being able to get away with stuff member of the mental illness

462
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,320
Community

463
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Because

464
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
We're willing

465
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
To talk about it now

466
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Yeah

467
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,696
To fight against Batman

468
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
There is

469
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
There is the Quan

470
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
Over-diagnosing

471
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,632
Because that's always

472
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
Concern with any kind of medical

473
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,520
Message within the community is something that we all

474
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
Consider

475
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Something that's really important

476
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Because

477
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,664
With all the side effects that

478
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Your medications

479
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Can have

480
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
If you get a wrong diagnosis

481
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
Very serious

482
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
But

483
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
That said

484
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,160
It's generally

485
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,696
Not as big of an issue as the

486
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,304
Always very very small percentage of cases

487
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
People are keenly aware of

488
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
Something that

489
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
There is a debate

490
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:51,360
Also over-prescription of stuff

491
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Real world thing

492
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
But it's not

493
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,456
Real the way Batman

494
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,040
Is describing it

495
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Now that's what it is

496
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,856
Trigger warning

497
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Some s***

498
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,208
With that underlying

499
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
You see

500
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,376
How easy is it to from there into

501
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
Student

502
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,984
We're students getting together insane

503
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Triggering

504
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
There was there was

505
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,552
If there was a Nazi propaganda painted on

506
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Jefferson

507
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:38,976
I went to the student at the University of Missouri

508
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,768
Yeah yeah

509
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,560
Back when I went to the university

510
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,400
See Missouri there was a situation where

511
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
A bunch of cotton

512
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
Was put outside like

513
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,032
Just thrown out at side.

514
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,336
The office of the Legion of black Collegian

515
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
You know that guy

516
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
The people who did it

517
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
Taken care of

518
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,904
But if I'd administrator

519
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
They were

520
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,768
From the Vegas Mafia

521
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:19,168
They got very short Graves out the desert took out.

522
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:24,288
Got expelled the facts but that's how I remember go down

523
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,080
More severe punishment

524
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,152
Sara Lee a 3-foot

525
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,224
Something happens a lot

526
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,272
And that sort of thing

527
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Is not

528
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,856
People respond to that it's not mental illness

529
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
It's causing them to respond

530
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,696
It's that they should be very offended

531
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
Well

532
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
It's it's a threat

533
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
You're being fresh

534
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,400
If you do not look for a safe space after being threatened

535
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
Then I mean

536
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
That's that

537
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,032
Why aren't the guys

538
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,312
Perpetrating the race

539
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
Mental illness

540
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:07,040
I don't know what will they the ones who believe that mental illness is wicked.

541
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
Mental illnesses

542
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,136
Get the help that they probably mean

543
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
Desperately

544
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:19,840
And put it outside a black building out of work

545
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,632
Racism is a lot of

546
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
Work indicates

547
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,960
Something is not working right

548
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,056
India brain-dead what if there was let's

549
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
Let's say there was a

550
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
Even better yet

551
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Again

552
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
We could just Pump It

553
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
Too heavily race

554
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
Still against

555
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
Admittedly I agree with you

556
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Now

557
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
I will say that

558
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
The side effects of this gas

559
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
In my head are your legs don't work

560
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,048
So we don't have to worry about

561
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
So you're not mobile

562
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,424
Yeah exactly how about we just make you dick way to bed

563
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:02,336
It said of no egg just pick you pick comically large

564
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,784
That's the that's the ironic twist

565
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:16,160
Now it's like careful what you wish for

566
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,768
Revealing

567
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
And

568
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
Shares some thoughts

569
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
Scientology

570
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Unfortunate way

571
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Great

572
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Get it

573
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:36,128
Because we already have a mental disorder you see somewhere a little bit off chemical imbalance in the brain whatever

574
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
Ever whatever whatever

575
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,248
You can't. You can just whatever whatever whatever

576
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:47,648
You can't like yada yada yada

577
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
Hard-hitting investigative

578
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
Now we have a right

579
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:58,400
To begin talking this crazy language and we need to save space in a room as teachers and staff

580
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,776
And we can regress back into being children

581
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:08,384
Because we've already been diagnosed by a mental health professional

582
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,688
As having a mental disorder

583
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,016
I hope

584
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,576
This is the key to understanding

585
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:24,000
What is going on not only going on at us colleges and universities but what is eating out the country from

586
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
The inside

587
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:32,960
Profession of Psychiatry and I'm going to break down for you

588
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,520
Andrew said this investigative report

589
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
He doesn't

590
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,688
Okay

591
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
I'm like

592
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:49,088
We're going to go down to the medication is

593
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Change

594
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,440
Thing right

595
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
Shades of

596
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
If you will

597
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,768
Where where is this going

598
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,072
Poquoson places you don't

599
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Of course

600
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:06,496
If it does get to those places we've got to deal with him being a little bit but it's worth listening to this

601
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
Because

602
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
Of

603
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
You'll see

604
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,920
Paragraphs

605
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,712
He's a complete ass

606
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:22,368
You don't get to do that I don't know him

607
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,440
He just generalized every us College

608
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,256
Yes

609
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,048
That's the whole

610
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,888
Like that the fight that's so funny

611
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Conservatives have because

612
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Cuz they they

613
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
Have that thing where they send their

614
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,056
You know Chris Christian conservative brainwash kids

615
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,104
The universe

616
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
Other

617
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:51,296
Surprisingly enough they come back with from their tiny ass

618
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:56,928
Maybe they smoke a little smoke

619
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,256
Oh my God

620
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,072
Sort of person over that camp

621
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
Maybe you maybe

622
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:10,752
You matter gay person you're everything I've been taught About You Is Wrong

623
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Is always that

624
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,568
It's always that whole b******* like

625
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
If we could just

626
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,408
Bubble like

627
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Occult

628
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,296
If we could keep that like every small town should just be called a

629
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,368
Because that little bubble they have of those p

630
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
And I grew up in a small town

631
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
Probably will.

632
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
But at least it'll be enough

633
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,144
Bathroom stall of a bar

634
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
Keep that short small View

635
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,568
And the moment somebody goes away and

636
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
Comes back with a

637
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
They blame the universe

638
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,712
As though as though the universe

639
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736
He wasn't just

640
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
A collection of

641
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,088
From other places it's full of crazies

642
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
And Psychiatry is to blame

643
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
Oh okay

644
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
BMX

645
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,584
Thanks so much easier because it's Arkham campus

646
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
That you not

647
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:13,216
Dress in blackface.

648
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,752
Misgender people

649
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,848
People are crazy for demanding

650
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,200
Yeah and I guess if that's your argument I can't

651
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:28,064
I can't really argue with you except to say I completely disagree

652
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,392
People though are always the ones who are all the most against

653
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Deformity

654
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
So it's always like

655
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,792
These people demand something that goes against what I think

656
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
Think is what everyone

657
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,376
Should be

658
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:47,776
Individualism the libertarian ideas

659
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,336
Everybody's individual

660
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,176
Actually he's going to get to individuality in a little bit I bet he's right on

661
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,992
Totally now you can see

662
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,576
How this whole business came

663
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:06,976
And how gorgeous destroying the country because it's a majority of the best and the brightest

664
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,816
Attending colleges and universities 25%

665
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
That's not a majority

666
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,192
The 45% of

667
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
A hundred percent

668
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
Write notes

669
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,872
What is the

670
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:29,760
I don't know I just learned all this liberal hippy-dippy I don't know about math

671
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
San College

672
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,136
Then already at such a young age or being diagnosed

673
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,488
Drug is highly toxic

674
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,024
Brain scrambling drugs

675
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:48,192
Naturally

676
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,896
Halloween costume

677
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,944
Nothing things are related

678
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,576
Into each other ideas

679
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,600
They're talking

680
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
Specifically about black

681
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,208
Is always minimizing it if you rename it

682
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
2 something

683
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
Locker room talk

684
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,304
Right

685
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Locker room talk

686
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
It's the Battle of language

687
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
It's not it's not black face

688
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,680
The Halloween costume

689
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,240
You and I know everybody wears Halloween

690
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,312
Which means everybody wears

691
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
Haysville Halloween

692
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Sure

693
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,896
Well

694
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
We're f****** blackface

695
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,736
On the last episode

696
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:37,344
Little bit of the Halloween

697
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
Totally cool

698
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,488
So don't even reach right it totally

699
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,024
But this is so great because

700
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,376
Spouting this stuff and he's about to make a really smooth strands

701
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,520
You bet

702
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,080
And the drugs then sell

703
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,200
Create a distorted perception of reality

704
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
The drugs

705
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Okay

706
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,264
Yeah I'm getting a little worked up about this I've been on this case for 20 years now

707
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,568
Funny years

708
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,152
Before I guess the next

709
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,944
Gigantic

710
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,760

He goes on for like 3 minutes

717
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,520
We all know that he goes on 23 minutes or so selling Rodger Stones books

718
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,080
But it's great because this is a show that does have commercials

719
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:08,480
I love I love what the f*** are you doing you're in the middle of a report about how psychology isn't real in the enemy

720
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,112
Huge bumps but you know we got to talk about

721
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,904
I love how worked up he is

722
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,952
By his voice being like

723
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
And I

724
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,816
Real angry about that

725
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:29,216
Be Sedated opening with

726
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
I'm a little hyper

727
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,288
Yeah yeah

728
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,872
Some of these herbs we can buy on Infowars

729
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:41,248
Psychiatrist

730
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,576
Totally fine but he's psychotropic drugs from the psychiatrist

731
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Well you know what

732
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,184
I will say that they do have a greater propensity

733
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
Because they're real

734
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:58,144
So anything that's real is of course much more likely to be high risk

735
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,728
Exactly or more like Lolo low-risk

736
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
Hyrule

737
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,128
I'm ready to get to the bombshell

738
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,152
I want to be clear

739
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
Okay I'm not sure

740
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,392
Forgetting the Bob

741
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
Okay

742
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Next

743
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
Peace here

744
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
Okay

745
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,704
If you go to the psychiatric Bible

746
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,520
Famous DSM

747
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,664
The diagnostic and statistical Manual of mental disorders

748
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,064
What was by the American Psychiatric association about that because he's activated

749
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,344
You don't have to

750
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,184
Because he's got so little

751
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,280
He's got

752
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
Yeah but

753
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
Still it's like

754
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
It's going to appeal

755
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,400
To people who are dumb

756
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
Who's going to hear him

757
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
Sarcastically

758
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,032
He's been

759
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
It's

760
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,640

That there is a list

769
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
Description

770
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
Ready

771
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
300 separate and distinct

772
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,016
Mental disorders

773
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
Finance

774
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:56,160
Defiance disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

775
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:00,512
Clinical depression

776
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,608
Obviously the vast majority you never heard of 300

777
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Okay

778
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
Now what

779
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,288
Revelation revelation

780
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,872
There is no and listen carefully here

781
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,408
Every word is important

782
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,504
Physical

783
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,552
Diagnostic test

784
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,832
Of any kind

785
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,904
For any of those 300

786
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,952
So cold mental disorder

787
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
That's not true

788
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
Jessica

789
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,400
It's horrible complete lie

790
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,216
Memes I think

791
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,520
Cuz I'm going to be generous in one set

792
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,592
If you have

793
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,456
If you have

794
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
TBH

795
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,576
Was like that there was a specific a Tubi TV

796
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,904
Yes you can take that test it'll tell you yes or no if you have

797
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,720
There is no test like that

798
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
Depression

799
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,304
Per say or schizophrenia

800
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,328
Anything like

801
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
But

802
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Dora

803
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,168
Physical test

804
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:15,520
Very important information that lead doctors to those diagnosed

805
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
I consulted

806
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,848
With my gums

807
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,920
Who is a real-life doctor and I asked him

808
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:28,320
Bleeding gums Murphy

809
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,768
And

810
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,304
I asked

811
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
Just absolutely

812
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,888
Incorrect there's so many physical tests that are

813
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
The go into psychiatric diagnosis

814
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
There are

815
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
Panels

816
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,848
There are any kind of brain scans

817
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,384
There's other physical test

818
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:56,223
Basic even movement test

819
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,527
It doesn't in the same way as

820
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,063
TBH yes or no

821
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,159
It's not the same

822
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:08,511
But this is such an elementary understanding what physical test

823
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,119
Three other or here's the other angle on why

824
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
From this angle

825
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,751
Especially if there's a

826
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
7000 years old

827
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Or however old

828
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,359
Is that

829
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,895
Is Brothers Methuselah's

830
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,967
The heart

831
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
Part about the hill

832
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
History of

Marianne psychology

834
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Is that

835
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,575
There was such a

836
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,599
Play push for a long

837
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
Into a

838
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,439
Will sign

839
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
Message

840
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
Which

841
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
For the longer

842
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,559
Longest time it was just

843
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,607
You know a guy like Freud saying

844
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:51,263
You dream weird how about that your mother

845
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,311
Crazyshit so you can

846
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,103
Understand if somebody had only

847
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,895
Only read Freud thinking

848
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
That's what

849
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Psychology or

850
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
That means you

851
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
You haven't look

852
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
Looked at

853
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
Any cycle

854
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
Length of time you've

855
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
Warriors

856
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,535
Did some stuff in your not really recognize it

857
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
The DSM

858
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,471
Regularly

859
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,287
Blown away he was by

860
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,895
7 billion people there are

861
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:35,551
Seven billion within that 300 there's like five

862
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Different sorts of

863
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,927
Depression

864
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
That's the treatment

865
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,999
Depressed

866
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,303
Which again if you're dealing with

867
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
Was misdiagnosed

868
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
Cuz medication

869
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Very toxic

870
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:57,311
You know like I'm destroying my liver so I don't know

871
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:04,479
60 years from now have a good life while good life as possible or do you want to be eight

872
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Yeah

873
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,039
Who do you want to live like you have

874
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,343
In terrible pain in your life

875
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,183
But the other thing that I think it's super important is

876
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
Ndsm

877
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,487
Is statistical

878
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
Cuz it's based

879
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,559
Unreal observations of

880
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
People

881
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Tons of patience

882
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
That Dave Dave

883
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,215
Diagnosed

884
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,239
Categorized

885
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,543
Mental disorders

886
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,823
And found what works

887
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,663
Statistically

888
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
Complicated

889
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,735
Read the new Michael Lewis book

890
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,623
They were everyone doesn't believe in coincidences isolated

891
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Actually talk

892
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
Somebody earlier about

893
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,743
Where is

894
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
Is that whole myth

895
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Well people Goku

896
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
Full moon

897
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
Look at it from a

898
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
When you realize do they do

899
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
When somebody goes crazy

900
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
And there's the phone

901
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
You associate

902
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
Wait we talked about

903
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,919
When somebody doesn't go or when somebody goes crazy in there

904
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,687
There's no full moon

905
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
You don't register

906
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
Cuz there wasn't a

907
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:15,135
Well it's like suicides Rising around the holidays we always hear about

908
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,207
Intuitive sense

909
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
The full moon

910
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
Is

911
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,071
Yeah so unusual things

912
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
Should happen

913
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
Whilst holidays

914
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
RC

915
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,215
And you should kill yourself

916
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,335
Spell statistics are like a science that's desperately in need of a story to make them

917
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,407
Yeah so you have the like full moon story

918
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,223
Whether it's true or not

919
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Storytellers

920
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,599
That's what we are that's the only way we under

921
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
Story

922
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
Batman

923
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,487
Got a blood test

924
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:57,887
AR test not saliva test out of urine test not a brain scan out of genetic

925
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
Nothing

926
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,519
Lucero's zilch nada nothing

927
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,847
Secret

928
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,175
In the psychiatric community

929
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,831
You going into the doctor he says you know

930
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,367
You've got cancer

931
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
Yeah

932
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
I think you got cancer

933
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,791
You going to run any tests

934
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,863
No we don't actually have any tests

935
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:34,239
But from what you say and looking at you I would say that you got cancer

936
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
And it's now time

937
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
You know

938
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,359
We could start an hour

939
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,663
Rounds of chemotherapy

940
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,343
It was your course will stop the reproduction of all your cells and we hope it'll kill the tumors before it kills you

941
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,463
We don't really have any chest that would be like that

942
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,303
It wouldn't be like that also kind of insinuating

943
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
Cancer

944
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
Treatment is bad for you

945
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,191
He probably would

946
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,007
In like

947
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
It seems like

948
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
He's really mad because

949
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
Can somebody diagnose

950
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
That's how I lost

951
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,711
Well you got you

952
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,991
You guys will see the picture

953
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,295
Holyshit

954
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,087
Ulta

955
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,111
If I was diagnosed

956
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
Play on

957
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,511

958
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,791

959
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:36,447
I would be totally cool I love the idea of like trying to figure out when they send

960
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:41,055
Your ear deep in this metaphor that we know you're not going to find your way out of the woods

961
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
Skipping music

962
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,663
There is never been a break or that Muse

Like they never end on a

965
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,039
They're always going to break

966
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
The middle of

967
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,599
And if you got diagnosed

968
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,207
Like no

969
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,487
Play something

970
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303

Something like a dirge

972
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:07,935
Exactly

973
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:11,007

That is like

977
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
That's just not true

978
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:27,647
But then the other I'm being extra.

979
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,439

It's like you answered

982
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,351
Conditions have an underlying condition

983
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,375
That is causing

984
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:42,239
Derelict sometimes depression is caused by hyper hypothyroidism

985

Happening

994
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
To me that makes

995
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
Yeah

996
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,495

1000
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,199
It causes

1004
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,575
Exactly

1005
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135

You had things that made

1015

You have never felt a deep and unending sadness come from

1016
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
From within you

1017
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
Trying to eat

1018
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,663
Much like other people of that

1019
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,223
I'm accusing others

1020
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:01,599
Well now you have a secondary diagnosis

1021
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:06,975

1027
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,247
So-called

1028
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,063
The moment that came into the left

1029
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,391
So-called so-called that that

1030
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Undermine

1031
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,951
How could you have any confidence

1032
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,231
In literally any

1033
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
Somebody is call

1034
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,375
What is the so-called investigative report

1035
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,679
Also I noticed

1036
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,959
He's doing a lot of this

1037
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,287
And the Trump does all the time

1038
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,639
Play Trump stolen from Ikea

1039
00:50:59,455 --> 00:50:59,967
Cast

1040
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,503
Whatsoever

1041
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,295
For any of them

1042
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,855
That defines any of the show

1043
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:10,207
Psychiatrist can diagnose you

1044
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:14,559
Your child student at a college with anything that he wants to

1045
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
Square

1046
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,935
Emmaus Hammer is drugs

1047
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:26,847
And in case you're thinking of trying to worm out of my argument here and say what we know

1048
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:33,247
But all these mental disorders are chemical imbalances in the brain

1049
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,551
First of all

1050
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,599
Baseline normal

1051
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,391
Cast for

1052
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:43,999
What a normal Baseline chemical balance in the brain is

1053
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
FairPoint

1054
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,655
There is no necessary way to

1055
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,679
To tell what is normal

1056
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,727
But that does not prove his point

1057
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,543
It's a fair point but it's

1058
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,079
Not don't prove anything

1059
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:02,175
And I've documented through a mission

1060
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:08,575
By dr. Ronald pies who is she know one of these erudite psychiatry

1061
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,599
So fake

1062
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:15,231
Resume this long retired now Emeritus editor

1063
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:21,631
Until want who said

1064
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,055
So that doesn't even hold up

1065
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:35,455
Are you saying that doctor pies called something I looked into this I found the article that he took the

1066
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
Best rum

1067
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,855
A visit from the psychiatric times

1068
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,135
This was

1069
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,927
An article called psychology

1070
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,487
Psychiatrist new Bryant

1071
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,815
And the legend of chemical imbalance it's from 2011

1072
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,399
I did a chemical imbalance

1073
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,447
Being responsible

1074
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,239
Holy for mental illness

1075
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
Is

1076
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:03,103
An urban legend never Theory seriously propounded by well-informed psychiatry

1077
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,663
But he goes on to explain

1078
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
He's quoting

1079
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
National Institute

1080
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
Mental health director

1081
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,039
Thomas

1082
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,087
As Intel describes

1083
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
Is the new model

1084
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:18,719
Conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder

1085
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,743
Genetic variation

1086
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,047
Delete dysfunction in multiple complex

1087
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
Complex brains

1088
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,655
However the particular symptomatic manifestations in a given

1089
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
Is phenotype

1090
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
Is partly dependent on the person

1091
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,055
We met hypothesize

1092
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:33,823
This is

1093
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,687
The giving developmental eBay

1094
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,711
In various neural

1095
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:44,575
The young boy or girl may be predisposed to the use of certain dysfunctional cognitive strategies

1096
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,879
For example viewing everyone in the environment

1097
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,903
Is uniformly

1098
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Or rejecting

1099
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:53,791
Wow that's a really well said really well-thought-out really well

1100
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,351
I don't think

1101
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
Now

1102
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
You know

1103
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,935
Paint me wrong

1104
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,983
I don't think that

1105
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,263
Was very well represented

1106
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,895
No

1107
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,431
Six way of pointing out every

1108
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
Is that

1109
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,479
Even if you have the

1110
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,015
Genetic

1111
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,551
What

1112
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,343
Whether or not you would call it a

1113
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
Dysfunctional

1114
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,719
There are certain

1115
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,023
Trade-offs

1116
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:26,047
With my experience

1117
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:31,423
There's always been

1118
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,191
It gives you power up

1119
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,239
If you think that you suck

1120
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,287
Sometimes you'll work harder than everyone else

1121
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,311
Too complacent

1122
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,407
But the other things

1123
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
Is that it

1124
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
Is

1125
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
Relevant

1126
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,759
Where You Are

1127
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:46,783
Growing up in

1128
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,807
Where You Are

1129
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:52,927
Is the blasting

1130
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,463
Whatever you know

1131
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,255
You can have a Layton

1132
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,023
Psychiatric

1133
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,583
Conditioned it'll never be set off because you

1134
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
Live the right Circle

1135
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,471
The same condition

1136
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,007
Somebody

1137
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,799
Lately different world a maybe

1138
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
Genetics

1139
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,127
But you're going to react

1140
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,663
Different symptoms

1141
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
Cuz you're dealing with it

1142
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:15,967
An environment that

1143
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:16,991

1146
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,343
Even if

1147
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,391
In even if

1148
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,927
About those College

1149
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,951
Feels like it's in a

1150
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,999
Somebody may have

1151
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,327
One illness

1152
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
Or another one

1153
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,143
But they're both exhibit

1154
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,679
Symptoms

1155
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
X wear

1156
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:40,799
If you go through the

1157
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,079
Bipolar disorder

1158
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
It's really hard

1159
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,639
To diagnose because

1160
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,431
It may be that you're so

1161
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Symptoms are exact

1162
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,271
Disease or exactly the same as that busy

1163
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,319
And so you wind up going through all these do

1164
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
Because

1165
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,903
You don't actually know what your

1166
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,927
Underlined Pro

1167
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
You just know s***

1168
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,487
Yeah

1169
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Yeah yeah yeah

1170
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,351
So it's a well-thought-out

1171
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:07,679
And you should be the M rated as editor of

1172
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,751
Black shut up.

1173
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,799
You do good work I wish you didn't drive it

1174
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,335
Car with so many clouds

1175
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,663
Batman

1176
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,199
What he's saying is

1177
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:22,015
Is a really bad representation of what doctor pies

1178
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:27,903
More or less out of context because the actual quote sounds good for

1179
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,231
Has is saying is essentially

1180
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
That the idea of a chemical imbalance

1181
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,863
Is a simplistic inaccurate way to look at it

1182
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,959
These are the brain that would cause

1183
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
Chemical differ

1184
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,823
So it isn't it isn't a reputation of

1185
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,895
Did the idea that your brain chemistry is different

1186
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,455
It's just that the brain chemistry

1187
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,527
Is not really what we're talkin about

1188
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,063
Not really rapper

1189
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:56,831
Preventative

1190
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,415
My point is

1191
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,047
In the way he is

1192
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,071
Doing that for

1193
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:10,655
For 20 years a tornado

1194
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:16,287
Why wouldn't he at least have read the full article if you did pull out the

1195
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,847
First five

1196
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:25,247
It was the first leg he got what he wanted and then did not bother to read the rest

1197
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:29,599
Case for 20 years what are you

1198
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:34,207
Why you call him and ask him what he meant by that instead of pulling out of context quote

1199
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,767
What are you actually do some investigation

1200
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,583
What do you what do you doing how could you get ahold of doctor

1201
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,383
A great tweet that was

1202
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,663
Is the picture of Jeff sessions

1203
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,527
Sessions looks like a baby who is turned old by which BS

1204
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,791
Show all these college students

1205
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,583
And everybody really are

1206
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,983
Completely submerge see the psychiatrist who will say

1207
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,871
The antidepressants Prozac Zoloft Paxil and so forth

1208
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,919
In my article

1209
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,247
Which is up now at Infowars

1210
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
Number one

1211
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,367
Mind control program u.s. colleges you can see

1212
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,671
The effects of these drugs

1213
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:40,255
As cited in study after study after study and there

1214
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:46,911
Influence how they push people over the edge into committing violence

1215
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,447
Violet drink

1216
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,519
Tequila yes could be throwing a rock through a window

1217
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,311
But it could also be murder

1218
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:59,967
Could also be mass murder could also be suicide which walking serious stuff here as

1219
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,759
The result of these

1220
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,343
SSRI as they're called antidepressants

1221
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:08,159
And that's just one class of drug

1222
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
What

1223
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,719
Barrel roll

1224
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,023
Major tranquilizers

1225
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,327
Sword neuroleptics

1226
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,911
The first of which was

1227
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:26,079
It's unfortunate because there is

1228
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:26,847
Reality

1229
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
Some people

1230
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:34,271
Often times in a little bit later in the his special report

1231
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,831
Dangerous to go off of medication

1232
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,207
But you end up seeing Revo with people who have fallen off my

1233
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:46,559
So that was very accurate

1234
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:50,399
There are negative responses to medication

1235
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,447
Negative

1236
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,727
Responses to not

1237
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,751
Searching out

1238
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,847
To be a

1239
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,383
There's not going to be

1240
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,687
You are no and even then

1241
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,967
If you are going

1242
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
You seek out medic

1243
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
You're not doing

1244
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,623
Girls are not doing a good someone Shanghai

1245
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,695
Because you're struggling

1246
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,719
Unless you're on

1247
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,511
TV show

1248
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,279
TV show yet

1249
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:23,679
Getting help all of them literally every reality show

1250
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,727
But like

1251
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,287
I know a number of people who are mentally ill

1252
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:32,639
Consider getting help and I always tell them you know I can't tell you what to do

1253
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,663
I really think

1254
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,735
But there's help you want to go I'll give you some

1255
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,503
Resources

1256
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,039
When I try and help people as much as I

1257
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,367
Never follow through

1258
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,415
Bia

1259
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,975
Is is Bizarro

1260
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,767
You can go in

1261
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:54,399
Laughing Gopher One session in the never go back even then

1262
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,191
I'm not going to say

1263
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,239
I think I see

1264
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,775
The way that he's putting

1265
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:00,799
Force

1266
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,591
Is such a Negative

1267
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,407
One of the hardest parts about having

1268
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,431
Mental illnesses

1269
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,199
Sometimes

1270
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
Phresher

1271
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,015
And that's not

1272
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
Feeling like your

1273
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
Forced to go

1274
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,343
But that's like your no your

1275
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,623
Your friends are putting this

1276
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
The pressure on you

1277
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,695
You should go get help and it makes

1278
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
Feel

1279
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,255
It makes you feel like you're

1280
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:25,119
Yeah but they want actually putting it is more like

1281
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,519
Guys out there with butterfly net

1282
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,823
He's a he's a

1283
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,591
No he's been

1284
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,127
He's very he's very much angry

1285
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:42,783
Right now in my monotone voice

1286
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:46,367
This next clip is where it spins into a little bit of like wacky

1287
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,927
Conspiracy territory

1288
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:52,767
They are creating

1289
01:01:55,583 --> 01:02:01,215
Just because it was just because of where the eclipse started when he says they bought the drugs not

1290
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,543
I want a psychiatrist to give him the drugs

1291
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,383
Look I want to be sure that I'm not giving him like false contacts

1292
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,199
Right

1293
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:11,967
This with gun

1294
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,759
Psychiatrist with tail shape

1295
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,343
Is that mean

1296
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,671
That means that your ability

1297
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:26,047
Physiologically as a human

1298
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:33,727
The great reference on this is Peter break-ins book toxic Psychiatry 1991 Saint Martin's press

1299
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,567
Which should be on every bookshelf

1300
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
No

1301
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,223
U.s. colleges

1302
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,295
Control

1303
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:54,719
Psychiatry is basically a mind-control operation MK Ultra

1304
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:58,047
Arbitrary

1305
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:03,935
Giving you the sense that you have a mental disorder and now you're a victim and therefore you have sir

1306
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:09,567
Privileges and rights and so forth I'm triggered I need to say space microaggressions

1307
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:12,639
The drugs are in fact scrambling your brains

1308
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,711
What else do you need

1309
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,735
Display

1310
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:19,551
Psychiatry is a mind control program

1312
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:29,023
Of the CIA

1313
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:36,959
Not even trying to hide it anymore they're just giving it to you here we are

1314
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,335
There's something called the Freedom of Information Act

1315
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
They would love to

1316
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:47,199
Still be hiding at no no no he's talking about just like

1317
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:53,855
Reminder driving mainly about MKUltra a program that Andre back in the 70s

1318
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,159
Even trying to hide it anymore

1319
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:01,791
Like

1320
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,607
Totally understand

1321
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,143
If we live

1322
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
In the 19

1323
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,471
Yep cuz you do have those

1324
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,751
People who are out of f******

1325
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567

Conspiracy blogs

1328
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,015
It like that

1329
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:27,135
Who wins if you have Motors

1330
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,975
Who's who's winning

1331
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:34,303
Why is it always nobody wins everybody just loses

1332
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:39,935
Possible paths he wants the argument to go down and never really gets

1333
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:46,591
The first paralysis or whatever in your f***** up then you

1334
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,615
Just become like

1335
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
That's what they want

1336
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
Population

1337
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:53,759
About to bring Dead zombies

1338
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,087
People to do she know it's silly

1339
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:03,231
But then the other one

1340
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,023
You take these pills

1341
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
They scramble your brain

1342
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,327
And because you have this

1343
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,375
Mentally ill victim mentality

1344
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:12,703
You go out and you start yelling the black lives matter

1345
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,751
And you're going to end up causing a race war

1346
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:18,335
I think that's the other argument that he can't fully flashout

1347
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,127
But that's kind of what he

1348
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,783
That's kind of dog whistle be within your right

1349
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,599
Black Saturn

1350
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:33,951
Rates is really bad transmission

1351
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,047
Right cuz he's an old scared

1352
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,327
He's an old

1353
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:43,167
Scared man who's mad that

1354
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
That was

1355
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:52,127
What was The Dark Knight Rises

1356
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:52,895
God damn picture

1357
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:57,247
Cuz it's too much for one man to

1358
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,063
Everytime I hang out on the couch

1359
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,367
Nobody

1360
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,415
A picture and everybody take

1361
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:07,231
I've been waiting for a really long time just

1362
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,791
Because of how much I'm fascinated by that picture

1363
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:16,447
I want to get a really high pixel version of it so I can zoom in and see what the payment is

1364
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,751
The TV show then had then

1365
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:24,895
And hence I want it I want to get a really slick a megapixel version of it

1366
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,687
Make a shirt of that

1367
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:30,271
Precursor of the picture

1368
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,063
Where is

1369
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:32,831
Where is he

1370
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,975
I have no f****** idea he's in the middle of

1371
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
It looks like

1372
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,535
He's in the bayou himself

1373
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,399
He's got bodies in his f****** shed

1374
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:49,727
He is one of like all of these dudes

1375
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,007
New Skype

1376
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,335
And how's the fourth hour

1377
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,871
Anthony cumia has it on

1378
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,151
Studio and stuff like that

1379
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:01,503
But the rest of them Skype Tower or just in rooms

1380
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,575
Like it's it's weird and his room is the most

1381
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,367
Baron its God

1382
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:12,767
How great would it be if they were all in the same house I just had different oh my God

1383
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:19,167
Like like confessional on a reality

1384
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:23,263
Weirdos who are Alec Alex Jones Associates living under one house

1385
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,103
Babe.

1386
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,663
They are already doing that

1387
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,223
How long before they eat each other

1388
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,783
Put all of the conspiracy

1389
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,575
People in the same house

1390
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,623
Econo Lodge Poconos

1391
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,671
Sooner or later they're going to eat one of

1392
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
Right

1393
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:45,279
What are yeah I made if you cut them off from the outside world like they do in Big Brother

1394
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,607
I have to assume that everything is

1395
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,399
Okay so I think a lot of people who are into the

1396
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,679
Conspiracy narrative

1397
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,215
Have I don't know what

1398
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,751
Bias would be

1399
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:58,079
But they believe that things are moving faster than they actually are

1400
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:01,151
Okay crash

1401
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,759
The Temper of their like

1402
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,527
Interfere

1403
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,975
Coming

1404
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,511
You cut them off from news

1405
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:19,583
I think their natural fear that things are moving fast

1406
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
Quit within a week

1407
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:21,887
Fibula

1408
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,447
We're cut off from the outside world

1409
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:28,031
Cut off the Second Amendment right

1410
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,591
Start what with the amount of

1411
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:35,455
What time Alex Jones talks about cannibalism there is a part of me that thinks

1412
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,247
He's always like this closed

1413
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
Tappan Lake

1414
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:42,623
Special report about that new show The Saint

1415
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,647
The Clarita diet

1416
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,927
What's that

1417
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,975
Apparently a show starring

1418
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,095
Don't don't worry about it

1419
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:56,447
Michael

1420
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,519
Mike know who's that Drew Barrymore

1421
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:02,335
Drew Barrymore

1422
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:05,919
Okay

1423
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,711
Normalizing

1424
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,039
No that's pretty much

1425
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:13,855
That's pretty much as far away from normalizing cannibalism is

1426
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:23,071
You know what I think I think

1427
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,095
Different by differ

1428
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:29,471
Okay because you know like your ass would be like a much more fatty

1429
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:35,871
Roosevelt

1430
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,663
What humans taste like

1431
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
Your bicep

1432
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,039
Rihanna

1433
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:47,391
Yeah it would be more like

1434
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
The white meat

1435
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,511
Okay I had a long conversation with my doctor

1436
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,351
And like

1437
01:09:56,607 --> 01:10:00,191
Lost his teeth eating people

1438
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:00,959
Because

1439
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,007
Most of their bodies muscles

1440
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,871
If it's the superior me

1441
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:12,479
A lot of muscles are slow twitch muscle they don't have to move

1442
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:17,343
Okay I'm so there's are the fat marble

1443
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,135
That's why you have the red meat there

1444
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,183
I think your ass would be like red meat

1445
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,975
And maybe your thighs

1446
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,791
I meant your ear like bicep would be white meat

1447
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,071
I would probably go by

1448
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,119
YouTube I think so

1449
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:32,447
I'm a chicken poultry kind of got everybody

1450
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:36,543
What type of what part of a man would you eat

1451
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,871
The new corner on this

1452
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:43,199
I got a high five

1453
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:49,599
Alright alright we got to come back to the center also hit us up on Twitter at knowledge

1454
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,927
Underscore

1455
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,463
Alright

1456
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,743
Fun

1457
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:58,303
You talk to more b******* and then he goes to break

1458
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,839
He introduces a

1459
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,607
Clip

1460
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,655
We're not going to listen to but it's cliff

1461
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,191
That goes back to

1462
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,727
Fears about agenda

1463
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,823
20%

1464
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,431
College students in the US are being diagnosed or treated for mental inventory

1465
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,319
These are nothing more than psychiatric clinics

1466
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
They are

1467
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:27,231
Little produce violence and craziness and insanity

1468
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,511
That's why

1469
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,303
Where the insanity begins

1470
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,863
That word comes up

1471
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,655
Okay

1472
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
Okay

1473
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,751
Take a break in a couple minutes but I want to tell you

1474
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:42,847
After we come back from the break stay with us because

1475
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,919
What I'm talking about is my control

1476
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:53,599
What Rob do in his report which is coming right up is talking about

1477
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,903
Is over

1478
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,951
Our physical world

1479
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,999
Through Agenda 21

1480
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:04,351
That's actually some pretty good music

1481
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
The clothes out on the

1482
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:10,751
He's right the Mind Control mask

1483
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,567
Masters 2020

1484
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:19,199
That's the little bit like Max Fury Road it's a little bit like the guy on the guitar

1485
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:25,855
I noticed some Bumper Music that he plays like Alex Jones plays on the show

1486
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,623
You assume the artists

1487
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,647
Don't know

1488
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:31,487
Feather being used with mobizen

1489
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:37,887
Extreme Ways

1490
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,167
Spelling of music

1491
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,215
Commercials and stuff

1492
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,031
Money to charity

1493
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:44,799
You can't do that

1494
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:51,199
Play Store we can do that do that with

1495
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:54,015
Without movies cancer

1496
01:12:54,271 --> 01:13:00,415
I don't know yeah he might have some sort of a deal with

1497
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,207
Music deal where you can

1498
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
It's about that

1499
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,815
Kia's

1500
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
Morrissey

1501
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:12,959
Yeah

1502
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
That's the only way.

1503
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:22,687
Support mental illness more than this special reports is play some f****** motivation

1504
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:26,783
Commercial to come back and they play this long

1505
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,367
Special Report by Rob do about

01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,135
21

1507
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:31,903
Right

1508
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:36,767
It's more completely unfounded bulshit

1509
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,095
Want to put you into inner-city ghettos

1510
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,655
Then where you'll have a cough and apartments all the same

1511

It's a terrible name

1520
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:05,439
So comes back from break after this

1521
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,719

01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,103
Scared accordingly

1526
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Excellent

1528
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,271
Traffic report by Rob

That was a terrific

1530
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,647
Completely unrelated

1531
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,439
Now you going to have people

1532
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,511
Desperate

1533
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:45,375
And somebody's going to say well you should really see somebody

1534
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,959
You should talk to a professional

1535
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,239
If you are desperate

1536
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,775
Please talk to me

1537
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:55,359
What is a is a tabby there is

1538
01:14:56,127 --> 01:15:00,991
That Agenda 21 is going to make people sad and then people will be like you should go to a therapist

1539
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,015
So like

1540
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,063
The sad world is going to be happening

1541
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:10,463
Because the elites are going to force us into inner-city ghettos with no choice

1542
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,255
Therapist will

1543
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,047
I don't know

1544
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
It's dumb

1545
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:23,519
Scientology psychiatrist control the world

1546
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,567
Are the elites also

1547
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,871
I don't I don't

1548
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,919
Propping up the Psychiatry industry

1549
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,943
As a front

1550
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,711
For their mind

1551
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,991
Controlpro

1552
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
You what

1553
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:41,439
Not wrestle with at all like why

1554
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,743
Speculative

1555
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:46,303
A couple possibilities

1556
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,839
The endgame for the psychology

1557
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:52,447
As we get into so many times

1558
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
We all get into trouble

1559
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,263
Sota Ken's NY

1560
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,055
I hate to sound like Young Jeezy

1561
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
But then what

1562
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:03,455
Point what's you have a brain-dead population that is

1563
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,479
Is unable to work

1564
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,551
Yeah

1565
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:13,951
So now you just have potatoes who's got a whole world of potatoes

1566
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:19,583
The economy then is an image in his head

1567
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,863
I guess what I'm at

1568
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,423
Psychiatrist

1569
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
Delighting

1570
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:27,519
It hurting people really good question does he think psychiatry

1571
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
Start in on it or does he think that

1572
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
That they're just

1573
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:35,455
Like they're just the Nazis at Auschwitz

1574
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,223
Just like

1575
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,343
Thinking they're going to work everyday like regular Joes I sincerely don't know and I don't think he does

1576
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,159
I really don't think he knows what is argument

1577
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,719
Man

1578
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,767
Popeyes

1579
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,351
Next episode

1580
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:04,127
What's happening outside in the world

1581
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:11,551
What do you say

1582
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:16,671
Join the crowd everybody loves you. We're all getting diagnosed this week

1583
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:23,327
This is diagnosis Suites

1584
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,887
Skeletal figure

1585
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,703
And they're all saying what Hillary Clinton

1586
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:33,311
It takes a village to get

1587
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:39,711
Population

1588
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:43,039
Faces and making you a

1589
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:46,111
Destroying the middle class

1590
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,159
And basically

1591
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,951
You know gutting the nation

1592
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,303
It's time to get diagnosed spokes

1593
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:57,375
It really takes

1594
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:01,727
A village to get diagnosed

1595
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:04,799
It's weird how everything he saying is correct

1596
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,079
Even though he thinks

1597
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,103
If you saying it

1598
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,407
Like you should get that nut

1599
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,527
It's a good idea to have a support structure

1600
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,063
Yeah I've also

1601
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,135
Known some people

1602
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:23,487
Interesting thing that I just realized

1603
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:27,071
I've known a couple people who've gone to therapist and psychiatrist

1604
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,351
And they be like

1605
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,471
It's not

1606
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,495
Every

1607
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,031
Psychiatrist that doesn't

1608
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:42,687
I want to find an issue that they can try and help with medication

1609
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:45,503
Appropriate I think maybe you should talk to somebody

1610
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,551
Did that does exist in the world

1611
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:53,439
Not everybody's trying to get everyone in on a shell game like you have high blood pressure but maybe you

1612
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,231
You should just stop eating garbage

1613
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:05,727
He's about to get to this case study and I'd like you to remember

1614
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,263
I'm going to try so hard

1615
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,055
This case study is anecdotal

1616
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,335
It's from a book

1617
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,103
Which means it's

1618
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:14,175
Always the most reliable information

1619
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:18,527
Probably there's a name given but it's obviously it's a good thing

1620
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:24,415
It's a good thing that you're going to do case studies or protect privacy but also this book was written

1621
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,951
26 years ago

1622
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:31,839
Before he even started his investigation before

1623
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:37,983
These State pills we have now.

1624
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,263
Discovered back then

1625
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,103
Think about therapies that we've developed didn't exist 26

1626
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,639
There's a lot

1627
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:50,271
Banking was still a legitimate therapy

1628
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,159
Corporal punishment

1629
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:56,927
Yeah

1630
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,463
Crazy now right

1631
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:04,095
Nuts that seems bananas

1632
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
Nice was weird

1633
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,775
That's a story for another day

1634
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,592
You may have to blast

1635
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:18,176
Damaged are we going to get into a trigger warning for you right now

1636
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
This case study is to

1637
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,784
Takes a village mentality

1638
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:26,624
A global village mentality

1639
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,144
Mind-blowing I'm going to try to raise a document up here for myself you will not see it hopefully

1640
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,728
Technology

1641
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,264
I don't think you understand what's

1642
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,800
Scream like that what's

1643
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,360
The Skype connection was actually being relayed

1644
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,200
Video camera

1645
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:54,016
I'm not sure he knows so he thinks every move something on his

1646
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,296
Green it will play on it

1647
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,600
Infowars.com

1648
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,624
And that's not like

1649
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,280
But also

1650
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,936
Where is Alfred Alfred

1651
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,288
Okay we're still here

1652
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,616
I'm your basic Primitives

1653
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:26,528
Brighter okay. He sounds like it's a short passage from Peter brigands

1654
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:31,904
1991 book toxic Psychiatry 1991 scissor Revelation okay

1655
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,952
I'm just a little bit

1656
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:44,192
When she first became depressed and sought psychiatric help with the recommendation

1657
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:50,592
University Health Service right talk about Agenda 21

1658
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,640
When was Agenda 21

1659
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,664
1992

1660
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,944
Stream

1661
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,808
The Proto

1662
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,720
Animes that you came up with

1663
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,280
Look at my note there

01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,560
Look at my no right there

01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:11,840
There we go

1666
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,912
Book before agenda Social Club

1667
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:20,032
I had that note just in case I forgot I could so eat that was so obvious

1668
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,056
Yeah yeah

1669
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,408
Analogy

1670
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:30,784
Nothing

1671
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,064
Trying to shift back

1672
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:37,440
Whatever conclusion you already have in your mind

1673
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,304
Bugattis so sleepy

1674
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,608

01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,656
3 p.m.

1676
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,264
And well

1677
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:03,552
A lot of stress instead of moral support and insight

1678
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:05,600
Haldol

1679
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,648
Antipsychotic

1680
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:16,864
Major tranquilizer those are all names for that class of drugs over the next four years

1681
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:24,288
Physicians watched her deteriorate neurological

01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:29,152
Motor brain damage

1684
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,688
The diagnosis

1685
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:38,112
Even when she was overtly twitching in her arms and legs instead they switched her from one neuroleptic to another

1686
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:41,440
Including the stelazine in Thorazine

1687
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:48,096
Actually rebuilt

1688
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:52,448
Made the diagnosis

1689
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,008
Permanently physically disabled

1690
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,824
With a 30%

1691
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:02,432
And then bragging says my medical evaluation described her condition

1692
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,480
Grossly disfigured

1693
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:09,088
Severely disabled human being who can no longer control her body

1694
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:17,792
Involving the face neck head shoulders

1695

Nearly the entire body

1696
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,120
Difficult

1697
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:27,776
Be standing sitting or lying down and the difficulties worsen as she attempts to carry out voluntary actions

1698
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:32,896
Nearby furniture

1699
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:39,552
She could hold the lip to a couple only with great difficulty at cetera at cetera

1700
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:45,952
Seriously afflicted

1701
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:52,864
Drugs

1702
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,168
Can't have anything remotely resembling

1703
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,192
A normal

1704
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,216
Life

1705
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,032
That's that's tragic

1706
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,080
That's really sad

1707
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,384
I mean

1708
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,408
That can happen

1709
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,736
Literally anywhere with

1710
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,760
Just about anything

1711
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,528
Sure

1712
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,832
But if you want something she could have tripped

1713
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:19,232
It is one of those things where

1714
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,024
She's dealing with such a

1715
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,304
Unique Circa

1716
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,584
Hey such a

1717
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,608
Such a rare

1718
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:27,936
Always

1719
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
Crushes me

1720
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,520
Hey

1721
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,800
We had one guy

1722
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
This happen

1723
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,104
And it is a tragedy

1724
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,128
It really is

1725
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,712
Worst case scenario kind of

1726
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,272
Bad drug reactions

1727
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,040
And that it's

1728
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,576
That that happened

1729
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,368
It really is

1730
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,160
It's not indicative of the

1731
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,952
Psychiatry is a hole

1732
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:55,840
So I was thinking there's how many it's it's one of those things where it is like

1733
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,864
How many pesos

1734
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,912
Per year are killed by doctor

1735
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,960
Error as opposed to what's going

1736
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,776
A lot of pee

1737
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,056
People are killed by doctor

1738
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,104
There are a lot of that is like in surgery

1739
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,408
Yeah or or just any number of

1740
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,944
Misdiagnosis

1741
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,736
Misdiagnosis

1742
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,552
All of the all of the

1743
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,832
Please different possible out

1744
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:20,416
Still rather go to a f****** doctor then.

1745
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,952
What if it's dr. Wallach

1746
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:25,024
If it's not your Wallach I would take my cat

1747
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,864
He's a really good Veterinary apparently it

1748
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,936
Yeah it's somebody else's cat super strong

1749
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:36,800
Also the use of case studies is

1750
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,360
Illustrative of

1751
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:43,456
You know points you want to make but it's not necessarily it's it doesn't

1752
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,760
It's not really a fair way to make an

1753
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:49,088
Because like if you want to pin all of that on

1754
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,112
Like

1755
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:55,232
The art of Psychiatry if you want to make the argument a there are some

1756
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:01,120
No one's going to no one's going to just before Point good

1757
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,424
My uncle was a psychiatrist

1758
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,240
Kill Roberto

1759
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,264
You didn't

1760
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,544
Okay are we sure

1761
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,080
Yeah

1762
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,944
I don't I don't know how much I want to say about him

1763
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,736
How to spell this out

1764
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:21,088
Okay

1765
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:24,416
I'm not sure I want to tell you

1766
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,976
I don't know his business

1767
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:32,352
I agree I don't I don't know how much is PS4

1768
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,912
Publix

1769
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,192
I took

1770
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:36,960
With your weiner

1771
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,008
Was

1772
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,288
And I think he still is

1773
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,568
Psychiatrist

1774
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,640
And he had a bunch of books about multiple personalities

1775
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,944
Which is

1776
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:52,064
Really

1777
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,600
Like hot.

1778
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,392
Yeah it's now dissociative

1779
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:03,840
Understanding of what it is

1780
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,912
His whole thing and you wrote like two or three books about it

1781
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,472
He believed

1782
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,008
It is clinical opinion

1783
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:12,544
That

1784
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:16,896
Multiple personality disorder is caused by Satanic ritual abuse

1785
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,432
And the Cure is G

1786
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,224
Right

1787
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,576
So he has these books

1788
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,112
And they're full of case study

1789
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,928
They're full of case studies with a pseudonym

1790
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,976
And these horrifying stories

1791
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,000
And then Jesus

1792
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,304
Helping out

1793
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,376
Anti gay conversion therapy

1794
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,144
Hobo

1795
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:48,128
If you knew more about how much avail

1796
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:53,248
But the point I'm trying to make is that like when you have these case studies they can sort of

1797
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,552
Tell the narrative that you want

1798
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,112
To tell without it actually being really based

1799
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,136
In

1800
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:02,720
Butta Butta

1801
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,000
Short Circuit

1802
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:11,168
We love the story tell me the story I get all caught up

1803
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:17,568
Got a middle of got it

1804
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,616
Another human being sure

1805
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,896
And instead

1806
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,688
Warp your perception but then

1807
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,968
Go to the word

1808
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:24,992
Statistics

1809
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,040
In the diagnostic manual

1810
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,368
Still in Port

1811
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,184
Very small

1812
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,488
Some people have said they were

1813
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:36,256
Cured

1814
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,024
Because of an

1815
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:37,792
Anti-gay Kim

1816
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,352
Sure some of them have

1817
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:44,192
Whether or not they have is they probably haven't but they said

1818
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,008
Do you know where you can point to those case studies

1819
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
As being

1820
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:48,544
Oh

1821
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,336
This works

1822
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,616
Large

1823
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,384
Majority

1824
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,432

01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:57,504
Only hurt by people

1827
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,296
Hurting

1828
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,344
People with that narrative

1829
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,648
It is a narrative that deserves

1830
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,440
I agree

1831
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,464
But it is

1832
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:10,304
Is a f****** damaging their deal with

1833
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,608
Reality it deals with the story you want to tell

1834
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:16,704
Story that my uncle and want to tell is that this people

The tricomp want to tell you there's no cats over here

1839
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,072
Data is your telling a story that fits

1840
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,608
The store you've already

1841
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,912
Decided to tell the truth

1842
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:51,264
Dictate where The Story Goes

1843
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,824
Confirmation bias

01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,848
Batman

Love

1846
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,688
Confirmation bias

1847

You would be most angry moment I get angry now whenever I

1866
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,360

Rapidly from any psychiatric drug can be worse

Very dangerous and even life-threatening

1884
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,232
Problems

1885
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:53,376
So this is in no way a recommendation to anybody who may be on one of these drugs to just get it off of it

1886
01:32:54,656 --> 01:33:00,032
Reagan.com breggin calm is the website

1887
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,056
Peter breggin

1888
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:07,456
He's writing a book about withdrawing from psychiatric drugs you recommend should be done by a professional

1889
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,224
Nose

1890
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:18,720
So I think you're probably getting the message now and its investigative report on the number one mind control

1891
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,536
Program the colleges

1892
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
Psychiatrist

1893

Jesus superblue

1894
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:33,568
Fluoride free toothpaste my wife read about this she was very enthusiastic

1895

After being sold out for Infowars life.com its back

1896
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:45,856
Gums Research indicates contribute to the development can contribute to development of heart disease heart

1897
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,624
Heart attacks

1898
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:52,768
When bacteria infect your gums you can enter the bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots

1899
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:58,912
He goes on for like 3 minutes about this great toothpaste

1900
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,936
Hey and you know what

1901
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,728

No negative side effects or withdrawal regular toothpaste

1903
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,944
Super Bowl

1904
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,248
It's created by Alex Jones

1905
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:17,600
You know they do they

1906
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:20,160
They get it from Tom's of Maine

1907
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,744
Alex keep doing this

1908
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:30,656
We get it from the top organic you know what's up in the name

1909
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,192
Vulnerable

1910
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:32,960
Subcon

1911
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:36,800
Space from Tom's of Maine and then he puts

1912
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,848
Colloidal silver and iodine

1913
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,640
In the toothpaste

1914
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,920
Along with

1915
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,968
Peppermint oil and tea tree oil

1916
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:50,368
Dangerous than the colloidal silver when the iodine

1917
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:52,928
X

1918
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:55,744
The peppermint is a little too strong for kids

1919
01:34:56,256 --> 01:35:00,352
So the coming out with a bubble gum flavor

1920
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,120
Do you know

1921
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:02,912
It's it's coming

1922
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:05,984
Bubble gum flavor was very important to me taking medication

1923
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:08,800
It wasn't

1924
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,592
So important

1925
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:15,456
They actually had like Radioactive

1926
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,224
Toothpaste

1927
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:21,600
Did not know that everything everything was Radioactive

1928
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:29,792
The people are like oh look at how amazing all of these are radioactive Things Are

1929
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:35,424
The people would actually have glow-in-the-dark teeth you would clean your floor with glow-in-the-dark because it was Radioactive

1930
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,984
Open had

1931
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,104
They would detonate a nuclear

1932
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,896
A nuclear bomb right

1933
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,664
And the

1934
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,456
Thinking about is

1935
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,224
After that

1936
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,272
When you have that giant cloud

1937
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,552
Maybe we should have an army

1938
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:52,576
March through that

1939
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,112
So they ask

1940
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:02,304
Sew-in no just to hide

1941
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,840
Just to hide in the smoke

1942
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:05,120
Okay so

1943
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:07,168
Thousands of soldiers

1944
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:09,728
Wild up having all kinds of radioactive

1945
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:10,496
Diseases

1946
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:12,288
Because they didn't understand

1947
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:14,336
That was bad for you

1948
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:18,432
So people lost their teeth because they did all of this shed

1949
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,200
Now

1950
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,248
You know why we don't learn about that

1951
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:26,880
Or that globalist probably globalism

1952
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:27,904
Man I wish I could

1953
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,928

1954
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,120

1956
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,736
This this life is just about the fear

1957
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:57,856
This is fear-mongering not the movie Fear

1958
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:03,232
Nordstrom

1959
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:05,536
It's just the fear

1960
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,328
He wants you to be scared

1961
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,096
And also

1962
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:08,864
He has this

1963
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,144

Videos of the fake doctor

1965
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:15,008
Thank God his role play so far has been one

1966
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,288
Confusing

1967
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:22,176
So many different ways

1968
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:23,712
Okay

01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,312
Huddling in a corner

01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,944
Considering that situation

2042
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,480
Accomplished

2043
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,296
Back to the

It's obvious to me

2047
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,976
That you

01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,768

Well I mean

2052
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:33,312
I'm assuming that's related to the drug that you gave me for ADHD of course not

2053
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,128
It couldn't be any relationship to the draw

Uninformed

Mental illness

2108
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:39,424

2109
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:43,008
Never had a conversation with anybody else married

I'm the professional here we get such an idea

2136
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:06,720
Some crazy stuff somewhere

2137
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:12,608
Medicines used to treat them here

2138
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:18,240
So now we get into valproate

2139
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:21,568
These are much heavier drugs

2140
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:23,360
Is much heavier

2141
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:24,896
Potential effects

2142
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,480
And the circus goes on

2143
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,320

2144
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:37,184
I'm toxic Psychiatry about the suit

2145
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:39,744
Very well.

2146
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:46,400
You've got kids with colleges going

2147
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:57,152
Anywhere they don't know

2148
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:00,992
To the left to the right

2149
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:05,088
Just about the end of the Special Report

2150
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,368
So you know

2151
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:10,720
He doesn't long fantasy role-play with a doctor where do you like

2152
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:16,608
Maybe these drugs that you're giving me or make me feel bad and they're creating new things

2153
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,424
Long roleplay

2154
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,192
Do you know

2155
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,216
Situations

2156
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,056
Heavier and heavier medication

2157
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:31,712
And then you heard that from that book from 26 years ago

2158
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:34,016
But if it's not the outcome

2159
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:37,344
You could be on campus being crazy

2160
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:42,208
You're not making a gateway drug marijuana thing

2161
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:44,768
He know who he wishes

2162
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:49,888
He's not even close to that making a point

2163
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,680
There's nothing there

2164
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:56,800
No his point is that literally anything can happen at any time and you should always be afraid

2165
01:47:57,056 --> 01:48:02,432
Respect scientologists more than this

2166
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,712
Just stand on their origin

2167
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:08,576
I know it.

2168
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,856
Secret about how much they hate

2169
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:12,160
Psychiatrist that's what I'm say

2170
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,696
Well

2171
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,024
I think the pill

2172
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,840
L.ron Hubbard

2173
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:21,632
Wasn't allowed to be

2174
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,912
Become a psychiatrist

2175
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:26,240
And so Scientology was born

2176
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,288
And purely out of spite

2177
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,176
Scientology

2178
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:36,224
Scientology is bad

2179
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,552
But you do have to respect a religion that was not built

2180
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:41,088
On anything other

2181
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:42,624
Then pure spice

2182
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:43,904
Yeah sure

2183
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:47,232
That's badass got to give him credit for that

2184
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:50,560
The fact that man is

2185
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:53,120
Noozhawk

2186
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,936
If you synthesize his ark

2187
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,216
It is

2188
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,520
Trigger culture

2189
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:06,176
Space space I completely forgot we started with trigger right there's no way that that has anything to do with

2190
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:13,088
What because that's where his argument begins

2191
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:15,648
There's no such thing as

2192
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,048
If you're okay

2193
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:24,096
It's also

2194
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,912
Because all you read

2195
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:30,240
Yeah version of the world

2196
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:32,800
Oh look at these uppity black

The Shining

2207
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:05,568
If

2208
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:07,104
If we get to the point

2209
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,408
Where we can speak to Scatman Crothers

2210
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,176
No

2211
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:11,456
Get to the point

2212
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:14,016
Where there are no Nations to this show

2213
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,808
God

2214
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:20,160

01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,392
This conclusion

2226
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:53,696
Looks good jobs

2227
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:54,464

01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,192
I think that's the next step

2231
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:05,984
Because

2232
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:12,896

01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,296

Maybe it's that maybe that's brain control maybe I don't know I certainly use a lot of it when I was in college

2252
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,576
Bookstore

2253
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:26,368
Because

2254
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,416
The bookstore

2255
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:35,840
Exactly books in there

2256
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:36,608
Is the book watch

2257
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:42,752
I would go there

2258
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:44,032
And I would get like

2259
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:45,824
And I was drunk

2260
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,360
And I would charge

2261
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:48,384
My student

2262
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,944
It would show up to my parents

2263
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,736
It was a student book

2264
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:57,344
Store I do never question that brain control

2265
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:03,232
The triggering thing in the whole movie

2266
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,768
I'm a victim

2267
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,048
So I can just

2268
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:06,816
Be

2269
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:11,168
Victimized by anything

2270
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:12,448
The grand scheme

2271
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:20,896
Is C-section the psychiatric drugs scrambling brain chemistry that make kids

2272
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:21,920
And say

2273
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:24,224
The strangest things

2274
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:27,040
David

2275
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,320
Spring Jam

2276
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:31,648
As they're developing

2277
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,696
Not kidding around here folks

2278
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:35,488
Chemical warfare

2279
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,304
It is just

2280
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:45,472
Your Generation by generation now

2281
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:50,336
Cool Monopoly Packer Mental Health

2282
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,384
That's where we're at

2283
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:58,272
Roanoke

2284
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:00,576
Thanks John

2285
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:01,600
See you next time

2286
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,648
I think he lost it when he was like

2287
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:09,536
This needs to be thrown over the right way

2288
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:13,632
Special Report

2289
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:17,984
We didn't spend any time really address

2290
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,032
Racist homophobic

2291
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,056
Sexist

2292
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:22,592
All of it is

2293
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,896
It's basically

2294
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:27,712
Basically his entire argument is anytime

2295
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,736
People do things that

2296
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:29,504
She doesn't think

2297
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,576
Are appropriate behavior and that includes

2298
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:38,976
Literally everyone but him and other old white man other group standing up against

2299
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,816
Integrated

2300
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,864
Costumes is just short for

2301
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:46,144
Literally

2302
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,424
Wait a second

2303
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,472
These kids don't want to use the bathroom

2304
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,264
Gender that they were born with

2305
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:57,408
Guess what that is psychiatrist in drugs

2306
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:00,992
Drugs

2307
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,016
Do you know where black people

2308
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:03,552
Came from drugs

2309
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:07,136
He's at

2310
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:12,256
Cuz you know

2311
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:14,816
People have different opinions alive different opinions

2312
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:17,376
And someone who hears this and thinks

2313
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:20,704
All this triggering stuff is a bunch of pussies

2314
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,472
What have you

2315
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:23,008
Let's even take a step back

2316
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,032
He didn't make

2317
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:30,688
Bombshell there was an hour of him

2318
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:37,344
On the are actual sources we looked into the sources

2319
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:46,560
The underpinning of 25% of the population at campuses

2320
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,096
It has a diagnosis

2321
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:51,424
Which doesn't mean anything

2322
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:58,592
If it's not literally true it's not accurate because a lot of people go to doctors to get Adderall

2323
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,640
Very least

2324
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:03,456
It is a gross mischaracterization of

2325
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:04,736
What the problem Act

2326
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:06,528
Etsy

2327
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,552
Very least

2328
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:08,576
Now

2329
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:11,392
If you add in all the things we know about him

2330
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:13,440
It is most likely a

2331
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:18,048
Huge shitshow of entitled white male b*******

2332
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:18,816
And big

2333
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:25,472
And then the other step we have to take

2334
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:28,288
Oh yeah we can surround

2335
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:30,336
But the other piece of it

2336
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:31,872
Is the

2337
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:33,408
Advise he's giving

2338
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,944
Or the assessment

2339
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:36,480
Is literally Dane

2340
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:40,832
Yeah you and I are both people who struggle with mental illness throughout our lives

2341
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:42,880
I don't want to end this on a Saturday

2342
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:47,232
I think it's I think it's a hopeful note to say that quite literally

2343
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:50,048
I would be dead if I had not gone to see if

2344
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:57,216
Exactly what I was going to say I was going

2345
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:59,776
To say had friends who have killed

2346
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,056
Yes

2347
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:04,640
A lot of it had to do with them not

2348
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,920
Seeking help the way they need

2349
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:07,968
And that's real

2350
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:11,040
Isn't that good

2351
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:14,368
What you're doing is a disservice to people who need help

2352
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:18,464
When you look at it realistically and say hey you know what there is overdiagnosed

2353
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,488
6 / 4

2354
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:20,256
Prescription

2355
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:21,280
That's a realist

2356
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:22,560
Discussion to have

2357
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:24,608
System that has

2358
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:28,448
Flaws and you point those out and you search to correct those

2359
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,472
That is good

2360
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:32,544
When you say a system has flaws so that mean

2361
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,592
Every single part of that is wrong

2362
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:35,616
You get

2363
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:36,384
The

2364
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:37,920
Government we have now

2365
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:40,480
Yeah and that's why I wanted to cover this

2366
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:45,088
A little bit outside of what we normally do but it's just like

2367
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:50,208
You're such a f****** a****** in this is what Alex Jones chooses to put on his show

2368
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:51,744
So it is still him

2369
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,280
Yeah it's not like

2370
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:56,096
It wasn't literally him saying these things

2371
01:57:56,608 --> 01:58:02,752
He was tacitly endorsing these two days he was talking about how this is some of the most powerful

2372
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:04,032
Important information

2373
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:06,848
God and it's not information

2374
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:08,640
We we would like

2375
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:12,224
One thing that I do like about this

2376
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:15,040
That I do like

2377
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:17,856
I find this I find this to be fun thing

2378
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:21,184
Yeah but occasionally there is something it's like

2379
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,464
Oh I

2380
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:23,488
I think we

2381
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,560
Are fighting this f****** horrifying monster

2382
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:27,840
Like

2383
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:30,400
Alex Jones is a wackadoo crazy cat

2384
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:34,496
In a way that is

2385
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:36,032
Farless

2386
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:38,336
Fun

2387
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:41,408
It doesn't matter cuz no one listens

2388
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:46,016
David goddamn the only platforms

2389
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,576
F****** Jon rappoport has is his

2390
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,600
Angelfire

2391
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,160
Bulshit

2392
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:54,976
And then also the fourth hour of Alex Jones

2393
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,304
Turn it off for the 4th

2394
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:01,120
I would hope so

2395
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:04,704
Irresponsible

2396
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,984
I'm very dangerous

2397
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:09,568
It's not irresponsible it's an active

2398
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,336
Attack

2399
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,128
It really is

2400
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,664
But the attack is he response

2401
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:14,944
Yeah

2402
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:17,504
And if you responsible for anyone to broadcast

2403
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:18,784
That and I apologize

2404
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,808
We just did

2405
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:21,600
But we did with commentary

2406
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:26,208
Anytime somebody broadcast

2407
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:27,744
Fifty Shades

2408
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:30,560
The movie irresponsible irresponsible

2409
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:33,120
As long as we're making fun of it though

2410
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:34,912
Pretty great

2411
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:40,288
Guys the bottom line is if you need help go I'll talk to somebody

2412
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:46,176
If you don't feel about it

2413
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:48,992
No one is going to force you down some weird rabbit hole

2414
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,528
You don't want to take a pill

2415
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:51,552
Don't take

2416
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:56,160
You have your own agency

2417
01:59:57,952 --> 02:00:04,096
The proliferation of the internet being tons of information you can find out about any pill that someone wants

2418
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,888
Are prescribed for you

2419
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:06,912
And you can

2420
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:09,472
Yeah look it up and decide for yourself

2421
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:11,264
If it's a path you want to go down

2422
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:12,288
But

2423
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:15,360
And it's also you shouldn't diagnose yourself

2424
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:20,480
No you can come in you can go into a conversation with somebody thinking that you have

2425
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:22,528
A basic understanding of

2426
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:25,600
But it should be a conversation

2427
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:28,416
Yeah

2428
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:31,232
It's not a dominant thing from one side or the other

2429
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:34,560
Find a psychiatrist who wants to work with you

2430
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:38,656
And not tell you what to do and also don't tell the psychiatrist went to

2431
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:43,520
But that's that's the bottom line

2432
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:46,080
Dirty I've bailed on a couple many

2433
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:47,616
Many in my life

2434
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:53,248
Popeyes
