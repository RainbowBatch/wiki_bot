1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

2
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
Worship at the altar

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,584
Alex drew

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
Indeed we are.

8
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
What's up

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
Is

10
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
This this button stuff is

11
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,872
Going along I have a prediction that I think it'll probably

12
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,176
Every button will be out by the end of the year

13
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,504
I'm giving myself that kind of sort of

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
Window

15
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,880
Yeah but it's really fun I mean one of the things that's really nice is a going through and

16
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
Addressing the envelopes

17
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,232
Some stuff that I see a lot of names that are like

18
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
People from way back yeah you know and it's really nice to know that these people like a lot of people are still with us

19
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
You know that's that's really

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
Exciting

21
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
And then the other thing

22
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,592
The second Wonka button is in the mail

23
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,712
Brightspot Willy Wonka button

24
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,272
Somewhere

25
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,576
Yeah

26
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
As luck may have it

27
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
This is an international button

28
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,000
This one is going out of the United States

29
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
So someone

30
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,144
Modern America Patriot fans are not going to like that I'll be looking out

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,752
As eyes look as long as it didn't go to the queen landed in the United

32
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:25,152
Sure that's true I knew it I knew she was going to ask for one and then she died

33
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,968
Well thanks for going to Queen Beatrix

34
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Whatsyourprice

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
My bright spot is I started watching the show called Welcome to wrexham

36
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,840
Apparently Rob mcelhenney from It's Always Sunny and then Ryan

37
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
Reynolds from being a dick and movies

38
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,936
Body like

39
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,496
Zoo second-tier

40
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
Football Club

41
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
In wrexham

42
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
In Wales

43
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,712
Which is like the old estate site it's really cool story about the backstory of the town and it's got the oldest International

44
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Stadium

45
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
At anywhere at all this cool stuff

46
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,600
And then they turned them into like the Mighty Ducks

47
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
Right and that's really cool

48
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:12,768
But then because Ryan Reynolds and Rob mcelhenney or riches s*** and they can get all these sponsorship deals

49
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
Now they're in a league where they are getting ice

50
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
Huge budget

51
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,912
Compared to everybody else so they're like the bad guys

52
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,216
The same time because of the way football works

53
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
They're in a little early so what they're really trying to do

54
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
Is get out of that League to be the underdog in the higher League

55
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,504
But there's another errand over dog Underdog

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
Kind of situation

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
And it's really cool

58
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
Cuz it talks about the town which

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,208
Is more interesting then tonight

60
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
The corrupting influence of money

61
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
They like if you have too much resources you can't even be the thing you walk away weed which is the underdog

62
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:54,240
They're not they're they're buying people from the upper League

63
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
That's because

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
You know like it's it's difficult

65
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Difficult

66
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
Sure and they're trying their best

67
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:05,760
And there's all that fun stuff but it's amazing really good documentary in its its Mighty Ducks ass

68
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,064
While you're on the subject shows

69
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
Contraption master I finished a couple episodes

70
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,167
I believe you well

71
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,055
And then I've been needing another show cuz I watched all the survivors

72
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,919
Making the buttons right towards shows that are about people surviving

73
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
And then

74
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,063
I tried to Naked and Afraid but as I told you

75
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,695
Play maked Hermosa tomorrow that afraid

76
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,767
The Show recently called alone

77
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,119
And it's they are straight-up alone my partner loves

78
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,679
I am I'm into it I watch the first season

79
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
And I think it's great

80
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
Cuz it's 10 people they have to record

81
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,847
Themselves in the first episode of the first season

82
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
What cables got eaten by a bear

83
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
I was thinking

84
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
How would they stop that

85
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
No

86
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,855
Evacuate somebody who is worried that there were like

87
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Big cats

88
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Around

89
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,463
3 hour drive away

90
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,535
That's a lot of time for a big cat

91
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
They're quick

92
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:29,215
Yeah it's like right there I've always thought like the survival shows often don't have enough serve

93
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,287
Survival aspects

94
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
This gives that

95
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
Something bad could happen here

96
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
Appreciate

97
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,431
And then the second thing

98
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Is head

99
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
There is no end date

100
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,319
Nope they just are out whoever goes login

101
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,903
They might as well have their hand on a car for a year

102
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:53,023
Yeah I don't want to like spoil anything about it or anything but like in the first season

103
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
The beginning of it it's really survival base traveling make fire

104
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,383
I have to survive because they figured out like

105
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
Okay I can get to

106
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
Some food here

107
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
I have a 10

108
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,319
I made a guitar and a boat yet totally totally just so bored

109
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Just like I have

110
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,671
I have defeated existing but now existing

111
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,255
Is impossible to do that conversation of like

112
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
Am I proof

113
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:33,215
Who came in second cuz I watch the first season the guy who came in second and it was after like 3

114
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,751
Three or four months

115
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
And it was

116
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,639
Like you were just hearing him talk to a camera and you feel like he's talking

117
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
To you and then you stopped and you realized

118
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
He hasn't spoken to another human being from

119
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
The other guy is just like quoting Edgar Allan Poe

120
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,279
Georgia vaguely hillbilly

121
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,351
Or at least has a little bit of that

122
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:06,239
Deeply philosophical hillbilly

123
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
I like it

124
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:14,687
Fall off my big difference between alone and Naked and Afraid

125
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,991
I loved alone because they keep

126
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,295
Building their shelters until it looks

127
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:25,695
Cool enough for me to live it like that one play of months I know that would have build a shelter and I was like man

128
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
I kind of wish I was living there

129
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
Call the guy who made a guitar and

130
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,607
His mind before he decided to leave he was like

131
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,423
Think about make a sauna neck

132
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,751
You couldn't also

133
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
You got to go you got to go bad

134
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:45,663
I was talking to my friend Angela cuz I really enjoyed

135
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
I didn't know if

136
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
How it works

137
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
Like the only complaints

138
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
The only complaint in this is

139
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
This goes to what we were talking about

140
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
They should not tell the person who survived the longest that the second-to-last person has quit

141
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:08,191
They should see how long I had that thought

142
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,287
Someone's just out there for like six extra mods

143
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:19,199
$500,000 a lot of money that's 6 months worth of work let him stay out there

144
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,551
What is that hourly

145
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,111
They have no ability to gauge

146
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
How long other people have stayed

147
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,023
One guy who's the third to quit was like I'm definitely first

148
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Totally

149
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
You just be like okay

150
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
4 month

151
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,543
There's a couple people still out there meanwhile two months ago everyone's gone it is a sort of prisoner's dilemma ask

152
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,151
Back to because you have to be in your head like well I'm a great Survivor obvious

153
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,199
Because I'm 4 months into this

154
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
Is the TV show man

155
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
There's got to be

156
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,135
9 other great survivors on the show they could be

157
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:05,535
Pick up beer for a year if you know that they're going to come and tell you when you've won then that takes away that meant

158
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Light app

159
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,911
F****** with your head like maybe I want

160
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:16,287
You know it should be a surprise if you win you are alone

161
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
I'm going to watch

162
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
Sounds good

163
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,455
Took Jordan today we have episode to go over and what I thought we

164
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Might do

165
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,343
He's talking about the trial court

166
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
Discuss Alex's press conference

167
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,487
But he gave on the steps

168
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,791
Of the courthouse

169
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
I think that there's there's a

170
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
The points that I want to make

171
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
And

172
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
Probably merits Focus

173
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Okay

174
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
In This Moment before we do

175
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
What the hell

176
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
The first

177
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Basket of muffins

178
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
Thank you very much

179
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
Box thank you so much and I'll probably walk

180
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:05,439
Next, Ohio thank you so much

181
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:12,095
Thank you very much room temperature

182
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:18,751
Level above that one up to the front because it's so important people know about

183
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:24,383
Relevant you're going to get pushed up and if it's

184
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
Such an important social message

185
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,735
It's a PS4

186
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,903
Feral swine

187
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,255
Ted Cruz is a spineless sack of jelly thank you so much

188
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
I have

189
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
Risen above

190
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Miami

191
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
And then we're going

192
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
To come back

193
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
And I'm going to start the show over

194
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
F*** you

195
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
F*** you

196
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
At the end of the day

197
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
F*** you and your new world order

198
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
She wrote in on

199
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
All your s***

200
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Maybe today

201
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby

202
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Tomorrow

203
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
And you never see me again

204
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
What I want to do

205
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
I never want to come back

206
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Apologize to

207
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
To the crew in the listener's yesterday that

208
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
Was legitimately have

209
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Better tomorrow

210
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
He's not

211
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Is that

212
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
He sucks sounds

213
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,023
So we recording this on Thursday evening closing arguments

214
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,631
Today and so when this comes out every Friday

215
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,959
You're listening to this there may be a verdict

216
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,847
For tomorrow who knows how long the jury will deliberate on this could be till next week

217
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
But I think

218
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
That's of the

219
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,503
Course of the content of this trial and the

220
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
Testimony that we heard was

221
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,695
Something with the stuff that you hear about Alex

222
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
Whether it be the business

223
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Practices or the

224
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,399
Yeah I think that's a guy for the Super Bowl the Matt Miller guy was a

225
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
You know certainly that

226
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
It's not like

227
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
The biggest thing in the world champ

228
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,079
Crippling to Alex Azar

229
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
The lot of that stuff is there and then

230
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
I to the side of that all of the

231
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Humanizing

232
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,087
And the flushing out of the people's

233
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
Experiences

234
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
Other than that

235
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
The sort of

236
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
Discussion of their loved ones yet

237
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
Enough to

238
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
2

239
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Yeah to wrestle with

240
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,959
Yeah it is it is very much like I feel like

241
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
Everybody who wanted their say

242
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Got there safe

243
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
And they got

244
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
To tell their story and their story was

245
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Very very

246
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Variant

247
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Emotionally affecting

248
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
Powerful

249
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
And the way that they have

250
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
All

251
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
Turned their lives

252
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Listen to something

253
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
That is

254
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
I mean just

255
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,351
You know it is it something that's stronger than I think I could ever

256
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
Accomplished you know like it is that kind of

257
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,751
God will never have to find out

258
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Just

259
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:37,407
Yeah words almost fail me in terms of the process of this

260
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Blast

261
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,343
Until we reach the end of the the trial in the testimony and closing arguments

262
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
End up with the plaintiffs lawyers

263
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,951
Laying out really

264
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,791
Concise argument about what they have discussed

265
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
There's like the appeal

266
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,727
To the emotions of the case scores respect for that but also the cause and effect

267
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
Alex's behavior and

268
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,615
The grief that was caused to these people

269
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
Then then

270
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Norm

271
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Paris

272
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,223
For the defense

273
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,039
Scientist going to play a 20-minute video

274
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
His own show

275
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
I thought that was strange

276
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:27,327
I mean I heard him I mean I watched the video and was

277
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,679
Focused on it because for some reason I thought there must be some sort of

278
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
Content reason

279
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
That he would play this video

280
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
And when you watch it you're like

281
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:43,455
I think you just didn't want to do 20 minutes of his closing argument I think it was Alex said play this or you're fired

282
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,855
That's my argument that Alex in Norman wanted to make this whole

283
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,695
Full-time is that the video the plaintiffs are showing of been taken out of context

284
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
And understand

285
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,559
What they're playing

286
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,607
So now in the closing statement

287
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
That's when Norm has disability

288
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Need to do that

289
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,007
But this is kind of b******* because the exact same argument

290
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
That they use applies here

291
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,127
This is just like a 19-minute video from a larger show

292
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,479
The context of this video shouldn't be insisting you have to watch the whole show

293
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,551
And to be honest Alex's shows are generally emotional outburst

294
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:25,951
That are the result of some other stimulus so in order to understand the whole show you kind of need to watch the day before

295
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
The day before showing

296
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Contact

297
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,375
You can see how this argument spirals out of hand easily because it's

298
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
Meaningless

299
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:39,007
Alex defends himself by saying the things are out of context if you need to see the whole clip because

300
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:44,383
He wants to be able to set the arbitrary parameter for what you need to see in order to be qualified to judge

301
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
Hate b*******

302
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:50,015
Also there's at least one added in the video that Norm plays so even that doesn't even

303
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,855
Hold up I'm not just that but what Norm did

304
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,695
In his closing argument I felt like was essentially flat

305
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,767
Every rule has been made so far up yet

306
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
The video

307
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:06,399
Had like five claims that you could not make in that courtroom will get to that

308
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
It it was

309
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,751
Explain saying that Norm had at least six or seven

310
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
Out-and-out lies that I know he knows our troop that's like physically speaking in the world we can't have

311
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,943
But I know Norm pattis

312
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,271
Note that is not true and he saying it in front of a

313
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,415
Judge you know so I don't think the video did as much to help Alex's cases he might have thought it would

314
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,559
Beyond sounding completely insane rambling about how Megyn Kelly totally wanted to f*** him and he could prove it if

315
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
He was recording at the right time

316
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
Yo man Alex also touches on a number of

317
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
F*****-up claim

318
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
1

319
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,543
He says that it's proven that the Wikileaks releases couldn't

320
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,871
Have been hacked and where the result of someone on-site download in the files

321
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
This is part of his Seth rich

322
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Conspiracies and it's based on

323
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,503
The comments made by his buddy William Binney

324
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
It was shown

325
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,599
Benny that you was totally wrong and that the documents could have

326
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,159
Easily been downloaded remotely and Bingham

327
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
Chanted his claim

328
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,511
But Alex is never corrected himself or updated his talking point

329
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:11,167
So just off the bat in this closing statement Alex's reaffirming his belief that Hillary Clinton had Seth Rich killed for

330
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,215
Releasing the WikiLeaks

331
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:18,847
Purchase family has successfully sue people for claiming I was going to say in court he did a thing that

332
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
Gets people put in court

333
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:25,503
2 oz repeats completely false conspiracy claims about Hillary selling uranium to Russia

334
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
3

335
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,111
Forgive my language but Alex call Sandy Hook a Tar-Baby

336
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
Pete's conspiracies about Sandy Hook

337
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
Direct

338
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,303
Yeah he said that it's a plaintiff video where he said that and and they were like

339
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
That's going to do it

340
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,935
For Alex demonstrable lies about what he said about Sandy Hook

341
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,775
He directly contradicts videos that have already been shown in court

342
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:52,383
If this video shows anything it's completely untrustworthy source

343
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,919
Particularly about his own action

344
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,759
Five Alex claims that the Syrian gas attacks or false

345
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
6

346
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:05,439
In this clip Alex says that he got a cease-and-desist / retraction request about Sandy Hook that gave him a month to

347
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
And he didn't

348
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Because he felt like he had done anything wrong

349
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
That's in the

350
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
Play I was insane

351
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,471
IFixit Alex severely overestimate his own ability to make a point

352
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,287
He's playing his video because the underlying point

353
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,895
He's trying to make is that he's totally cool did nothing wrong in the media is attacking them

354
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
Sandy Hook because he composes things at the

355
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
The media doesn't want the public to know

356
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,039
Like how asada super cool right

357
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
The thing is though that

358
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
He makes no sense

359
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,927
I don't see him lay out his defense

360
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:43,071
Then they would get it and it'll be game over for the plaintiff's but this video is uncompelling to anyone who doesn't already believe Alex

361
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
The s***

362
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:49,983
It's particularly useless to show people who have already seen evidence that the things he's saying in this video are b*******

363
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
If the jury already has

364
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
I get the impulse on Alex's bar

365
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,943
I think but in this setting it actually kind of makes his image look much worse

366
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
It is

367
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
It is

368
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
I think

369
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
It's the wet cement

370
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Problem

371
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,135
You know like if he'd gotten to play that video right

372
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
Color the jury's perception

373
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,791
With that video at least a little bit

374
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,583
You know maybe that does something

375
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,143
Because the cement is dry as f***

376
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,447
His video bounces off of it and you can

377
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Can see every

378
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,287
F****** problem I'm not sure if that would

379
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
Fully work

380
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,895
But that Dynamic is

381
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
Very much real big

382
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
You show this video in advance and then maybe you'll have a kernel of Doubt whenever you hear him say these people are actor

383
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
Yeah yeah

384
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
Free streaming that like

385
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:46,559
Like everything is out of context that's what he does free frames events that you don't know the

386
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
Complete details about

387
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,935
So he's trying to do the exact same thing here the only problem is

388
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
He's not allowed to talk by him

389
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
To get to play this

390
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
Troubling clip full of b*******

391
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
Alex's used to facing no consequences being surrounded by losers on his payroll who know their unemployable anywhere else

392
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:10,367
Interviewing con artists who are financially and professionally invested in maintaining the illusion that Alex is right

393
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,487
And being able to hang up on or bully any callers who disagree with him in any meaningful way

394
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:21,375
He's used to his explanations for things working because the people he's explaining things to her already in his camp

395
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
The uninitiated here Resort

396
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
People who seen evidence

397
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
The contrary

398
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,007
This video just seems insane

399
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,847
What would have been useful for Norm to do would be to take

400
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:36,735
The clips of Alex saying that Sandy Hook was fake with actors that were played in court and then show the full video that the clip

401
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,295
From which of them reveal that the original clip

402
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
Was taken out of context

403
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,391
Alex is actually just asking questions or Playing devil's advocate

404
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,743
Absolutely can't do that though because those clips are out of context the problem

405
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,863
Old Norm can do is insinuate that the larger context completely absolves Alex

406
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
But it's b*******

407
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:00,031
Norm's other arguments that Alex's actions were driven by a fear that the government was going to take the gun

408
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
It's not by a desire to endanger

409
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
Grieving parents for money

410
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
But

411
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,015
The reality is that I was in danger grieving parents in order to push his narrative surrounding the fears about the government take

412
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,111
Which is something he embellishes exaggerated sin sensational izes

413
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
In order to make money

414
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,976
It's not one thing or the other is Norma's pretending it's

415
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
Dynamic system that Alex uses

416
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,144
Don't understand this he's been a guest on the show numerous times

417
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
If you watch this

418
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,496
How to get the sense that Norm doesn't believe a goddamn word he's saying

419
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,568
It's just that there's no other real way to argue this

420
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
And the bravado that he had about

421
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
The families

422
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,432
Exaggerating their grief

423
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Probably

424
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
That's the sort of

425
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,136
Talking isn't going to play too well with a jury after days of hearing from said family members about the pain they've been doing

426
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,464
Yeah he tried to bring that exaggeration Point backup

427
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,304
But you heard how much more apologetic and careful he was about it

428
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,632
As opposed to the sort of cocky swinging Dickie had in the open

429
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
I was trying

430
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
Nor was desperate to try and make this

431
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
Lytical in his closing

432
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,288
Trying to shoehorn in references to Trump

433
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,104
And getting shot down with objections along the way

434
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:13,248
He also tried to make a mockery of the idea that the plaintiff's who testified and said that they didn't know what Alex's

435
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
Positions on guns

436
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,344
Where they they didn't notice position

437
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
I don't want to

438
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
Touch on this for a second

439
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:25,024
When you live by the sword it's not a certainty that you're going to die by the sword

440
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
If you do

441
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,352
You have an obligation to accept your death by the sword

442
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,240
Alex is most consistent defensive himself is that he's being taken out of context and that you can't understand what he saying

443
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Short clips

444
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,848
I think this is bulshit but it's the foundation of norms defense

445
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
And their position

446
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
So he has to accept

447
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:47,040
It's all good fun for him when he wants to claim that Alex mocking Robbie Parker was out of context

448
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,368
It's so weird how he doesn't realize that this Cuts both ways

449
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:56,768
He can show the jury a clip of Alex saying they're coming for our guns or they're staging shootings to take our guns and

450
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,352
If he's being intellectually consistent he should know that the jury camp

451
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,168
Possibly know what Alex's position on guns is

452
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
Without watching the whole video

453
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
Innocent

454
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,592
Norm's underlying defense strategy precludes him from being able to expect that he's able to

455
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,616
Approve anything

456
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,944
This is also a corollary of one of Alex's other defense

457
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:21,856
What he's accused of anything and then shown video with him doing or saying the thing he's accused of his contacts.

458
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
Satire

459
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,672
If that is what I want to say

460
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,744
And if the entirety of his on-air career isn't allowed

461
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,816
Be shown in his custody hearing because he's putting on a performance

462
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,888
Then why should the plaintiffs in this case take him at his word

463
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
Bernie says something on air

464
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,728
He could lay out his entire philosophy on guns

465
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,312
Succinctly on his show and the plaintiffs would have every right to say

466
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
The wealthy did say

467
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:46,176
See things on are they have no way of knowing what Alex's sincere positions are

468
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,272
How to get a lot of mileage out of people knowing he's a fraud and

469
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:55,136
McGuire's where you can wiggle out of trouble by disowning the things he says on Erin's being Seattle

470
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,160
Satire

471
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
But the other side of this

472
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
Is this

473
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:04,608
If you want Norm to insist that the Sandy Hook families are suing them because of their opposition to his position on guns

474
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,192
You have no right to claim that they even know what those positions are

475
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,496
It's called being hoisted on your own petard

476
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,568
There is bad

477
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,128
Told you can't understand what I'm saying on air

478
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,224
Expected you get to use that other opposite for your own purposes

479
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
It was a bad closing

480
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,344
Statement describes full all around

481
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
And f******

482
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,184
Yeah yeah the moment where Norm

483
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,232
I mean I really thought the

484
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Set Norm should have been packed

485
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
Buy likes

486
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:39,168
Deal of law because the moment he was like full from Night Court

487
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
What attacks them

488
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,008
Cuz he was playing the video

489
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:49,408
And the norm said he was trying to insinuate the thing that he's been trying to insinuate the entire f****** time and

490
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:55,808
Everyone has stopped him and they still let him do it and then the objection was sustained but it doesn't f****** matter cuz again

491
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
He got to say

492
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
Why did they come with this

493
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Ed with this lawsuit

494
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:05,792
It's because of the guy who said good job Alex right instead of saying cuz he can't say it's Trump

495
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:12,192
Yeah he can't say they're coming after Trump but it can't play a video where Alex references Trump and then references

496
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,496
Maybe he was referencing

497
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,848
Pronoun still refer to a thing

498
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,176
I think I was painfully obvious

499
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,224
I don't think the jury's dumb

500
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,528
I think that they get that too

501
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
To the extent

502
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,856
They have any awareness

503
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Of

504
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Why

505
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
It's inappropriate

506
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,488
This Behavior understand like

507
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,584
This is this guy's trying to do something he's not allowed to do

508
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,656
Yeah and I already have faith that those bill

509
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:47,008
Sucks that out I don't think it's too hard after a like eventually

510
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,336
No matter what you're like oh this kid is trying to break into

511
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Do the cookie jar

512
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
I get it then and then

513
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,688
Dude with the

514
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:01,088
Attorney prayer or whatever the f*** f*** that was rough what the fuk was that was embarrassing

515
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,672
Corroborated that that an attorney's prayer

516
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,816
Has anybody said that attorneys pray like that is any attorney ever prayed like that I could see it being like

517
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
Placemat

518
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:19,520
Grandma your lawyer grandma gets it for you

519
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
Circle these words of the prayer

520
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
That was tough

521
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Yeah and then

522
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,480
Nor might have protested a little too much about how proud he is to keep

523
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:34,624
He kept saying like I'm exactly where I live. So proud of you

524
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,672
Felt a little bit like somebody

525
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,208
Talking themselves up of

526
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:44,608
Like no no no I am not ashamed to be here it was it was a little bit like a shirtless

527
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,424
Naked man walking into Congress being like all I'm so mister

528
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,216
Chris Smith I am going to f******

529
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,312
Filibuster this s*** everyone's going to be like look at this

530
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
Genius

531
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
I think we

532
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,688
Are foolish for except expecting more

533
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
From a guy who drops

534
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,784
Does pancit has the underwear course we are of course we are

535
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,880
Norm's Behavior throughout the entirety of this proceeding has been

536
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,672
Shameful

537
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,720
I hope you enjoyed

538
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,584
Being second banana on Infowars to Barnstead a lawyer

539
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,400
Yeah I don't know I don't know really what

540
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,496
I can't I find it difficult to imagine he'll

541
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,824
I have too much cash I wouldn't

542
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,616
I wouldn't hire him

543
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
It's just been bad

544
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
But

545
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
I think there's something else that is

546
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
And that is Alex

547
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
So he went

548
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
To Connecticut

549
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
Little bit back

550
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,184
Justified

551
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
Add a little bit of a meltdown

552
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,048
Had to get away from The Buttery

553
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
Right went back to Austin to do his bulshit with Barnes say the same thing as fake again

554
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,496
Flew back to Connecticut

555
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
Right

556
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
And then the idea was that

557
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,128
Nor was going to call him as a witness for the defense

558
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
The only Witness

559
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Yeah

560
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,760
And this game was being played

561
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
And Alex came back

562
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,904
And now that both sides have rested the closing documents have been made

563
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
We know that he did not testify

564
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,280
Like Brave sir Robin he ran away

565
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
It's

566
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,376
He went to Connecticut for

567
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
Essentially no reason

568
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Except

569
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
Well

570
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Promotion

571
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
He went

572
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
2

573
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Publicity

574
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
He went to get attention

575
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
And

576
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
It is my firm contention that

577
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
He never

578
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,272
Even considered

579
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,320
Testifying again

580
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
He went

581
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,440
Specifically to get as much attention as he could

582
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
With the

583
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Pretense

584
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,792
That maybe I'll testify

585
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
Or maybe I will

586
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:55,168
He went there because he knew he was going to get that press conference right outside the court

587
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
Always gets it because

588
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
Everybody who works in the media is fuc

589
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
Here a little bit adapter

590
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
This press conference

591
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
Because I found it

592
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
Tubi

593
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Great

594
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,576
The best quotes

595
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
None of those things

596
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,904
Here's where we start off

597
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:21,024
And I should give you a little bit of a sort of tableau

598
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,816
Alex & Barnes

599
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
AR

600
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Standing behind so camera

601
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:31,008
Now little bit later Alex Alex

602
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,616
Stowaway well

603
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,712
We'll actually find out why Barnes is there a little bit later and it's very sad

604
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:45,344
A little bit later Alex is talking to some people and Fielding questions

605
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,392
And he's holding up a copy of his book

606
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:51,232
So obviously like this is all this

607
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,536
Getting your your product

608
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
On the news

609
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,888
This is the game that's being played

610
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,448
Bruce standing there with Bart

611
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
I really

612
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,288
For being here today

613
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,592
Alex said f*** you at that point

614
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
Constitutional

615
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
First Amendment

616
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,688
Criminal lawyer who also worked on

617
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,504
For several years he can give you documented evidence

618
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
We gave them all the

619
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Discovery

620
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,320
Case

621
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
The Poltergeist

622
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
Because I'm the villain

623
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
That deserves

624
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
To be found guilty by the

625
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Kangaroo court

626
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,024
So yeah Barnes was working on the case

627
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,912
If you have heard the deposition episodes that you'll know this but just to revisit

628
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,496
This is Brittany Paws testifying under oath

629
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
That they're considering suing Barnes

630
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
I went over this a little bit with me

631
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
The kind of company decided one way

632
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Play or another

633
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
We have not decided

634
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,152
They're considering suing their previous lawyers for malpractice

635
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,176
Sprite

636
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
Justin Bieber

637
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
Totally clear

638
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,808
They also discuss which lawyers there was a problem with

639
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
I'm not sure about

640
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Barnes

641
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
Bobby bonds

642
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,856
You can tell there is a heavy bar

643
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,904
Barnes and then exhale

644
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
I got some issues with bar

645
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
That's a

646
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:04,096
Personal Excel that is a woman who is talk to Barnes and when I do not like

647
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,216
Conversely someone who has is a lawyer and is looked

648
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,032
What happened except is like

649
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
This is exasperatingly

650
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,128
I can't get into any of this but

651
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,688
I have an issue with Barnes

652
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
Good good guy too

653
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
Explain how you

654
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,368
Did this case by the book

655
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,024
Good guy to bring with you for your dumb publicity stunt in front of the courthouse

656
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
Keep in mind

657
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,608
The people in the court

658
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
House

659
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Are having their day in court

660
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,216
They're doing something

661
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
Incredibly difficult

662
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,848
They're being disrespected by Norm routinely

663
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
And

664
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
This is what Alex is doing

665
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Wow that's going on

666
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,040
Operate II

667
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
I need I need

668
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,672
This to be hammered into the head of every journalist alive

669
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
Like with a

670
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
F****** hammer

671
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
When you give Alex that prescon

672
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
Outside of the Court

673
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:12,192
There's two things you're showing your showing the difference between what you're allowed to do inside the cork

674
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
88 a wall separate

675
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,032
Being allowed to lie

676
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:20,896
To the entire world and being allowed to f****** lie to a judge

677
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Right

678
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
And then second

679
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,504
If you are giving him that press

680
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:29,856
You're the editor forcing somebody to go give him that press conference

681
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
Who are you doing this for

682
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,720
You're not doing it for you're not helping the families at all

683
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,792
But you're not helping measuring officers it

684
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
You're not helping

685
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
Anybody

686
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
But Alex

687
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
And I guess

688
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,424
The corporation you f***

689
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
King work for

690
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,776
Yeah those are the people that you care about if that's what you're going to do

691
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
Those are the people you care about

692
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,104
Give up any other

693
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
F******

694
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,712
Argue many give them a little bit less of a hard time because

695
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
Some of them were probably

696
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,016
On the beach

697
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,344
I know that you're a better person that I assure

698
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,464
One thing that sticks out to me about what you're saying is he does highlight the difference between what you could say in court

699
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
You can say it outside on the steps

700
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
And

701
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
I think

702
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,352
That imbalance

703
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Should be

704
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
Chao 2 hour

705
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:20,032
What's your first amendment right that's kind of why I think

706
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,872
You know I get a little uncomfortable with your instinct to Barca

707
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
Two people in

708
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
You know whatever

709
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,064
That is why someone like you should actually have to be there for all the press conferences

710
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,368
What in the courtroom people ask you polite question

711
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:40,768
Be a piece of s*** because nobody else will be and he's going to be

712
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,608
You want it only exists in the wilderness of these steps totally

713
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:51,008
Then I will be a bear or whatever because the bailiff

714
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,568
Will come and stop me from interrupt

715
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Sing him

716
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
That's f*****

717
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,432
Yeah I'm protect

718
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Hemet

719
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,624
Make sure he's okay and nobody's mean to him difference I suppose

720
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,648
Is that like

721
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:14,560
You have the awareness that you yelling at him is disrespectful to the court itself as well

722
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,376
Disrespectful to what the families and all them are doing

723
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:24,032
I think that's another thing that Alex weaponizes got like people of good heart and good conscience went to make a scene

724
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,104
And treat him the way he deserves to be treated on the staff

725
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,176
And this is a result

726
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:36,576
This is why you I do need to be there is because I was in if you recall I went to the f***

00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
King Lou

728
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,160
And there was a kid who stepped over a kid

729
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
French

730
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,536
Not my child obviously parents nowhere to be found in the kid was like

731
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,096
Taking picture and was getting too close and I was like hey

00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,632
Get the f*** out of here

733
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,680
Real loud and everybody was like

734
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:56,032
Good call that kid needs to get the f*** out of here so that's what I'm here for

735
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
That's my job

736
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336

Justice

739
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,552
Itself is on

740
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,344
America

741
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
Injustice

742
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
On trial

743
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
Even the worst

744
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
People in the world

745
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Which I'm not

746
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,720
A bad person

747
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
Some say

748
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
I deserve my day

749
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
Newspaper

750
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
I'm not allowed

751
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
Defend myself

752
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,264

Star Supply

755
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
Here's what we know

756
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Himself

757
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,784
They had three weeks of

758
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
People up there lying about me

759
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,600
Twisting what I said

760
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
Memorial

761
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
Kill

762
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,000
This article in the current doesn't say this

763
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
It says quote

764
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:54,144
Johnson his company Free Speech systems have been prohibited from defending themselves under the default

765
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
But

766
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,216
Kim try to minimize what they have to pay

767
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
Incapacity and punitive damages

768
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,568
Alex campus and himself under the

769
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
The default

770
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
That's an important distinction because

771
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,992
Get every opportunity to defend himself when that was appropriate but

772
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:12,832
He didn't he was so abusive of the process that he was defaulted

773
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:18,976
He can't now take this damage is hearing as an opportunity to try and undo the default or

774
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,792
As if he hadn't been defaulted

775
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
He f*****

776
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,864
Himself over in this is a consequence of that

777
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
Yes every

778
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,216
Ability to defend himself in the context of this damages

779
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,264
Which is the second part of the sentence

780
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
In that current article that

781
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,568
But he's ignoring

782
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,616
He can try to minimize the damages

783
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,432
That's the damages hearing equivalent of defending him

784
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,736
Boy being out to the f******

785
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,576
Baby and Barnes is tag-along to Connecticut with him because Barnes

786
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
He just loves the public

787
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,440
A problem being a disrespectful s*******

788
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,720
It get some attention

789
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:57,120
Maybe drives a couple more people into his revenue streams like on that patreon clone at unhinged

790
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Assholes

791
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:02,496
Span I beam the the f****** cycle the psychopathy of doing that

792
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,032
You know like that's not

793
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,848
I wouldn't I would up I mean I guess

794
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,968
Separated from Humanity you know you're in a studio

795
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:18,368
It's just you and Alex he's easier to step into the world where you can be a piece of s*** to be a psycho and

796
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,416
To go and stand on the steps

797
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
And watch

798
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,792
Alex do that s*** all the steps that are required

799
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:32,192
Get you there yet the plan

800
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:36,032
Got to get lodging and insecurity

801
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,336
Knowing that what you're doing is just

802
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,152
Traveling to another city to disrespect

803
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,688
F****** people that you've hurt

804
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,992
Yep that's what you're doing

805
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:50,112
Yeah but like later he is just holding up a copy of his

806
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,672
This is a publicity stunt for Alex

807
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,440
Pure and simple

808
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,232
That's why he went to Connecticut

809
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,304
Give no intention of ever testifying but

810
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,144
Since the bankruptcy court has taken over his business as finances

811
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,752
I bet he had to pretend that he was going to testify in order to rationalize the expense of his travel

812
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,056
Who probably not fly as business

813
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:15,200
Transfer Company in bankruptcy to say hey I want to go across the country with my s******* lawyer friend so I can promote my book

814
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
On the steps of the courthouse

815
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
Swear I'm avoiding testifying cuz I'm

816
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,600
Scared I bet the bankruptcy court would be like yeah

817
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
No

818
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,904
I'm in the back and it's not going to be in

819
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
Expect

820
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
Going to fly

821
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah I got it

822
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,048
I got a charter a plane so I can

823
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:34,656
Try and get some attention I'm going to throw this out at you how do you feel about an aisle seat

824
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:40,032
I went to the tremendous peace of s*** in this press conference is a new level of inexcusable act on his part

825
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,336
He could have stayed the f****** Texas

826
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:47,968
There was no need for him to go to Connecticut just so he could siphon off some of the attention from this trial in order to Grant

827
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
Stand in front of

828
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
The court with barn

829
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,296
Instatrim promote is stupid

830
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:57,696
It's honestly difficult to think of a way he could have been more disrespectful to the families inside just trying to get there.

831
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
In court

832
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,352
It's one thing for him to be afraid to sincerely face them and accept responsibility for his part and everything that's happened

833
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,912
Entirely another thing to do this

834
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Stop it

835
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
I don't know man

836
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:15,872
I have I have a lot of words for him and I don't know

837
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,920
Can't blame Alex for this I mean true

838
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,944
He's discussed

839
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
He's a monster

840
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,064
But I wouldn't want to go back and absolutely

841
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,392
The worst thing for your defense

842
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,952
If cowardice is a given

843
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
Of course yes

844
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,072
The problem I have is

845
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,120
When we talked about enablers

846
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,448
We do not often talk about ourselves

847
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
You know like

848
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
No not us

849
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
Obviously if it's

850
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,408
If he ever mentioned our name maybe we could talk about us being enablers but

851
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Kaiser of knowledge first

852
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,016
It does feel like everyone is in a attempt

853
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,320
To keep us from doing that

854
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
Who is enabling him

855
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,976
Who is enabling him to do that he's not going out there

856
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
Thinking

857
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,792
But he's not going to get oppressed

858
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,352
There are people in neighboring him

859
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,752
Who are making money off of letting Alex make money off of abusing these people and I do

860
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:21,152
Don't find it acceptable behavior I don't I don't find it acceptable honestly don't understand another

861
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,456
It would go without like a gag order

862
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,224
Understand

863
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
I don't

864
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,320
Think that anybody is making

865
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Like

866
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,368
Super wrong

867
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,672
Choices given the

868
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
The circumstance

869
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:41,376
I think that local news it makes sense that they would be there here Alex is giving a statement

870
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,168
It makes sense to document it

871
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,192
I don't

872
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
I don't know

873
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,056
Is this is different to me than somebody like

874
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,872
Alex Lee boilermaking that documentary you know what

875
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,199
There's a series of decisions that don't need to be made

876
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,223
That led to that

877
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,015
Where is Alex speaking out

878
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,319
In front of the court and people recording it

879
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,623
I hate that it's happening

880
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,903
I hate that this

881
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,695
Do something that happened

882
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
But

883
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:11,327
I mean I'm not arguing for the world that we currently exist in

884
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,887
That they should be somehow like

885
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,655
Punisher

886
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,239
Prayer Behavior that's terrible what I'm arguing is that

887
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,823
The current world that we existed is not capable of

888
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
Handling this

889
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:28,223
In any responsible way exacerbating it as time goes on

890
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,783
Man so I mean my argument is

891
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,575
All of society is bad

892
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:39,487
Your first thoughts about the judge

893
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
This is not a trial

894
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,839
Testify two weeks ago

895
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,863
I came here this time.

896
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
Today

897
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
But she will hold me

898
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,055
Did I say I'm bankrupt

899
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
First person to climb

900
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Sandy Hook

901
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,151
Andover 10 other things

902
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
Has ever told somebody

903
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
What they can and can't say

904
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,063
That doesn't sound true at all

905
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Ask me question

906
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
Or I'll be arrested

907
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
If I tell

908
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
The truth

909
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
This is outrageous

910
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
You're all having

911
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
More freedom

912
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,583
Going to be held in contempt because

913
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,679
If you did any of that stuff he be acting in ways that are contemptuous to the Core

914
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:26,335
He's not allowed to train re-litigate his default in this setting because to do so would run a very high risk of poisoning the

915
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
Jewelry

916
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,175
The jury isn't there to determine Alex's culpability that's been

917
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:33,503
Decided so for him to rant about this irrelevant nonsense

918
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,551
He's an act of contempt of the Court

919
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:42,207
Judges very regularly hold people in contempt if you don't stop yelling about things that aren't germane to the matter at hand

920
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,999
You will be held in contempt

921
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
It happens all the time

922
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:51,679
I was just doesn't want to accept that he's a petulant child who can't allow for their being rules that he's subject to

923
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,495
He's trying to turn it into a constitutional issue

924
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,311
Don't b*******

925
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,591
Legit

926
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,663
What am I mean that's kind of what I was watching during that closing

927
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,199
Whenever they played the clip

928
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
Is that like

929
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,039
He would have been held in criminal contempt

930
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,063
If he had said those

931
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:12,415
So why in God's name are you allowing him to say those things

932
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
The Thriller video

933
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,767
He should still be held in criminal contempt for that

934
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,607
A norm should be as well for or some of that like

935
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
I

936
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
I don't know how courts work

937
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,519
Me neither I would have probably stop that video

938
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
Yeah totally

939
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,127
I said the stuff that we said he can't say if he must hear

940
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:38,527
He would be going to jail maybe there's a different way that things work in terms of like the closing statement

941
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
What's an opening statement

942
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,367
It's there not evidentiary that's possible

943
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
Still

944
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,671
Don't ask me

945
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,023
But also Alex wouldn't be perjuring himself if he told the truth

946
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
He wouldn't

947
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,375
He wouldn't have to perjure himself to answer any of those questions

948
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,167
He would have to purge or what

949
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
He believes of himself

950
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
You'd have to

951
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,799
Encroach upon his self perception

952
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,103
And that is something that he

953
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,895
Is too afraid to do

954
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:09,503
Yeah it is it is a moment for Alex that is change or die

955
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,063
And he can't change

956
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,391
But he's probably not going to die either

957
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,927
Cuz I'm at metaphor

958
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Sure

959
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,743
So you asked why Barnes is there

960
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,327
I am interested Piazza new position at Infowars I got no

961
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,351
Robert Barnes

962
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,119
First person

963
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
That is

964
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
American just

965
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Itself on trial

966
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:40,479
So this raises the issue of whether or not Barnes is an official spokesperson is he on the payroll again now

967
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,039
And if so is this just a way for Alex

968
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,623
It's to try to rationalize the bankruptcy court to pay for Barnes to travel

969
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,927
To Connecticut for their stupid publicity stock

970
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,487
Does a

971
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,279
It's a question worth asking

972
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Yeah

973
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,839
Yeah

974
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
Man

975
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
They're just

976
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,959
It should be harder to be

977
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
Sneaky

978
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:08,383
Hanging out it should be harder to trick a bankruptcy court I would suggest that this is evidence that it is very hard to

979
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,455
Be sneaky very sneaky

980
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,247
That is true

981
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,295
I think we're talkin about this from different directions

982
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,927
If there was anybody

983
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,951
But Alex

984
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,255
Who determined whether or not he test

985
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:30,911
Then I be like well you know maybe he went there expecting that he might testify and then he just didn't write

986
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,471
But in this case

987
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
It's all out

988
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,055
Well you made the decision and I

989
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
Guarantee

990
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,871
T he made it before he left office

991
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:44,479
Well I can say that of all of the corporate Representatives

992
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,015
Who has been asked the

993
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
Bastion of

994
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,343
Can anyone tell Alex what to do

995
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,647
Not one of them has said anything other than

996
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:58,047
Nope no absolutely not nobody can tell us what to do when you make all the decisions completely by himself represented

997
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:02,143
Employees consistent

998
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
Alex

999
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,959
It's just does whatever the f*** he wants to do

1000
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,799
To look it's a bad times if Alex testify

1001
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Because

1002
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,639
He's going to get locked up

1003
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
Everybody knows

1004
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,503
You're the one person who is

1005
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
Any day Inn

1006
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
In court is Alex

1007
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,647
To such a degree in a car for a month and he was already in there once

1008
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
Testifies

1009
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
Honestly

1010
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,743
Justified truth

1011
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,815
But have you answered

1012
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
The questions in the way the planets

1013
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,119
Lawyers one

1014
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,655
Also go to J

1015
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,703
No matter what he does he goes

1016
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,471
J lift

1017
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,263
Testify in his own behalf

1018
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
In his own.

1019
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,055
How

1020
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:48,479
It doesn't make sense now he'll go to jail I understand this fantasy about it being locked up for 6 months for criminal contempt

1021
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,551
You know if you need a ride

1022
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:56,159
Okay what's my agenda scenario where they ask like did you say that the Sandy Hook families were actor

1023
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,231
Yes how's that going to bring him to jail

1024
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,767
No Doubt

1025
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,535
This is bulshit

1026
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,327
This is so stupid

1027
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,119
Barnes

1028
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,655
Come on man

1029
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,191
Alex lies in court

1030
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
Enough

1031
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,519
Sooner or later

1032
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,567
Someone will do something to stop him

1033
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,199
And if whatever it is that it takes eventually wind up being prison it's going to be a long

1034
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:24,063
Long way away

1035
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,951
Imagine a world where they ask him all these questions that are like did you do this

1036
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
Did you do this

1037
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,511
Yes he says ever

1038
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:37,119
In a way that is advantageous to the plaintiffs attorneys

1039
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,679
How does he go to jail

1040
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,543
Trial know it'll happen is

1041
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:50,943
The walls will suddenly fall down the trunk realize that we're all already in jail

1042
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
Exactly see that

1043
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:58,623
That's the twist right Alex says I did it and then black doors

1044
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:04,255
Do you know a lot of smoke

1045
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,047
So ridiculous

1046
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:12,959
As we know from listening to Alex's show Barnes has his own little pet conspiracy about Saint

1047
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,727
Sandy Hook

1048
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,007
The store they told about

1049
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
Was not true

1050
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,335
In the sense that they blame

1051
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Gun owners

1052
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Blamed Alex

1053
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,151
It's going for what happened

1054
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
When the reality is

1055
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,711
Is it school safety was not up

1056
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,271
Democratic College

1057
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,319
Decided the pocket money method

1058
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,855
Supertech little kids lives

1059
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
And little kids died

1060
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,159
Didn't mean to.

1061
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
Does politician

1062
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
That's the real

1063
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
But they can't have any of that

1064
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,583
Holyshit hay barns

1065
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,399
I know a school safety officer you should talk to

1066
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,191
Used to be a freak

1067
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,727
Cast on Alex's show

1068
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,287
Wolfgang halbig

1069
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
Kim

1070
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,335
Buddy

1071
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:54,431
This isn't good I mean I

1072
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,247
Need to keep clarifying this

1073
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
This is sad on the steps

1074
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,599
This is bulshit

1075
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
I'm writing up

1076
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
Los

1077
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,159
Stuff

1078
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,231
If I hear him well.

1079
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:12,607
If I hear him say that outside of a courtroom I'm like blah stuff needs to happen to stop this already

1080
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,679
I don't know what law stuff needs to happen but I know it does

1081
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
Yeah yeah

1082
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,519
I just

1083
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:24,639
Play words fail you know we we talked about this in the days coming up to the

1084
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,407
The trial

1085
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,199
That kind of idea of like

1086
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
If he gets a judgement

1087
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
What is going to make him stop

1088
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,599
And if Barnes is outside of the courthouse

1089
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,135
Outside of the courthouse

1090
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,695
Days before they go to deliberation

1091
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,279
Making vague insinuations about

1092
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:47,679
What he's doing

1093
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,215
Vague claims about

1094
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:49,983
Various

1095
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,775
Democrat politician

1096
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:52,799
Right

1097
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,615
Reticular in a different context

1098
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
That is

1099
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,431
Fine but in this context

1100
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,967
You are denying Sandy

1101
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:06,367
In an accounting office or something like that maybe put the water cooler

1102
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,159
This is not

1103
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
Number one

1104
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,951
Relevant

1105
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,487
Number to Noland blamed Alex

1106
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,511
Sandy Hook

1107
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,791
Bill

1108
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
This

1109
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,839
Outrageous

1110
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
Unacceptable

1111
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,399
Anyway this is.

1112
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,959
Why are they so scared and terrified

1113
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,751
The truth why are they so afraid of

1114
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
What they say about Alex Jones

1115
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,175
True why are they willing to allow Alex Jones to have his day in court

1116
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,711
These are questions every American

1117
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:36,319
Everyone was so willing to let him have his

1118
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,855
Fucken are you going to show up to

1119
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,975
Ben said I've been involved

1120
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:46,303
With the plaintiffs attorneys in Texas course

1121
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,607
I know from

1122
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,399
Conversations with them

1123
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,703
Very

1124
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,775
Willing

1125
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,311
Quite a surprise

1126
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,591
When there was a default

1127
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
And

1128
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
That

1129
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,431
Would have been fine

1130
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,271
Done what he was supposed to do

1131
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,551
Send

1132
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
Competent

1133
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,879
Corporate represent totally allowed to

1134
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,951
Disclosure things to happen with

1135
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,975
Discovery

1136
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:20,095
They were perfectly happy to let him have his day in court every opportunity

1137
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,935
We could have had this thing wrapped up in

1138
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
In f****** 26

1139
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,775
Yeah you didn't want his day in court

1140
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,823
Maybe a little after that but yeah

1141
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,871
Barnes

1142
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Feel like he's

1143
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,711
Getting dangerously close

1144
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,479
2

1145
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:39,295
Climbing 12 saying some things that aren't

1146
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:45,695
Appropriate about some one of the plaintiff all my stuff on Alex's show already

1147
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
What is dislike

1148
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,791
Tell if they were working out their talking points working out their B

1149
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,119
On his show and then now they're just doing it in front of the court

1150
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,911
Here you have a case

1151
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,447
FBI agent

1152
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,239
Are our current FBI

1153
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,263
Lawyers

1154
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,823
Don't know anybody who died in

1155
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,151
I mean

1156
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,175
What is FBI agent

1157
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,199
Canal sue people

1158
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
For raising Quest

1159
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,015
About what took place

1160
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,039
Various cases

1161
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
Everybody who Quest

1162
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,367
The government now go to jail

1163
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,927
Testify truthfully in their own defense

1164
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
Do they all go

1165
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
Get bankrupt

1166
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
Into Oblivion

1167
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
Because that is a

1168
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,303
Future we face if we allow Presa

1169
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
Didn't like this.

1170
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,143
Such an abusive of

1171
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,983
Logic it's pretty ridiculous

1172
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,263
It's a disgrace

1173
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,103
For Barnes to pretend that bill Altenburg is just an FBI

1174
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:40,223
Agent or FBI lawyer he knows better he knows exactly why he's one of the plaintiff

1175
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,527
This is bulshit I mean

1176
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
You compare that

1177
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
2

1178
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,647
And this was a good one of the more powerful things

1179
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,439
That you could hear is that

1180
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,975
The FBI agent

1181
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,255
Himself bill

1182
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
Testifying

1183
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,327
I wish I'd worn a different jacket

1184
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,119
Maybe that would have

1185
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
To change something

1186
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
Can you add like

1187
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,935
That kind of

1188
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,495
That kind of weird Gill

1189
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,543
That should never have even a

1190
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Existed

1191
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,127
Just like man if I'd worn a different shirt

1192
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,431
For ten years these people would have been a

1193
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
You know

1194
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:18,623
Saying that level of irrational guilt he knows if they're rational man's gone to therapy for years you know like

1195
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,951
You can never

1196
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,487
It's just f***** up man

1197
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,511
That is plucked

1198
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,839
And Barnes is a disrespectful

1199
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,863
Yeah

1200
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,911
I'm not Adam Lanza

1201
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,959
I didn't kill those kids

1202
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,495
But people don't know

1203
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,823
We'll take a few questions

1204
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,615
Animal going to come back later obviously

1205
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,895
Listen close

1206
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,967
Considering tomorrow

1207
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,503
When I get put on the stand

1208
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039
Looking at the judge

1209
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,063
Just saying you Barbie

1210
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,087
Medicine

1211
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,623
This isn't a real Court

1212
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,415
Amendment

1213
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:58,559
I was just never considering pleading the fifth because he was never going back into that Court

1214
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,375
He was only going to testify if Norm

1215
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,679
Called him and he knew normal isn't going to

1216
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
He pays Norm

1217
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,519
This is all just artificial bravado and it

1218
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,079
Alex is Bart to get headlines written about

1219
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,359
Speculation about him

1220
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,663
This is desperate

1221
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
Pathetic

1222
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,015
To use the trial is a promotional event

1223
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:24,927
Also more people know who Alex has been Adam Lanza because Alex is a giant media celebrity with an audience of millions of people

1224
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,743
Lenses a notable name

1225
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:34,143
He's a murderer from about a decade ago so maybe his name recognition isn't the same as a giant media

1226
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,679
Celebrity who's the textbook

1227
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,215
Definition of a f******

1228
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:37,983
Attention w****

1229
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:43,359
Get out of your Alex Adam Lanza's name is in the first

1230
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
Who gives a f***

1231
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:50,527
This charade that Alex is using about like everyone thinks that I did this or

1232
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,343
They don't know who Adam Lanza's we know who I am is is

1233
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,623
Is just

1234
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,183
Yeah you're living in f***

1235
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:57,951
In Candyland

1236
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
Infuriate

1237
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
Yep

1238
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,279
Pleading the fifth

1239
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,071
Yeah

1240
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095
So I take the

1241
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,399
Guilty

1242
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,191
She says

1243
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,215
The truth shall put

1244
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,007
In the Waterbury jail

1245
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
6 months

1246
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,567
That doesn't make sense

1247
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:17,151
Never before in a Civil Trial is the Fifth Amendment needed

1248
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:17,919
Top lawyers

1249
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
It looked at it

1250
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,967
And say no

1251
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
She wants to put you

1252
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:23,807
Drudge

1253
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,439
And you are guilty of

1254
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:33,535
So I guess the judges part of the new world order now

1255
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
Many

1256
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
People

1257
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,119
Use the fifth in

1258
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,143
In civil cases

1259
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,167
That's not

1260
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:39,935
Titan of men

1261
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:44,031
Yeah that not like I sometimes outrageously

1262
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
False

1263
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,127
Standing there is embarrassing

1264
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:53,247
Constitutional lawyer in no one's ever used the 5th before civil case

1265
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,039
But Alex says top lawyers

1266
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
He's just talking

1267
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,159
And maybe Norma consultation

1268
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,463
Anymore he probably wants to forget his

1269
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:07,327
So yeah he's going to take some questions but we know Alex there something that comes for

1270
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,375
You have heard

1271
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
Little America

1272
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,751
You're going to sell something

1273
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,287
Yeah right to say he was in

1274
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,567
Think about

1275
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,359
You're being robbed

1276
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,151
Process

1277
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
Stanford

1278
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,759
Dot-com

1279
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,783
Yourself

1280
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,111
Walmart books for the world

1281
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
The War of the Worlds

1282
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,511
Papa film

1283
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,583
I barely covered

1284
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,351
That's a lie

1285
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,375
And I did

1286
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,167
Warren Police

1287
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,191
Apologize

1288
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,983
Years and years before I was too

1289
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
Cannot send

1290
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:57,503
Do you notice here that I can't even bring himself to admit that he called them actors when he's explaining what

1291
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,807
He did wrong that he claims he's apologized

1292
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
S4

1293
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,647
You can only use these vague terms like that he called it staged

1294
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:10,303
He's doing this because even he knows that his real actions are indefensible but if he lies about what he actually did

1295
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,655
Becomes a little bit more understandable how we could make these mistakes and such

1296
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,471
He's doing this because he's a coward and a liar

1297
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,007
Simple

1298
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,799
And nobody's challenging

1299
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:27,199
He gets old sad and predictable that's like a plug is going to come in here

1300
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,735
You're doing this

1301
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,039
Bulshit disrespectful act on the courts

1302
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,087
Have to plug

1303
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,623
Yeah

1304
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,695
Yeah Heil Darvish this is just like that

1305
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:40,255
What I'm for is when he's about to say

1306
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:46,655
Infowars I buy just go airhorn yeah absolutely

1307
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:51,519

Media dum-dums

1309
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
You're here

1310
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:59,711
You don't know when he's going to do a f****** ad pissed but even they kind of felt

1311
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,015
I'm sure Liz was like a f******

1312
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
He's going to do it

1313
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,135
Shitzo know is the name of his book going to no kidding

1314
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,671
So you take some Quest

1315
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,255
And you know I think

1316
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,791
I think actually some of the

1317
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,607
Some of the people if they were asked

1318
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:19,935
Questions for rational people they would be fine question

1319
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,751
Alex they don't know like

1320
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,031
Right you're not going

1321
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,871
How to get to know what you think you're you think you're going to get something you are not going to

1322
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,943
The first question is what do you say to the harasser

1323
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:42,975
The original people

1324
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Professors

1325
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535

1326
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,607
And they never told

1327
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
Anybody to go rest

1328
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,167
If you mentally ill people get harassed

1329
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935

1332
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,311
People that are

1333
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,103
Public figures

1334
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,383
And met with Obama

1335
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,407
10TV

01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,199
You do a lot of folks are pro-gun

1337
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
Didn't like those

1338
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
Family

1339
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
Not sure anybody

1340
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623
Able to do that

1341
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,927
There's tons about

1342
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:20,095
That part where you said release the Kraken is a real issue

1343
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:24,703
Instant promotion of Wolfgang halbig another very big piece of it

1344
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
Jail time

1345
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,519
Yeah man I mean this is

1346
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,847
Just you know you can just say these things and

1347
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:35,199
Just bullshittin then they'll write it down and put it out there

1348
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:41,599
You know this is a local news peace and maybe they would play this and

1349
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,367
And then be like

1350
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:46,207
Not back in the studio sounds like this is totally me

1351
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:51,327
I imagine you know I didn't see the local news peace imagine if you're watching local news in Connecticut

1352
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,375
Probably not going to be

1353
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
Probably not

1354
01:00:55,935 --> 01:01:02,079
I mean I certainly wouldn't be if I knew that he was coming to disrespect your f****** town like this

1355
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,383
Make a mockery of the proceedings and

1356
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:07,711
Try and sell books on the courtrooms better Community is gone

1357
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,479
Through

1358
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,503
Together

1359
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,783
Yeah so

1360
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:15,135
Also ask the question there's like

1361
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,695
There is

1362
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:23,583
Tomorrow that's something you're really considering

1363
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
I'm not going

1364
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,959

1367
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,103
If I get any other answer

1368
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,383
I don't know

1369
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,711
Isn't it true you make money off

1370
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
No

1371
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,015
The judge says I'll go to jail

1372
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,807
She says I did it's a lie

1373
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,855
But you didn't give us a banana

1374
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,135
You're guilty

1375
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,975
Do you understand

1376
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,511
The kangaroo trial

1377
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,535
This is a fraud

1378
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,303
Pictures of danger

1379
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
Alright

1380
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607

01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:06,079
Yes I mean he only took a few classes mostly just needed Barnes ranting about bulshit

1384
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:08,127
Yep that sounds about right

1385
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:14,783
He didn't end up also answering some other questions from people this is not

1386
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,855
On the video that he put out on his own website

1387
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
Interesting yeah it's

1388
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,927
Stream because some of it

1389
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,719
I mean it sounds bad

1390
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
They're going to be snowing

1391
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
A Thousand Years

1392
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,071
Name a whole planet

1393
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,607
Okay

1394
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
This is a damn

1395
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
Oaxaca

1396
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
What about it

1397
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
I don't have to

1398
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,495
$2000000

1399
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,031
I don't have all the

1400
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,823
Put money in crap they talked about so they can

1401
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,383
Billion dollar verdict they're going to get anything

1402
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,455
Charities

1403
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
Cash machine

1404
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,879
Is

1405
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,415
Unaccepted

1406
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,487
Stephen knows that like

1407
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:59,071
Let's not play that part on info

1408
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,351
Pretend that didn't happen

1409
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:07,007
Where I'm laughing about they're not going to get in my money because I don't have any haha the joke's on them and

1410
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:08,799
Calling the

1411
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:12,127
This trial a publicity stunt while he publicity stunt

1412
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,919
Call Nieves tabs

1413
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,783
I think I think saying that they're squeezing money out of the dead kids is

1414
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,367
Pretty grotesque f****** thing for him to say

1415
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:26,975
Yeah you know when people are like he should have gotten his ass kicked when he was younger like

1416
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:30,303
We're leaving out the many people get serious head injury

1417
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,119
Like Alex got his ass kicked enough but I think he's

1418
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,143
F***** in the head

1419
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,703
Maybe we maybe we need to talk more about that

1420
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,983
I mean

1421
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,079
There's an inability to control himself it is absolutely true

1422
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:44,127
But he can control himself enough

1423
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151
2

1424
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,943
Navigate

1425
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,503
Doing s*** like this

1426
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,271
Yeah

1427
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,319
Mr. Magoo like right

1428
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:55,647
F****** around and everything just falls into place for him

1429
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:59,487
Magoo was like deeply malicious

1430
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,511
Yeah

1431
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,351
So I wanted to

1432
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,375
Take this

1433
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,655
Episode

1434
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:11,519
To Alex's been in Connecticut has been hosting the show

1435
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,079
Mohammed Barnesville still pop in

1436
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,359
Here in there

1437
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,919
But like I wanted to take

1438
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,711
An opportunity to really look at like

1439
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,759
This is this man

1440
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,295
That's is what he's doing

1441
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,087
I think

1442
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,879
In terms of

1443
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,671
His behavior

1444
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,951
Obviously

1445
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,999
He could do what he wants on his show

1446
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,559
And there's a level of that that is disgusting

1447
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,583
Toxic and I

1448
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,887
Jenna Dewan ignore it totally

1449
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,655
But

1450
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,703
The idea of it

1451
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,471
He would

1452
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,751
Take the time

1453
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,543
To go to Connecticut

1454
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,567
To do

1455
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
Who's this

1456
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
Is

1457
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,175
Hey baby paint

1458
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,735
It paints a picture of a real piece of s***

1459
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,039
Yeah and and again

1460
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,087
This is outside the walls

1461
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
Like

1462
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:01,439
The families could have been in the hallway and
