Full blast

13
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:54,272
First of all like to give a big shout-out to listener Keegan

14
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,600
I believe he's a technocrat at this point

15
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:01,184
I'll look over the Patrick's Day weekend

16
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,840
And it was very nice to meet him at always a great time

17
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
This is why I brought it up

18
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
I'm just sorry I couldn't make it

19
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:22,176
It baffles me this is not why I brought this up

20
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
No I brought up because it was also his birthday

21
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,904
Jordan

22
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,072
He donated on time travel level a while back and one of the things you wanted was a drunk Alex Jones

23
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,472
And it turns out even though we are another episode for him

24
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm able to sense he was in town this weekend

25
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,592
Honor him with this episode that we're going to be doing today

26
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
But first

27
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
I have to honor all of our listeners

28
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
I haven't even taken a sip of the wine then already grandiosa

29
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,280
So I told you on the last episode that episode we would begin

30
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
The March Madness bracket

31
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
Of Alex Jones drops because we have a lot in

32
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,520
Front of us and I didn't want to overwhelm you

33
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,824
After your long day at work

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,712
I decided we would have one teaser matchup today and on the next episode

35
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,992
The putting out on Wednesday

36
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
We'll have a bunch more everybody right off the top two I don't want all the matchups

37
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,280
Using bet so today we're going to be looking at one match up from one of the quadrants there's 16

38
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:46,400
Write for division one of the divisions that we will be looking at today

39
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
1 matchup from that

40
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
Is the guest division

41
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
Okay

42
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:03,296
We got to get you out of the house are from people who are not Alex Jones

43
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
The other 12 will be Alex Jones drop

44
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,976
Different variety of XX

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Go home and call you

46
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
But the selection committee has over long and hard

47
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
It's sort of like the people who like the Pope

48
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,152
Service Electric

49
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,928
Number 1 seed vs the number for

00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
Amanda revealing first

51
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,328
The number for recede is Darrell hamamoto gayest instrument

52
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,448
I said the gayest instrument in my collection that I could take to visit the

00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,288
Esquire Esquire

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
Absolutely lunatic man number one seed is the gayest instruments

55
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,624

56
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
Is Steve pieczenik it's not go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

57
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,607
It's Alex Jones getting a manners lesson from Steve pieczenik

58
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:41,855
What do you make of this

59
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,695
Going to call me after

You could ask how I'm doing I think the selection committee what they selling that clip over the go home and

64
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
Tell your mother from Alex

65
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
Screaming about the globalist

73
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447

75
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,663

We were at the

00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
Tongue turned green

83
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,711
Then I had to walk home with my hand over my mouth

84
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
I just didn't want to blend in with the rabble-rousers and passed out on the street drunks at 11 in the morning

85
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,143
Or whatever on the Chicago

86
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935

87
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,007

88
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
Give the gift

89
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,407
Fulfill this birthday wish of a drunk Alex

90
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
On Saint Patrick's Day Saint Patrick's Day I mean Saturday

Now it's just never show on Saturday so I watched Friday in like maybe he's going to get the booze going early

92
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
Nope

93
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:32,351
Buddhist Parable he just have to punch people on to talk about how they're all being censored and all this nonsense

94
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,423
Then that way doesn't have to talk about his own

95
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
Crowder

00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:49,247

Thank you so much for not suing me for the things that I did actually Bedford that I'm almost there

98
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
As luck would have it

99
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
God smiled down upon us

100
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
Alex

101
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
For reasons unknown

102
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,471
Decided to go into the studio and do a special report on Saturday

103
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
And I have

104
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Almost

105
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
No doubt that he's drunk

106
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,639
Out of context drops from that episode

107
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
I can do this

108
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:30,207
Give you a little bit of the flavor of things

00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,303
Hillary about to be indicted by a lake

111
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,911
The precise title was because it's

112
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
It's inappropriate if I don't give you the

113
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
Precise title

114
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
Cuz it's just that

115
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,127
Important like this is a salacious as title

116
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,687

120
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159

I've so we'll see how much you talked about that

123
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
I don't know what to do

124
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Expect anymore but

125
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,335

Hear that silence

129
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511

All the tyrants in history

131
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631

132
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,471

186
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
For her father George

187
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:57,727
The 6th was king before that his brother Edward the 8th was King for under year and had to Advocate because he wanted to marry a lady

188
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:03,103
We've been divorced twice and the court deemed her unfit to be the consort of the king

189
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
1910 witches

190
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
Before World War 1

191
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,111
This is interesting because

192
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Yes

193
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,999
I promise everything is going to come full circle

194
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,399
Vlad the Impaler Alex is going to look very stupid because people were not really enjoying

195
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,495
In the mid-nineteenth N George the Fifth change the name of his branch

196
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,079
His house from the house of saxe-coburg and gotha

197
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
Do the house of Windsor in 1970

198
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,479
Is it a wise decision that you made about three years into World War

199
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,575
Perhaps the most grisly war of all-time most people blame the Germans for

200
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:51,231
The Belgian wing of the house decided on how you feel about that

201
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Scraps

202
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:57,119
The Belgian Winger the house change their name a few years later for exactly the same reason

203
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Think of Germany

204
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Was upon me

205
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
House of

206
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,543
Saxe-coburg and gotha and they'd wanted that appearance to be

207
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,615
As moot as possible

208
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Is its name as well

209
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
From saxe-coburg

210
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Alright

211
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,623
It does have German roots

212
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:24,255
I'm looking for screen as hell

213
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:29,631
The house of saxe-coburg-gotha does have a Germanic Roots as does every house

214
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Because

215
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
There were a bunch of

216
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,823
Germany didn't exist as a nation-state until 1871

217
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,175
There were just a bunch of Regional family and some of them in Turlock

218
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
And some of them created larger houses

219
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
Yeah just a little fi

220
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,111
Increase their power

221
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Beds

222
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
Crown family has always

223
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Kind of avoided

224
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
What is the fact that

225
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:02,143
They're related to just about every other Crown family

226
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,335
Hundreds of years between

227
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Tons and tons of people

228
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,431
It just so happens that they had like released

229
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,831
Strategic and selective marriages in order to consolidate power

230
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Here's the thing

231
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
The Sak

232
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
Emma title SAS

233
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,815
My name is a reference to Saxony the state modern

234
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,143
Eastern Germany Medieval Times

235
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
Become the UK along with the angle

236
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
What are the term Anglo-Saxon to rides

237
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
That is also where the Black Knight comes from in medieval

238
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Exactly

239
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,735
The Angles and Saxons collectively founded the kingdom of England in the mid

240
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
Turley

241
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
9

242
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Hundreds

243
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
When Queen Victoria died in 1901 the crown Pastor her eldest son Edward the seventh was a member of the House of saxe-coburg

244
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
Coburg and gotha

245
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,791
Through his father Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert

246
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:08,191
The ruling lineage went from the it was patriarch Ali handed down

247
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,751
Give me House of sax

248
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
Coburg author where is

249
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Hanover

250
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
House of Hanover is also aligned

251
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,991
That has German properly called the house of Hanover Brunswick ludenberg

252
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
Hanover line

253
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
Back in 1740

254
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,927
The first began the Royal lineage of Hanover the crown after Queen Anne

255
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
House of Stuart

256
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:35,071
Which is a Scottish line died without an heir and they picked her second cousin George to take over

257
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:40,703
So Alex saying has a Germanic root obviously it doesn't that means nothing

258
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,239
He brings in the Habsburg

259
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
The empire

260
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Which is just

261
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
Just such a distraction on his part

262
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:52,735
It's just another name for the austro-hungarian Empire which is defeated and Scattered of the many pieces of the end

263
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,551
In 1919

264
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Many Habsburg monarchy

265
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,647
Working currently a Holy Roman Emperor which

266
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
Would be confusing

267
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
Read that really doesn't mean anything

268
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,935
Exactly the house of Habsburg is also a completely different thing if he was trying to talk about that

269
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,751
Instead of just the austro-hungarian empire

270
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,799
Add House of Habsburg became extinct

271
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,847
Dissolved on November 29th 17

272
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
The junior Austrian branch of the houses

273
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Extended SV House of hops

274
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,759
Berg Lauren but this to I

275
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
Dissolved in 1918

276
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
Did not dissolve because it's

277
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
Was secretly apart of the House of Windsor

278
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
I am positive also

279
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,255
Conception vet this Empire got

280
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,327
Defeated in World War and wanted to become like it's like

281
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,887
In World War II

282
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Hitler Express

283
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
But he hated the Habsburg identity

284
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,567
And he was a harsh German nationalist

285
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,967
He claimed not want to fight in the austro-hungarian Habsburg Army because there was a mix of races and

286
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
You could call him

287
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,063
You could call that his struggle

288
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
That was a comp

289
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,743
I apologize

290
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
The time in my my life where I

291
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Knew that and like

292
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
I had memorized those facts

293
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,191
And then I became a person who is like

294
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,383
Victoria

295
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
We'll get to that in a second

296
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,855
There's a lot of progeny and a lot of people ended up scattering from there

297
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:39,743
As you know cuz you're not an idiot

298
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
So you sing and it makes me sad I'm German

299
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,455
I'm so in the 16th century Transylvania was absorbed by the Empire and their rulers adopted

300
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Title Prince

301
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,527
Transylvania part of the royal list of acclaim

302
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,087
Until the austro-hungarian Empire dissolved

303
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
1918 Daenerys Targaryen goes around and creates like a queen of the unsullied

304
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,375
The unburnt whatever things happened she had things to her royal title

305
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:24,031
It's really fun whenever it was absorbed the title Prince of France

306
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
Sylvania ended up

307
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
Becoming part of

308
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
A moniker that got

309
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
Austro-hungarian Empire

310
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,247
And that doesn't necessarily mean there's a

311
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,647
Like a genetic connection or even a passing down of a crown

312
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,975
Come from

313
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
I'll tell you what I'm going to go with

314
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
Bulshit

315
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,727
In 2011 Prince Charles said in an interview that he was a descendant of Vlad the Impaler which started the rumor Mills running and he should be named

316
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,567
King of Romania which experts viewed as a Preposterous idea

317
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,615
There's no evidence of Charles is playing

318
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
And it's more than likely that he just said it because he was in Romania at the time and because he owns a summer house there and he's active

319
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,159
Live with the mihai eminescu trust a British charity that works preserve rubbing his Saxon history

320
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
It could also be

321
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
Because Prince Charles

322
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
Is a lunatic

323
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,815
He's also

324
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:26,495
Kind of love him he's a horrible racist monster

325
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:35,711
So also the confusion comes from the fact that the last king of Romania King by Kohls

326
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,759
The great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria

327
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Which makes

328
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Third cousins

329
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Queen Elizabeth

330
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,159
Because of colonialism in the way that people would just like

331
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:50,559
You know I'm I'm a prince of England I'm going to marry a princess in Russia or something like that

332
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
Weird connections that would end up happening

333
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,399
You can find like

334
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
If you just

335
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
Dig deep enough you can find

336
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Connections all over the

337
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:04,127
He is the great-grandson of Queen Victoria

338
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,407
The great great great great

339
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
Great-grandson of Otto the first king of Greece

340
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,087
The first modern king of Greece

341
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
I hear Spain has a

342
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
The king I'm like

343
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:26,656
Beckett be real functional monarchs

344
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,704
I understand there

345
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
Imaginary

346
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Still like

347
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
For sure

348
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
You know we could go with like

349
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,016
Did that lady who is on suits

350
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:48,416
Who's marrying one of the princes is now the great great great great granddaughter of Queen Victoria

351
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,744
Order child will be the great great great great great great granddaughter

352
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
For Sun

353
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
Queen Victoria

354
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:05,056
Popular like you could you play this game all day long but what it really comes down to is astray interview the Prince Charles at

355
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,640
And the fact that when Transylvania was absorbed

356
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,432
As a region by

357
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,504
The austro-hungarian Empire The Prince of Transylvania title

358
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
Breathing part of demonic

359
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
That's f******

360
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,392
Exhausting way too much information

361
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,232
The rest of the clips won't have nearly as much

362
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:30,656
Constantly be getting into biblical lineages at this point Victoria begat

363
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:36,544
I'm sorry Alex

364
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
Is also going to claim

365
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
And he was one of the 300

366
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
Fighting against

367
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,016
British tyranny or whatever it is

368
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
Possible he's a f****** lunatic

369
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,136
So if he gets even crazier

370
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
I learned it

371
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
Lazy people

372
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,328
That's great.

373
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,144
Like you didn't actually have them

374
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Race memory

375
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,080
And that's why in 2018

376
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,200
Without even wanting it

377
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Long pause

378
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
I have a sickening amount of power

379
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,560
Thesaurus crowd of the globalist

380
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,352
So

381
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
This is

382
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,960
Certified

383
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:42,848
To the races in terms of like

384
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
I'm tariff

385
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,944
I'm terrified this is very much about

386
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,344
Hillary Clinton being indicted we're already right into it we're digging into the reasons that she

387
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
You going to be indicted

388
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
You know what my theory is

389
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
Dracula like Fox News

390
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,584
Keep talking about Hillary

391
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
Is because the campaign was

392
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:12,032
So good for them.

393
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,824
Have to deal with what a piece of s*** is

394
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,616
Present

395
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:23,296
I think there's a part of that

396
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,320
Kansas of the good

397
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:30,720
What's a loser in adulthood but you are a star quarterback and you like flashback

398
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:37,120
Potential

399
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,168
And now you work at your dad's

400
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,520
Metaphor for Trump

401
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,848
Used car dealer you remember when he was out there throwing bombs

402
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
Just downfield

403
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:56,320
Lavender we need to unpack Alex Jones's idea that you super powerful

404
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
Is the super powerful

405
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Because he's

406
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
Smart

407
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,952
Because his knowledge that other people don't have

408
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Like the fact

409
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,768
Dracula gave birth

410
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,328
Do Prince Charles in a roundabout way

411
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Controls Drac

412
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:14,240
Exactly the lawsuits against Alex are fake

413
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,056
And then it spirals out of control into him realizing it

414
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
Saint Patrick's Day

415
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,896
He said some other stupid s*** about history

416
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
Congress

417
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Presidents

418
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Connected

419
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Please.

420
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
Now that means

421
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:43,424
Renaissance in American Reawakening is commanding us all

422
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
But as

423
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
2.0 visuals

424

Open the universe

425
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,080
They don't even get the

426
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
Show me sad

427
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
Saint Patty's Day

Wearing green

429
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
My daughter

430
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
Your mommy

431
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
Park Cafe hours

432
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,536
That's really weird that's a really weird thing to say

433
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
Actually for green shirt earlier wear my green shirts around all but

434
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,872
I love that I'm not trying to patronize.

435
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
The reason so you guys

436
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,272
Don't know that I couldn't find my green shirt

437
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,344
I just told you

438
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,744
Whiskey inmate I called Rob do and showed up over here working on a schedule

439
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,632
Is it look what the Irish went through everybody else has gone through under Imperial Brett

440
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
It's not a British conspiracy

441
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,776
It's corrupt leads to conquer powerful Britt

442
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,592
Use the power of those tribes

443
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
People

444
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,176
I was laughing around Technologies of control

445
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,992
Power the world

446
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Rogue forces

447
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,808
Ability of

448
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,672
The modern

449
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
System

450

Doughboy

451

Follow the money

452
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,120
Fact

453
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,192
Yeah it's really

454
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,520
Very prosperous Society because they had a very

455
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
Strategic places

456
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,944
The port has Genoa came to prominence that sorta fell apart there were other options

457
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
Stranglehold

458
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Ted Nugent

459

D.c. Commerce

460
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
And what have you

461
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:45,536
That's a really interesting. Whenever those guys start going crazy at 8 at each other

462
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
City-states

463
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,120
In Italy gold shops along with

464
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,144
You know

465
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,936
Where does the pope come from

466
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,240
From which one

467
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,848
Get the pope and then they all go f****** fight each other about the pulpit

468
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
Pope's going on

469
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
Under counter counter counter

470
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,320
Yeah as I loved it and Italy's history

471
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
As a unified

472
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,416
Today is not that old

473
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Still kind of

474
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,976
Not great

475
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,280
I mean if you really look at it wasn't even a Republican

476
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,816
Cancel 1946

477
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,144
So it's that is recent as a

478
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,424
Sort of democratic

479
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
Existing

480
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,776
Italy is good he was under fascist rule before that

481
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,592
Friends before that right

482
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:36,992
E46 Berlusconi had his first bunga-bunga celebrated

483
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
Scared

484
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,392
F***** everybody in his alien they became a republic

485
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,184
Because he f***** everybody

486
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,560
Exactly

487
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,376
So black nobility

488
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,984
Nobility

489
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:04,640
Black nobility is just a term that's used to describe Italian in Italian because of the time

490
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,432
. but in the area of Italy

491
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,992
Aristocratic families who sided with the Pope

492
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
Kingdom of Italy

493
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,064
Came into Roman overthrew Pope

494
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
Pius the 9th

495
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
In 1870

496
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,696
That's what the black nobility was people who sided with

497
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
The papacy over the state of

498
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,608
Because Pope Pius was a piece of s***

499
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
He was f****** garbage

500
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,496
Exactly the kind of thing that Alex Jones

501
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,360
Super against was corrupted who is monstrous and who was apparently

502
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Just

503
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:41,248
Destroyer

504
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:47,648
Able to do into the idea of the black nobility and what have you

505
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:52,512
Leads back to a bunch of theories about to howdy Venetian oligarchs

506
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:57,376
The black nobility who is becoming black nobility were comprised of

507
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,424
You're about avocados hours

508
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
No

509
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,544
The name is applied to a semi-nomadic group of

510
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
Descent

511
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,896
Yeah I thought that is not related to the Cossacks

512
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,552
I don't know I don't think so I don't think it's a Pacifica.

513
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,648
It's very popular in a few somatic and anti-zionist circles

514
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,488
But slightly less popular and academic ones that the

515
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,048
Because our bloodline or

516
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:30,912
Case if you make a one-to-one comparison d-black nobility the Venetian oligarchs

517
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:34,752
I thought that bloodline is responsible for the ethnogenesis of us

518
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Eskenazi Jews

519
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
Not that it's not very real

520
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,504
That's one of the reasons why Alex

521
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
Third of compelled towards these ideas

522
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,648
Cuz you get into the idea of like the black nobility

523
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:55,232
As a historical entity but also

524
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:00,608
It wasn't like it wasn't some Grand conspiracy that still lingers to this day

525
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,216
I think that is the case in a lot of conspiracy theory worth

526
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:11,616
But at the same time you get these ideas

527
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,688
And in all this like these evil

528
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:22,368
Extra Vatican entities with a lot of this cannizzaro

529
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:26,208
Or idea that I have time to unpack right now

530
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
Have a

531
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,280
Do you think we'll ever have a black pope

532
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,096
Like not but I mean like a boy

533
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,680
African descent

534
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
I don't think so he's not Catholic

535
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
That's a first problem

536
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
That is an issue

537
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
What is an issue

538
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
I don't know everybody I think I need to ask

539
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,432
I think eventually we may get there but who knows

540
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
The world probably doesn't have enough time

541
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:56,416
Black nobility in

542
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,232
Probably a dog whistle to

543
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,536
Anti-semitic ideas about the roots of

544
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
Ashkenazi

545
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,632
But be that as it may

546
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Alex

00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,472
Famous Mexican meinkampf at 11

Everything you believe

00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:29,440
Is almost exclusively from Nazi propaganda

554
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,280
I was going over the Friday episode

555
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,352
Cuz I was going to initially go over Friday

556
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
Episode

557
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,424
But

558
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
It did not

559
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
It did not

560
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
End up making

561
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,056
In the cut we have big narrative on Friday

562
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,592
Is that

563
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,128
The

564
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,200
This church in Australia is not allowed to

565
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
Disabled Jesus

566
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,784
In there are in a banner that they put up

567
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,136
The great narrative that really covers the big issues of our time

568
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,000
He's taking this

569
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:10,400
He's taking this from a Daily Mail article and I went and looked at the Daily Mail article from it here

570
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,520
Claimed Lend-Lease what's the name of the mall or the company that owns them all

571
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:20,384
Requested to withdraw the word Jesus from assign as a suspended Shoppers and non-Christian

572
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:25,760
Pastor David said Lend Lease has to change their mind and allow the word Jesus to be included in the sign

573
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:30,624
In a statement the Lend-Lease spokeswoman said that they regretted asking for the sign to be amended

574
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,976
It was an error of judgment to ask Elam Church to change it to messaging a tweet

575
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,512
Apologise unreservedly

576
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,584
That's in the actual article that Alex is reporting

577
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
I don't trust him to do anything

578
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,960
I don't trust him to know about history

579
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,032
Based on his inability to read an article

580
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,688
You can't expect anybody to read all the way to the third paragraph

581
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,808
Forever

582
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,904
That's his reading comprehension at-44

583
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
I don't fucken want to know what it was it

584
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,256
Fix I don't know I don't know what I

585
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
How Abel he was to parse

586
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,864
The language of a monstrous

587
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,448
Future dictator and his anti-semitic vision of the world

588
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
Is a six-year-old

589
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,520
Or even is at 10 year old

590
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:23,104
I don't want to f****** no he can't do it

591
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
That's not good

592
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
The other job

593
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,456
He described that job in this next clip

594
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:32,576
And then he said some other explain

595
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
Look at me.

596
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,672
And so I'm here

597
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,768
Trying to explain this stuff really works

598
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,560
From their own admission

599
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
And they think you're such fools

600
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,192
He'll just tell you doesn't exist but look at you

601
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,776
Heaven wants to told me Alex they'll never listen to you

602
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
In fact

603
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,592
Will tear you apart for warning them

604
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
Grainger Supply

605
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,064
Can I play the globalist

606
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,624
Hollow Earth stopped revolving

607
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,648
Cannot join them

608
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
So

609
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Fairy

610
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
Disassembly

611
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,608
Warn all of you that the decision

612
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,784
Andrew

613
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,064
McKay

614
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,416
Does bring it up

615
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,536
What is media Access Control

616
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,912
Sure just political hacks putting Power by Bush senior in Bush

617
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,704
Obama and the clintons

618
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,592
Covered up all the crimes the Communist Chinese takeover of America

619
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,920
Makeup

620
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
The Conjuring of country

621
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,600
What else

622
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:16,000
When American Embassy Patrick's Day

623
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
The Gallows

624
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,584
From the neck until dead

625
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,144
Before that switch.

626
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
The floor open

627
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
Country forever

628
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,288
Providence show today

629
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
Face again

630
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
Space again

631
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,480
Just that to me is

632
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
Boy

633
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,576
I don't know what time he recorded this at but no time make sense

634
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:48,512
Well the only way you can say it like if you think Trump is the face of Providence

635
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,840
F****** face

636
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,632
Is the face

637
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
Of Providence

638
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
We did not

639
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,240
Enjoy that it came in this for

640
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,544
Looked

641
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
It's just all bad

642
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:08,736
McCabe

643
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:12,832
Trigger into the media personalities are presidents

644
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:18,208
Yep place in order to lie to us about the Chinese takeover also

645
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:24,096
One of his big narratives that he's pushing right now is that Apple has moved all of the cloud keys to China

646
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
And we discussed

647
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,936
Before you moved

648
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,472
The Chinese kids today

649
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,520
The Chinese government has access to it

650
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:37,920
Entire world

651
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,736
Right now

652
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
Chinese

653
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,296
Government has a real bad history

654
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
Onboard

655
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,904
Onboard I'm with you there

656
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,976
That's not a great

657
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,536
That's the biggest reason why capitalism

658
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,328
Really needs to be regulate

659
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,168
Because Apple has that opportunity to be like

660
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
No it turns out

661
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
Like realistic

662
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Apple

663
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
Is

664
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,128
Capable of being stronger than the Chinese

665
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,272
Then the Chinese government realistic

666
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
They could draw

667
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,624
Now go f*** yourself

668
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,928
And then China would become

669
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,584
Essentially North Korea like they would have to develop all of this s*** on their own but they probably would probably be successful

670
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,936
Connected to the rest of the world

671
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:35,008
A much more isolated place

672
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,080
Most likely go

673
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,152
And it starts to collapse

674
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
The size of

675
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:46,272
Like that's one of the big things about their control is that

676
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
If they are connected

677
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
To the outside world

678
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
Control a much larger

679
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,232
Yeah North Korea was as large

680
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,792
Just tryna it would have collapsed a million years

681
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
Absolutely

682
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
Be a dictator over that

683
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,984
Without like a amended version of

684
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
Without the

685
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,592
Tacit approval of everybody else based on your

686
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,664
That's what it comes

687
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,712
To save it like everyone's complicit with

688
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,992
The Chinese government in like

689
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,784
To a certain extent I don't

690
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,344
Totally

691
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,488
The other piece of it that goes beyond the complicit part of the univet economic picture that your drawing is that

692
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,560
A war would be ridiculous

693
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:35,936
Like that would be absurd would be the only way to deal with

694
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
You know

695
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,520
The actual human rights

696
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,312
Horrible record

697
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,872
Imagine

698
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
If

699
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
Global Corporation

700
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,272
Actually they really cooked

701
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,088
Its Global corporations

702
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
Their own

703
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,184
There's nothing anybody could do over

704
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,208
That's interesting

705
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:03,072
Nothing anybody could do about it I would I would I would

706
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,400
You just said is a refutation of the idea of globalization

707
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:13,568
Exactly because if that centralized organized group that Alex pretends he's fighting against

708
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
Really existed

709
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
They already have done that

710
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:20,736
So that's interesting that reality that

711
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:27,136
In all honesty maybe one of the things that is protecting us is unregulated capitalism

712
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Insofar as

713
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,488
If corporations actually wanted to become their own Nation

714
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,048
There would be nothing to stop them

715
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,864
At this point in time

716
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,168
If if they wanted to

717
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
No one could stop

718
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:45,568
There's no stopping their economic power if they decided to become one block

719
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,384
Then we would have a global government essentially

720
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,200
Interesting thought

721
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:57,600
Alex

722
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,928
I think we're in a couple of bean bags

723
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,256
To realize that a corporation could become a state

724
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,840
Alex wants to stress how important

725
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
Times are

726
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,424
He is unable to put it into words

727
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
Probably cuz he's Daedra

728
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,008
Providence showed it

729
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
Already off to a bad start

730
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Face again

731
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Smiling

732
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
Patient

733
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
With fake hair

734
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
Pulling us back

735
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
Racist

736
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,720
And just a spirit of

737
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,536
Life of spirit of success.

738
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
Joyce.

739
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,120
Future endeavors

740
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,680
That is dead

741
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:49,056
Really like future endeavors it's fun to use that terminology because that's like

742
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:55,711
You know it went wrestling when you get fired you get future Endeavor menology like we look forward to

743
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,783
Future endeavors

744
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
You have a Culture of Fear like

745
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,671
That terminology is always used in a in a firing

746
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:08,255
Future endeavors

747
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,447
Came back in the world like a son

748
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239
Cutting through

749
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
The Tempest

750
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,847
And that's what we all right

751
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
Destroying you can feel the energy

752
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Literature

753
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,479
Tectonic

754
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
Shifting

755
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
Seal

756
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,135
All the old scores all the old battles

757
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,183
Repercussions

758
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
Percussions

759
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Drums

760
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,935
We can always help

761
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,239
Where is an amazing moment

762
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
Industry right now

763
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,895
I struggled before I do these life is like

764
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,199
Your mind Dua

765
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
Articulate the gravity

766
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
The importance

767
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
Historical nature

768
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
The timer

769
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,559
Secretive

770
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
Quarterly

771
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,471
I f******

772
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,495
Love

773
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
That like

774
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
If Alex was a stand-up

775
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
One of his b

776
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,175
That would get the audience I can get her done

777
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,759
Don't know how

778
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,855
To express the Majesty of the

779
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Subs

780
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,439
Stars aligning in solarwinds

781
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:47,839
Coming through launching off on a soliloquy using all this grandiose f****** language while sitting idle

782
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:54,239
Don't know how to describe how important these times are

783
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,799
Is a term for storm is actually

784
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,127
I don't think I was even a reference

785
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,247
Quotes from Donald Trump

786
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,783
Then if you're paying

787
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
If you're paying close attention

788
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
The event

789
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
The big old drink

790
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
So here we are

791
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,487
Watch WhatsApp

792
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
I always go with my gut

793
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,559
Play Slash.

794
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
Oh my God

795
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
Everything okay

796
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
Call masala

797
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
I'd like to study

798
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,543
44

799
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,711
You know I used to remind myself

800
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,503
Obsess over things with

801
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,551
The deepest thing I ever did was

802
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,343
Start going with just my

803
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
First assumption

804
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
That was the cheapest thing in my life

805
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,255
So I want to read the actual Trump quote

806
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,327
This is from his book think like a billionaire

807
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
Personally

808
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,471
Easy for him to write he has a

809
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
Great

810
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Attention span

811
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:04,639
The actual quote is the day I realized it can be smart to be shallow was for me a deep experience

812
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:09,247
Different than what Alex is suggesting

813
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,807
Because what he's saying

814
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
Sometimes

815
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
It's advantageous

816
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,183
To just use your basic

817
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
Impulse

818
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,815
How much superficial distrust is reading comprehension

819
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,631
She doesn't know what the word quote mean

820
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,167
Right because Alex

821
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,447
Who's presenting it is like

822
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
It's

823
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,751
Deep to be shallow

824
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,567
Or something like that like

825
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:37,663
In there

826
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
Anyway let's finish this

827
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,015
See if you can figure out where he takes a drink

828
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
A shower

829
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
People didn't get

830
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
Halcyon

831
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
What

832
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,999
They thought his a*******

833
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,303
The cheapest thing ever

834
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887
It's right here

835
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
Do you have a room

836
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,751
You heard him swallow

837
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,055
Georgia woman's intuition

838
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,895
Funny after he takes a big Pole from that whiskey he's like

839
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,455
Olivia woman

840
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:17,855
Doesn't get more obvious that it's a mixed drink with ice

841
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:26,047
Have the second camera to cut away to actually I have snapshots of it

842
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,607
He's going under the desk

843
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,215
Cuphead takes

844
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
F****** pull off it

845
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,287
Never take from a water cup

846
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,311
It's

847
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:41,663
0 chance and there's actually a part of me that like got really sucking

848
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
A tutorial as I was watching

849
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
Drink

850
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,295
He side-eyes the camera

851
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
As if to say

852
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
Come on Alex

853
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,439
Isaac

854
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:59,839
We have the courage to drink live realistically what it was was that he was taking the drink

855
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,655
He didn't realize there wasn't a camera to go to

856
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,471
To the cameras more I look of like

857
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:09,055
I'm on I'm on are clearly

858
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:15,455
I've never seen him do this before he takes the drink and slides it to like we're just out of camera frame

859
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,479
I'm in front of him

860
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,063
Play Kyoto Rob do comes over and collect it from

861
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,623
It's not it's very weird

862
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,159
So anyway you taking to drink

863
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,975
He asked about women's intuition will pick up right there

864
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,511
11

865
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,631
Ignored your woman's intuition

866
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
Women consciously

867
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,567
Statistically are men at making decisions

868
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:45,407
Decisions about how to buy robbed

869
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,247
Intuition about Street smarts

870
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,551
We balance that out together

871
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,671
So in closing here I just want to say

872
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,975
So in closing

873
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,767
He's already closing

874
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:07,423
She has mentioned Makeba once in passing it on reporters

875
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,055
Spoiler he's not but

876
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,359
Buzz

877
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,639
Get wasted

878
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,175
You going to stay out there a little bit

879
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,967
Oh yeah you got a ride this out

880
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,039
Good classical Western chauvinism

881
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,575
I love solo

882
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,367
Kia of applying stick

883
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
Statistics

884
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,415
To what women can

885
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Can do on the bed

886
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
Battlefield

887
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
As though

888
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
As though

889
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,559
It's been something that they have had

890
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,399
Controlled experiment

891
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,215
No it's not it's not like there is an equal representation

892
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,239
Visitation there 2X

893
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Viable

894
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,055
Measure of

895
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,079
Statistic

896
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
Alex

897
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,663
Stupid

898
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:53,247
That's light

899
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,527
Statistically

900
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Women

901
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:01,695
If they're on their. They're going to lose their uterus whenever they try and

902
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,487
Let's just true facts

903
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
Statistically

904
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
So many women

905
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,607
Uterus is just Fallout

906
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:13,727
I mean for me right now I find his chauvinism a little bit boring

907
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,823
I don't know I just I don't even want to engage

908
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:27,551
I keep dreaming of it as well

909
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Whiskey on the rocks

910
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,135
And he's like I don't want to talk about the thing I'm supposed to

911
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
We talkin about

912
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
It's not

913
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,559
No mixed drink I

914
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,839
Right now

915
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,375
Present

916
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,679
Oh that's interesting

917
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:46,239
To make you feel as though I drink it straight

918
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,263
Yeah

919
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,127
You're probably right you probably a silly boy who pretends to drink black coffee

920
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:59,295
We are taking it back I said it would never happen we're taking it back

921
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
Starlight

922
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,879
It's not going to work now

923
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:09,535
20 second experiment

924
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
Flo-Jo

925
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,583
In the last

926
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,399
If you want to go back a couple months

927
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,215
Trump saying he's a globalist

928
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:21,567
Just look at the last month or so we had Trump saying I like chicken

929
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,591
Morgan's early

930
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,871
Yeah we had him

931
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,919
Suggesting that maybe he should

932
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,943
Be president for life

933
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:32,319
Drug dealers make you should get the death penalty

934
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:35,391
Set alarm things pretty counter to Alex's

935
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:41,791
Philosophy

936
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:46,399
Inception but talk a little bit about the gun stuff

937
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
But he could have pushed

938
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,703
Woodside in Saginaw

939
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:59,711
Machiavelli

940
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,015
12 Alex

941
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
Explain the

942
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,831
He's always wrong

943
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,111
Whenever he Quest

944
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,207
Show enclosing here

945
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,023
I have watched Trump in a

946
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Compendium

947
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
What he's done

948
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,423
Can always when something looks like a betrayal

949
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,495
It turns out that the opposite

950
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
Not going with my gut

951
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,663
Shoes just so I could

952
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,199
Feel like I was being fair

953
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
That's why

954
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,831
So they get one

955
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
Like salad

956
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Turn right

957
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,791
And all of the setup

958
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,071
Criminal Network

959
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:47,839
Evident

960
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,863
Inside

961
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
The jesters.

962
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:56,287
Haven't paid for fake dossier Zentorno at workout

963
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:00,383
That sound

964
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:09,599
It's Alex finally got to McCabe here a little bit the timeline of the Fusion GPS

965
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,951
And the donations from McCalla to McCabe's wife

966
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,231
Run

967
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:18,815
Don't match up the timeline doesn't match up

968
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,095
All this narrative is

969
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
Pretty wack

970
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,191
But Alex is saying that it's all over the news now

971
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,983
That McCabe made

972
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,287
He's a subordinates change their

973
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,567
302 form

974
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:33,663
Which of the forms of the FBI uses to report on interview

975
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:38,271
Suspects or Persons of Interest in what

976
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:48,255
Well feel like I would know if it was all over the news it's being reported in Gateway

977
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,023
Way pundit

978
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,559
Oh yeah well then

979
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,095
And I went and check that out

980
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,399
Fans that one source on that

981
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,935
Completes

982
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,959
They're put out

983
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
By Mike cernovich

984
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,823
Mike cernovich has source

985
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,871
Anonymous source

986
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:10,015
So I don't have to hold off on this one way of trying to get Flynn off the hook

987
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,343
Right that's exactly what they're doing

988
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,903
Attack the Mueller probe

989
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,207
So anyway I don't really care it's not

990
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,743
It's not in the news

991
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,535
But also

992
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,351
I don't think that Alex should be

993
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,631
Critiquing Trump

994
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,423
Funny says really f***** up stuff

995
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,959
Because he wants to appear Fair

996
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:33,823
I think you should be attacking Trump because Trump is saying things that run counter to his beliefs

997
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
Canto

998
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,383
He is a f******

999
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Sycophantic

1000
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:42,271
What a pathetic little

1001
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,343
For somebody

1002
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,159
Still disappointed

1003
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,463
At the very least

1004
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,487
Prior to trap

1005
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,279
He was

1006
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,839
Trying to be an iconoclast

1007
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,679
He was trying to be the only guy who is doing what

1008
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:04,799
With a little country music

1009
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,103
He's trying to be himself

1010
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,663
Now he is trying

1011
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,479
He's actively trying just by that clip right there

1012
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,527
Wendy's contractor not be

1013
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:19,135
Every time that I disagree with Trump

1014
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,415
I'm wrong

1015
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
He's trying

1016
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
To be a little bit

1017
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,511
Yeah yeah

1018
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
Have

1019
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,047
F******

1020
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
Backbone anymore

1021
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,287
Pathetic

1022
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,103
Yeah and it's really sad because like

1023
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,919
If things go the direction they are

1024
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,943
Cure to be going

1025
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
And

1026
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,551
I don't know let's say Trump does fire Mueller

1027
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:52,671
He will text you earlier I put it in a 94

1028
00:54:54,463 --> 00:55:00,607
Against the advice of literally everybody anywhere near him

1029
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,679
3 a.m.

1030
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:10,079
If we do see those sorts of things we we are at we are seeing the deter

1031
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,359
Curation of

1032
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,151
Civil government

1033
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:17,247
Not like civil government meaning like you

1034
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
Just be

1035
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,319
The idea that we can govern

1036
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,855
Yeah

1037
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,415
Is being De Pere right in front of all right

1038
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:27,487
And the idea that I would like a mouth

1039
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,559
That pushes for and apologizes

1040
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,327
For that

1041
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,679
When that's so counters everything he stood for for the last couple decades

1042
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:39,263
It's particularly sad it's so pathetic that

1043
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
He

1044
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,567
For whatever reason

1045
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
Maybe money

1046
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,919
Maybe blackmail

1047
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,711
I genuinely don't know it

1048
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:53,343
Tell me something real powerful those a drive that's really really powerful

1049
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,135
And I can't just be like

1050
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,159
Maybe

1051
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,183
Maybe it's syphilis

1052
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,511
Have we considered that

1053
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
He's just

1054
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,095
Lonely at this point like

1055
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:08,447
That like you can get Rob to come down to the stereo on St Patrick's Day

1056
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,751
I mean

1057
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:14,847
He has tried to avoid aligning himself with a movement

1058
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
That exist

1059
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,431
Do you know like the Teto

1060
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
Really

1061
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:23,551
Cuz he's always been a Ron Paul guy

1062
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,087
Community there

1063
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,879
And 911 truth

1064
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:31,231
He's always had a really secure place within that

1065
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
That world

1066
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,559
I don't know I don't think

1067
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,119
And the truth is Dracula calls 911

1068
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
Stroop

1069
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,679
He was a town

1070
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:42,239
Turn into a bat

1071
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,871
Yeah I don't know man it's it's really f***** up and the more we think about it the last we know

1072
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:48,895
But

1073
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,431
Something good come out eventually

1074
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
Anyway

1075
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,271
We can we can speculate about

1076
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,855
The reality of the world all we want

1077
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
Globalist

1078
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,415
And Patriots

1079
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,183
Not true

1080
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
No it's not

1081
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,791
You might be asking yourself

1082
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,327
Who's ahead

1083
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
Is it

1084
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,399
Or the Patriots

1085
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,215
Is this like one of those

1086
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:18,335
Go to a basketball game and they have the Dunkin Donut racing

1087
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:25,759
The milkshake or whatever the f*** I would rather it be that

1088
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,575
To be like

1089
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:33,695
We're here we're here I love it the audio of it

1090
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
No Lie

1091
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,047
Comprehensive video you're not missing any

1092
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:40,863
Is

1093
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,935
Everyone knows that I don't

1094
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:58,271
I think I was super Peter Gunn

1095
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,831
Now

1096
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,183
Falling apart Alex

1097
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
Not what I had

1098
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,279
Because in the time-space

1099
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,143
But let's say they're this far ahead

1100
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,423
We're like Warp

1101
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,447
Right now

1102
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,775
I can cook them

1103
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,615
100 Years of global ocean robber barons the British Empire population

1104
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,895
To get up here

1105
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:28,479
And just in five years we're just that's why they're like

1106
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,063
Don't know what to do

1107
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,879
Easy cheesy analogy

1108
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
They already blown up

1109
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,815
New

1110
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,607
Skynet

1111
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,399
Stop

1112
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,215
And and we're basically

1113
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,007
What

1114
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,639
Getting this this system of globalism all businesses tell people jokes

1115
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:04,063
Weird that's why the energy so high it's why they're so painting

1116
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,111
What are they going to launch

1117
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,159
MX6

1118
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
I don't know

1119
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,583
Yeah probably will see we'll see what your periods are about that

1120
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,607
Weird

1121
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,911
Cuz you talk to me what it is

1122
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,191
He thinks he say

1123
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,471
I think he thinks

1124
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,495
You saying

1125
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,543
That in order for the globalist

1126
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,871
To succeed at this point they will have to go back in time

1127
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
Yeah

1128
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:33,247
They'll have to send someone back in time to kill young Alex Jones

1129
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,295
That's not a bad idea

1130
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,087
I guess he thinks he's

1131
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,903
Jon Connor for woodwork

1132
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,183
Is that is that right

1133
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,487
Yeah and the globalist have Arnold on their side

1134
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:48,095
Yeah until the 2nd

1135
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:52,191
Okay they're secretly movie

1136
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,775
I don't know I have no idea how to re watch Terminator

1137
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,335
I don't know

1138
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,127
I always find

1139
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:06,527
Like we kind of distasteful because it's always

1140
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,319
It's very much it's very much

1141
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087
Him

1142
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:14,463
Constantly trying to keep you on your toes you know like there's always

1143
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:19,839
We're winning in because we're winning

1144
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,607
And then it's like

1145
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:26,495
Well maybe we're tired and we're losing right now in order to win

1146
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,847
That's not always

1147
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,919
There is a losing

1148
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:38,527
Is always be able to

1149
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
Succeed

1150
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,855
I need that money because it's getting food like crazy

1151
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,695
But in the next help me settle my lawsuit with laundered money

1152
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:48,511
Paint

1153
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,047
Globalist oppression

1154
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:55,167
People would think the government

1155
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,959
The persecution

1156
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:02,847
Then offered all the former employees money alive

1157
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,383
Hillary's people

1158
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,943
None of that is what happened

1159
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:13,343
Not the government and Georgetown is not the one

1160
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,439
What's Brandon Gilmore

1161
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:21,279
No he's not in play and also

1162
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:27,679
If anyone is giving

1163
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,263
Talking to ex employees of Alex

1164
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,055
I'm saying like will give you money

1165
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,103
Some sort of like

1166
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,639
Protect you from your MBA

1167
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:42,527
Yeah or something like that disclosure agreement you signed when you work

1168
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,087
Write get around that right now offering people

1169
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,647
Thirty pieces of silver to turn on Jesus

1170
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,463
Nda's do not protect

1171
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,279
Yeah but there's probably a lot of embarrassing

1172
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,583
Stop people want out that's not quite a crime

1173
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,399
Maybe journalists are asking them about

1174
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,727
I believe that

1175
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,031
Alex Jones committed a crime

1176
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:10,431
The ndaa doesn't cover crying out there who used to work at Infowars know about 425 Supply

1177
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,991
Hit us up cuz that's a crime for real

1178
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:23,487
Anna left thinks I'm like them like that miso

1179
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,279
Usher

1180
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,815
I go towards the attack

1181
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,167
Do

1182
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
Change the world

1183
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
Insincere

1184
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,223
Expressing how every

1185
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:44,991
Time

1186
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,271
He brings up something

1187
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
Where is like

1188
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,343
They think I have a bank

1189
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,695
We didn't think that

1190
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:02,399
And you're really stressing about how much he's lost after going to cost you when you settle them

1191
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
It's like

1192
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:07,775
You're the unhappy why are you saying

1193
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:11,871
So obvious

1194
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,431
Absolutely it's so obvious

1195
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:17,247
Episodes from couple years back

1196
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:23,135
Having a blast talking about the globalist

1197
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:29,535
Metallica coming out of the break

1198
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:33,887
Now in 2018 a decade later convincing himself

1199
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,983
But he's important that he has power but he's happy

1200
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,775
That we can get both

1201
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,335
I don't know I can do this anymore

1202
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:49,759
And I'm the happiest I've ever been in the same context of the I can't do this anymore either.

1203
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:53,343
Alright

1204
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,415
Is it level starting

1205
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
Couple years ago

1206
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,255
This is like Patrick

1207
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,583
Top retired General

1208
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,887
Halo CIA

1209
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,423
Transformer

1210
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,495
Or people in Hollywood or whatever

1211
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,055
What do we do Alex

1212
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:16,895
We're waiting for you to leave Alex what are we supposed to do

1213
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,919
What do we do

1214
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,759
I thought it was like

1215
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,671
And then I realize

1216
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,231
Conversations the president dollars

1217
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,583
What the President says

1218
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,887
Are Spirit strongly I believe in God

1219
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,447
Hillside be strong Army Strong

1220
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Sweetheart

1221
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,031
All of us

1222
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,079
Why do young Asian

1223
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,639
As long as we love God we're all equal we are better

1224
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,735
He's just a lot of strength

1225
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,271
Heath Ledger

1226
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,623
He understands what's going on he is putting a very strong face on

1227
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,183
We going to finish the rest of this clip but I just wanted to buy

1228
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,463
Cuz I Alex

1229
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:05,023
The point of Saint Patrick's Day drunk where he's like

1230
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,583
You really into talking about God

1231
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:12,447
Keep coming up basically turning into a preacher again

1232
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:16,031
This is supposed to be a special report about McCabe and Hillary Clinton

1233
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,335
For everybody

1234
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,359
And

1235
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:20,895
It's happening

1236
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
IPad

1237
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,527
Leaders of the most elite military teams are are

1238
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,319
Tell me

1239
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
Alex you're too humble

1240
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,647
We're waiting for leadership

1241
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,439
What are we supposed to do

1242
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:37,279
It's get down he's talking about

1243
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:41,631
Alex Ezra leader of Seal Team 6

1244
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,775
Is that an eagle they're like no you've already done

1245
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,311
We understand you for real

1246
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,127
And your specialized in this what we do

1247
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,391
Sure

1248
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,439
That's really sad to me

1249
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,231
That's very very sad

1250
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:12,863
Because I think what he's worth selecting on when he's talking about this stuff is you talkin about people like Steve pieczenik

1251
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,399
It's ever been like

1252
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:17,983
Steve on the show buttering up his ego like crazy

1253
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,543
Clear that he's manipulating

1254
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,615
Literally obvious

1255
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:26,175
Easiest person to con in history because

1256
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,479
Really wants to be caught

1257
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,527
You know what I bet we could fake a fight

1258
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:34,111
Or something like that on one of our episodes where

1259
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
Pretend

1260
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
That like

1261
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,439
I have been convinced

1262
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,463
Did Alex's right

1263
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:45,631
Right then we fake a kind of a fake a couple episodes

1264
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:49,983
Where I'm like doing fake Alex's totally right about stuff

1265
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:56,383
I bet I could get on his show

1266
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:03,807
Globalist

1267
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:07,647
Doesn't mean you're an anti-semite now especially if we did it in the first

1268
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:14,047
Couple minutes of the headline I bet we could I bet

1269
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:21,215
Whitewash the entirety of the last year-and-a-half and he be like

1270
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:27,871
He's very Triple A man who

1271
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,175
So now he is become a patriot

1272
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,295
I was responsible for album see the light

1273
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,367
Even though I would be a hundred percent

1274
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:45,023
And even if having this conversation wouldn't preclude the ability of us to do this in this picture

1275
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:49,887
Relationship

1276
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,191
You know how sometimes Alex Jones likes

1277
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,727
To say if you understand

1278
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,775
This clip you understand every

1279
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,847
Kingsley when he's talking about chimeras attention

1280
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,383
This next clip

1281
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,943
If you understand what's going on in this neck

1282
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,015
Text clip you understand everything about Alex Jones

1283
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,039
I think this clip

1284
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,831
Kind of perfectly sums up

1285
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,367
His head space right now

1286
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,903
Especially when he's drunk

1287
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:13,951
D'lites

1288
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,487
Bite down on this one

1289
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,375
Infowars has

1290
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,167
Has them scared and what is it

1291
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,471
I don't get off

1292
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,567
I don't get off at a bigger house

1293
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,407
I don't get off on having knowledge I want to share it

1294
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,967
That's why they think Trump mentally ill

1295
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,783
It's why they say I have a dark heart not a monster

1296
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:43,391
Because you don't give that knowledge people to have this knowledge

1297
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:45,183
You don't give it to the profaned

1298
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,071
I instinctively

1299
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,911
What knowledge for people that have more than I

1300
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,727
And I want to give you the knowledge I have

1301
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,311
People

1302
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,895
They believe

1303
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,879
I can do this anymore

1304
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
Listen

1305
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,351
All I'm telling you is Hollywood

1306
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,143
What

1307
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,727
This

1308
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:30,751
Is

1309
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,335
Everything you need to know about Alex Jones

1310
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:40,991
Word salad nonsense about like this is why

1311
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,551
Knowledge and you're not supposed to give it to the uninitiated

1312
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:47,391
Everybody golobulus Cherryville

1313
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,719
My wife mad at me

1314
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,279
Do this anymore

1315
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,559
Long pause

1316
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,191
Hollywood is not support

1317
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,871
Trail because he gets a text from his wife said he's not happy about

1318
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,711
Obviously it's something like why are you drunk at the studio with Rob Duke

1319
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:15,039
Saint Patrick's day was supposed to be hanging out with our kids

1320
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,831
Something like that

1321
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:20,671
Thursday Keegan D I can't do this anymore

1322
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:24,511
I don't think it's about the show now I got to go home

1323
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,047
I think it's about it

1324
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,399
Family is getting in the way of my preaching the truth about Trump

1325
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:37,055
It could go either way that could be like I'm sick and tired of doing this show the way I'm doing it or could be like

1326
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,871
Family responsibilities

1327
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Anyway

1328
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,087
Anybody

1329
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,135
Regardless of anything

1330
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,719
If you agree with me 100%

1331
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:58,559
Or if you disagree with me 100% or anywhere in between

1332
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:02,143
If you start talking about how the leader is connected

1333
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
God

1334
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:03,935
I'm out

1335
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:07,775
Oh yeah I know thanks

1336
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,055
New god-king

1337
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,847
.

1338
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:14,431
It's next level

1339
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:19,551
You know the rhetoric that comes out of the supporters of dictators

1340
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,623
Kind of

1341
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,903
Even happy

1342
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:28,255
Hockey is a propagandist to do that work

1343
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,279
Still works

1344
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,327
It's very easy humans are s***

1345
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,143
Yeah maybe we should

1346
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:39,775
I mean there's that old demon movement that I mentioned on our route

1347
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,271
Anyway

1348
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:53,855
Alex Jones gets into like the Hollywood has nothing for you

1349
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,415
Miss transitions into a motivational speech

1350
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,487
Kind of get back on topic

1351
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:02,559
And then ends up with even more of a dictator Eli

1352
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,423
The whole system has nothing

1353
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,191
Feeling insecure

1354
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,727
Stop

1355
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,591
If he just said that and nothing else

1356
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,639
Lovett his listeners

1357
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,663
No

1358
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,455
Feel insecure

1359
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,991
You don't have power

1360
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,015
Please

1361
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,831
Please Retreat into your own fantasy world

1362
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,855
And don't interact

1363
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:31,487
But the power to break free of the conditioning at Alex's putting off to them they're not

1364
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:37,887
Everyone has a chance for a second or third shot

1365
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:44,287
Everyone can be the hero of Their Own Story if they just turned things around a little bit and I wish nothing but the best for you

1366
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,615
Is out there but I expect very little

1367
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:50,943
It is that Alex Jones listeners have second act

1368
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:51,711
Problems

1369
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,991
That's the issue

1370
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:56,831
If you're going to go with a class

1371
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:01,183
Joseph Campbell and kind of situation a hero's journey of your will

1372
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,743
You guys got to figure out how to get past the crisis

1373
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:10,143
Will the problem with psych trying to frame his listeners into like a hero's journey is that by definition

1374
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,191
None of them can be the actor in the

1375
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:18,591
The story the protagonist

1376
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
The antagonist

1377
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,663
And you had best AR

1378
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,735
Someone is along for the ride

1379
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:31,135
You're just helping out along the road a couple pieces of gold or something like that

1380
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,439
Seaquest at Beth

1381
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:38,303
Side quest he answered your phone call

1382
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:41,375
I still like

1383
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,471
So desperate in the Alex Jones land

1384
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,495
In 2018

1385
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,263
That I'm like

1386
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:53,151
I like this and I want a pointed out that I like the idea of Alex Jones saying

1387
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:58,783
You're empowered you don't need all the right stuff in if people just apply it in the right direction I think

1388
01:13:59,295 --> 01:13:59,807
Positive message

1389
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,855
I think he's going to

1390
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
Stop

1391
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,487
Stop

1392
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,559
Thinking you have to look outside yourself and God for answers

1393
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,351
Because this whole thing.

1394
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,655
Trump

1395
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,679
Going after

1396
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
McCabe

1397
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,471
His fraud

1398
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,519
Yes falsifying

1399
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,543
Just running

1400
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,311
Oakland

1401
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,591
Again

1402
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,359
The fact

1403
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,127
Trump fired

1404
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:29,503
Is everything you need to know your side

1405
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
Is real

1406
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,295
Trump

1407
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,367
And I

1408
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,415
Because we believe it's Rob.

1409
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,279
We given to Hillary leaving to Michael Moore

1410
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,327
Given the Dianne Feinstein of

1411
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,935
To the Rothschilds and Rockefellers

1412
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,215
We die

1413
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:52,031
We're not fighting them because we want Power

1414
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:55,103
We're fighting on because when we're with them

1415
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,127
Underwater

1416
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,455
It's spiritual

1417
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,991
Strangulation

1418
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:05,087
So real quick before you respond to that I just want to point out that there was a click

1419
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:07,391
In there

1420
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:17,375
You could see his phone

1421
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,167
Wife is not happy

1422
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:26,335
But you know that the indictment stuff is all just probably Rodger Stone in a year

1423
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,639
It's just the hot talk

1424
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,407
In the

1425
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:32,991
The conservative World necessarily

1426
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,551
Involved like that everybody

1427
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,087
Everybody hot narrative

1428
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:41,183
Really trying to convince themselves that Trump isn't guilty

1429
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,743
Okay

1430
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
Meteor shower

1431
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,607
Based on everything that I know about human nature

1432
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
I would guess

1433
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,703
Really

1434
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,495
Really doesn't believe he's guilty

1435
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,335
But based on everything I know about Trump

1436
01:15:58,847 --> 01:15:59,359
In the past

1437
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,383
Today's

1438
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,663
Really

1439
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:04,479
Really believe he's guilty of money laundering

1440
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,271
That's gas

1441
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,319
It's so that's why he's going to fire Mueller

1442
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,599
Is because this time

1443
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:15,999
There's no way he knows he's not guilty because Mueller has subpoenaed documents

1444
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:20,351
There's no collusion

1445
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:25,983
It's because

1446
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,007
Nose

1447
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:27,775
He's guilty of

1448
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:31,871
Some serious consideration I might agree with your 90% assassin

1449
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
Look

1450
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,199
I don't know man

1451
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:41,855
Did the idea that even as a political distraction there would be indictments against like Hillary and Bill

1452
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,879
Obama

1453
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,159
Right stuff like that like

1454
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,231
Do you understand the Powder Keg that's that's all

1455
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:51,583
Like that is an unbelievable shitstorm of

1456
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,351
Descent

1457
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:58,751
To tyranny that like punishing your political Rivals a year-and-a-half after an election

1458
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,823
Doesn't send a good message

1459
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,383
It certainly would be

1460
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,223
Tragic Prelude to the

1461
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,503
The midterm

1462
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,271
What I think

1463
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,551
Issue there

1464
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,319
Is

1465
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,855
That they are jealous

1466
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
Because

1467
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,671
All of those people

1468
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,463
Totally committed crimes

1469
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,767
That they should be held accountable for

1470
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,327
They're better

1471
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,607
Getting away

1472
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,375
Set the new guys

1473
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:29,727
Ain't there nothing it's not the crimes that

1474
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:35,103
Alex is accusing other crime

1475
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:39,711
Good at it because they hire people who know how to do this s***

1476
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,759
And you guys are stupid

1477
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,295
Feel like you can just

1478
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:48,671
It like you're like well they can hide their crime so I can hide mine but you don't learn how

1479
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:55,071
It comes from that like inferiority childishness that Alex Express is all the time

1480
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,607
Exactly that sort of thing

1481
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,399
Right right

1482
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:03,007
It's like it's like you're a kid in school and you see the cool kid

1483
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:07,615
Why can he get away with all the stuff and I can't

1484
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:14,015
You can't get away and still living in that Paradigm for some extent

1485
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,087
Go to be like

1486
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,879
Hey I'm better at you

1487
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,647
And it starts

1488
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,183
Just being a statement of fact

1489
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:27,583
Competing with me anymore for me to tell you that your

1490
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,143
Because you just are and I'm just

1491
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,751
You just make it very clear that we

1492
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
Don't think

1493
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,311
It's good that they are committing crimes

1494
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:43,711
Either I think I think I'm cuz where we are sort of detach idli saying they are more comp

1495
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,759
Appleton added doesn't mean we're like

1496
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:51,135
Real they're doing it

1497
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:57,535
I am against all of those people I just I just wanted to make it clear in case we have any new listeners who think like

1498
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:01,887
Thrilled that the Democrats committed

1499
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,911
So

1500
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:08,543
Last week a story came out of Believers and vice maybe was BuzzFeed I don't know it's one of Alex's

1501
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,567
Usual Target

1502
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:14,687
And they laid out a bunch of times that Trump and Alex have said very similar thing

1503
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:18,527
And it's an important conversation we need to have socially

1504
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,855
Not with Alex

1505
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,623
Pretending

1506
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,951
He is trying to react

1507
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,231
To the idea that

1508
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,279
He's writing Trump's words

1509
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,815
Or something like that

1510
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:35,167
In reality it is just that Insanity has taken over the body politic

1511
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,447
Inner discourse

1512
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,727
Has become so eroded

1513
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:41,055
Did Alex Jones E-Type speech is okay

1514
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:43,359
And whereas it was not before

1515
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,383
And so you can

1516
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:49,503
You can make a pretty clear line of times but it's out in the open

1517
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:56,927
And so out this this one story came out and maybe a couple people did like sort of rehashes of it

1518
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:01,791
The stories talking about that

1519
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,095
And people ask why

1520
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,911
So many of us are on the same page like a left

1521
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,471
Follows orders they follow Scripts

1522
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:13,311
Ideas of the higher-ups come up with

1523
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,360
Because I want slice

1524
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,528
Not out this vertical

1525
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,088
Lego giving speech

1526
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:29,184
At the same time as Jones and they said the exact same thing

1527
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:33,024
They got computers at look at this.

1528
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,584
A computer that goes Jones right here

1529
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,120
Believe that the speeches

1530
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,936
Hornstromp there's a lot of this is original stuff

1531
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:41,984
No

1532
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,776
Spirit riding

1533
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,320
God doesn't possess it's like solarwinds

1534
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,392
So

1535
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,976
Videos always articles 100 times

1536
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,256
11 *

1537
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,792
Stop

1538
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,584
I'd love to take

1539
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
Is it it's that

1540
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,424
It's the same page

1541
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,216
It's the same sheet of music

1542
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,848
Resonates with

1543
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:20,896
And

1544
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,712
You Know a Man by his enemies they are so

1545
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,552
The only people I see

1546
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,088
Publicly panicked

1547
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,624
Alex

1548
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,928
SAR Alex

1549
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
Because I

1550
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
Lumpen

1551
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,072
Alex world

1552
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,864
I don't see

1553
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,448
The msci

1554
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:45,984
Freaking out

1555
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:53,664
He has been for the last two-and-a-half years

1556
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:02,112
Alex don't pretend you didn't make a functional

1557
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:08,512
Giant pivot literally 2 years ago we watched it happen in real time

1558
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,048
When you change

1559
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,096
Here's my ass

1560
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,632
Yeah stupid a******

1561
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,656
But like a

1562
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,960
I don't admit Italy I don't watch

1563
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,520
Being mainstream news that

1564
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:25,408
Msnbc's the CNN's everyday but whenever I see clips of it I don't see people panicked I see people

1565
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:26,944
Boy

1566
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:32,064
Trying to report unbiased Lee and slipping a bit

1567
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,344
But at the same time I don't

1568
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,368
Atlantic from them

1569
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:37,696
I don't see Panic from Muller I don't see Panic from

1570
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,000
Smart

1571
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,280
Folks on the left

1572
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,560
On Twitter

1573
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:45,376
I think I feel like that

1574
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,656
But the

1575
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,680
I feel like that

1576
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,728
The wrong direction to

1577
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,264
Like I think we all should be

1578
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:56,640
Right like that's one of my biggest issues with that concept of unbiased is that

1579
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:59,456
Reality is unbiased in the reality

1580
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,016
They're f****** destroying the world

1581
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,552
Really quickly

1582
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:05,088
You should be

1583
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:08,672
Because that Panic will maybe incite you to f****** action

1584
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,208
I think

1585
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,744
Freak out everyday

1586
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:13,536
Living

1587
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,072
State of panic

1588
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,096
I want to

1589
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,120
Fights

1590
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,144
Bright

1591
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,424
You f****** know how we

1592
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:22,496
Way too large

1593
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:25,056
I think that a lot of people have found a

1594
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,592
Complacent stride

1595
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,616
Based on the fact

1596
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,152
That are going to

1597
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,688
4

1598
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:33,760
The time that it's been going on

1599
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,552
Mueller investigation has

1600
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,832
Borne fruit

1601
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,624
In terms of

1602
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,184
Flipping people please

1603
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:44,768
What have you and I think that a lot of people are freaking out because of

1604
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,536
The faith

1605
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,328
In the system that this is going

1606
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,632
To get unraveled right

1607
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:52,960
That well maybe it will maybe it won't but whatever the case

1608
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:56,288
Freakout might need to come around the corner at some point

1609
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:59,872
People are Panic right now the only people that are panicked

1610
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,408
IC on info

1611
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,456
Those are the people who are panic

1612
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:06,272
Ralix is creating space

1613
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,552
Wow yeah

1614
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:11,136
Yeah yeah it's not great

1615
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:15,744
I don't Focus too much on that though cuz I still I still think that's more of a simp

1616
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,048
I know Alex is a symptom too but it's like

1617
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,632
Alex is more of a primary symptom and I think Trump is a secondary

1618
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,680
Maybe that I'm I'm biased

1619
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,472
Because of my area

1620
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,032
I see Alex

1621
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,568
Freaking out about these lawsuit

1622
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,664
To the extent that he creates fake versions of them to respond

1623
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:34,944
I see him

1624
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,296
Freaking out about the fact that Trump said I want to take the guns first

1625
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,856
Maybe we should kill drug dealers

1626
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:44,160
I see him freaking out about those things

1627
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:47,488
I'm pretending he's not freaking out and that he's totally at peace

1628
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:51,584
And what have you and that to me is much more indicative of like

1629
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
You are

1630
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,168
You are

1631
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,216
I can't do this

1632
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,008
Kind of moment

1633
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,544
You know what that moment was to me

1634
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:04,640
Riverwatch Lake Geneva watch Tom Green growing up

1635
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:09,760
So Tom Green Show there was one episode in particular that stood out to me

1636
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,040
I never liked him

1637
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,832
I didn't think his shows funny

1638
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:18,720
I thought my friends love to be on with smoking weed

1639
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:25,376
I didn't I didn't enjoy him much but it was one moment that always stuck out as like sort of very transcendental

1640
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:28,704
It was an episode where he was sucking on a cow's otter

1641
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,544
I'm like in character like sucking on the otter

1642
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,080
A man afterwards

1643
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,896
Like they were still filming him anyways like

1644
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,944
I'm f****** done

1645
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,784
Like he was really pissed off in the character broke

1646
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,856
There was a moment like why am I doing nothing

1647
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:49,952
That's the moment you see an Alex there with it I can't do this

1648
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:53,280
Mark yeah that's what a gero would cry

1649
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,304
On jackass

1650
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,352
Ragnar those moments of just like

1651
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:58,656
You can't keep it together

1652
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,448
I think that I think that

1653
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,728
You're going to see him crack

1654
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,496
More and more

1655
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:07,360
Anyway I'm going into a r a we don't need we don't need this

1656
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,152
It's a little something

1657
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,688
But Rob do

1658
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,224
It might surprise you

1659
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,272
I don't know if you know about Rob do

1660
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,320
You know that he is a

1661
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,392
I know his wife is mad whenever you take super male B

1662
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:22,720
Boehner's we know that from 2014

1663
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,768
Yeah we also know that he

1664
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:27,072
Clearly is on Alex's beckon call

1665
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:31,424
Yaccarino whenever he needs it becomes a running cuz he knows where his bread is buttered

1666
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,448
But it turns out

1667
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,992
You know there's a sixth sense

1668
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,040
When you wake up my wife

1669
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,576
Children

1670
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,600
We're doing something

1671
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,392
I like think of thought

1672
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,184
My little Temple daughter

1673
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,464
No

1674
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,512
Not a chance

1675
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,536
Transcendence

1676
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,096
I just want to be part of this good stuff

1677
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:03,936
If your 10 month old daughter is saying the thoughts

1678
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,704
But you have

1679
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,728
You got terrible

1680
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:06,752
Thought

1681
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,032
You're in

1682
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:11,104
Yeah probably but also I love the idea of like

1683
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,152
Improv is

1684
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,992
I mean you see enough Improv

1685
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:17,760
When you realize it is

1686
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:24,160
Fascinating thing that happens when people are collaborating in the freshly created

1687
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:29,280
Does it does have the appearance of like telepathically communicating

1688
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,328
What are y'all doing things well but it turns out it

1689
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:37,728
It's just sort of an artistic Pursuit Thief go in Vibe with each other if you get the right people

1690
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,008
Looks amazing

1691
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,056
Magic

1692
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,336
But also

1693
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,640
I love the idea that like

1694
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:47,200
He's sitting with you rob to play

1695
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
Clarinet

1696
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:56,160
He plays Jazz clarinet Alex either on

1697
01:27:56,416 --> 01:28:02,560
I love the idea of Alexandra ten-month-old sitting around and having a great time

1698
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,840
Cinema 10 month old is like

1699
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,240
I don't know when like

1700
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:16,896
You know the last time I went back I went and hung out with my brother and his family

1701
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,664
For Christmas

1702
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,688
This last year

1703
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:21,248
And at that point his daughter was about

1704
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,552
Maybe get ready

1705
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,832
Right

1706
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,368
She wasn't

1707
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,648
Coming up with sin

1708
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:31,744
Right

1709
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,280
Take 6-8 months

1710
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:37,376
Off that age I don't know what unless Alex is like

1711
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:40,704
They're all laughing and having a great time and like them googoogaga

1712
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,240
Isn't

1713
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:47,616
I just want to help people I want to be nice

1714
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:50,688
The enemy comes and goes

1715
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,016
Don't be a racist don't be a capitalist lookup wasn't healthy

1716
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,344
Concha

1717
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,440
Also he's comparing I don't be a racist joke from the same set

1718
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,256
Daisy Daisy for your position

1719
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,096
And I know where Shayne Topp

1720
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,400
They know we've already arrived

1721
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,008
Those that

1722
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,544
We can't get

1723
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,336
Who are your serving evil

1724
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,688
With realize they're trying to sabotage

1725
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:25,504
Who haven't fully made the decision

1726
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,600
They want peel them off and have them go

1727
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:33,440
Is the allegory of Lucifer want the angels to go with him

1728
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,464
They just

1729
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,000
Not really nice

1730
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:38,304
They want to piss in the Cheerios bro

1731
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,632
That's not really an allegory doesn't think it is either

1732
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,656
He thinks it's a literal

1733
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:46,496
Very literal get through the rest of this year

1734
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,544
He's just turning into a preacher as his

1735
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,568
As it's drunk

1736
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,336
Gets a

1737
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,872
Crescendo

1738
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,432
He tries to end the show

1739
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:59,808
And it's really fascinating to little bullet points he wants to get to cuz they are tracking weird

1740
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,904
Appreciate coming in Robinhood

1741
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,464
I would want it back tomorrow for 6 p.m. central

1742
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,768
Lord willing

1743
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,168
The justice department is going to indict

1744
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,240
Oh so we're finally there

1745
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,008
So

1746
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:22,336
The president the next couple weeks

1747
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,736
I've never had more peace.

1748
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,296
Doesn't sound like a piece of

1749
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,576
The fog about

1750
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:41,792
Term doesn't refer to

1751
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,584
The peace

1752
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:51,008
It refers to decisions that are made that are not good

1753
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,152
Ateez it's referring to the

1754
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:01,760
The f****** unknowable and inability to plan

1755
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:07,392
Morris movie The Fog of War McNamara

1756
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:12,256
Is the most evil

1757
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:14,560
Middle name is strange

1758
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:17,120
How fun is that that's fun

1759
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:19,424
We got this now his only he was a doctor

1760
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,984
Kill Trump

1761
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,520
In the next couple weeks

1762
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:27,104
Everybody everybody everybody

1763
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:34,272
Literally everybody I guess so

1764
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,576
Tell supplies by geopolitics

1765
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:42,720
Quickly and something we've been waiting for for a really long time

1766
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:44,256
And because he's drunk he makes it

1767
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,024
Pretty clear

1768
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,048
And that is

1769
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:48,608
Tells us exactly what he means by Birthright

1770
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:51,168
Ono Korea's falling

1771
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,448
Notary will

1772
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:55,520
Saudi Arabia's falling radical Islamic backing off

1773
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,408
Globalist

1774
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,808
But it was the Providence

1775
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,232
The birthright

1776
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,144
You can do this

1777
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,680
Come on man

1778
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:24,960
No

1779
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,264
No understand

1780
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,800
Fallout

1781
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,848
And it's at Birthright

1782
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,152
Can I get pregnant

1783
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,688
Oreo TV

1784
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,224
All of you

1785
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:36,992
If you love God

1786
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,016
Birthright

1787
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,576
And

1788
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,880
Except

1789
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,208
That's what I'm going to be hate you because

1790
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,488
You already won the

1791
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:50,816
Jeffrey Wilson

1792
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,632
So that's why they gave this is me

1793
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,912
The lottery

1794
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,568
And they point out where we've stumbled and where we're not part of

1795
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,592
God knows

1796
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:03,872
We're not perfect

1797
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,152
But we love God

1798
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,480
It's all really just a bad Christian Supremacy

1799
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,248
That's all

1800
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,064
Yeah

1801
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,344
We got the birth White

1802
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,160
Yeah it's not even I mean

1803
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:20,000
For him it is cuz other pieces of his cosmology

1804
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:22,304
He believes in did bring in the whites

1805
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,608
The mail

1806
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,888
Dominated

1807
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:29,216
The ideas but to him the birthright that idea is very

1808
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:29,984
Specifically Chris

1809
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,056
Extant

1810
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,592
Like in our world

1811
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:37,664
We did hit the lottery

1812
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,200
I'm awake dude bright

1813
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:45,600
Like f****** as I was going over

1814
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:49,184
Today a lot of his research about the

1815
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,464
Like the Kings and

1816
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:55,072
The various lineages and stuff like that you know you see all of these

1817
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,864
The people throughout time who had

1818
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,424
Just like Charmed f****** lives cuz they

1819
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,240
Happened to be born into the line of Queen Victoria

1820
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,008
Or whatever

1821
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:09,664
And you also every time you see one of these people you have to think about how many people headed f****** miserable

1822
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,528
And in all of that and how much of that still exists today that dichotomy of

1823
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,296
Like

1824
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,320
It's lock

1825
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,368
You are you

1826
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,904
Happened to be born

1827
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,184
Even certain circle

1828
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,232
But those poor

1829
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:26,304
Oppressed people in China or North Korea

1830
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,632
Or even the Islamic terrorists you're so afraid of

1831
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,656
Are you

1832
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,936
They're all us

1833
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,472
You're all them

1834
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
We just

1835
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:38,592
Happened to be born where we were at the time we were

1836
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,128
Edit so

1837
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,664
F****** stupid

1838
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,944
This idea

1839
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,504
Cuz he talks about his Birthright s*** all the f******

1840
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,296
Kantime I'm the idea that

1841
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,064
Vistana

1842
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,600
Is crazy

1843
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,136
It's absolutely not

1844
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,160
It's

1845
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,952
Everything about him

1846
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,768
Is infuriatingly dumb

1847
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:00,352
But on some level I do enjoy that he's like

1848
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,120
Birthright

1849
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,680
Providence

1850
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,216
Salonpas

1851
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:09,824
Birthright

1852
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,104
Appreciate that

1853
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:18,016
Because it's too long and it's just him talking about God

1854
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:24,416
You love it

1855
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:29,280
Is like a moment he's like self-conscious about

1856
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,584
I'm going to shut up

1857
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,376
How many looks at the cameras

1858
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:40,032
The camera lingers for like 3 seconds too long

1859
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,080
He's sitting there like

1860
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:46,432
Like a deflated Alex Jones post rant

1861
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,760
Finished

1862
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:52,576
Am I going to make Rob do stick around for another 20

1863
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:56,928
Alex Jones

1864
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,208
Thursday I hope you all had a great

1865
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,744
Saint Patty's

1866
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,144
But if you'd like to find out

1867
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:07,936
Knowledge

1868
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:12,800
Participate

1869
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:13,568
In

1870
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,360
What some have called

1871
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,896
The most exciting event of March

1872
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:23,296
That would be the created and that

1873
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:27,648
What's a good name

1874
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,416
You're brilliant

1875
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:33,280
Facebook group we are also just on Facebook

1876
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,304
For a lot of fun to happen

1877
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,864
Absolutely

1878
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:41,728
Radar detector

1879
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,032
In the meantime

1880
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:45,568
Got a

1881
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:52,480
Close this up

1882
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:54,016
Answer to ramble around drunk

1883
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:54,784
Stupid

1884
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:55,808
Transylvania

1885
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:57,856
Black nobility

1886
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,024
I would say there's only one candidate

1887
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:09,376
Himself right now who enabled

1888
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,472
Because without him Alex couldn't do these things

1889
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,776
He makes it possible by

1890
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,568
Leaving his family

1891
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:21,920
To go do all this b******* literal Renfield

1892
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:25,248
I'm talking about

1893
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:27,808
And I wish

1894
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,856
Talk to you you can

1895
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,648
F*** yourself

1896
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,464
Holding

1897
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:40,096
