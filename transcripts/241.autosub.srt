40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
So Jordan

41
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:00,992
We got we got a weird Wacky Wednesday thing going this month

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
I don't know any hammers actually not trying to lull you into a false sense of YouTube

43
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,256
You know we've gone over Reverend Manning

44
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,656
We went over these Starchild who made good on her her life

45
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,728
We went over Coach Dave last week and I was at

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,544
Wildly weird episode

47
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,688
Here's the deal when I was going over Coach Dave

48
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
I found a lot more that I wanted to talk about it would end up being a 4-Hour episode

49
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,952
And I don't feel like I want to move on from Wacky Wednesday until I get this out

50
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,304
So today we are revisiting coach days.in Myers

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
Back to the well so quickly on someone who is in new entry into our

52

00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,576
Dictator level is like 99%

55
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
Yeah the horrible white nationalism

56
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
Is a sex offender

57
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,287
Mike's

58
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
That I had that I wanted to talk about it actually works really well to have it be

59
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Be two separate episodes

60
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Is

61
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
In

62
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
2016

63
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
The election

64
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Hunting show

65
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
That we are very familiar with

66
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
Say David Mayer hair

67
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Thursday evening

68
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Just have a great day

69
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Opportunity

70
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
Talk to Larry Nichols

71
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
Normally no exclusive

72
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
How to get ahold of that guy

73
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,111
But I laughed my ass off what do you like

74
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:20,511
He gives out his phone number on other shows we just called him out of the blue

75
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:25,119
Weird it is not Nick

76
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,495
Goosebumps

77
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,823
Coach Larry Nichols on for an interview

78
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
The lead-up to the election

79
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Soften hard

80
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
That doesn't come out

81
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
Where is real

82
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
MS

83
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
I'm going to hear from

84
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
Tubes coming out of this

85
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
Just about everything to

86
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
Can be coming out up so just out of

87
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
Of decency in a privacy

88
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
We still are just going to become a bill with this

89
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,655
Where's the hydraulic 280

90
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
We going to hang out soon

91
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Giessen

92
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
We're not going to do that today

93
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Was Larry Nichols

94
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Very exciting

95
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
For Larry

96
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,759
He's not going to have him up on baby when he says

97
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
Exclusive inner me interview he just means

98
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:22,207
I'm the only one doing this interview with him I do my 15 random as guys on Google Hangouts yelling

99
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:27,583
Larry Nichols to make it easier to listen to for sure

100
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
Thrilled he thinks this is a get

101
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,191
This is like I have a big guests on my hand

102
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,263
Larry fucken

103
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:40,383
I love I love that I love the idea that anyone hero worships him

104
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
It just means I don't know anything

105
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,735
Like they haven't looked into his history the

106
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,039
Defected after he sued the clintons

107
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
Back in the 90s

108
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:53,439
And accused Clinton of having affairs with a bunch of women all the women were interviewed

109
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Absolutely not

110
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,559
Then the star tabloid picked up the the story was like

111
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Look

112
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,679
I don't want to be able I don't want it I'm sorry

113
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:10,079
And then a little bit after that

114
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,151
Is hucksters scams

115
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
It's very clear

116
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
And his motivations for Hayden

117
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:22,111
Things are really Clear Lake because Bill Clinton fired him from the Arkansas development Finance

118
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:28,511
Ioffice for making 142 collect calls

119
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,607
Time to the contras in Nicaragua

120
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,423
They got pissed off

121
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Bill Clinton

122
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
I meant just tracing

123
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,567
Timeline through everything is like Alright you're someone who just committed

124
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
Broadcaster

125
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Fraud

126
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,735
Actual direct quote after the story came out in the star tabloid

127
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,831
This is because

128
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,135
Because things that Larry put out into the world

129
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,439
Did everyone in Arkansas signor.

130
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,767
Cuz they just new like this is nonsense

131
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,887
But what became the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate

132
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,959
The star was like oh here's a juicy story they started

133
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:14,079
The media is made a circus out of this thing

134
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,151
When is Star article first came out several women called

135
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,967
If I was willing to pay them to say they had an affair with Bill Clinton

136
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
This is crazy

137
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,831
1 London newspapers offering half a million dollars for a story

138
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
To even he's coming out being like

139
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,279
This is bulshit a lot of horses that I accidentally opened up

140
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Without cons

141
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
Consequences and you guys are going to make it till

142
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Continually

143
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
There's

144
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,567
Perfectly clear that he set out to destroy Bill Clinton and I got away from him

145
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:52,479
That was a good game for the clintons on a radio show

146
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
Like I was on pills

147
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
Disguise an a******

148
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,327
Also we should say he's the saddest SEC I've ever

149
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,423
How is Young and I was cool and I was smart that when I work

150
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
The clintons

151
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
Build assist

152
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Now you wrote Jingle

153
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
This

154
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
Cabal system

155
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
Original writer

156
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,295
Welts on other shows

157
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Like Alex's

158
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,159
Is it referring to hears this mob

159
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,463
Cabal system

160
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,047
It's the way you described it elsewhere is the idea of the broken coalition

161
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,607
The idea of going after

162
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:45,983
All Christians are a majority of Voters in a state

163
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,567
Is probably not the best strategy but if you embrace

164
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
Disenfranchised

165
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,919
They add up to a large

166
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,455
So that is the

167
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
The evil

168
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,319
Then he says he worked on with Clinton's intervista

169
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Back then

170
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,463
Now he's on Coach Davis showed he's calling

171
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
Cabal system

172
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:16,447
Listening to minorities system nearly got Stacey Abrams elected until it

173
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
It was stolen

174
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
Sure

175
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
Help build it

176
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
Design poster

177
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
And then here I am today

178

Sienna

179
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
That's just

180
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,439
The lights my grandchildren are going to have in years

181
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Stop it

182
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Got2b

183
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
The one

184
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,119
You know nobody's big the Clipper system

185
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Cuz you know that nobody

186
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Powhatan clothes

187
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
Slippery

188
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Nothing it was all

189
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
Monday Destin

00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
And a Comedown

191
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Just barely hanging on

192
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
I'm trying

193
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
You sad pile of s***

194
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,159
This is

195
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
Cuz I'm

196
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
Do appreciate

197
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
This differing level of

198
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
A****** as opposed to our usual

199
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:34,015
Fake alpha male dominate everyday has the Danny Glover

200
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Coming out of retirement for

201
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:40,415
One last saving the f****** Union

202
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,743
Fake crutches

203
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,071
Ziza is affecting his illness

204
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
I'm talking about

205
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
McDonald's

206
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
I'm just

207
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,751
A principal

208
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,335
Because I know their system I built it

209
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
My work

210
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
So I have

211
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,863
Good God

212
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,679
What

213
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
This is awesome

214
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,871
Because you're right it is such a difference layer for a pathetic liar

215
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,479
Blessed even though he like I got him impeached and stuff like that

216
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,807
Kind of self

217
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,583
You know it is it is interesting and I enjoy it a little bit

218
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
But it's also like he's really Hamming up

219
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Do you like I'm going to die soon

220
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,543
I have been brought low even talkin about there like I was

221
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,871
When I was younger

222
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
I brought to be humble

223
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
What is doing this show is because that's so in line with the Christian ethos like this

224
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,879
Idea of the mighty being brought low and Ed

225
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:20,767
The Saul on the way to Tarsus kind of moment

226
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Yourself do something like

227
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,375
Especially mainstream Christians nowadays

228
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Deserve

229
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Can't get enough of that s***

230
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
That story is

231
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,519
While he was working with

232
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Clinton

233
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
He was actually

234
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Gary Nick

235
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
And then he had it coming to Jesus

236
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,247
That's the softball situation all over you might have smell

237
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
I've not been able to quite true

238
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,439
But I do think he has a couple of false

239
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
What was the

240
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,047
Benjamin Franklin Gold fake grandma

241
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,631
There was a

242
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:02,495
Something Snodgrass

243
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:07,103
Coach

244
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
But if you listen

245
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,663
Carefully to the audio

246
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,575
You can tell that Larry is distracted by something else that's going on in his

247
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,951
Safe to say that some of these guys go there with the best

248
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
Do they not

249
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
50

250
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Corrupted

251
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,215
What preceded this immediately is Larry telling a story about

252
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,567
Corrupted

253
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
And feel like that so

254
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
Question all the stupid

255
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,879
Become corrupted by the

256
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,231
Exactly by me I did it

257
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,583
I'm the reason Washington is alive

258
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
Everybody else so

259
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
In-N-Out

260
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Detroit

261
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
Celebrities we look at it right now

262
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
We looking all the stuff

263
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
Coming out

264
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,687
Are they really

265
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,527
Are they going through my house

266
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
Are they really going to

267
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
Countdown Larry

268
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
He's elected or not

269
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,975
Sorry I take my dog house

270
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
That's that's great

271
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,375
Exclusive interview

272
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
Professional

273
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
It's

274
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
Pretty pretty awesome

275
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,575
Respectful

276
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,135
Yeah yeah

277
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
It was justified

278
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,935
What is a turret liar

279
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:13,567
Belizean get up to take his dog out noisily on our show

280
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Appreciate that

281
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,151
Thanks Larry there's one good thing about

282
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,503
So what points because he's here it right before the election

283
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
Isn't that the fraud is going to happen

284
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
He wants you to do is pray

285
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
So you going to a place you need

286
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
They don't give you favor

287
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
A big scene

288
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Man

289
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,911
I think people should have done that North Carolina this year I suppose

290
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,983
Maybe the advice.

291
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,311
Good bye week has other advice

292
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
But he wants to give

293
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
That is

294
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,407
Deeply deeply problematic

295
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
He's advocating for

296
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Probably cry

297
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Multiple times

298
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
Records of Peep

299
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
Died that records

300
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,143
Paperwork to register

301
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,239
What we used to do and I will describe it

302
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
From

303
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
First-hand experience

304
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
They go in

305
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
Coming in the bus leaves

306
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
School Bus

307
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
Literally the best company

308
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Conway

309
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Anna

310
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
When we get school buses with go

311
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
2 Northeast

312
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
Octavarium

313
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
Black part of the steak

314
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
4 people

315
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,055
And we will take them just like they're going to do this time

316
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,639
Take them to the inner city Precinct

317
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
City creatures now

318
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,807
Not going to your Precinct coach out and rules wherever

319
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
They're going to Ender City

320
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Appreciate

321
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,743
Demonstrate

322
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
Necessarily

323
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,375
What are you talkin about

324
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Discharge

325
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Of all the

326
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,495
Finna all this water frog.

327
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Within

328
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
These are

329
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,151
I feel like all he said right there is we were helping people

330
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,759
Real world version of

331
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Conspiracies about

332
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
Larry actually later says it like

333
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,415
It off with a bus

334
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Cars

335
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
Like

336
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
Three people to the polls

337
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,887
Like that only makes sense

338
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,959
You really believe in voting integrity and you're carpooling

339
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,287
That's not

340
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
That's going to

341
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
Be cost-prohibitive

342
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
You would have to have

343
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,967
Fleets of cars out there it would have to be

344
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,807
Uberpool

345
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
Conspiracy in order to make a dent

346
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,279
In most of the places where would matter this is crazy nonsense

347
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:19,679
Unless demonize the idea

348
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,543
And what he's doing is trying to present the idea that you are coach

349
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,359
Not your white Enclave in Ohio

350
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
It's happening in these black

351
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,247
Another reason that I said that I think what he's talking about his criminal is because

352
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,807
This part of it was the descriptive part

353
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
He's describing what you think the problem is

354
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
And now here's his solution

355
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Now you take

356
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
Nationwide

357
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
Baltimore

358
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Philadelphia

359
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Look at all these

360
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Huge cities

361
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
Chupacabra

362
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Vocelli's

363
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,615
More than in the rural areas

364
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
How do you catch

365
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
We need veterans group

366
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,391
Call Dino

367
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
No

368
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,975
Cuz I don't recommend

369
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
Anybody going back

370
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
Train Intercity

371
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,191
I really don't understand that at all

372
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
I got some guests

373
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
All right now

374
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
Deja

375
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,855
They can go into the inner city Precinct

376
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
Which day

377
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
Let's say

378
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Can people

379
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
Going there with 10 people

380
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Let me just watch

381
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
They don't hide it

382
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,775
You seem going incoming outgoing in coming out

383
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
When you see it

384
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
Take a picture of it

385
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,663
When did you take a picture of it

386
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
Call the police

387
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
Tell the police what you just witnessed

388
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
They won't come

389
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Take picture anyway

390
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:19,232
Can you let me know on my website

391
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,792
Larry Nichols. Info

392
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
We got a place right there coach

393
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
People

394
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
Experience

395
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:35,616
December 28th how's it going

396
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,688
Of concrete voter fraud

397
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
2

398
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
His plan doesn't even

399
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,576
Does if you consider it to be voter intimidation

400
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Bright

401
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,208
I just went for advocating for a bunch of people intimidating

402
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,024
Interesting polls

403
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,096
I think is going to go

404
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376
But that doesn't

405
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
It's going to be people who hear this message of

406
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:06,336
Go alone to an inner-city black you'll probably get assaulted and maybe murdered so you go

407
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,224
You're going to be thinking it's the jungle

408
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,344
Like coach Pizza Harlem

409
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
Your wife

410
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
You are in

411
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
Danger

412
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
So you going with your team

413
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
Your team

414
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Are you going there

415
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
You're not going to be observing

416
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,376
What you're going to be doing is being skeptical of everybody who's there

417
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
North white people look the same

418
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:39,104
If you end up doing

419
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,920
Is intimidating people away from the pole

420
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
I mean

421
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
No I mean more like for him

422
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
To say that plan makes

423
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,624
That's because he wants people to go to Interstate

424
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
In order to intimidate voters

425
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
Committed voter fraud

426
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,536
We Are One

427
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,328
What cities are Democrat

428
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Because we won

429
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,448
We're we all realize that we're in it together we're sitting

430
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
I would take

431
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,776
Intercity people

432
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,920
In order to make sure that we win those District

433
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
You misunderstand

434
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,528
He's advocating a position of how the right

435
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,928
Can take back the other City

436
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
If you're working with Larry

437
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,048
Against

438
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,632
Larry's working to stop me right right right

439
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
Committed voter fraud to win the election

440
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,752
Sprite

441
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:45,408
Because those places you can Ram the totals up really high because people like Larry and Coach are too afraid to come

442
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:49,248
Come around and find the clear evidence but that doesn't make sense

443
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:55,648
And

444
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Strategy

445
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,232
Being advocated for

446
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
To intimidate people away from

447
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:06,400
Practicing their right to vote is where Larry is coming from

448
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,704
You can dress it up in all sorts of like

449
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,728
I know.

450
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
These drinks

451
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,872
I know the only way to stop those tricks

452
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,968
Hanging around for no reason at the polls harassing people

453
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,016
Just being a nuisance

454
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
That's the only answer this

455
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,112
Without pickle that we find ourselves in

456
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,208
Disenfranchised

457
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:36,608
Coming in and out of the

458
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,424
And then going in and out of the poles

459
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Picture of that

460
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,776
You have to take a video of that otherwise you're

461
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,336
Just taking pictures of people walking out of the polls

462
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Right

463
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
It would be tough

464
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,480
And then probably why he hasn't gotten to the bottom of this mystery this one

465
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:03,488
Episode we're good but sour in people clamoring I don't

466
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
Lucy is out there

467
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,912
Screaming Into The Ether call Larry Nichols Larry Nichols and he is

468
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,568
Right now just not want to talk to him he's experiencing

469
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
Sickness problem

470
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,408
As we as we speak right now

471
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,808
I'm sorry

472
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
Easier time and why

473
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
Really into the idea

474
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Talking to him

475
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,232
Cuz we're talking about him right now recording

476
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,024
4:30 in the afternoon

477
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,328
Where's General a lot of time will be recording

478
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Evening

479
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,192
Grandpa Nichols got to be in bed I assume

480
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,264
I feel bad

481
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
I was just

482
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,152
I feel like the only problem that we had was

483
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,784
Because I didn't know we were talking about Larry Nichols today

484
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,112
I don't know what we're going to do

485
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,904
It would have been great if we could call them like

486
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,952
Yesterday or 2 days ago

487
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,744
And seeing if you wanted to come over

488
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:14,144
But it was a spur-of-the-moment Larry Nichols

489
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Real talk

490
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:21,312
I predict he won't talk to us again we'll try a long time

491
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:30,016
We brought up that he was trying to Blackmail Congress and Robert Mueller

492
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:36,416
Superlative

493
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,472
Cuz he was talking about

494
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,152
Find out about

495
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:01,760
I think he is a garden-variety, you just took advantage of a situation

496
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,064
PennDOT time

497
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:05,856
Good morning

498
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
He never gives up

499
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:12,256
We're in the weeds here let's get back on track Larry wants to express

500
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Verify

501
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,352
And then coached

502
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
Very smelly

503
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,240
Away from your voting machine

504
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Without verification

505
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
Nature boat

506
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Which law

507
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
U-boat

508
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,688
That's actually good

509
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
They can't steal your boat with machine

510
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
Wired up

511
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
Wherever

512
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:45,024
Which we know Soros owns a lot of these things and so you know they called conspiracy theory

513
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
Terry's Larry butt

514
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
Reno in fact it's going on

515
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
That's why

516
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
While

517
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,496
Bring up story

518
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,848
Find a different billionaire

519
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,432
Going to try to run for president

520
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
Trump campaign

521
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Stuck

522
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,784
For a while

523
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,024
Popularizing make it popular

524
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
He sucks

525
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
I mean I'm for impeachment

526
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,472
You unified focus on one

527
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
On one person

528
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
Right

529
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,568
Especially if it is somebody who is

530
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
A Hungarian

531
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
So weird

532
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,272
It's just so consistent

533
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
Yeah I know

534
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
It's just

535
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,344
Crazy that adjusted

536
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Travels

537
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
This

538
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
This worm

539
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Worms

540
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
Through these different

541
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
Community

542
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:52,096
You're like I'm sure if I listen to tons of her boring political episodes

543
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,168
I'm sure Carrie talks about Soros to 100%

544
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:04,640
But you got done with Jim Baker's doctor about the road you got Cochise talk about Soros Alex's talk about the road

545
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,432
Larry Nichols 8 Soros

546
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,016
It's weird it seems such a unifying piece of

547
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
This fabric

548
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Gettington

549
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,672
Getting to the bottom of where all that comes from is so important

550
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:21,536
Because when you do you start to understand where the rhetoric that trickles down to all of the

551
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
These places

552
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
Because it has to come from

553
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
From a source

554
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,680
It can't complex I bet coach got that from Allie

555
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:34,080
He has some sort of primary doesn't get to jump up a level in the trickle-down

556
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,384
He watches Alex's show that's why he

557
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,664
Admires Larry

558
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,760
And that's why you think Soros is behind there's really no other way that coached

559
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Dave Cook

560
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,064
No

561
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,880
Canterbury

562
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:51,232
When I was growing up in the nineties totally knew about Larry Nichols

563
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,304
I mean it's possible but I think at that point

564
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,656
You'd have to assume you would have made contact with him before you would help you know because

565
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,216
If you knew about him from the actual

566
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
Time

567
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,312
It's not like Larry shied away from the spotlight

568
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,128
It's not like he's hard to get in touch with no actually

569
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,176
Interesting Lee in fact

570
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712
Still the same

571
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:18,112
In 1994 he started this like campaign like so in 90 he got fired from the Arkansas

572
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,136
Development

573
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
No idea why

574
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:31,680
Yeah but then

575
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
He started to give speeches at Patriot

576
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
Community

577
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,920
And The Following comes from a transcript of his feet

578
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,736
I want to tell everyone in Colorado

579
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,552
In Arkansas I'm hated my family is embarrassed

580
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,344
My wife on a given day hates me

581
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,136
But I made a deal with Bill Clinton

582
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:57,024
In 1994 we're going to meet at High Noon and one of us is getting out of town

583
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,352
Parenthetically parenthetically

584
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:07,008
At this point Nichols draws a silver-plated semi-automatic handgun from his hip and waves it in the air

585
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,056
Before placing it on the podium

586
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,640
Several voices from the audience or her cheering shoot the bastard

587
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,408
Wow

588
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,248
So that was what he was up to in 94 he was out making the rounds and all these

589
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
These places

590
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:24,928
So the concept that coach would have been aware of him from wouldn't like there's no way that he would have never talked to him

591
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
Tried to get in touch with him

592
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
Before 2016

593
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,048
The Abbey absolutely no sense

594
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,608
From Alex my point in that is there

595
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,448
These worlds that all have Soros as the big Boogie

596
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
8 hamster

597
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
It has to come

598
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:39,776
From somewhere

599
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:44,384
This flowchart interesting things about Coach bring it up

600
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,944
Is it a gives us like a layer below out

601
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:52,064
Do you have the influence that Alex has wielded on the world being expressed by coach

602
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
Zip code

603
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
Step above that Al

604
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,440
You understand where Alex gets it all from

605
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
It helped it starts to help where

606
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
All the other

607
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
People got it

608
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
Right

609
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,096
Fusion I have

610
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Is that

611
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
Spread

612
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
Pretty much the same way that

613
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
Your garden

614
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Variety internet

615
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
You know there's nothing

616
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,176
Speakers

617
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:24,576
Bill O'Reilly then just stop cuz didn't work out all that well for me

618
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,880
Like thesaurus attempt had been made

619
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,904
Before

620
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,232
It didn't I didn't work the same way as an internet meme

621
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:37,888
Or maybe you did but it would be like a meme that someone tried to launch and then it didn't work so they waited a few years and try to

622
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,984
Maybe I've never I don't know of any memes that work that way

623
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
But it's

624
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
It is possible

625
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:49,408
It's like a virus becoming resistant

626
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,712
I'd say it's it's

627
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,528
Won't go away

628
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,368
Confuses me with like Bill actually cheating

629
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,672
Reinforcing the lies

630
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
That

631
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,792
People still believe they'll kill

632
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
Vince Foster

633
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
Sure

634
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
Enough

635
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
There are enough.

636
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
True sayings

637
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
If you deprive them of Conte

638
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
About sources life

639
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,336
That leads you to believe that you can

640
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
Evil man

641
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
The people's if they just don't

642
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,968
Try and do the time put in the work

643
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,760
Figure out what's truth and what's fiction

644
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
There's enough

645
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,112
Semblances of reality behind the idea

646
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
Oh hey

647
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
Hungry

648
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,952
Does want him out

649
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:40,608
Yeah the reason for that is because hungry is by

650
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,192
He's a democratizing

651
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Force

652
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,520
And that is a threat to an authoritarian leader

653
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
Ergo

654
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
They want him out

655
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,848
Right and there are enough

656
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
Authoritarian leaders

657
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
Working and cons

658
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
With enough

659
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,712
Dedicated propagate

660
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
Panda group

661
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,272
Sprite

662
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,576
Reinforce this meme over and over again

663
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:05,440
So yeah I can we could force memes

664
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
Is to stick around as opposed

665
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,256
Disappear or

666
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:13,120
Is if we hired never-ending resend

667
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144
I suppose

668
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,680
Who knows

669
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:22,080
So it was next clip obviously coaches

670
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
Getting a lot of this

671
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
From Alec

672
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Even further.

673
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
Play one of the most salacious things

674
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,856
Come out here in the last few days

675
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
The governmental

676
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,440
An undercover government authorized

677
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
Singing this

678
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
Other places like that

679
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,560
Recent stuff came about because of

680
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Anthony

681
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
Weiner in the

682
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:50,752
India investigation by the NYPD yada yada yada 2016

683
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
Deep down in the middle

684
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,592
This thing is the idea of this Lolita Express we know

685
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
We know build

686
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Stations

687
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
Hillary

688
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
Somehow involved

689
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,440
Jessica pedophile

690
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Perspective

691
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Is this

692
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
Is this something

693
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
Oh yeah

694
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,704
Yeah chief

695
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,520
Nine-year-old

696
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Good

697
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
Larry

698
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Good

699
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,944
I do like Larry's commitment to letting you say whatever

700
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,016
Conspiratorial dumb s*** you want to say and then in Spanish

701
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
Pusherman

702
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
You keep on it

703
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
I will tell you loving it

704
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:44,512
There's a really interesting point where Larry refutes a conspiracy about the clintons coming up later

705
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:49,120
Almost blue

706
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,912
Positive

707
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:56,800
Pick up the world absolutely Alex Jones and Rodger Stone have perpetuated

708
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,640
So hard it's crazy but a little bit

709
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,408
Before that

710
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,248
So he said Hillary was part of the pedophilia uptown

711
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:11,648
Explain all this stuff it doesn't take into account that Donald

712
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
Good friends Jeffrey Epstein

713
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,512
Play we don't need to think about the fact that Donald Trump also

714
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:23,168
Commented

715
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,288
Whatever you talk about that for a little bit and then Larry tells his story

716
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,080
Trademark story

717
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
About how

718
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,896
Hillary would go to Which churches

719
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,944
I love the witch

720
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Which

721
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,648
But

722
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,440
Almost exactly the same as he's told it

723
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
In the past

724
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,536
Before so I felt like it was

725
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
Is it worth

726
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,376
Pause rehearing until someone else the same story

727
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:58,240
So just know this clip starts right after you talking about

728
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
Love witch

729
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Which

730
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,504
Is it located

731
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
Church on Sunday

732
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,552
Methodist Church

733
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,856
I want to set up a camera

734
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:20,768
We don't do just an impromptu just look like it accidentally happened to coming out of the Methodist Church

735
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:28,448
I want you to talk about your faith in Jesus except

736
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
She turned away from me

737
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,408
Remember like it was yesterday I told stories many times I know people that hear me very much

738
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,712
Probably get tired of it but it's that significance

739
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,296
Turn your head to the left

740
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,392
You said you know I can't do that

741
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,096
What is that mean

742
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,656
Spiritual man

743
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
I am

744
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,544
Okay alright story

745
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:09,664
Stage name where you notes

746
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,272
Go to church

747
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,368
The news crews are you talk about love

748
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
Busy

749
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,032
In that conversation clearly making up

750
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,104
The two of them both know that she's a witch

751
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,200
All the information is what

752
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,040
She knows that she knows she knows that he knows everything

753
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:53,440
I know you're a good PR here

754
00:38:54,464 --> 00:39:00,608
Big sheep and ambitious driven politician eventually become president

755
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:08,288
Who used to be the president in the world

756
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:14,688
Creating a caliphate in America provisional

757
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,160
Nascent stage

758
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
Politician

759
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,000
Who needs all the good press you can get

760
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:31,584
Hurt hurt hurt Friday

761
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
And he's like

762
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,680
I'll tell you what what you need to do is

763
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,776
Hey very manufactured that clearly duplicitous

764
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,592
Speech about your faith that all politicians

765
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
Do

766
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,344
Satan's working so hard

767
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
Cheetah run the world is

768
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
The Antichrist

769
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,208
Ulta

770
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
Kaufman

771
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
The brakes

772
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
I don't have the

773
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,400
The f****** time to go through every single speech Hillary Clinton has ever made

774
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,472
But I'm positive.

775
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,264
Positive never seen her to church

776
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,664
Yeah sure I have

777
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,016
Fake news

778
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,624
Solaris

779
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
What is this

780
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,120
And here's a little bit of analysis of what that could mean

781
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,424
I first met her she was killed

782
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,360
At all cherry hair on underarm

783
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,944
Flip flops

784
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
Ygritte

785
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,784
Mission Ridge Pharmacy Northeast Arkansas

786
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,064
Next Seattle

787
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,648
Chain like a dog tag chain in there was a card on it

788
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,744
Absolutely not

789
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,840
Complete bulshit

790
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
Hillary Clinton

791
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,960
Leader of the young Republicans

792
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,544
Goldwater ghoul

793
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,736
111 meaning

794
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:30,368
School

795
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:36,768
Shows up hairy armpits

796
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
Burlap sack

797
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:44,192
ATS official meeting with financiers and all these respectable people with a f****** chain around her neck

798
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,264
Member of the Communist Party

799
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,848
You gotta believe

800
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,687
Gofucker

801
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,503
Yeah I'm just

802
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,855
Yep

803
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,415
Don't necessarily

804
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:10,815
Not believe that Hillary might have had some communist leanings when she was in college

805
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Do stuff like that

806
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,911
I don't think that matters

807
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,495
I thought you was

808
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:24,383
She was a Goldwater gal when she was younger than she always likes to talk about Goldwater Republic

809
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,175
I would say she would have to have been in her

810
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,455
Early 20s

811
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Commit30

812
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,831
Jumping into the let's go all natural French

813
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
Style

814
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,623
Groovy

815
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,255
The possibility

816
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:44,863
That she presented a certain way and had a certain ideology that might not have matched

817
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,495
What Larry is selling here

818
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,799
I'm not willing to believe it anyway

819
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,335
If I have to

820
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,151
Then the only thing I can

821
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
Is it Hillary Clinton

822
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,015
When she was younger and Larry Nichols New her

823
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
Was

824
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,111
Fiercest troll of all time

825
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:12,511
Like she was going to this meeting with financiers with the tag that says member of the Communist party like just try

826
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,303
Trying to f*** with them or something

827
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,703
Like that's what I have and I don't believe that

828
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
A money off of

829
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
Speeches to these

830
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
Assholes

831
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
Forever black

832
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
Tulare convince

833
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,687
Answer to shave those damn

834
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,759
So yeah I don't believe I don't believe

835
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,391
I truly don't believe Hilary

836
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
Has ever

837
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,583
Pictures of a bill with a huge

838
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
You're not even

839
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,471
Brooklyn Museum

840
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
Yeah but he's

841
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
These bills

842
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,103
William

843
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
Hillary's

844
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,711
Is Hillary was nine

845
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
Years old shoes

846
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Run this

847
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,623
She probably had some Wild Oats in her life she's still a human

848
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,791
Absolutely not wearing

849
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,607
Card-carrying member of the Communist Party to a f******

850
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,655
Business blunch how big is this

851
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
4 years after

852
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,223
Even when we got her cleaned up

853
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,599
Gallery

854
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,391
It's a smell

855
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,743
Rotten Manor rotten

856
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,095
I told her and even today

857
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
Recent

858
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,191
Maybe come three months ago people that went to one of her

859
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,775
No rallies were she talking and ended up

860
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
Close to

861
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
No nothing and what I'm telling you

862
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
It's her

863
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
And what is that

864
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,135
You know I have my

865
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,975
Well

866
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,815
Am I

867
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,607
Demon possessed

868
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Talk about that

869
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
Give off an odor

870
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:43,807
Attracted

871
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
Here is just

872
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
Audible

873
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
It's just

874
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
Crazy nonsense

875
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,119
So sure of himself and Broad

876
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
Moody Christian

877
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
Mine said who knows what show is

878
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,983
Courtney's trying to appeal to that again

879
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
I don't know what

880
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,663
He's trying to get coach to save a demon thing

881
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
So he doesn't have to

882
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
Anyway

883
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,271
This next clip

884
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
Larry Nichols said something about the

885
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
That I find

886
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,879
Unaccepted

887
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:23,231
And not because he's trying to malign the clintons or anything like that but just because

888
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
This is one of the stupidest

889
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
I've ever heard of my life

890
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
And it betrays

891
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,143
Then he's just making s*** up

892
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,215
Cuz there's no way that either of them said the thing

893
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:37,567
But he's going to report that they said immunized

894
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,383
Amanda green

895
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,455
Hillary Clinton smells bad because she's a demon

896
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:49,087
Is not one of the

897
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
She smells bad

898
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,415
The demon talk about all the

899
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,255
That's sort of just like blase

900
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
Interesting

901
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,303
So here we go

902
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,095
You Know lyrics

903
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,471
So bad I want to hear this

904
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,287
All right.

905
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,359
Just running while going crazy. Hillary

906
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,663
Ravenous crazy

907
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,455
Driving Miss Crazy

908
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,927
And look at him now.

909
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,791
Don't tell me over and over and over

910
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,839
We will never get a divorce

911
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:37,727
That way we can never be forced to testify

912
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
My goodness

913
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,615
Well that's the truth

914
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
That's the truth

915
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,479
House of both of them told you that

916
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:53,599
I'll talk to you about this

917
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:59,999
The rule that holds the protest against each other

918
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Or spousal

919
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,535
Privilege

920
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:07,935
Piece of puritanical American history this rule was established based on any guidelines

921
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,495
Because quote the sanctity of marriage

922
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,799
Be fostered as a matter of social policy

923
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:22,015
It's houses don't have to fight women aren't allowed to test

924
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,831
Testify against their not not anymore

925
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:30,207
Crime against spouse

926
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:36,095
That privilege is gone

927
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:42,495
Right version of it was

928
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,055
Depends on marital Harmony

929
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,127
So we should make spouses with each other

930
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:48,895
Rose

931
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
Thanks

932
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
Exactly

933
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:55,039
Regardless of the reason it was established

934
00:48:55,295 --> 00:49:00,415
Things that are communicated between couples are generally seen by the laws being intrinsically confidential

935
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,975
Exhaust are considered privileged information

936
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:09,631
This rule doesn't apply to anything that was said quote in the presence of or likely to be overheard by third-party

937
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:14,751
Hillary Clinton cooked up this conspiracy that they're putting forth

938
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,775
Hot themselves

939
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,847
Most of the relevant information is not confident

940
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,663
Is a third party who they're plotting with

941
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,455
Also this is stupid

942
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:29,343
The rules spousal privilege does apply to federal crimes but almost every state

943
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,647
Colorado does not allow it

944
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,975
For cases involving first-degree second-degree or third-degree felony

945
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:38,303
Sew-ins

946
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,863
Possibly compelled to

947
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,631
Contempt

948
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
Were you not

949
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,959
Also Larry is even stupider than its

950
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,775
Again this is from

951
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:54,175
In 1983 the seventh circuit held that privilege cannot be claimed by a witness who's Legend

952
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,711
The crime

953
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,527
With which his or her spouse is charged

954
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,575
And about which the witnesses

955
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
To testify

956
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:06,207
There's a big exemption to the rule of marital privilege that is known as the crime-fraud

957
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:12,095
Which holds the quote the marital testimony rule does not apply

958
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,143
Went to our spouses Ark

959
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,471
Conspiring in a future or ongoing crime

960
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:21,311
Or the other may be compelled to testify in order to protect

961
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,335
The safety of the public

962
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,919
I would say that if anything Larry Nichols the saying is true

963
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:32,319
Then the clintons most certainly are conspiring in a future or ongoing crime and dust their claim of marital privilege is

964
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:40,255
The world might be considered a crime

965
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:43,839
So that we can testify

966
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,655
Each other even though of course you have proven that we are

967
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,703
Trying to run

968
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,775
Tired very idea of a

969
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,079
What are you saying is b*******

970
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,615
It's such nonsense

971
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,175
Like the idea that they stay together so they can't be

972
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,967
Be compelled to testify against each other

973
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,039
When the law is very clear that if you're conspiring

974
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
Together

975
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
You can

976
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:09,439
I suspected Larry just recently been arrested development that's where he's coming up with this dump

977
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:16,095
Central point of the plot of Arrested Development

978
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:23,519
Hillary Clinton has a degree from Yale law school and was published in the Harvard Law review

979
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:28,127
Bill Clinton has a degree from Yale law school and studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar

980
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:34,271
Larry Nichols got fired from advertising job for making collect calls to the contras in Nicaragua

981
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:37,087
I can't confirm that Larry Nichols even went to college

982
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:42,975
Before getting fired by the Arkansas development Finance Authority for baby 642 calls

983
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,767
I'll be half of the f****** contra

984
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,863
My point is that I'm going to trust an understanding of the law

985
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,959
I'm going to err on the side of the clintons knowing what the law is

986
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:59,359
This possible high school graduate who wrote shingles and then got fired for being involved in a rom-com

987
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:07,551
So sneaky

988
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
Larry Nichols

989
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,647
Siri is

990
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,671
Sure he

991
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,303
That the clintons have one of the more fascinating relationship

992
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,607
That I in

993
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,375
In recent hiss

994
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,703
Has nothing to do with

995
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,471
Not being able

996
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,079
Probably be a real interesting

997
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,895
Story to tell here

998
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,175
Years down the line

999
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,711
Hillary was

1000
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,991
Ostensibly going to

1001
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
To be president

1002
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:38,783
2 years

1003
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:42,367
Definition

1004
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,903
She was going to be present

1005
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,255
Popular vote

1006
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,559
Sort of like real in-depth

1007
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,839
Understanding of

1008
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,863
What's a

1009
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,447
I'm sorry but there's no way we're going to get that for

1010
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,727
Years Hobson

1011
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:01,823
Who's going to get Larry Nichols and bullshitted

1012
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
The answer

1013
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,407
Who's going to get Larry Nichols

1014
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,711
80s

1015
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:11,807
So I told you earlier that Larry Nichols is going to stay

1016
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
Conspiracy

1017
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
About the clintons

1018
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,903
And this is so

1019
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
Interesting to me

1020
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,951
Because coach

1021
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,743
Goat starts basically like a lightning

1022
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,279
Kind of thing goes like

1023
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,815
Tell me about this

1024
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
You see a lot of stuff

1025
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
On the internet

1026
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,007
The joke goes around once I saw it on the Internet it's got to be

1027
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Do things that the

1028
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,151
Really been can

1029
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,455
I need the main number one the whole Danny Williams thing

1030
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,735
About Danny Williams

1031
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,759
I know true

1032
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
Not true

1033
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,319
Addendum

1034
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:53,791
So Danny Williams is the priority

1035
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,887
Very

1036
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:04,031
I can't prove it but I'm almost certain to Larry Nichols heads

1037
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
Roll

1038
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,567
Perpetuate

1039
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,615
Probably

1040
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,247
Creating it or fostering

1041
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,527
The show but I can't fly

1042
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,807
I have way too many

1043
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,623
Eclipse in my archived to go through like fine

1044
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,695
Specific

1045
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,511
Saying that it is true

1046
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,119
Would never say that

1047
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,191
Spot

1048
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,727
I have a further theory about

1049
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,031
And it's not about Larry saying

1050
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,591
Hey this one isn't true as a

1051
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
Beings of being

1052
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,127
Fair

1053
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,919
Anything like that

1054
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,455
I think

1055
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,503
To bolster what he's about to say

1056
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,295
Okay

1057
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
Larry

1058
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,391
Hertzler number you're seeing all over the internet

1059
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,415
The Webb Hubbell

1060
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,439
Who is Chelsea's dad

1061
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:56,255
That is true I'm the one that put that out

1062
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,023
That is true

1063
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,327
That is true 100%

1064
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,191
So there's a conspiracy that goes around that Webster Hubbell

1065
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,239
Help someone in the Clinton orbit

1066
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,543
He is actually Chelsea's

1067
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
Dad

1068
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,895
Hillary

1069
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,919
I don't care

1070
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:18,271
It doesn't mean anything to me I don't think it has any bearing on

1071
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,807
I need to get matters

1072
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,159
You shooting down the Danny Williams

1073
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,511
And saying that yes Webster Hubbell Chelsea

1074
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
Please Dad

1075
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,047
Because

1076
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,839
The bigger point that he wants to make

1077
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,119
Is it bill is in

1078
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:43,103
The further point

1079
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,479
I was sitting around with Bill and I'm asking him hey man why you banging all these chicks aren't you worried they're going to get pregnant

1080
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,503
Now shoot

1081
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,575
Create this like

1082
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,367
Diminishing of Bills mascot

1083
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,439
Fight takeaways reproductive capability

1084
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,023
2 oz of that doesn't matter

1085
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:03,071
Put in that work

1086
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095
Yeah but

1087
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,119
At the same time

1088
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
I don't necessarily

1089
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,703
Think that is

1090
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,287
Yes yes that is important for

1091
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
Taking down his mask

1092
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,103
For some

1093
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,895
Whatever

1094
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,223
I also think that's

1095
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:23,551
Probably the only way for so many of these people too

1096
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,087
Create this reasonable X

1097
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,111
Expectation of

1098
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,647
Bill Clinton

1099
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,671
Everyone

1100
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
And yet has

1101
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,023
So the only explanation is

1102
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,839
What appears to be reasonable

1103
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,655
Visa Vie Larry saying the Danny Williams

1104
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:44,799
It's not reasonable because it is just a ball through

1105
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,823
The idea that built

1106
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,919
Make, right

1107
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,735
What

1108
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,551
You can't we

1109
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:59,391
I feel like it's perfectly describes which

1110
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,951
Thank you

1111
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,231
I've never heard that before

1112
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,815
I like ice cream

1113
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:13,215
Mccleary's putting out there like eight years were shootings at in a

1114
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
Conservative

1115
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,055
Emasculate

1116
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,591
Demasculate

1117
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
Yes but

1118
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,991
He does refute another Point here

1119
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,527
It is a huge

1120
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,295
Problem

1121
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,599
Did this next clip

1122
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,391
What Larry Nichols says

1123
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
Is it

1124
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,975
Direct contradiction of Alex Jones's worldview

1125
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
Entirely

1126
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,559
Learned about 5 minutes left

1127
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,351
Is there a shadow governor

1128
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:45,471
About that people make fun of and say all you're a conspiracy theorist YouTube

1129
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,775
Tinfoil hat all that kind of stuff

1130
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,311
Are there Men Behind the

1131
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
Literally pulling out

1132
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,223
No

1133
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,831
There are men dying

1134
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,439
Oh yeah well yeah that's

1135
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,743
Not since mister

1136
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,791
Stevens Brothers

1137
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,559
Dad

1138
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,839
No one

1139
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
Has ever been

1140
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,447
Uncontrollability

1141
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,263
Call Shelly will not allow it she has too much power

1142
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,639
Well of course

1143
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:30,015
Because they only world that he actually knows anything about his back in Arkansas

1144
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,575
Simply Hired

1145
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,647
Facilitated his

1146
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,207
Super secret agent career by the Sivan

1147
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,023
I think it's entirely possible I'm not saying

1148
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,815
Case but I think it's possible that

1149
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,375
Jacket with Stevens as super rich

1150
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,167
Businessman

1151
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,703
Arkansas

1152
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,751
Might have had some dirty dealing

1153
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,543
If possible

1154
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,127
Almost

1155
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,687
Larry Nichols to be

1156
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,223
Sort of man on the ground

1157
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:03,039
In some capacity

1158
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,367
Making making and funneling these phone calls in order

1159
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:10,207
To facilitate communication between Nicaragua US Representative

1160
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,791
But that's entirely possible

1161
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,327
From that standpoint

1162
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,655
I do see like Larry having this image of

1163
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,703
Mafia activity

1164
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,727
I in

1165
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,823
In Arkansas that is only surrounding jacket with Steven

1166
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,431
Because those are the only contact those are the only firm reference if he had

1167
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
Which would make sense

1168
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,247
What

1169
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:36,319
Hillary and Bill get outside of that world

1170
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,135
That doesn't know anything about what's going on with it

1171
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,159
So of course

1172
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,951
I had a big player

1173
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
They are now

1174
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,511
Dave

1175
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:49,631
Lack of imagination the one thing

1176
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,911
The one concrete

1177
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,935
Things that I have learned

1178
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
From this

1179
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,239
Anytime

1180
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,775
Two brothers are rich

1181
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,543
Together

1182
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,079
Is

1183
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:02,943
Going to no good

1184
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:09,343
Stevens Brothers how many more Brothers do we have absolute

1185
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,623
Tegan and Sara however

1186
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
Sure

1187
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,463
Look I don't know

1188
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,047
I don't know I don't know how to I don't know how to slice this other than to say like

1189
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:22,911
It's really f***** up that Larry is coming on the show and saying there's no Shadow government nothing

1190
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,215
That implies that there's no globalists

1191
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,007
Like all of this stuff

1192
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:32,639
All of the idea of Alex's nefarious spiderweb of weirdos

1193
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,919
Isn't true

1194
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:38,271
Like Larry doesn't believe that s*** that Alex says on his show

1195
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:41,087
He thinks that there is nobody above the Clinton

1196
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,183
For Obama he had other people above him

1197
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:48,255
Maybe I don't know he doesn't say that but maybe

1198
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,047
But not I would have

1199
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,375
II

1200
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,423
Do appreciate Coach Dave

1201
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,191
Treating

1202
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,239
The single most important

1203
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,287
Question I think that you can imagine which

1204
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,591
Is there a shadow government

1205
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,359
As like

1206
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:07,455
We got a few minutes left let's toss this in their is their Shadow government

1207
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:14,111
No alright we're moving

1208
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,183
Everybody know alright we're going to

1209
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,999
Celebrities at this point

1210
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,071
He's told his backstory

1211
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,095
About the ark

1212
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
Consolidate

1213
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,911
Is that the Hillary is a witch

1214
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,935
Smells weird

1215
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,495
He's lied about the idea of spousal privilege

1216
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,311
Stop by these just dumb he doesn't even know

1217
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:37,919
He's lying about Bill and Hillary still married

1218
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,967
At the end of the episode

1219
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
He said something

1220
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,015
Real interest

1221
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,343
No I wish you would have me back on tomorrow

1222
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,903
Give me one hour

1223
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,719
Tell you

1224
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
America

1225
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,327
2017 under Hillary

1226
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
I assure you

1227
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
It will scare you to your knees

1228
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,311
Grateful be my opinion

1229
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,151
But I will substantiate in and supported

1230
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
Lebanon

1231
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,223
EFax

1232
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,783
Wow thank you

1233
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,551
Not true

1234
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,599
Think about

1235
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,367
Your audience

1236
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
Needs

1237
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,695
Really think long and hard

1238
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,791
About what America is going to become in the next 3 years

1239
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
A disaster

1240
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,607
How do I know about it

1241
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,655
1986

1242
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:32,447
You know how it works

1243
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,519
Ego

1244
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,543
I wish you

1245
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,335
If it would be okay for me to ask

1246
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,871
They would help me

1247
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:43,967
Play Tiny desk

1248
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:50,367
I don't don't do it if it's going to make people not believe Larry Nichols.

1249
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,135
Larry Nick

1250
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,671
Schools.in Frozen where they go Larry

1251
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:56,767
Well then go there if they will use a credit card but if they want help

1252
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
PayPal

1253
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,095
Please just go to Nichols

1254
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
Why

1255
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,423
AOL.

1256
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:10,847
That is a re-run aol.com

1257
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,199
That is pretty funny

1258
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,295
What's fun about that most to me I believe

1259
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:23,135
Is it is a classic Jones

1260
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,183
Super Jojo

1261
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:33,375
Have me back on tomorrow and I'll tell you all of this

1262
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:38,751
Future information because I know I know what's going to happen when Hillary ends up

1263
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:42,079
I'm going to tell you this it's going to blow your mind and bring you to your knees

1264
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Can I ask

1265
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,895
For money

1266
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,783
By no means

1267
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
And I won't

1268
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,343
Revealed

1269
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,655
If you'll have me back on tomorrow I'll tell you all this great information

1270
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:09,215
Now the possibility is that like

1271
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,239
Cotrip

1272
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,031
Tomorrow

1273
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:15,871
Lingering

1274
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:20,735
That only leads them to search at Larrymore

1275
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,271
Does he have Larry

1276
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:27,647
You better use on the next day

1277
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:34,303
He doesn't actually explain what's going to happen in 2017 and Hillary's charge

1278
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Maiden

1279
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,311
He says the exact same thing

1280
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,895
Here is him talking again about how you need to protect yourself

1281
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,663
Voter fraud

1282
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,223
You say I do not recommend

1283
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:52,991
Coach

1284
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
You maybe you and

1285
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,575
I don't recommend job going

1286
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,183
Track monitor

1287
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,743
You could get hurt

1288
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,071
Remember last time in Philadelphia

1289
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,887
New Black Panthers

1290
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,727
Shout

1291
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,495
Organization

1292
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,775
Motorcycle

1293
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,591
Motorcycle games

1294
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
You can go to these

1295
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,943
With say

1296
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,735
8910 guy

1297
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,551
Adjust watch what app

1298
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
And when you see it

1299
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,183
Reported to the

1300
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,255
Play Coldplay

1301
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,535
Call the police

1302
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,119
That's what you got to do

1303
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,655
And that will stop

1304
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,727
A goodly portion of it will not stop all of it coach

1305
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
Just want

1306
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,311
Will scare Samoyed

1307
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,127
That's the worst way

1308
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,151
Yeah that's bad

1309
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,687
The Jordan

1310
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,991
We're an audio podcast

1311
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,015
It's it's difficult

1312
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,063
For you to pick up on why I care

1313
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,391
To talk about the second appearance at all

1314
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,207
But it comes back to what I told you to remember

1315
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,231
That was

1316
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,511
What coach said

1317
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
The first

1318
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,839
Larry Nichols is sickle

1319
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,143
You have these tubes

1320
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,935
That's why I do respect for him

1321
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:21,055
We're only going audio

1322
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,335
How many kids does he have

1323
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,895
They're really trying to play up how stickler

1324
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,919
And all of it

1325
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,711
Video in the second episode

1326
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,271
They go so far as to say is going to be dead soon

1327
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,807
Neo camping

1328
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,439
What I don't know what the deal is about is real condition

1329
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:42,815
He very well may have cancer or said they've contacted his wife and she said

1330
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,911
I don't know who knows I don't give a s***

1331
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,263
It's not a big deal for me really because his whole life is a series of fraudulent scam

1332
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:57,151
Scamming people into giving him money because he's pretending to be sick it's just another in a long line of fraud

1333
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:01,247
From a 1998 article instalaunch

1334
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:05,087
The aftermath of being fired after he made 642 collect calls for the

1335
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,391
Larry quotes

1336
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:11,487
Theft by deception charges in several Arkansas County

1337
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:16,095
He avoided prosecution by promising to either Maycrest to make restitution

1338
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:19,423
The later filed for bankruptcy in was never never had to pay

1339
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:26,847
Frauded by promising to pay them back and

1340
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
Didn't

1341
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,151
Because you filed for bankruptcy

1342
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,199
Is a lifelong f****** con man

1343
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,527
Either way the only thing I want to talk about in terms of this

1344
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,343
That first interview coach doesn't want to put Larry on screen

1345
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,623
Protect his dignity

1346
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,647
As he's so sick

1347
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:46,559
I'm second episode he does show Larry on video and what you see is a con man trying to make himself look very

1348
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607
What am I getting at

1349
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,375
Well

1350
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,423
He has tubes going into his nose

1351
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,191
An oxen

1352
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,471
Machine to help him breathe

1353
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,519
He can't even breathe Jordan

1354
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,335
He's just this hero out here trying to

1355
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,871
He's overdue asbestos

1356
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:03,455
You can't even is horrible sickness to get the word out about the clintons

1357
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,223
City black

1358
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:04,991
Congress

1359
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,271
No.

1360
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,367
But during the show which is only an hour long by the way

1361
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:13,951
Larry light up a cigarette and smokes it

1362
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:20,351
With no concern for the fact that his oxygen tubes in his nose away from his face

1363
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:27,263
This is so severely f***** up according to the National Institutes of Health

1364
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,615
Most patients on home oxygen use nasal cannula

1365
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,175
Nasal Candlelight tubing

1366
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,735
Polyvinyl chloride products

1367
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,295
Which emits an intense Flame

1368
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:45,695
Possibly owing to the release of Highly flammable vinyl chloride gas the prongs of Canela

1369
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:52,095
Are intended to direct a previous study showed however that is significant amount of oxygen

1370
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:55,935
It's been a constantly leaks out of her face

1371
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:59,007
Environment facilitates

1372
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,823
Ignition and combustion of the material

1373
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:08,479
Smoking using an oxygen machine is super super dangerous your face

1374
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:13,343
Highly combustible gas and waving a flame really close to that cat

1375
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:19,999
The only conclusion this Behavior are they either help or well-being

1376
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:24,863
To quote a house fire over these fake news onus entirely

1377
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,679
These are fake oxygen tubes that are coming out of his nose

1378
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:34,079
Is it hot bulshit he's straight-up smoking a cigarette in the middle of his living room while he's out.

1379
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,407
It's crazy

1380
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,759
You are writing things out chemically

1381
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,295
What does

1382
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,623
The chemical symbol for

1383
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:55,583
Lorazepam

1384
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,167
Merrifield very like

1385
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,703
If you if

1386
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:04,543
Believe me

1387
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,615
But like if you have any curiosity about this at all

1388
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,895
Look it up

1389
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,431
Like look up

1390
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:14,015
The cases the very frequent incidents of people

1391
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:17,087
Who are on oxygen machines

1392
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,135
What is it blows up

1393
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:22,463
And it blows up and burned most of their face

1394
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,999
You can find pictures of it

1395
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,023
It's crazy

1396
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:29,375
It was crazy to me is how specific the burns are generally to

1397
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:32,703
They are the Elves leave the pattern of the tubing

1398
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:35,263
Cub Cadet

1399
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
So specific

1400
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,591
Have you ever seen those because

1401
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,639
All of the patterns

1402
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,431
Are shaped

1403
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:45,759
Like a little like almost like a little

1404
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
Paper

1405
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,575
That says call Larry

1406
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,119
But he's not going to cuz it's

1407
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,423
Fake tubes that was two years ago

1408
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,471
Right and we just called him

1409
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:12,127
Recording of it or anything like that but yet we called him

1410
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,407
Jordan talk to him

1411
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:18,015
He sounds exactly the f***

1412
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,391
Contacting his wife and talk

1413
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,159
About like

1414
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:27,487
He doesn't have cancer

1415
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,255
Black Legion

1416
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:32,863
His throat of the situation that causes

1417
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,167
Him to speak like that and he's using

1418
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,471
The perception of

1419
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,263
Like chronic illness

1420
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,543
In order to

1421
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:47,455
No I like it when we talk to

1422
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:49,759
Talk right now as

1423
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
I don't want to talk

1424
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,319
Look for an hour right

1425
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,343
Because

1426
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:58,463
Throat hurts or whatever it is I were him I would want to talk to us

1427
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
I would put that off

1428
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,095
I don't think so

1429
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:08,703
Is actually the wolf

1430
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:15,359
Like you didn't try and pull that add pivot on us

1431
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:21,759
Nobody

1432
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,575
Back on the show

1433
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,343
No

1434
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:30,463
So my point in this whole thing is that if you actually watch the videos of the

1435
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,791
I never bring it up in and talk like

1436
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,351
Coach Diaz on Skype

1437
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,143
Why are you smoking

1438
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:44,543
You're on oxygen story about how you you have

1439
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,335
Lung cancer

1440
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:49,407
And you don't want to go to the VA because you don't trust them

1441
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,711
This is bulshit

1442
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,527
Got the Lord

1443
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,575
And that is why we

1444
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,343
When you go on

1445
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,367
Coach Dave show

1446
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,647
Doesn't matter how

1447
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,415
How much you smoke

1448
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
Doesn't matter how much

1449
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
Did you got in your face

1450
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,511
You have the power of the Lord

1451
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,815
And you end the Lord is telling you

1452
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
Good

1453
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,007
Is how bad

1454
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,567
I would love it if we test that.

1455
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,359
Jesus

1456
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,383
Oxygen machine

1457
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,407
Hooked up with them

1458
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,455
Do some like Firebreather

1459
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,807
And say that that is not going to

1460
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,831
Sponsored by the

1461
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,903
No I do not

1462
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,439
I think they might call that in

1463
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:35,487
Unethical

1464
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,023
I mean this is this is super

1465
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,839
What I want really

1466
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,935
Crazy

1467
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:48,799
Clearly like not rolling his eyes but clearly there was a look on his way to like

1468
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,151
He look like he was

1469
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
Not happy to talk

1470
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,479
Of course not

1471
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,527
The things I want to say

1472
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,807
I can't say this

1473
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,831
But I want

1474
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
Is effect

1475
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,439
I think it was

1476
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,231
Cuz I don't think anybody

1477
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,255
Like who

1478
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,047
Has any idea of

1479
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,071
Like what ox

1480
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,095
Virginis

1481
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,911
Anybody who has doesn't have a death wish

1482
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,703
Is going to smoke

1483
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:19,775
While they have a nose tube

1484
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,567
Represent himself is like

1485
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,591
Smart guy

1486
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,151
It's not somebody who's unaware of

1487
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,455
The risks of that might pose

1488
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,223
It's a prop

1489
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:32,063
Now I will I will say this

1490
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,087
Justin Fair

1491
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,879
Just incomplete Fair

1492
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,927
He may use a

1493
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:41,279
That may be real and he may have

1494
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,303
Turned it off

1495
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,863
Hour or two before

1496
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,679
That's entirely possible I'm not going to

1497
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,799
Use that oxygen

1498
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,591
I cuz otherwise

1499
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
I mean

1500
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,407
Freddy put it in as a prop

1501
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,687
Exactly exact

1502
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:02,527
Yeah otherwise why would you have it

1503
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,551
Unless you were like

1504
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,831
Committed to the

1505
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:09,183
Scam in the in the picture sight you don't see that it's

1506
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:15,583
Connected

1507
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,863
He does need to use oxygen

1508
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,983
Because this is what it's really about

1509
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:27,359
How long is election day

1510
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:31,711
He needs he needs funds to somebody else

1511
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:38,367
Nichols. Info

1512
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,159
The rest of the

1513
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:44,255
Breathing device he needs financial help with some people

1514
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,815
20 boxes way Larry

1515
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,607
Nickel. Info

1516
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,423
This is what he's really up to he's just trying to

1517
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,703
The colonies dumbfucks

1518
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
Santa giving him money

1519
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,031
10 or 20 by lying about the Clinton

1520
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:04,991
It's interesting cuz it's so much more over here when I look at it in the prison both coaches.

1521
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:07,039
Is it Alex reminder

1522
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:10,111
Announce his audience is so much larger

1523
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,391
Delivery probably doesn't

1524
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:13,695
Feel the need to

1525
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,743
Make it so over

1526
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
Like

1527
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:20,351
The first time at the end of the first interview that he did when he was like

1528
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:22,911
Can I ask

1529
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,519
Like

1530
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,543
Betrothed

1531
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,079
Process

1532
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,383
Like the Philadelphia

1533
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,783
So we see here Larry Nichols

1534
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,063
He is a zombie coach

1535
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,831
Programming

1536
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,415
I bet it's a little bit boring for our taste

1537
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,463
Possibly you know like a big picture

1538
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:55,423
More or less the same sorta narratives he says other plays it

1539
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
Shadow government

1540
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,007
Danny Williams

1541
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,543
His kid but also

1542
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,823
Legend services

1543
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,687
He said some things that are kind of out of character but like

1544
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,223
Big picture

1545
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:12,063
Kind of a disappointment Larry Nichols is

1546
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:12,831
Like

1547
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,599
Coach Dave

1548
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,183
The problem with it is

1549
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,463
Coach Dave

1550
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,255
Bring it

1551
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,303
Coach Dave is just

1552
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:28,703
Therefore Larry Sparks play too much Larry is the one doing everything in between

1553
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,983
F******

1554
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,799
Is Brick

1555
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:36,127
The table I don't know if he has cancer let him drive

1556
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,663
That's what I was.

1557
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,247
In an interview with cigarettes

1558
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,551
Degenerative

1559
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,623
Blake don't don't let him

1560
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:49,695
Become so boring

1561
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:54,559
The pace of speech whether it's because of an actual illness or his affectations or whatever

1562
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,351
Lady just becomes this

1563
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,359
Winner

1564
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:13,759
Years of really bad

1565
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:21,695
Listen to a bunch of much more entertaining

1566
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,463
He has

1567
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,487
Larry

1568
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,535
F****** Nichols on his show

1569
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:28,863
42 episodes of because you respect him so much

1570
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,655
This weird of

1571
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,215
Fetishizing of demonizing the left

1572
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,239
Kind of stuff

1573
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:37,567
Cute he sacrifices control of

1574
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,871
His own brand Tulare

1575
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,295
The moment you said that

1576
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,319
So many of our

1577
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:53,183
Don't have confidence that their own products people it's like

1578
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,463
If your

1579
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:57,791
Stable

1580
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,095
If you're rolling your belly up for

1581
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:00,863
For somebody else

1582
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,911
It's a bad show for

1583
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,727
Like if you like with Alex

1584
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,775
Rolling his belly for Gavin

1585
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,543
Like

1586
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:19,295
Whenever she's f****** controlling thing she put in the narrative

1587
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,319
Got that

1588
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:23,135
Yeah

1589
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,159
Is

1590
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,439
Running the game

1591
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,975
S*** is going well

1592
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:30,303
Coacht

1593
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:38,239
Burnham Park

1594
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:41,823
Is very Salient I think it's the right point and that is that like

1595
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,639
What we really are interested in

1596
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,919
In terms of these

1597
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,455
These Wednesday character

1598
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,479
Is

1599
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,015
You have your own

1600
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,783
Nothing

1601
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:52,319
Right

1602
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:58,719
When Carrie is is talking to someone and Mark Richards she gets f****** pissed at them

1603
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:05,119
Because it's her show a huge you not disrespect Mark Richards on Project Camelot

1604
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:05,887
What Alex

1605
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,959
Alex is an interesting case because like what

1606
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,519
John McManus from the Birch Society

1607
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,799
Dude showed ass

1608
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,567
All over the

1609
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:19,200
The playwright

1610
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,016
But Gavin wasn't

1611
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,040
Supplicating

1612
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,064
Vicky

1613
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:30,976
Threatened to murder people moment I brought Alex into it I knew that that was the wrong

1614
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:37,632
Yeah your address is the wildcard

1615
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:44,032
Like on his own show

1616
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:47,616
But he is his own thing like the stuff that I like to talk about

1617
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,896
With these crazy

1618
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,480
He's so much like them owning their space

1619
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:56,064
I like that I like him

1620
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,416
Get the f*** out of here if you don't agree with my version of secret space program stuff

1621
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,952
Get the f*** out

1622
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,976
I'd like

1623
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,256
Even though I hate everything

1624
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:05,792
I like

1625
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:07,584
Reverend Manning

1626
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,120
I mean generally speaking

1627
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:09,888
He's just talkin

1628
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,704
Camera by himself

1629
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:20,384
But I still like owning the space

1630
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:25,760
With Wacky Wednesday stuff it's very hard for me to see somebody

1631
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,784
Who like

1632
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,088
Talk themselves out for

1633
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:35,488
Someone that we know is a charlatan Like Larry Nichols isn't someone that you should bend over backwards

1634
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,768
Even if

1635
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,536
Coach

1636
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:40,608
Does believe all the stuff Larry believe

1637
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,656
Still should be coach

1638
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,680
He's not coach

1639
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,800
We would never do an episode

1640
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:53,408
Larry Nichols had his own show

1641
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:59,808
I do want to try it

1642
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,344
Nichols episode and we tried

1643
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,160
Tons of episodes of

1644
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,208
Various internet program

1645
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,816
Larry's been on them not worth our time or whatever

1646
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,656
The combination of of Costa

1647
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,936
Would make it

1648
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,472
Somehow more appealing

1649
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:23,872
But you're right we had to get to the end in order to really realize it

1650
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,456
Larry Nichols

1651
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:29,760
Arkansas coach

1652
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:36,160
When the to come in contact with each other

1653
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,816
We Are The Smokers of

1654
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,352
Rich environment

1655
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:50,496
That with us going forward

1656
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:55,872
Second coach is a finite

1657
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:59,200
You know I

1658
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
Bit more in this

1659
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:00,992
Sure but

1660
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,040
He's nothing with

1661
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,320
Buckle

1662
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:08,928
The folds like a taco when Larry Nichols comes around

1663
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,976
Nope nope he thinks he is

1664
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:18,400
Comes to Someone Like Larry neck

1665
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
Indeed

1666
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,544
We'll catch you next time but

1667
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,872
We have

1668
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,968
Website

1669
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,296
Knowledge bad fight.

1670
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,368
Underscore

1671
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,392
Thousand Oaks Cafe

1672
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:45,024
I have a Groupon there

1673
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,680
Oh yeah we're on our way back to then

1674
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,080
Articulate better

1675
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:04,480
We appreciate everyone listening so much thank you all.

1676
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,248
Look

1677
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,528
I'll say this

1678
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,552
Batman

1679
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,576
Is totally kill the guy

1680
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:15,744
How much people want to argue

1681
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,144
Technically probably killing a guy probably if we look at it it's probably

1682
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:22,912
From some

1683
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,984
Aggressive beating he gave a guy that caused

1684
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,264
Like chronic

1685
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,800
Illness

1686
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:35,968
John way worse people sternum head trauma

1687
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,736
My all that s***

1688
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,272
I would never let that man out there

1689
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:43,392
But I will say that Larry Nichols is a complete f****** coward real

1690
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,952
