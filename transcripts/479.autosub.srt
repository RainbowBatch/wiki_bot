19
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,064
This is the perfect weird how the world works like that

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
Whenever you need to be tempted

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
Even know you're not going to be late

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168

Looks

43
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
Maybe you need a clipping

44
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:12,672
Maybe you know you need a clipping and then you put that in the thing I've heard clipping before I have no idea

45
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,768
I don't understand corporate leadership don't ask me

46
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303

48
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,567
To go over but

49
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
Ridiculous

50
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151

Tim

59
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
You can take that generous

60
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
Spirit and you could

61
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
Put it in an empty bag

62
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,703
Cigarette pack grab that

63
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,263
Decide never to buy another cigarette pack again

64
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
So instead you take that generosity

65
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
Cigarette disposal store

66
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599

00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
You don't end something like that self-consciously

69
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
Miss

70
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
Now I struck out man

74
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
On top of this black box

75
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
What appears to be

76
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:13,151
Clippings from

Yet

81
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
So that's just to err on the side of caution

82
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
This is a gift from

83
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,591

00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,711

Copyrights or whatever to

116
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:15,071
If you sell something to take that

117
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:21,215
Even if it would be fair use I'm still going to respect that

118
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,287
All you needed to hear business baby

119
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,383

Alexa

138
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
I'm guessing she loves

139
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,055
Show a lot of it has to do

140
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823

Houses are boarded up

148
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:18,111
Confirmation silence is deafening

149
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
You can't talk

150
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,047

I deprived you of opportunity

162
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,767

On this to give you an indication of how little she gives a s***

171
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
What is all about

Understanding

To radiation

179
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
So we even had a doctor

180
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
In York

181
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
Turn off machine

182
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,271
And it may be that he was innocent

183
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
Sure

184
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Frenemy

185
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
But she was quite

186
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,463
Traveling around March I think it was

187
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
And he came forward

188
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,839
Innocently near doctor in

189
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
I think it was

190
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Dealing with emergency

191
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
And she was

192
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
Same.

193
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,919
Trouble breathing that it was much more of a kind of a

194
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
Radiation sickness or high altitude

195
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
Sickness

196
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039

00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951

00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:44,447
She sounds exactly like my Bob tried to remember

203
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:49,823
Okay 1000 sometimes people are asleep

204
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,919
And then I slept

205
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,735
More inside their sleep

206
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,807
Stop codon

207
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
He's always wearing a mask

208
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:08,767
Sometimes

209
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
He was an expert at something doctor guide

210
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,943
Cameron kyle-sidell

211
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,599
Yeah I remember this is not making up some pictures lying about everything around

212
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
Revelations remember his name

213
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Story

214
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Maybe corn

215
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:49,727
In April Kyle's Adele posted a YouTube video

216
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,151
Presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome

217
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
Which is treated with the ventilator

218
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,551
What Kyle Citadel was pointing out was at the muscles of typical ards patient

219
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Or malfunctioning

220
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Program

221
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:15,071
Same pressure traditional

222
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,775
Sure that would be concerned

223
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,615
Did you see if he is been threatened in the face of the Earth

224
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,455
No I can't tell that to

225
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,271
Is video with covered by

226
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
Find articles

227
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
Gabe

228
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,743
There wasn't the cover-up

229
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Going on

230
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,055
Settings

231
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
Covid-19

232
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
Inmates

233
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,455
News 12

234
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,015
Personalized approach

235
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Haitian

236
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:15,231
Which is why she conveniently can't remember details about this guy

237
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:19,327
Reminding listener of how about that story made them

238
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,655
To actually engage with the story itself is dangerous

239
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,495
It's just the doctor kyle-sidell disappeared

240
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,799
No reason to suggest that

241
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,919
He hasn't posted any more videos on his YouTube channel

242
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,223
Before that videos that doesn't seem too weird

243
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,087
Twitter account

244
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,439
Okay

245
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
So

246
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
So much of right-wing anger

247
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Boiled down to

248
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,191
Just like I don't understand your words

249
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:00,287
I think they mean why do you talk

250
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Difference

251
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Speaking English

252
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:08,223
You might ask yourself scalar weapons

253
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Or whatever

254
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:14,623
He's targeting of cities

255
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
Wow

256
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,208
There's one

257
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
Cleopatra

258
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
Target population Center

259
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
From a distance

260
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,656
And this gets into Tesla and his wardenclyffe

261
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Power

262
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
There we go

263
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
I talked about

264
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
Augusta

265
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,544
And how he

266
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,104
He was aiming for I believe it

267
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
I think was a

268
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,712
And it actually

269
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
Something like 2,000

270
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,600
Then I get into the fact that it was

271
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,464
Show that they knew what she was doing and in the process

272
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
Houston.

273
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Different

274
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,656
In tomorrow

275
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
No s***

276
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Tesla

277
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,824
What's the cause of the temperature

278
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,128
I did not know that

279
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
You haven't read all of the files in the Assassin's Creed games

280
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,880
No s*** I know that much

281
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,864
Address of the villains of her story are using Tesla technology to direct remote attacks its please

282
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:36,032
This is the Tesla accidentally shot Sunbeam

283
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
I love it

284
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
This is great

285
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
It doesn't work

286
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,344
124

287
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,816
Gotcha

288
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:05,216
Redirection

289
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
808

290
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,592
Place was a really exciting place around

291
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:33,888
Matters because it's just a cover-up version of the story

292
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:40,288
Going out of business sale

293
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
The government right

294
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
Secret

295
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
We're going to find out where this comes from later and I

296
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
Is it literally says

297
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,320
Who created

298
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,184
No

299
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:04,608
I didn't ask you what

300
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:11,008
The kind of person who would read everything in a game

301
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,544
I could never have done that

302
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
Become an adult

303
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,320
So

304
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Deep

305
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,952
Denialism medicine tonight

306
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
Call

307
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
Urology

308
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
As Judy

309
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
Never isolated any

310
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
Virus associated with

311
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,664
So what does that tell you that tells you that

312
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Working on that

313
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
Contagion

314
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,648
Right away season questions I mean it just sounds

315
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,928
Questioning

316
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
Premise

317
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
What is virology

318
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,328
Have they been able to buy

319
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Isolate antivirus

320
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
And if so

321
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
How did they do that at

322
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,312
They've never done that for any virus

323
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
There's also

324
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
This germ Theory

325
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:26,016
The whole thing he's thrown out get rid of it.

326
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,368
Little germ Theory get it out of here

327
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,912
Disease

328
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,776
And creating certified moral character 2:30 a.m.

329
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,080
Quite a bit

330
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:58,272
Really feel like

331
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
You know how you get

332
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
Free samples

333
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:07,232
The grocery store or 100 days or whatever

334
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,256
Here's what we do

335
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,304
Vaccines also have

336
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
Station

337
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,144
Polio and the Cure

338
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,936
So you get polio

339
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,008
This is really bad

340
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,104
It was a good idea to make

341
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,736
Conditions that you need to be vaccinated for

342
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:37,184
That's a that's a situation

343
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,232
Solution

344
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,536
Marriott

345
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
Syringe

346
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
No

347
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
You just a quick rebuttal

348
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
She's wrong

349
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,368
I'm not going to throw away

350
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
Isolated the virus

351
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:14,048
Never isolated

352
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
Textbooks

353
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,888
Little drawings of sucking viruses in

354
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:23,776
Why do you have tons and tons of studies about I mean anything to her

355
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,080
Does any Nobel Prize actually

356
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
Secret Wars

357
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
Go get it out of here

358
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
There's another guy

359
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
Okay

360
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,376
This is who carries it

361
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Alright

362
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
Germ Theory

363
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
The whole thing thrown out

364
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
Your

365
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,848
There was another another sign

366
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,896
I discovered

367
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,968
Substantial way of looking at

368
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,016
Human health and what what's going on

369
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,576
The bottom line is that

370
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
Comes from within

371
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,904
So that we generate

372
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,208
Except around our cell

373
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
Which is like

374
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,816
What is expelling poison

375
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,120
Coronavirus

376
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Difficult

377
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
Telford cell

378
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,520
And this is where that comes in

379
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
And it's all about

380
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,336
Poisons that are cell

381
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,664
Poisonous

382
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,712
Poisonous environment

383
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,504
Who is the other guy

384
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,088
Who is this guy

385
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,256
Who just took up more you know like Broadview

386
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:56,960
The details

387
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,264
Was that you

388
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,200
To tell you

389
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Psychic

390
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,952
So I got psychic download

391
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,512
They were installing

392
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,816
Using

393
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
So

394
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,912
From there I I kind of

395
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,240
And then also

396
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032

So just do happen

502
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Take that

503
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,256
And what they found was

504
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,536
Italy

00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,632

Tesla

513
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,368
So I

00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
Interesting is a tween

515
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672

Tesla blowing up

523
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:12,064
Yeah the alien battle was ended by directing Tesla's

524
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:20,512
Course

525
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:28,448
It was God's plan.

00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,456
Although it appears to be much like Alex

529
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,016
Carrie is taking pieces of picture

530
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,832
Weaving them into a Fantastical narrative about

531
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
All of this is

532
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,488
In my world document

Doing a lot of work on that.

535
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,632
But for the general populace

536
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
No nothing

537
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,616
Do these episodes condescending attitude

Accident

540
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,296
And the real people don't even want to know these things

541
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:19,648
Probably at this point it's fun it's fun

542
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
These ideas

543
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,888

You don't even know the aliens are

550
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:02,912
Dumb for not knowing that aliens had a battle and I really don't like it I don't like that mentality at all

551
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
It's hurtful

552
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944

561
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:48,224
So according to Jean-Claude you folks are old generals who got fired

562
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
To overthrow the government

563
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,904
Doesn't sound good at all

564
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,024
That's the one

565
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328

575
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,904
I think that goes on a lot whenever

583
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,264
And people don't realize

584
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,592

But they kill a lot of the CIA agents that are non

588
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
Why

589
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,000
Why would you ever do that

590
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
Why would

591
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,888
Why would anyone work for the CIA

592
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:49,312
So I started and then the next day they said if the president changes I die

593
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:54,687
Yeah that sounds like a recipe for a toxic environment

594
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,527
The real Megan and Morgan is coming up

595
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,183
You're aware in with the agency for a while

596
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:14,143
You can either accept your new president

597
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
Love you

598
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
Kilgrave

599
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:27,455
Lover he's my favorite you know how a grated into work under regimes where if you

600
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:33,855
Make them angry

601
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,391
We just pretend to like

602
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:38,719
Current president I think you would like every president

603
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:45,119
Equally

604
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:49,471
Bia2

605
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,775
You know what that's like regulatory capture

606
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:56,639
The SEC has offices inside the same building

607
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:03,039
You don't want your CIA Hunter guys

608
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,343
Just the recipe for disaster

609
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,903
Are there cell phone

610
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:14,047
Do like the idea behind the scenes there's evidence

611
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,095
Maybe it sounds ludicrous

612
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,143
Maybe there's accident

613
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
How many need a lot of sources on this

614
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
Knows about

615
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,359
What is it

616
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:33,247
They killed the CIA plane for about this stuff

617
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,327
Lady who's afraid of

618
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,887
Somehow I can't get hurt

619
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,983
Jesus conception

620
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
Superpowers

621
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,991
22 idiotic antipasto

622
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:12,927
Jean-Claude

623
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
There is some credence

624
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
Scary

625
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,535
Go back to

626
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,327
John F Kennedy

627
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,631
He was president

628
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:28,031
Incorruptible or something realized

629
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:37,247
Get hung up on that I'm going to pull up

630
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,855
Interrupting

631
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,183
That's the nature of these episodes

632
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:50,559
Uncorrectable

633
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
Don't worry about it

634
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,495
At the time he realized he couldn't Trust

635
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:03,871
People with me like intelligence Services operation

636
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:07,199
Where he was getting people recording stuff

637
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
Tahir Moore

638
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,759
Secret

639
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
As far as

640
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,999
It doesn't look as though the Kennedy

641
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,791
Family

642
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,631
Getting murdered

643
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:27,935
No Doubt

644
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,727
So at some point

645
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
And yes

646
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,311
Someone's got to read the writing on the wall

647
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,591
You're going to be at Target

648
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
Special

649
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,663
Crainer

650
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
Joe Kennedy

651
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:45,855
Literally just ran for Senate in the House of Representatives

652
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:53,023
When rsk was killed in 1968

653
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:59,423
Death in 2000

654
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,751
Half a century

655
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:11,967
Global most of the other

656
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,623
Incorruptible William Robert

657
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,671
Right

658
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:25,535
I don't know about the Camelot connection

659
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,607
In between the Project Camelot

660
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,423
I don't know I don't know

661
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,519
JFK jr. realized

662
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,055
You know he's going to be

663
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,591
Probably

664
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,407
Plane crash

665
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Decades

666
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
Do with all this s***

667
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,599
Get more internet

668
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:53,439

669
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,279
Love it come on man

670
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,607
He didn't even get to finish out his first three months

671
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,399
You got her you why did he die

672
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:05,471
Right everybody's like

673
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
Rashad you know this dude didn't even make it he's either you could have been polonium poisoning or their Warren G Harding

674
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,479
James Garfield had a beard

675
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,295
Look me in the face

676
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:24,671
Do you do I

677
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,303
I'd say you didn't have beards

678
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
2q stuff a little bit later but

679
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:42,335
Interesting about

680
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:46,175
He's working with these good folks

681
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,479
Tesla raised used

682
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,015
Spread covid in what have you

683
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
Obelisk

684
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
Ukraine

685
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,023
Hunter Biden and Joe Biden

686
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
Anniston

687
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,447
And everyone who's involved in Ukraine

688
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,727
They're involved

689
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
In action

690
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,263
CRST

691
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,055
And the real truth by the way

692
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,855
Not even about Russia it's about something in Ukraine

693
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,647
And I am

694
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,671
Sort of online

695
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,511
The devil in

696
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
Andy Frain

697
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,607
You talked about on other

698
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
Update

699
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:43,519
There's more here than meets the eye

700
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,103
This case will not go under cell

701
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,479
Board this Ukraine situation

702
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
Baby it's

703
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:57,343
Mountain

704
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,927
What's a fun party Hardy Boys way of looking at life

705
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:12,959
Mountain where the devil makes his residence

706
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,311
And that leads you to ask yourself

707
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:30,879
Who wins in a fight a lot

708
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,447
Look I would say

709
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:50,847
Stupid

710
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,039
Geopolitical truck ever been

711
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:09,535
One side Russia resource issues

712
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,095
Play Store

713
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:18,495
Incredibly, the fact that there's trouble

714
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,919
Horoscope

715
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,735
I was in Greece

716
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,551
Back in 2007

717
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:35,903
One ring of course

718
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,999
We took a little trip

719
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
We went to some Island

720
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,887
Amazon Knoxville

721
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,935
Scooters around

722
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,471
And weave

723
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,495
I don't know

724
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:56,895
I might be mixing up memories

725
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,735
He wasn't there

726
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:11,231
That was Jesus born

727
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,863
We we take a step back

728
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,167
Geopolitical issues

729
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:29,663
Because I love hearing about Double Mountain

730
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,967
Nonsense

731
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
Mike down for this because

732
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,599
She tried to put videos up somewhere else

733
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,391
Although by the way

734
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:43,487
How do you say the band video I will call over there and they haven't even accepted

735
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,071
Fanvideo not sure

736
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:52,703
His videos are being banned in whose are okay right now

737
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:58,847
Battery capacity has banned from banned. Video

738
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,919
Alex Jones is censoring

739
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
Kerry Cassidy

740
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,015
Why would you allow her free

741
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,551
You coward

742
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:13,951
You hypocritical coward how dare you the truth out videos about Ukrainian devil mount

743
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,999
How different is

744
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:22,911
Now Barry Moore

745
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,527
Exactly

746
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:39,807
Great

747
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,671
Gino

748
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
Okay

749
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,815
So we have DNA

750
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,191
Would you say that your DNA is

751
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,751
That's a loaded question

752
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
Right

753
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,687
Kaiser

754
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,223
It's kind of a trick question

755
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:12,831
Because you're human

756
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,439
Made a profit of 12 or more

757
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,023
Haven't

758
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,071
Actually if you want to look at it

759
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,911
At least 12:30 races meaning

760
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,679
Planet

761
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,983
Some of which have also said

762
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:33,567
An inner inner earth and inside

763
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,639
Civilization 6

764
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,919
Did come from

765
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
Off-world initially but how

766
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,991
I have been here for millennia

767
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,855
Living inside the planet flat-earthers carries a hollow Earth

768
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
Love it

769
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,231
Okay so then humans were

770
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,255
Constructed

771
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,327
Where we were built

772
00:53:55,583 --> 00:54:01,727
Yeah I want to call

773
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:08,383
I'd like a slave race

774
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:14,783
Sumerian text

775
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,599
You were created as like

776
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,647
Remaining race because they needed

777
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,927
Something from Earth

778
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,463
White gold

779
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
Evolve

780
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,279
Is

781
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:35,263
I don't know I haven't heard her

782
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:43,967
You know.

783
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
Going to be down there

784
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:52,415
I'm interested because I always do the HALO Series more than I like

785
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,183
XB

786
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,583
Because he allowed

787
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,983
There's promise there's promise with you can find something in there there's a place

788
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:12,383
All kinds of animals running around I can see everything

789
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,943
Isn't another

790
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,783
Does it work

791
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,367
Play the video game

792
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:32,863
Map

793
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:42,847
That would be what happens if you

794
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:48,479
Or whatever

795
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,759
Science fiction writers

796
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,295
Always have a hollow Earth

797
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,831
Somewhere along the line

798
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:56,671
The worst science fiction writers have the Flat Earth because it's just a

799
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,487
It's a measure of your explore invitation

800
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
I'm glad we're in agreement

801
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,655
Just talk more about that

802
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:12,287
Trump jr.

803
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,591
John F Kennedy Jr and Trump

804
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,175
Many many years ago before

805
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,807
So this is where you guess

806
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,575
Unity

807
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,367
Qanon

808
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,999
At least inspired by John F Kennedy Junior

809
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,047
She may be running it as the top

810
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,375
Yeah but I don't know

811
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,263
Pecking order hierarchy

812
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,431
Qanon but I can definitely say very involved are in it and it has it actually smash

813
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,367
Kennedy Junior Style

814
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,903
Poor grammar

815
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,951
Yes weird

816
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:05,279
Predictions

817
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:11,679
That must suck to be believed in the qanon

818
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,983
You have to defer to the

819
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,519
Right

820
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
She can't just be like

821
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,871
I know this about cute because then people be like

822
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:25,759
I think you can kind of play games

823
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
Bad

824
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:35,487
Specific as long as you don't do it

825
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,727
Screwed over by aliens

826
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,079
Time

827
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,103
In our history

828
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Diesel

829
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,991
Asian

830
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,903
I don't know if there's any history at all

831
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,535
Species. Then

832
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,327
Intermarried intermingle

833
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,631
And word you know

834
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,447
Interfere

835
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,471
Especially

836
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,311
Is there a murati

837
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,359
Species that go from planet

838
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,151
Planet and that is what they do

839
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,223
Justin Bieber

840
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,247
On the planet

841
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,599
And they

842
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,415
Omastar geneticist

843
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,719
Do they wrap their own genetics

844
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,743
Into

845
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,791
When they interfere the way they enter

846
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,327
Interfering influence

847
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,351
Through

848
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,375
Genetics

849
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,679
So no difference

850
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,751
Was Bill Gates and his whole genome program

851
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,055
Typical reptilian

852
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:54,847
To help

853
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
I would suggest

854
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,807
Siri racist

855
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,903
It's hard to say

856
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:13,535
Is a lot of places it's hard to say

857
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,839
If we imagine

858
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,119
The reptilians

859
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,911
To be this marauding

860
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:22,751
Horse Across the Universe

861
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:31,455
Easier to take over its resources

862
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
Is it Ben

863
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,391
Total waste of resources

864
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,207
Whatever they could possibly get from this planet

865
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:48,351
There can't be something that they couldn't find it somewhere else is it on Iraq War

866
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,911
It's just locked in an endless conflict

867
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,983
Nobody has

868
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
Meijer like that

869
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:08,319
That's just a misunderstanding of typical reptilian

870
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,159
Misunderstanding I don't know man I just think

871
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,983
Weather live

872
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,775
Thousands of years

873
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,799
Right I mean

874
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:35,967
How many have died in the process

875
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,735
Somewhere else

876
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:43,391
Do they have a memorial on their home planet

877
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:46,463
Even like

878
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,511
Wild animals

879
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:54,911
Sure will.

880
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,471
Many animals

881
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,519
If they get to a point where

882
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,079
Whatever they're trying to get

883
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:05,151
From attacking you

884
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:15,391
In some way things can do a basic cost benefit analysis

885
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:19,487
Operating

886
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:23,327
We're getting what they need takes more

887
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,519
Yeah and I don't know I don't know how

888
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,871
Is it there first

889
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:39,455
Give me the first. What is this their first goal

890
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,439
The bigger problem is

891
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
The easiest Target

892
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:54,559
And everywhere else is so much harder than us and they're just like

893
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,631
It's like the first black

894
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,655
Constantly

895
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,799
There's two low-level

896
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,359
Durham

897
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,407
It doesn't make sense

898
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:13,247
You are asking about

899
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:19,647
Typical

900
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,255
This is getting a little bit

901
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:28,095
This is my issue though and I don't know if you want to talk about this

902
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,423
They don't want

903
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
Okay

904
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,007
Can't help

905
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,031
Themself

906
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,823
Because they

907
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,871
And this is true of the majority of

908
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,151
Humanity that has

909
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,175
Stgnews

910
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,223
Shimla

911
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:50,111
No have a related Gmail even to the Mantis by the way

912
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,647
Even because

913
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:56,511
No Simon parkes was their Emissary to say that they're trying to change their ways and

914
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,535
Align themselves

915
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,351
Emissary from the

916
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,423
And they're saying the same thing that used to eat us

917
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,447
But then they decided

918
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
Future and sauce

919
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,799
Ourselves

920
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
Manatee

921
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,847
So now they're there

922
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,407
Branson are helping us behind the scenes

923
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:19,039
The reason I try to explain is that

924
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,903
There is a mixture of races

925
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,183
From all different

926
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,207
Sort of shades

927
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,279
And most of them have an agenda

928
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,071
They're not just here

929
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,631
No for our well-being in

930
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,911
Cuz you know they want

931
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,191
Jason light

932
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,215
Insurance

933
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,263
Not really

934
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,567
It's not really like that all that much

935
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,895
I don't I don't know

936
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:50,527
I don't know I don't know how much

937
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:57,183
Play the centrally from a different genome are lesser groups of people

938
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:03,583
And the ones that are 7 impact

939
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,375
Character

940
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
Like that

941
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:10,239
Your morality or your ability to control yourself

942
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:11,775
Evil

943
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,335
Stop yourself from being evil

944
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,639
Timmy is a real problem

945
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,199
Is an idea that I rejected

946
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:24,831
Yeah it seems like once we got DNA phrenology just got smarter

947
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:29,183
I just got more smarter

948
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:34,047
Technically complex I suppose

949
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,863
Keto acids instead of your

950
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,103
Because it's like

951
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:53,503
Look like lizards

952
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,415
Compositive alien DNA

953
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:06,815
And if you have that reptilian

954
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,863
Who has that reptilian

955
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,167
You give into that kind of territory

956
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:14,751
Dan White

957
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:18,847
Right you get you your start

958
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,639
How does a supply realistically

959
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,687
SMS in humans

960
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
Become problem pretty

961
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,503
Probably

962
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,551
So f*** you carry

963
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,855
Anyway

964
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,879
This next

965
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:39,839
Is talking about how she may have manifested

966
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:48,287
Says the name of the person

967
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:54,175
I don't even care no no no no

968
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,527
They didn't really

969
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,647
Person per se

970
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,183
In anyone

971
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,487
Particular individual

972
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
Call Rudy

973
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,791
Many many months

974
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,583
Stration

975
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,423
As we get closer

976
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,191
Selection

977
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,727
And I even put out

978
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,799
Lee I don't know if it had any effect but it seems to

979
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,591
There seems to be a manifestation

980
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,359
The weather

981
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,663
I was helpful in bringing out

982
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,943
All I know is that

983
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,247
Yo I did some block

984
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,039
Video blog

985
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,831
We need to see your win

986
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:35,135
We need some evidence of your win

987
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,511
It's not enough

988
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:43,839
We just talked about it we need to see some you know some

989
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,423
So I think what they've done

990
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,471
Certain individuals

991
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
The week

992
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,055
Now those individuals

993
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
Because he was

994
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,711
Intuitively

995
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,735
Number one

996
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,319
He's like a master neurologist

997
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:08,671
Mary Kate. And then I guess also interpreting the two material

998
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:14,047
They noticed him and they made overtures to him basically saying

999
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,351
We don't have a leak so how do you know this

1000
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,887
As he says I'm I show

1001
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,935
And so she became one

1002
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,287

1003

You got a master's in numerology

01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,535
Charlie freak might be in the running

1009
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:50,399
Numerology

1010
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:53,215

North Carolina

1019
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:44,415
That doesn't sound like me

1020
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,975
Damn this is not an issue for

1021
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,815
Charlie freak

1022
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,631
My mind is blown

1023
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,167
That's why they

1024
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,495
I think I believe you have now

1025
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:07,967
I talk to myself oh my God

1026
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
Yeah I do care

1027
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,039
Charlie Charlie

1028
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:21,023
Has another source named Charlie that

1029
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,095
I don't think she

1030
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
But

1031
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:31,263
He is in direct communication with

1032
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,799
Information

1033
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,591
You want to know about financial

1034
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,383
Now in this interview

1035
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,479
Charlie Ward is saying

1036
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,015
Cuz he has an inside track

1037
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,039
That he's been told

1038
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,855
It started in August

1039
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,879
It's going to manifest

1040
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,183
September 4th

1041
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
Today

1042
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,255
Supposedly today

1043
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,023
Okay

1044
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:58,911
Now I guess seeing is believing how it's going to manifest you know they're calling

1045
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,215
Financial system

1046
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,751
So do we have a quantum

1047
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:09,919
Fluid

1048
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,455
September

1049
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,991
Haha

1050
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:18,623
No manifestation no root no reset

1051
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,655
Surprise appearance from Jeff session

1052
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,959
Play makeup

1053
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,495
And he becomes the vice

1054
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,287
Interesting

1055
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,639
Because I already knew that John F Kennedy Junior and I'd already

1056
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,407
That

1057
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,111
In my

1058
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,183
So

1059
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,743
And then since then of course there's so many other people

1060
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,839
Anchovies and Jennifer Mack kind of

1061
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,655
Lay's that out very nicely in a very

1062
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,215
Brand new

1063
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,519
To this idea

1064
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:09,823
Why

1065
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,871
Pescado is now Hemet

1066
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,711
Carolina

1067
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,343
Material

1068
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,695
Bottom line

1069
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,375
In end of July but for some reason

1070
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
Timeline change

1071
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,191
Extraneous

1072
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,751
Circumstances

1073
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,335
Actually

1074
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,943
It didn't happen

1075
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,271
And then Charlie freak. It would happen early August

1076
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:53,855
Ecology at he was following that he's hot mic

1077
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
Dodging

1078
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,463
Lately the latest is now

1079
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
October

1080
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,511
Sometime during

1081
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,191
That's my under

1082
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,615
Is

1083
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,247
JFK jr. is going to be the vice president

1084
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:29,951
Was wrong about numerology

1085
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,487
Call Jessica Alba.

1086
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:36,351
PhD in neurology okay

1087
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:41,215
First two letters

1088
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,895
I think that would be my break

1089
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,431
For all of life

1090
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:53,503
I think it's suddenly JFK Junior

1091
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:56,575
Reveals to Earth that he faked his death

1092
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,927
And then just becomes vice president like he faked his death

1093
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,695
To become

1094
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,023
I think at that point

1095
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,047
No

1096
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,935
He declares that he faked his death

1097
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:15,519
Immediately arrested

1098
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:30,367
I really do

1099
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,671

What is the property they made themselves

1119
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:39,743
They have respect

1121
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,911
Just just the back

1122

1274
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,328
I have to say

1275
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:28,704
You know what it is it's understated

1276
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,008
It's totally not that is

1277
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:36,640

1278
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,064
Yes that is a pickle drink

1279
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,904
I think I I think

1280
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,440
How do they get that much pickle

1281
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:58,912

I keep going back

1288
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:28,864
I guess reviews are mixed up but you know what I can't

1289
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,216
This might f*** around and be less than 250

1290
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:41,152
3 * I don't think it's merely that low for me

1291
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:48,320
It would be like spit out

1292
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:54,720

Going to be a Slave

1296
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:11,616
