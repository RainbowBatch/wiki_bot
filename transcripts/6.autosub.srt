00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:07,936
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:10,496
Everybody welcome back to knowledge

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,520
Jordan

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:16,384
Today we take another adventure down into the land of Alex Jones

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,176
Insanity iWatch

7
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:18,944
Infowars

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,224
And I have no fun

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,992
Conclude what he's

10
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,784
About and I will do my best

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,112
To explain what's going on in the world

12
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,648
Well

13
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,440
Going on in the world is it

14
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,744
Going on in the imaginary world

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:37,632
The world of Jones as it were

16
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Yeah

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,472
I've been wrestling with a few things

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:46,336
Alright involved 14-hour live broadcast

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
But Infowars dead

20
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
Which

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Everyone can agree is except

22
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,736
There's no way anybody watch

23
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,528
More than a half-hour of

24
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
Right I think a lot of people watched

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
The bunch of it

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,416
Raise I know that I was checking it out

27
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:06,304
Periodically it was in the thousands

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:11,680
Fluctuated near me and Matt Riggs

29
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,728
Get together and watch podcast Athan

30
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,288
Ricardo's charity

31
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,384
But Marathon show up and down

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,688
Just know people don't have time for this b*******

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
People drop-in drop-out

34
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,344
Donut

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,464
Myself I'm not super thrilled to admit I could really only make it through a couple hours of it

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,376
Retreat to the safe Waters of how are you how are you not super thrilled that you made it

37
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
Through a cup

38
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
School because the hours

39
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,240
Through maybe 45

40
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
If I was

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
Really focused on

42
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,088
And then David night we're like

43
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
Is the most boring

44
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
He's a smug prick

45
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,256
Yeah it was a girl

46
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,816
Leanne

47
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Choose flying

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,192
Most of what I watched her do with interview a guy about how Russia is okay

49
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,544
That was a big narrative that kept spinning with a k

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
Way too much about Russia

51
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Like

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
To establish

53
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,504
Because the whole look up because for so long all about

54
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Show

55
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Russian

56
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Basically

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Now they have to

58
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Two established

59
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
Yeah

60
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
If I pretty

61
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Tending that none of

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Yeah actually

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
One of the things I was going to do is because this inauguration

64
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,424
14 hour broadcast is

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
Almost

66
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
Impossible to cover

67
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
I wanted

68
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,312
Maybe we could do a special episode

69
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896
Send to the 911 episodes

70
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
And it's shockingly boring

71
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Really

72
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,320
It's just like

73
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
That was yesterday

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,928
You do have to give him credit he did

75
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,488
Like in the in the Y2K up

76
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
Episode

77
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
The the

78
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
Blind squirrel in the crazy occasion

79
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
Hazelnutty totally nailed

80
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
But it's very easy to predict that

81
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,568
911

82
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
Take responsibility

83
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,200
Given that he'd already attacked the World Trade Center wants to do it again

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
Loudly

85
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,112
Lightsabers

86
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
You're not reading

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
B

88
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Osama's going to

89
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
Yeah

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,632
I have a lot of theories

91
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
About what happened

92
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,288
To get back to that cuz I do but we're going to cover

93
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
RMV

94
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
Great nightmare that began

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
On the inauguration

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
The women's March just happened

97
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
This is the day after all that was fuckingawesome

98
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,672
Millions of people taking to the streets

99
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
3 million

100
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Across the country

101
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,536
Which is a population

102
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Like fuk

103
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,887
Like one person

104
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
But you have to factor in

105
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,751
Beverly

106
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
Even if you go just by voting

107
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
Population that's a full two and a half

108
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
That is a huge part of the elect

109
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
Largest protest in America

110
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,599
What's going to end up having Countrywide it's not

111
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Because that's always the narrative

112
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Of likes

113
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Countrywide

114
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
Kansas

115
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
City there were thousands

116
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,375
Women showing a Heart of Texas

117
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
Yeah

118
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:01,055
Unoccupied around the world

119
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
One-place

120
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Erica

121
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
All seven continents

122
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Sarah people approach

123
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
But

124
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
We don't have feedback of what he

125
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
Was going to say about this in the narrative

126
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Cannabis pain

127
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
But I guarantee

128
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
What's going to happen is he's going to

129
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Conflate

130
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
With the people breaking

131
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
Starbucks Windows the night before

132
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,655
It's going to be this wasn't protest

133
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
I mean we'll deal with that when we get to it

134
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
I'm having a disjointed open

135
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Because I don't know how to

136
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
Everything is overwhelming

137
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,407
Yep

138
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
Compared to one of the most amazing days I've ever seen

139
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
Like I've been so hope

140
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
I'm seeing all of those women

141
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
Show the f****** and

142
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,231
Like and that's the other thing in d.c.

143
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
No arrest

144
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
There were four

145
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
Yeah 300 women's

146
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
2000

147
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Walking down the street

148
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Zerorez

149
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,127
Useful tops there's no narrative

150
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
Can spend other than

151
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
These are full-on protest

152
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:16,575
I want to start

153
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
I have a theory

154
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
The Alex was only on the broadcast

155
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
4

156
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
A couple

157
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
H and

158
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
Vague check-ins with him

159
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
Because he was on a bender

160
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
I think Alex was

161
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
Real drunk throughout most of inauguration

162
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Yeah

163
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,311
Well he did go to the deplorable right

164
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Assuming they all got

165
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
S***-faced

166
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
Same here I want to start with a clip

167
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
Of him right before the

168
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,319
The floorball that he was very drunk

169
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
He was out of out of

170
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
What is Gord

171
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,255
He was scheduled to speak at the deplorable and this is before it

172
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
Who want to take over with freedom and so here's that works

173
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
Dumbasses walk-around

174
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:14,431
So he also I should give a point of clarification there he always talks about the people and watch

175
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Big trench coat

176
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
Spy work right there

177
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Go to

You girls on

Get to the point where I am

181
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
Absolutely positive

182
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
You have to actually tell reality now

183
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
Infowars.com

The tree depends on our I don't know

196
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
That's a drunk like

197
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
Slurring his words

198
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
That is a drunk me

199
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
Absolutely

200
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,279
It further make the argument that he was wasted

201
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
Trying to act

202
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
He's trying to sound like

203
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,167
She's not wasted

204
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,567
A one-point

205
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
He's not drunk

206
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,551
Exactly what I've been a doorman at bars

207
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
I'm not

208
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
Too much

209
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
I haven't stepped

210
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,559
So here's my here's my

211
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
Business that may be developed over the course of

212
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Is a three-prong thesis

213
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239
The first is that Alex was

214
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,847
Did through most of the weekend that's why they kept him off air and had David Knight hosting most of

215
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Their coverage

216
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
Pretty well-established

217
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:29,343
Studio Lee Ann McAdoo also in-studio Paul Joseph Watson lives in London

218
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
So he was

219
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
He just Skype

220
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Stuff like that

221
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
Alex

222
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,023
Owen Shroyer and Rob do were on

223
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
On the ground

224
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
Rob do of courses the cameraman who sometimes gets on camera

225
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
Is not great

226
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Also

227
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
They had shots

228
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Because there's do like cameras

229
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,055
On top of cameras

230
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,871
Best golf

231
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,687
And you could see better videotape

232
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
Can people video.

233
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,783
Yes

234
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
He has one of those

235
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
The stabilizer

236
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
Is to iPhone

237
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
They don't even have cameras

238
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
They have iPhones

239
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
You know the

240
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,239
The cameras are there

241
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,543
There's some good stuff I'm not advertising

242
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
For iPhones

243
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,919
Nope professional operation would have cameras as opposed to what I have

244
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:30,015
Well we've already established their money stream is very

245
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
Tenuous

246
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
This is that

247
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
Then they kept him off after a large portion

248
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
We want Alex we don't want these other people drunk on broadcast the whole time 10 hours

249
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,911
I've ever seen I wouldn't have turned it off

250
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
Compelling situation

251
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,799
My second know he would fall in and out of

252
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,639
Sleep at least once or twice

253
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Artichoke

254
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
Before football

255
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
Imagine after

256
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
Amazing

257
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,415
Drawing of my

258
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Do you have

259
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Wikipedia

260
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:17,631
It at the at the Coronavirus

261
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,215
Dorset like Hillary a Goldman Sachs

262
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,799
The second prong of my thesis is Vicky wasn't really welcome

263
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
At the inauguration

264
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,663
The Trump didn't even really invite him

265
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,831
You went to this deplorable which was a secondary thing is like there

266
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Deplorable

267
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,303
But there's a video and it's not really good for audio so I didn't put it on

268
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
An art collection

269
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
Thrown out of the inauguration

270
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,007
Does a video of taking him out of a big crowd past the barrier

271
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,175
Globalist

272
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
Yep afraid of me

273
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
Fusarium just somewhere on the street

274
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
Surrounded by like 10 or 20

275
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Replace

276
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
You don't need access to get to

277
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
I have no evidence

278
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
But he's actually anywhere in Port

279
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,471
With my first one

280
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,823
Is that this is all sort of an elaborate charade about his access

281
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:36,479
But he has Zach Britton

282
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Really sucks

283
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Him up

284
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,599
Now feels like

285
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Credit

286
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,463
You carry in the water

287
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Trade like that

288
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,191
Every single

289
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
Weirdo

290
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,823
People who are a liability

291
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
The first time he's ever been

292
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Stepped on

293
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
On the way there

294
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
Wow

295
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,087
Nobody's he's never had anybody to step

296
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
Because nobody likes

297
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
Or 17 and then all the sudden

298
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
He did some

299
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Now I got a Kik

300
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
Kick you to the curb

301
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Horrified

302
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
I don't

303
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,495
I hope everything

304
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
He's very

305
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
So I think that what's happening is

306
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Trump is

307
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
Let him along

308
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,991
In a big way

309
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
I can't have you at the gala

310
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
Are you going to call

311
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
He's let on all of his supporters

312
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
Middle-class people need to pay more

313
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Interest on their morgue

314
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,655
Apart of any platform

315
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
His supporters

316
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
For the middle class

317
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,359
To really take over and then the first thing he does is go

318
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
Yeah it's going to be really shocking

319
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
Like the waves of awareness

320
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
Start selling.

321
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
You YouTube

322
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
He is lying

323
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Just like

324
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
He's lied to

325
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Everyone

326
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,487
Fake news

327
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,863
Let's just get into it one clip that I think

328
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
Apparent

329
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
Enough

330
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
The inauguration

331
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
It's sort of a breakdown

332
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
It's sort of like a

333
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Let's fucken take this

334
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,527
Apart piece-by-piece the inauguration

335
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
And I don't think he does a really great job

336
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,671
Here is the beginning of the clip where he introduces his

337
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Is Pisa

338
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,487
Okay about what Trump's inauguration

339
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Which was all about

340
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,375
First off let me just take a deep breath here

341
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,447
Undoubtedly

342
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,639
This was Trump declaring

343
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
Office Republican George Washington talked about

344
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,319
Little bit dog whistle

345
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
That is

346
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Straight up

347
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,463
You know that every white supremacist

348
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Super thrilled

349
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
To hear that sort of thing

350
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
To the third prong of my piece

351
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
And that is that what we're witnessing

352
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Is

353
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,495
Alex Jones sort of being in charge of

354
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
A move towards fiachra

355
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
Christian theocracy

356
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
This clip

357
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,807
If you pair it with him being a drunk on the streets

358
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
It's pretty funny

359
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
Did you take it just

360
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Of like

361
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
It's incredibly

362
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
So get ready to get a little bit scared

363
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Little bit

364
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,423
1776

365
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:26,623
Tweet that they're going to reimburse Oak

366
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:45,311
Spirit of America

367
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,015
And empower the globe

368
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,367
Coming in the way from the microphone

369
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
It's Pro he wants to empower

370
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Power

371
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,023
I don't think he's drunk at this point but I think he's probably hungover

372
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,703
Or maybe not maybe all of his weirdo supplements are actually hangover cures maybe that's the secret all along

373
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,847
If you're hungover take super male vitality

374
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
I got to order sub

375
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
Telling thing that he

376
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
He said

377
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,479
Was I haven't talked to Trump about

378
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,807
Oh no I did not happen

379
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Not that we

380
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
No I swear to God he said he hasn't

381
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
Talk to Trump about it no no no okay

382
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
Between

383
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
And the Providence

384
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Ideas

385
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
He didn't talk to Trump about

386
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
Is the spirit of America Rising

387
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Okay

388
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,823
Because I swear because the media is the media

389
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,639
What was the

390
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,167
Spirit of America

391
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
So he did he says that too though

392
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
We'll talk to

393
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Trump

394
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Telling you

395
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
He is saying is

396
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
One the media ask

397
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
They did not

398
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
He didn't talk to

399
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
To Trump but there's a mind-meld

400
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
He is trying to

401
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
He's trying to

402
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
Consider himself part of that

403
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
Very clear that Trump

404
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
Is cutting off

405
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,239
Like an ax through starting to move away from you and your like

406
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
No I gave him all the great ideas

407
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
Afraid

408
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
He is lost

409
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
All of that can

410
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,135
Then the question

411
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,951
Become even more non-existent

412
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,047
Somehow even in his own imagination he will have

413
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
To admit

414
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
The media isn't talking

415
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
Sing to me anymore because

416
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
Cuz I'm not a player

417
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,215
Yeah all I've got is

418
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
Weird dude

419
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,311
Who come on my show

420
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,407
Don't have a roster like a Cadre of weirdos

421
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
Those who do come on his show

422
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Pretty regularly

423
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
Who are all just like

424
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,551
On exactly the same pages

425
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,135
One of us yeah there's one

426
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,463
Google Google Google

427
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,559
I'm ready

428
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,631
Come on

429
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Skype in

430
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,703
From rooms

431
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,263
Bedrooms that look empty

432
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
I think you nailed

433
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,967
The pizza rolls are done shut up

434
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,783
Mommy I'm talking to Alex

435
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
And Trump have

436
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,719
Some sort of communication possibly it's waning

437
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
Altruism

438
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,071
The message we heard this speech

439
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
Open my message

440
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,167
4 over a decade

441
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:29,567
Laundromat from my music

442
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,455
Not quite so similar to what I say on the show don't you hear Trump say later

443
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,807
Okay and yes prep I was in Atlas Michelle told me but let's just move past all that

444
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Of course

445
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:46,463
Classic

446
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
That's not a lie

447
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,911
I don't think it's a lie either when he was on when Trump was on Alex

448
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,239
Yeah and he's

449
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
He said that Alex's record has been

450
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,871
Spectacular make his is history of

451
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
The other things

452
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
The other thing that I think is really scary

453
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
Is I don't think

454
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Keep that much wrong

455
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
About

456
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,807
Trump giving his message

457
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
Nope like

458
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
Trump is

459
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Pulling from that

460
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
That kind of Playbook there

461
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,232
Which is the most frightening

462
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
As yet we have to illuminate

463
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
The things that are being said

464
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
Onvisource

465
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,472
Are now president actually believe

466
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,288
He really does this over and over

467
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Various States

468
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Intoxication

469
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,200
Will talking to friends I really sincerely think that people who haven't

470
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,528
At all dwelled in weird parts of the internet are about to be

471
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Be very surprised

472
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
Why what happen

473
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
Because some of our leaders

474
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
And some of their advisors

475
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,952
Are beholden to

476
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
Or incredulous of

477
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
Really fatty dumb

478
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Conspiracies

479
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,912
And the consequences could be sack

480
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,216
Well and it's also because

481
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
Of that isolation

482
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:07,104
Where they're in their own world

483
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
There's that constant

484
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
Feedback loop

485
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,760
Especially like with Alex Jones where he says

486
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:19,392
Infowars.com then one of his crazy colors

487
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
Also

488
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,744
One of those crazy colors as being

489
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
People are talking about this

490
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,424
People it's not literally alive but it's spiritually alive

491
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,008
Inauguration went off

492
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
Another

493
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
You're old

494
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,920
Tunks there were also a lot of very important people there may be people who are oppressed

495
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,224
Maybe people who are rich

496
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
Yeah

497
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,136
We're here this is a giant victory for Humanity it is massive looking at Michelle

498
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
Mama

499
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,488
Ultron

500
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,304
When they were singing the Star Spangled Banner

501
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:04,960
Obama with that miracles

502
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:10,336
Call Timbers putting Power by the globalist

503
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:18,784
They're absolutely evil skins for people not to have a future it's why he goes to Africa and says

504
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
Cars rare condition air it was

505
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,904
Because because literally there to hurt people

506
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,000
Across-the-board

507
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,048
Donald Trump right now

508
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,352
Phone calls

509
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,632
Jobs

510
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,936
Detroit jobs Atlanta

511
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
Sue

512
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,288
Well one

513
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,920
Fear there was we were going into a real racist

514
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,064
Transphobic

515
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,464
You showed a little bit of restraint

516
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,328
In your face

517
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09,728
I actually went pulled the clip from Obama's speech that he gave that that keeps

518
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:14,592
Black people in poor people in foreign countries can't have cars please enjoy

519
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,152
Hurley from Obama's speech

520
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
That is being misrepresented work

521
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
I am

522
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
Africa

523
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,856
Work together

524
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
Define Waze

525
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
In which

526
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
Collectively

527
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
We reduced carbon

528
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
We make sure that

529
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
There's some differentiation so that

530
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
Countries that are very wealthy

531
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,984
Are expected to do more

532
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
And

533
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Countries

534
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
That

535
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
Are still developing

536
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,128
Obviously

537
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Mission Beach

538
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,456
Resign to Poverty simply because

539
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
The Western Europe in

540
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
America got there first

541
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,440
That wouldn't be fair but everybody's going to have to do something

542
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,256
Everybody's going to have to make

543
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,304
Some important choices here

544
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
And

545
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,936
Expected duration that helps leave this because

546
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,728
Is going to be your generation

547
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,264
That suffers the most

548
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,896
Ultimately if you think about all the youth that everybody's mentioned here in Africa

549
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,992
Raising living standards

550
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Everybody's got air conditioning

551
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
Well the platter will boil over

552
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,976
Is a producing energy

553
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,400
Absolutely

554
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,216
Positive of Alex Jones being a

555
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Interested in the truth

556
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
I'm being just a complete liar

557
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,592
Oh yeah you build a fake narrative

558
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Voice

559
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,432
Obama voice so bad around

560
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
I love him

561
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
There's there's

562
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,576
Citizens I have about Obama

563
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,856
Especially regarding

564
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,904
Drone Warfare crazy

565
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
So many

566
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
So many prisoners of

567
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,584
Political memes

568
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Not even

569
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,632
You know

570
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,472
Which is the right

571
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
There's no problem

572
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,800
God dammit

573
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Trying so

574
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
F****** hard

575
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
To make

576
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,688
The best decision available to

577
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,760
They have it every time

578
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,296
In a minute

579
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Of audio

580
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
He's able to lay out a problem

581
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
Show both sides of it

582
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,232
I'm say where the consideration

583
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
We have a problem with carbon

584
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
Consumption and it's causing

585
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
Global issues

586
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
And it's not

587
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
Your fault

588
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,824
Of course not

589
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
If everybody used

590
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,968
Carbon emissions

591
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
But if we

592
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,064
If we roll back

593
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,624
You're still the one most

594
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
Yeah

595
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
We're trying

596
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
To do more of our part B

597
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
We did more of the day

598
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,816
And within that clip

599
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
Even clearly says

600
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
You know

601
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
We have to find a way

602
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,472
Do not resign you to poverty

603
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,520
And not completely destroyed

604
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,288
The society

605
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,080
But we have built already

606
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
So it's

607
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:32,736
If you mean the thing that makes sense

608
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
It's f****** insanity

609
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,040
It's

610
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,136
Saying that Obama hates poor people

611
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Or the Trump is

612
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,464
Trying to bring jobs back

613
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
Obama

614
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
Brought all the jobs back

615
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,216
With the auto bailout whenever it was so close to all of those places just being like

616
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Well

617
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,264
GM is gone

618
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
Yeah like it was

619
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,080
Very close to that

620
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,664
No point in time does anybody ever give him

621
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
The credit of being the guy who

622
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Forced that

623
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
And again

624
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,880
Well the end result of me not doing this

625
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
More abhorrent to my principal

626
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:17,024
Then saying like let's not bail out these businesses that made bad decisions

627
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,840
Which is why the

628
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
Where are you

629
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,312
I don't know

630
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,384
Another another fun clip

631
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,296
Is a little towards the middle starts with an O

632
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
I'd like to remind you

633
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
It's the tistic

634
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
I can

635
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
Can confirm for you that

636
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,696
60%

This is indicative of

641
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:00,032
Awakening that is happening on a planetary scale not just here so

642
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
This revolutionary ilysm

643
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
This revolution is globalism

644
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,992
Trump said that

645
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,784
This revolution is about you

646
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,344
You are watching powers that you are the future

00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,904
We're going to get out of your way and let

As America goes the rest of world go

651
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,400
Washington envisioned all of this

Farewell address

Stool horrible deal the idea of Americans Providence in manifest destiny

657

All of the Sears and talk about the problems and crimes associated problems

658
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:03,008

661
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
A system so

662
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,064
Is an anti-human Eugenics bass technocracy system

663
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:20,160
But that's almost like a Philip K Dick's locked

664

What is the ballast

665
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
Human eugenics

Technically

Saying that we're going to turn tablets chimeras are real

668
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
People into computers

What's the singularity my friend

670
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,104
I mean that's common

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,504
Walmart hours

672
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,624
That's about abortion at Planned Parenthood

673
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,720
Text Chrissy I believe is about to have a singularity

674

Are growing Reliance on a surveillance state

675
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,168
That's that's fine

676
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,216
I don't know what the

677
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,008
I guess the anti-human part is just you

678
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
So they are satanic

679
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
Goes with the

680
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,968
Here's where we're going to here's where we're going to get into another

681
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Thing right there

682
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,368
Is there any Christian principle he adheres

683
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Other than

684
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
Didn't saying he's a

685
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:31,328
I mean it depends on one of the big one

686
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,864
That's one of the big ones

687
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
He doesn't honor his father because

688
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
He claims that he

689
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,384
He lies about his dad's Battlefield

690
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,432
Now

691
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,504
First like movies has to come from his dad but

692
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:55,648
Chimera

693
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:01,024
That's that's a possibility but I don't actually know too much about his mom I feel like it might be in Port A

694
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
To do research about

695
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
His family

696
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,472
Invoked by him I have no interest in knowing about cuz it seems like

697
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
Not fair game is son to the extent that he is an Infowars reporter

698
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,456
But I don't want to make fun of him cuz he's a kids

699
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,504
His dad

700
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
Because he is

I don't know I don't think so

705
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
This is

706
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,072
Please be made I don't have a clip of it but

707
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
The Infowars

708
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,888
On the last episode when we found out

709
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
They're selling body armor

710
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,728
I predicted that they're going to start start selling guns

711
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,288
I am now they have started telling cantar

712
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,200
14 hour broadcast if they're selling AR-15s

713
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
Team lowers

714
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,528
Which is the central piece of an AR-15

715
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,832
Which is the gun that is most commonly used

716
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,112
In mass shooting

717
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,184
Shooting which is really problematic

718
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:10,400
Kind of anti-human right now I was on the traces we keep making

719
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,192
Technocracy is probably

720
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,728
Better than a

721
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,056
Gun based like I don't know man

722
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
The bunch of crazy

That human

There's always exceptions to rules are some grapes

732
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,472
Yeah I think it was rated one of the problems that I had with edit

733
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
And that is

734
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
This

735
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Speech

Uninterrupted talking

738
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
Wow

739
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
For a breath for like 10 minutes

740
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
And he's just a verbal jazz

741
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Yeah

742
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
And I don't know where

743
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
Barely a little

744
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024

God

753
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,904

The American system is too much competition for them they admit that the white paper

The British government 200 years ago

766
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,920
The British are throwing off globalism

00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,680
You paying around that Audience by the way and there is like

772
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,728
98%

773
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,544
We do get some interviews a little bit later in these clips

774
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:03,200
He manages to find the one black guy who's there tokenism a representative idea is

775
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,272
So disappointing people later

776
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,856
And one of them is a black preacher

777
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
And the other is

778
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,696
And Incredibly angry Indian

779
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
What's the weather I think he's under house arrest

780
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
Nuts

781
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
He said that is

782
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,288
Is actually true which is that

783
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
The

784
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,616
Middle class has been

785
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
Taken away

786
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,456
There's no

787
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Reasoning

788
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,880
Poop like the people who have

789
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
Taking it away

790
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,208
Are the ones who are in control of the White House

791
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
And the Congress

792
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,792
And eventually the Supreme Court

793
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,328
Yeah

794
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
It's people who are in business who have done

795
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
Yeah who did it on purpose

796
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Those people

797
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
Will drive me insane

798
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
You have a billion dollars

799
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
Wealth and influence

800
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
Billion dollars

801
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,712
In 22 billion dollars or 1.2

802
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:12,576
2 billion dollars quick what to do any of this other than this

803
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,856
Weird sociopath

804
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
Greedy

805
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
Like mental illness

806
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,952
I think what it is is that

807
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,768
People who are really rich now a lot of them are

808
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,560
Super jealous of old money

809
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:26,144
There's an old money and I think the people believe

810
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,216
This is the kind of an assumption on my part I'm not I don't have any

811
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
Facts about this up

812
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
But I know that

813
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,080
New money is kind of scoffed at as opposed to

814
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,176
Do people who are like the Rockefellers

815
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,992
Yeah and I think that these billionaire Folk

816
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
They're like

817
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,064
Enough money

818
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
Next generation will be old

819
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,976
Yeah there's an idea that they could become the new old money

820
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:54,560
Well and I do think there is that are is kind of some of that

821
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:00,960
Right now where I'm there are upward Mobility look down on those Silicon Valley

822
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,592
You still going to wear a hoodie

823
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
Get out of here

824
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
Without a mask

825
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:20,160
Ladies and gentlemen

826
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,208
Turn it up

827
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,304
White person

828
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,680
You can't have guns private property or future you don't have the American Birthright

829
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,240
You don't have a future of wealth

830
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,544
That's your enemy that's racist

831
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
Programming

832
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,432
All the globalist

833
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,088
Poorest country in Africa

834
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:53,184
Play the Christians off against you know the animals for the Muslims or vice versa

835
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:58,816
Divide and conquer because the elite are destroying nation-states are trying to make the 4th

836
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,840
That's true

837
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
Cool hundred percent true

838
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:09,056
Well we

839
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,336
Does a blanket term

840
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,176
Just going by post-reconstruction

841
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,456
Reconstruction Era South

842
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,248
How do you get

843
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:28,512
Poor people fight with each other perfect

844
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:33,632
This is one of those weird whenever Alex is talking bulshit we kind of have to stop it

845
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:40,032
Point Pleasant

846
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:46,432
Agree with your diagnosis

847
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
How to treat it or what caused

848
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,320
You're describing a problem but everything else around it is

849
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,648
Wackadoo

850
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,792
How did we not come up with a Capricorn

851
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:07,168
I can't even keep track of how many we done

852
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,192
Is it kind of

853
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
Lose a little bit of

854
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,336
Where

855
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,408
Yeah but

856
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
Here we go

857
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
America

858
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,368
Died basically in the last few years it was a globalist program bushes and Clinton's behind it

859
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,416
With criminal elements the intelligence agency

860
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
But

861
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:34,048
Resurrection

862
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,864
But my country can come back

863
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,912
From the dead in America

864
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:45,568
Come back from the dead come back to life

865
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,872
Phoenix

866
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,152
How

867
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:54,272
Powerful that Phoenix is incredible that Destiny is you talk to us

868
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:59,648
We are what breathes life into the spirit get into us and the enemy knows everything's energy

869
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:05,280
Forget all the religious books and all the all the stuff

870
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,096
Monster destroy our spirit

871
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,776
We're taking

872
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:20,128
And those devil-worshipers up they're the enemy

873
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,688
Obama devil worshippers well now

874
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:32,416
Okay what's my prosperian Renaissance

875
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,208
Play 112 cornucopia

876
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,768
Somebody's got a big house or good-looking wife

877
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:40,864
Provide person as long as you don't race pace car

878
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,216
Devil worshippers and what happened today for

879
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,824
Beat the chief executive invited God back in and said the doors open

880
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,919
Genocide of the people the doors open now to you if you want this Birthright

881
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
If you want goodness

882
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,271
We've all got to be good we got to come together

883
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,295
And we've got a

884
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:05,695
What is your black card white people white people

885
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,767
What we believe in all the control

886
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,071
Did

887
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
He definitely didn't invoke

888
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,079
God or Providence

889
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:27,455
Overtures towards Jesus all of the all of the

890
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
Could not listen

891
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,319
Intuit

892
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:36,159
Like I just couldn't do it but I did see a couple of those like

893
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:40,767
The list of words that have never been said in a in a naughty Ranch

894
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,607
There was no message of Hope

895
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,679
And yes we can there was pure like

896
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:54,079
This country is turning into a monstrous nightmare all going to die

897
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:58,943
We're all day

898
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,551
You know we talked about confirmation bias a bunch

899
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,855
On the show and I think it is one of those things

900
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,903
Other logical fallacy

901
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Beholden to

902
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
And one of them is

903
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
Actually I think it's still just got

904
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,351
You believe whatever you want to believe

905
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,167
And you read into things whatever you want to read into

906
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,775
Hey so if you go up there and vaguely mentioned religion

907
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:30,175
He's brought God back we have to

908
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
Just a radical Islam

909
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,111
Victory.com

910
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,975
We have to say it or else we

911
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,255
We can't tackle it

912
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
It's such b*******

913
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,095
They use these precise words

914
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
So what if someone does say

915
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
Radical Islam

916
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
It becomes code for

917
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:59,359
Argument for Trump only briefly mentioning it

918
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
Is like

919
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,455
He can't stay directly otherwise

920
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,015
I think it was

921
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:06,783
The CIA

922
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,391
He said or no doubt it was it was one of the previous

923
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
He was like

924
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,231
We're going to take Dad radical Islam

925
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
You have to say it

926
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
You just have to say the words

927
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,983
Did Alex Jones you say

928
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,775
It's all energy

929
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:32,383
Oh yeah he just said it wrong

930
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,431
You left the Christian train

931
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,527
I was just like heck man guy is real of the Earth

932
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,623
How do you rather

933
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:49,023
You remember when the bubble is up here

934
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,823
It will get your Kundalini Rising

935
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:08,991
Water filtration devices

936
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:12,575
You know the fluoride in the water calcifies your pineal gland

937
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,183
I'm not a hundred percent sure that's bulshit

938
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:21,791
Might just be something I read on some weird hippie webcam

939
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,583
I'm not I'm not too worried about Krista

940
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:28,959
A little bit of a straw about Russia

941
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
Which is kind of fun

942
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,055
To give you some sort of a little bit of a setup

943
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:36,127
Maxine Waters was being interviewed auntie

944
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,455
TV on an active democratic

945
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,295
I'm not at otherwise.

946
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
Never going to make the right song

947
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,879
She gives bad interview

948
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
Is the problem

949
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,255
Things in ways that are really easy to attack

950
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
As you become

951
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,559
Like sort of

952
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,607
Lightning rod

953
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
For Republican

954
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
Quiet she ends up being attacked on

955
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
Dumb drama

956
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,383
Yeah recently she was talking about how

957
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
If

958
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
Comes out

959
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
That

960
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
The Russian

961
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,551
Things were Consulting with Trump about his

962
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
Campaign

963
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,111
And how to frame thing

964
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159
Like saying that Hillary is crooked

965
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,695
And sayings

966
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
She's sick

967
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,511
Send these should be impeachable of

968
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
Is that

969
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
Calitris

970
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:32,959
I feel like anytime boys on the cob

971
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,031
Influences the election

972
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,311
Specifically in the definition

973
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
No treason

974
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,615
That's a good

975
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:46,015
Point the very specifically Define what it is I don't think it may actually be a committed other treason

976
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:51,391
This one is absolutely

977
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,951
For the way she was setting it up

978
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,487
It's very clear if you go watch the clip

979
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,511
If

980
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,303
We find out that this is

981
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
McKay's

982
00:46:59,327 --> 00:46:59,839
Then

983
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
That isn't

984
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,679
What is a perfectly logical statement

985
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
Study Tagalog

986
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
Formal logic

987
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,503
Can college at the University of Missouri

988
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,087
Veterinary logic

989
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,671
So

990
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,743
The problem is

991
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:32,095
Instead of saying if we find that he was Consulting with Russia then we'd

992
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Stacked on that

993
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,471
She used to Pacific examples like if the Crooked Hillary came from them

994
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,055
Because

995
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:45,663
We know the tricks that Alex plays

996
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
Accusing

997
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:51,039
Russia of coming up with crooked Hillary

998
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,831
He even has played the clip

999
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,623
On the show and then attacked

1000
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,671
Have you like that's not what she said

1001
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,463
It's insane

1002
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,047
Yeah it's a little bit

1003
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:06,655
Incredible straw man fallacy arguing

1004
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:15,615
Russian spy

1005
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:26,623
You can have your own ideas you can have a strong leader

1006
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,647
Russian

1007
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,487
The reason Trump got elected and everything come from the Russian

1008
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,943
You like that

1009
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,271
I think they're over Mike

1010
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
Because

1011
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,719
Would be like 75

1012
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,999
How is marriage

1013
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,047
What would a

1014
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:12,191
I would estimated it like 75

1015
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
Proud

1016
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,823
It's maybe like three deep

1017
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,943
I'm kind of in the round

1018
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,247
Do you think he's doing Shakespeare in the round

1019
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Circling

1020
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,319
Alex sharks

1021
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,367
Like he's the nucleus of this

1022
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Weird Adam

1023
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,719
New York Times

1024
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,487
I don't think so

1025
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,791
I don't know cuz I

1026
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,095
Nexus I'm not going to be able to

1027
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,399
I'm not be able to try in like search

1028
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:46,239
Through all of their articles

1029
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:52,383
The Russians and crooked Hillary but I know that I know what Maxine Waters said and he's misrepresenting that

1030
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,687
He's also lying

1031
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
Here is

1032
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
Here is the

1033
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
The next question there

1034
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,087
Also God I love

1035
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,111
Nothing

1036
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,183
Alright that's a little bit

1037
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:09,535
A little bit right on the cusp

1038
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
I think it's

1039
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,911
Clear that Russia did influence the election

1040
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,191
In some

1041
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Fashion

1042
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,751
To what extent

1043
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:19,775
Don't know

1044
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,567
Debatable

1045
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,431
What legitimate effects

1046
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,967
Certain things they did

1047
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,527
I think it's almost undeniable at this point that

1048
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,319
They were in contact with Trump

1049
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,367
I think they were operatives

1050
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:38,975
Multiple people who are very close

1051
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,999
Reconnected with Trump

1052
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,047
Are literally under investigation

1053
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
Yeah

1054
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,423
They have they say they have communicated

1055
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,191
Vape juice

1056
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:54,079
If you're if you're the CIA or the NSA

1057
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,919
And you have the information potentially nest

1058
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,943
Necessary to

1059
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,479
I'd like

1060
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,271
Undeniably impeached

1061
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,039
Yeah

1062
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,343
How can you not release that

1063
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:09,439
I think you'd have to wait until he was actually inaugurated so we might

1064
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,743
See some of that happened now

1065
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,583
Well because if it happened before he was inaugurated we enter

1066
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,911
Tucson crepe

1067
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:25,311
Election do we have a new president

1068
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,895
Select

1069
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:34,783
At the end of the day you enter a bigger crisis necessarily than

1070
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
Do you need

1071
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,831
Where is afib

1072
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
It is true

1073
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,391
That they have this evidence

1074
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415
He's compromised

1075
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,487
They maybe they do maybe they don't I don't know

1076
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,607
Through the channels we already have

1077
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,887
Here's my next Quest

1078
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,679
Is there any

1079
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,471
Benefit for the GOP

1080
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,311
Leggett funeral

1081
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,615
If you're in the GOP

1082
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,639
You got

1083
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,919
The absolute best

1084
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,711
Scenario

1085
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,247
In that you have an

1086
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,783
Easily impeachable on

1087
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,807
Uncontrollable

1088
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,343
As your president

1089
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,135
With a vice president who is

1090
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,927
You actually want in the present

1091
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
Hates women

1092
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,535
He doesn't hate women but he wants them to never have

1093
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,559
Control over their own bodies

1094
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,655
Yeah I would never say that

1095
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,983
Is like the idea of is there anything

1096
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,519
The game by not doing it

1097
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:31,615
You're you're you're sort of touching on the same thing that Trump and Alex Jones have

1098
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,687
Alex's outlived his usefulness to Trump

1099
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,247
And if it

1100
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:41,855
Did the Jeep now the only issue with that is the drug does have a sizable

1101
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,647
Of weirdos

1102
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:50,047
Yes but if you are the GOP and you sign off on this impeachment proceeding

1103
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,839
Elections

1104
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,375
Everybody

1105
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,423
Doesn't show up for you

1106
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,959
The everything swings

1107
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,983
Either

1108
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,567
Weird Fringe libertarian or Democrat

1109
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,591
Emmanuel

1110
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,615
Completely lost

1111
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,639
All of your blood

1112
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,431
CorePower

1113
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,967
That's the usefulness he has

1114
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,247
In that like there's a

1115
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,783
The threat to going against

1116
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,575
But there's no upside

1117
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,623
Other than avoiding that threat

1118
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,183
Which end if you if you

1119
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,743
If you can even put together like a

1120
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
Based understanding of what they're going

1121
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
Things to do in the next

1122
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
2 years

1123
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
How can you

1124
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,679
You possibly imagine that they're going to

1125
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
Attain their majority

1126
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,823
I think it would be impossible

1127
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:38,175
Worse

1128
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,735
That could be the

1129
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
Do you like

1130
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,319
Now we're not talking about a 48

1131
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,343
Voter turnout

1132
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
Nope

1133
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,975
Some real s***

1134
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,511
A lot of other countries

1135
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:58,911
I have the ability to vote no confidence in your leaders you have a prime minister or president

1136
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
Job

1137
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,447
People can just

1138
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:03,775
Introduce measures to be like you should get out

1139
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:07,359
And we don't have that that we should

1140
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,175
Introduce that

1141
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,967
The ability to vote no,

1142
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,015
Because if we have that now

1143
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,295
He be gone

1144
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,647
That kind of separation

1145
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,671
Power is element

1146
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,951
Where in

1147
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,743
If you have a congress

1148
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,279
Like the one we have

1149
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
Completely controlled by one

1150
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
Imagine

1151
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
Situation where is Aldi

1152
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,215
And a republic

1153
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,239
President

1154
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,311
Confidence and all of a sudden

1155
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,335
The Democrats

1156
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,103
Control

1157
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Everything

1158
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,407
Or one-party can

1159
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,175
Controls

1160
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,991
But the vote of no confidence isn't done by the people in the

1161
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,271
The Senate is done by

1162
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,295
Like a general election

1163
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:53,439
I'm not sure that that's not how that works

1164
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,719
I mean in the UK

1165
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,743
Which is the other

1166
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,511
Like Maine

1167
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,583
I believe in

1168
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
I'm not sure

1169
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,423
Concocting something but doesn't

1170
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:06,751
I hate

1171
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,519
You know what time it is

1172
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,311
What time is it

1173
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:16,479
You know my favorite thing in the world is Alex and also

1174
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,783
My second favorite thing is him fake crying

1175
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,551
Okay

1176
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:27,999
History happening right now is get this network brake and and David not intrude upon whenever they want here but I'm going to go get settled down

1177
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,839
Take a shower so just get on my knees and pray to God

1178
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
Oh there it is

1179
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:44,639
Call we got to be ready but we know who they are

1180
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:51,039
Yogurtland it's been Infowars people

1181
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
You hear that

1182
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,623
Oh yeah

1183
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
And that's what

1184
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,927
Kicked him out of his fake crying

1185
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:57,951
Yeah

1186
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,743
That's what got him to be like

1187
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,535
Oh crab turning

1188
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:08,191
That's my favorite thing in the world he is so over-the-top with his

1189
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,495
Least wants to do is get into a room by himself

1190
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,031
Oh yeah yeah

1191
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,311
Ya RAB do

1192
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,103
If he doesn't get that attention

1193
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,919
Then he's really going to spiral into a into a depression

1194
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,479
Fallen Brown everywhere

1195
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:25,087
On suicide watch

1196
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,879
He is finally doing some

1197
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,927
Introspective

1198
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,719
In a long long

1199
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:36,095
I kind of imagined it being like Rob do is falling around taking the bottle of wild turkey

1200
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,935
That's that's kind of how I picture it like

1201
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,983
I get back on the air come on

1202
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,287
He's on like babysitting

1203
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,823
Patrol

1204
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,991
Do this if it starts right after that one

1205
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,015
The fake crying is great

1206
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,319

All of mouses

We are the blueprint of the operating system

1214
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:31,391

00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,431
Brutal he's very humble though

1219
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:59,039
I will say that

1220
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:05,951
Attributes my humility stands for

1221
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,535
The most humble person

1222
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,375
Going for a job interview

1223
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:17,727
Too good

1224
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
Hard worker

1225
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:22,591
So now at this point in his ramble

1226
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,359
In front of these

1227
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,895
270 people

1228
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,431
Who are overly Mike

1229
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:27,967
Someone

1230
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,039
Who may be from another press organization

1231
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,855
Question

1232
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
You might be

1233
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,183
Are we going to commit to the

1234
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,791
I don't tip my hat about who he is cuz they

1235
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,095
Maybe a little bit of Crossmark

1236
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:50,751
Russia's population

1237
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:54,079
Call Jennifer strong

1238
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,383
Hot tub by Trump

1239
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,431
Good we have the tools

1240
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:04,831
We have the history we got the pedigree we got it all everybody here is a morse

1241
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,399
Really

1242
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:23,519
Play the word Trump Tower the people and let them know you are this revolution

1243
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,055
Yep

1244
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Breitbart

1245
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,383
And the question was

1246
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,687
Did Trump really lay the wood to him

1247
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,759
That's a post

1248
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,807
Game question to like

1249
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:45,023
I just want to thank the president

1250
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
Yeah his name is Trump

1251
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:52,703
But I need laid it all out there on the diet serially less it left it in

1252
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,471
You know

1253
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,495
Girl's hands

1254
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,519
Yeah yeah

1255
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,359
Give me the

1256
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:02,687
Yeah f****** Breitbart Christ comes up

1257
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:06,783
Strategist of the White House should have a say in who

1258
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,087
Alex Jones

1259
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,879
Maybe drunk on the street

1260
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:18,559
So he allows Breitbart couple questions that are all like really like their meatballs

1261
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,399
Knockout a park like

1262
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,287
When I go to church

1263
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,615
Are we talking ice cream I don't need that anymore

1264
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
Do I take

1265
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:40,063
Superman ice cream ice cream

1266
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,927
Another question about the spirituality

1267
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,999
What's going on also from the Breitbart reporter

1268
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:53,119
Very spiritual speech unlike a lot of the rallies pages that I tweeted

1269
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,679
Going to invoke

1270
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,239
Probably about the Covenants

1271
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,263
I need it

1272
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:05,663
Because they all understand

1273
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:09,247
Got out. Let us feel empowered not let us know about America's destiny

1274
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,831
That narrative

1275
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:18,719
Globalist beautiful psychological abuse it gives us a culture unify

1276
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:25,119
Killing our culture

1277
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,543
The second phase of slavery just fell today

1278
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,871
Progressive the future they call themselves the progressive

1279
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,175
They're the opposite they're not the progressive

1280
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
And that's what the Democrats

1281
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,575
Were called what

1282
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,367
Was the French Revolution party

1283
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,159
They wanted to regress everything

1284
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:55,327
What you're seeing here is a real Renaissance I know you're seeing here is the real 1776

1285
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,935
George Washington quotes

1286
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:03,775
Guard against the imposters of pretended patriotism

1287
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,311
Interesting

1288
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,591
10% quotes

1289
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,919
Quote if the freedom of speech is taken away then dumb and

1290
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,455
And silently maybe LED

1291
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:16,575
Like sheep to the slaughter

1292
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:25,023
In the last week or so Alex has also been up on this like I add a calendar

1293
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,303
Today's word is Providence

1294
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,191
Arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of Liberty reviews to licentiousness

1295
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,263
Bingo

1296
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,919
I really do but this is George

1297
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:48,319
The two point out a calendar event Providence

1298
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:53,183
Birthright loves Rhode Island and then also the other one is

1299
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
Even talk about

1300
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,535
The Jacobin party for like the last few days

1301
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,375
Nope

1302
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,423
It does he have any idea what happened next

1303
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,983
Does he know about the terror

1304
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,567
You know he does not he doesn't know about that stuff

1305
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:12,127
But what he doesn't know is that no one else does

1306
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:17,759
People listening don't know like a sort of

1307
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,063
You know what sounds like Lutheran

1308
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:25,439
The kind of it has that religious feel too as a religious feel you can talk about The Maccabees

1309
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:29,023
And stuff like that you don't want knows what you're referring to

1310
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:32,351
You can talk about like and that's why a lot of these pseudo-religious

1311
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,399
People who scream talk about like

1312
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,679
The Book of Enoch

1313
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:40,799
Agnostics never read this stuff they don't actually know what these being saved

1314
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,567
But they know that

1315
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,359
People that talking to don't eat

1316
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,407
And it's the same thing with the Jacobins.

1317
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,199
The Guyver the Democrats come from

1318
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,271
Not really no

1319
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:54,111
Do you have any information about the jacket

1320
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,415
As far as

1321
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:59,743
The timeline of the French Revolution

1322
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,815
With a good idea

1323
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:14,847
And then it further ends with an autocratic dictator

1324
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:19,199
A warlock

1325
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,479
Yes

1326
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:22,783
Progressive

1327
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,807
Straight

1328
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,903
African-American shows up

1329
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,279
He's got a great hat on

1330
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,303
Also

1331
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
Look

1332
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,911
No

1333
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:39,935
A gentleman

1334
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,471
Describe it

1335
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,495
Logout of madman

1336
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,311
Angiitis

1337
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,127
As well cuz that's the way you are

1338
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,175
As I recall he's got a full suit on

1339
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,967
Oh and a nice coat

1340
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,783
Looks great

1341
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
OK Google

1342
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,647
Yes sir

1343
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,719
God bless

1344
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,607
Marshalls

1345
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,887
You know what

1346
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,935
Today was the beginning of something new

1347
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,727
We've been waiting for this for a long time

1348
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,055
And in

1349
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,615
Was that our president is putting back

1350
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,895
America first

1351
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,479
We've been compromising we've been putting everybody else second

1352
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,295
Politically correct

1353
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,111
A&R prison said America

1354
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,647
Has nothing wrong with any other country

1355
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,743
So we're going to

1356
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:39,327
Put on focus on

1357
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:45,471
Iran education today was that I present

1358
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:51,871
Right in the Bible

1359
01:05:54,687 --> 01:06:00,831
We can't do anything without God

1360
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:07,999
Today out of all the different agendas and so forth was putting God first

1361
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:14,399
Everything else be added to its encourage today we're starting over today

1362
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:20,543
So one of the things that I think is really fascinating is when your team says something about God

1363
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,359
It's like this is a sign that God is coming back

1364
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:26,943
But when the opposite side says

1365
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,247
Falsely pretending to be

1366
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,551
The word of God is a weapon

1367
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
Brilliance of

1368
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:37,695
The Bible is that you can kind of say whatever the f*** you want

1369
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,767
Like it even even in the evenin what is

1370
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,303
Is it the Old Testament where it says

1371
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,607
The devil can quote the Bible as well

1372
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,655
Like it's all just

1373
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:47,935
Any reference of

1374
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,335
It's really the devil

1375
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,639
But also

1376
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,455
Who's the thing that always drive me up a f****** wall

1377
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,479
Is that

1378
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,527
If you

1379
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:06,367
Fiat Fiat

1380
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,671
People who are religious

1381
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,719
Refuse to acknowledge

1382
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,511
That one of the big

1383
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,791
Parts of Jesus

1384
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,095
Is that he undid the old cover

1385
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:20,703
The old Covenant in the Old Testament is no invoice

1386
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,495
Welcome

1387
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,567
Genuinely had that conversation where they're like

1388
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,871
Maybe we should just get rid of the old

1389
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:32,991
If there it's important as maybe a historical document is one of the

1390
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:33,759
Great

1391
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:40,415
Like what is like a Philip K Dick's alternate-history of what if we got rid of the Old Testament

1392
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,279
Like the

1393
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:49,631
World is a much better place

1394
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,167
An eye for an eye is

1395
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,447
Replaced by turn the other cheek

1396
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,519
Yeah if you'd only use the teachings of Jesus

1397
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,591
You are in a better State problems

1398
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,615
Ford gospel

1399
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,151
You're in a much better state

1400
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,991
The Epistles are all f*****

1401
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:15,487
Even taking those letters my review of

1402
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:19,327
On Amazon I give a one-star cuz Timothy was a dick

1403
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:23,423
If you take all those people who are really involved with building the early church

1404
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,239
Think about who those people would be nowadays

1405
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,519
They would be crazy

1406
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,823
They were crazy cult members

1407
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,103
2

1408
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,871
Wanted

1409
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,919
Power probably

1410
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,991
And they built the system wherein they could they could get some power

1411
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,015
Which was Within

1412
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,807
This burgeoning church

1413
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,159
The interesting thing about the

1414
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
That is

1415
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,975
It was the reverse of most cults

1416
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,815
Good

1417
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,375
And in this circumstance that is kind of like

1418
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,447
They were taking advantage of the fact that

1419
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
Jesus

1420
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
Preach

1421
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
Love

1422
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,823
Which everybody is on board

1423
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,871
Which might be why it was so

1424
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,175
Yeah well and also why it was so Danger

1425
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
Is because

1426
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,575
He was he was like maybe this

1427
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,647
Maybe this whole patriarchy with a

1428
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,183
You know

1429
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,743
There's some indications

1430
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,535
If you go into it and look through

1431
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
Historical records

1432
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,119
There's a decent chance that they might have gotten

1433
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
Their records

1434
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,215
Yeah I'm at the Jesus who was the rabbi

1435
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,263
Wasn't actually ever crucified

1436
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,543
It was another guy name

1437
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:37,663
And the director

1438
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:44,063
Iowa

1439
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,415
But there are a lot of experts believe that there were two Jesus

1440
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,951
Historically and they've been can

1441
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,719
Inflated into

1442
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:54,047
Yeah well and also the the Jesus

1443
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,351
The whole Miracle story is

1444
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,399
The same one that mithras had

1445
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:04,799
Like the whole thing is just a mish-mosh in a hodgepodge of all these other religions but if you take a lot of it

1446
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:07,615
Teaching

1447
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,431
You take the teaching

1448
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,199
Person dead

1449
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:18,111
Thomas Jefferson had a Bible

1450
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,159
Novel

1451
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:23,487
You take that out

1452
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:27,839
So this interview goes on a little bit more and it gets more and more religious

1453
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,911
I want to kill Trump

1454
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:36,543
The spirit is kasasa opened up is already Rising

1455
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,103
They're not going to stop at all the world country

1456
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:43,711
Berryville

1457
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,111
Perilous times

1458
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,791
We can no longer

1459
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:02,399
Go to hell

1460
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:09,055
Stand up for what is right

1461
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,711
Heritage

1462
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:25,183
Disagreement

1463
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,255
Agree to disagree

1464
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:37,215
Positions of that particular principal are

1465
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,287
American is taken

1466
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:46,175
American countries all around the world has been waiting on us

1467
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,247
Tradutor

1468
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:55,647
Rome

1469
01:11:55,903 --> 01:12:02,047
American Patriots stand against

1470
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,863
But this divisiveness is blocked

1471
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:11,263
This all this stuff

1472
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:18,175
Have you ever felt the spirit stronger

1473
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:25,855
I want to say a couple things stronger than that

1474
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,463
All of the spirit

1475
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,767
Really f****** up

1476
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:36,607
Really should be dependent on the president

1477
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:39,423
I would think not

1478
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,959
The couple things

1479
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,495
Opposition

1480
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,519
I'm self

1481
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:48,383
You saying that we should agree to disagree about stuff and look for the higher principle

1482
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,967
Just taking those words I agree that there's some value in that

1483
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,527
Can't do that when the other side

1484
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
Is

1485
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,575
Religiously-based

1486
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,951
You know you saw where that one

1487
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,999
White supremacist got punched

1488
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,815
Richard Spencer

1489
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:10,143
The violence of the protesters

1490
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
But there's

1491
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:16,287
He wasn't literal literal

1492
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:22,943
He's advocating for genocide

1493
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,247
About it and I think they're both equally valid

1494
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,295
Amazingly cathartic

1495
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,367
And I can't lie I watch that clip like 15.

1496
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,671
I also see

1497
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,207
The

1498
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:34,975
Bad off

1499
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,023
Pics of it I see that like it's

1500
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:43,423
Just because you disagree with someone you disagree with them intensely it doesn't mean you should have salt

1501
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,239
I don't think that person did anything wrong

1502
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:48,543
But I probably wouldn't have done it myself

1503
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:53,151
No I would I would

1504
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
I'm not a violin

1505
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,223
Dude by nature but then again

1506
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,807
He's a Nazi

1507
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,623
Yep there's no defense for now

1508
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,183
The defense for Nazi

1509
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,463
He's being allowed to

1510
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
He's not

1511
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,303
Being put in prison for espousing

1512
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,863
They're dumb belief

1513
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,143
That is freedom of speech

1514
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,423
You cannot

1515
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,471
Taking apart by the

1516
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,239
Government

1517
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:22,591
Yeah punched in the face for being a Nazi I'm cool with

1518
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,383
It kind of comes with

1519
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,199
The territory

1520
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,319
Just f******

1521
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
Straight up murdered

1522
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:41,023
Yeah

1523
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:41,791
From the first

1524
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,583
Clip

1525
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,631
Right before the last one

1526
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,983
It's time for America to

1527
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,055
Yeah he said it's okay if

1528
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,079
Everybody else put

1529
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:54,847
Themselves

1530
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,127
Because America's

1531
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
That for them

1532
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,479
Like single-most

1533
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,759
We're all going to

1534
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,039
Fight a war thing

1535
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
Can possibly stay

1536
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:08,927
If we all put ourselves first that I don't have you ever have international compromised

1537
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,719
Human first

1538
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,255
Yeah

1539
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,279
Vineyard

1540
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,071
You're literally going when you

1541
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,095
Come up against

1542
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,143
The other country to put them

1543
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:19,935
In any conflict

1544
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,751
Now there's always a zero-sum game

1545
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,287
Always

1546
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,823
Always even though

1547
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,919
That's going to wind up being more damaging to both party

1548
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:33,503
Well I think that the nobility of sacrifice has kind of been lost

1549
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
Fun people

1550
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,575
But like this

1551
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,111
You know the idea of like

1552
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:42,719
We can all play actually if they would just sit down and look at the

1553
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,743
The prisoner's dilemma

1554
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:48,095
I think they might actually be able to realize like Concepts

1555
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,679
Fall Apart

1556
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,495
See that they would have no con

1557
01:15:54,751 --> 01:16:00,895
What does the idea that sometimes collaboration is the best possible outcome brandano you individual

1558
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,711
Hollywood get more by turning your back on your partner

1559
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:09,599
It's it's insane to me that you aren't able to have these abstract thoughts of like we can all Do Better Together

1560
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,903
If we work together although it doesn't

1561
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
Appear that way

1562
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,975
Some horseshit

1563
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,279
This interview

1564
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:21,631
And I visit Alaska for this interview because I

1565
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,655
Interrupt him in

1566
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,191
Credibly rude way

1567
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:27,263
Oh no really funny

1568
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:31,871
Nevermind we'll get to we'll get to why I have an issue with him interrupting this

1569
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,639
Specific

1570
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,175
Person in this

1571
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:40,063
Because he's put a lot of restraint into that bottle of wild turkey

1572
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
Yeah

1573
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,535
To get that

1574
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,559
But the power was strong

1575
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,095
Power with Trump

1576
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,167
That might even be sacrilegious

1577
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
Yeah that's

1578
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:00,799
Well he's already said that it doesn't matter by religion

1579
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:03,103
That's true

1580
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:09,503
I want to take a break from the literal chronology

1581
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
Being drunk

1582
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:16,927
We need a little fun right about now screaming on the street after the deplorable

1583
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:21,535
Carroll Shelby

1584
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:25,887
Republic

1585
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:36,383
Republic

1586
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,431
A lot of the time whenever I go for it

1587
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,711
I don't think I've ever been

1588
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,015
Like if this level order

1589
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:47,647
Mixed with super male vitality

1590
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,207
I hate to call it a demon

1591
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,839
I think a big part of that

1592
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,607
Super male vitality

1593
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:57,887
Is probably

1594
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,471
And testosterone is something bad

1595
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:04,543
If you don't have control over testosterone

1596
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,359
Yeah

1597
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,919
I'll never be more glad that I probably have

1598
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,687
Tableautier

1599
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,247
Then when I watch him

1600
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:17,599
Passive by nature but it's like a way worse

1601
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,927
Well and that's why it always it always boggles my mind

1602
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,463
Whenever that

1603
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,231
Never

1604
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,279
And like all of the

1605
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,047
The things that

1606
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,839
Glorify High

1607
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,655
It's never come with like

1608
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,703
By the way this is also

1609
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
Thing where it's like

1610
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,495
Your supervisor

1611
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,543
Like I

1612
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,591
Pictures for

1613
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,615
Any of them

1614
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,943
What is hot what is fighting still allowed in hockey

1615
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,015
Because we all have to get out some kind of sublimated

1616
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:46,783
Testosterone

1617
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,183
Sports in general

1618
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:53,951
Created

1619
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:57,279
By the powers-that-be in order to mimic Warfare 2

1620
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,327
To take away our male energy

1621
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:00,863
I mean

1622
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:07,775
For the created by a nonsense thing that's kind of what sports are for like

1623
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:12,639
Also we don't have Gladiators killing each other is because we have football

1624
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,175
Football videos

1625
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,455
Will kill each other slowly

1626
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:18,015
It also said that Hitler was responsible for

1627
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:18,783
For popularizing

1628
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,879
Which I'm not sure if that's true but

1629
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,207
Berkeley true but the 1936 Olympics

1630
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,999
Were the ones

1631
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,023
Tire world

1632
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,071
Stood at attention

1633
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,351
But there's a big reason

1634
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,399
For that

1635
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,935
Reasons

1636
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:39,263
He's not done yelling

1637
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,407
1776 will commence again

1638
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,159
I know you do now.

1639
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,719
We haven't taken the gloves off

1640
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,743
And if you want to keep pushing

1641
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:01,791
Please everybody else

1642
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:03,839
Map

1643
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,423
All the secret weapons in the control you anymore are they

1644
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:11,775
They're now in the hands of George Washington 2.0

1645
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,311
So I know why you're taking

1646
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,616
That is a drunk man

1647
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,968
Shaking and fever

1648
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,528
He also if you watch the video he looks

1649
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,808
Wasted

1650
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,112
It's like he's got like a

1651
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:26,880
Is he wearing a

1652
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
Yeah but it's

1653
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,720
Appetizer

1654
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:34,816
He's just like he's the guy at the wedding who's waiting to f*** somebody and it's

1655
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:37,632
Not happening looks like he's out on Bourbon

1656
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,168
Street to

1657
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,984
That's really the vibe that the video has and it's like

1658
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,008
Maybe six

1659
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:47,360
People standing around and when he's just yelling at me

1660
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:53,504
Like it's he's doing the wrestling promo globalist

1661
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,576
You don't have the secret weapons anymore

1662
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:03,232
Yeah what secret was there secret about

1663
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:06,560
Knows about it bro because some caller told him about him

1664
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,376
So this one is a nice

1665
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,424
Between his two interviews

1666
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,448
What he does on the street

1667
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,472
Again

1668
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:16,032
This whole thing is supposed to be a breakdown of

1669
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,800
Speech

1670
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,336
It seems to just be turning into church

1671
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:21,920
Or at least a long rambling

1672
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,712
Yeah stream-of-consciousness

1673
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,480
Consciousness

1674
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:28,832
I don't really understand based on my

1675
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,672
Klipsch I really like I said

1676
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,440
Office what I'm trying

1677
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,744
This one is called got to be humble

1678
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,608
I'm not sure I'm not entirely sure

1679
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,656
That is his first track

1680
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,216
Above yeah

1681
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:51,360
Are there in studio

1682
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,808
Very special time

1683
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,368
Have to go back to 30 seconds

1684
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,136
Cuz it's worth it

1685
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:07,488
Very special time

1686
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:13,376
I missed it again no no no no funny

1687
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:19,008
Very special time professional outfit

1688
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:21,824
I missed again to go grab a bite to eat

1689
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,408
Take some notes got2breal hump

1690
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:32,576
What are you talkin about Willis on his wall

1691
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,624
A little bit of insight into his mind

1692
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,672
Be humble is on his checklist

1693
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:39,744
Internalize

1694
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:44,864
Which which I don't necessarily I don't necessarily find

1695
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,400
Because I don't think it is

1696
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,424
Like a

1697
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,448
An internal

1698
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:52,800
Like a dozen

1699
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,408
Virtues aren't really in

1700
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:00,992
I think I think there's work to be done but

1701
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:01,760
You

1702
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,296
Generally do the work

1703
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,576
It becomes second nature

1704
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,000
So humility deficient that he has to work on it real hard everyday

1705
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,280
Or it's new

1706
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,072
It's a new practice for her

1707
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,864
I would actually go with the

1708
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,424
Yeah probably he seems like

1709
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,960
The most humility to fishing

1710
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,728
Person

1711
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,008
It's it's

1712
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,312
Like his entire radio show itself

1713
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,336
Aggrandizing how he

1714
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,872
He gets everything 104

1715
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,152
True

1716
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,456
Like that whole that whole like

1717
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,784
How did you know

1718
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,832
The trumps cuz we're on the same page

1719
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:40,928
I'm always for Americana

1720
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:44,768
Yeah of course somebody who's always correct is following my PlayBook

1721
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,584
Self-aggrandizement

1722
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,608
To a ridiculous

1723
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:50,912
Express

1724
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:53,472
Literally what he says about why he's right all the time

1725
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:59,616
I understand I have the globalists Playbook I'm not predicting Things based on like

1726
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,896
Does random predict

1727
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:09,088
Centration Camp so just be randomly predict

1728
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,136
Yeah

1729
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:14,720
He's very humble and his own for a little bit

1730
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,488
Wacky

1731
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:18,048
Leanne

1732
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,912
Told it was getting ready.

1733
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,960
They were about to watch the full

1734
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:28,032
Total take over the media WrestleMania.

1735
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:33,408
Torturing

1736
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,992
Comic book

1737
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:45,952
DC movies you read history books

1738
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:52,352
Photos of

1739
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,496
My point is

1740
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,312
Crazy stuff going on

1741
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:05,664
He's employs about polonium

1742
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,480
The end of that

1743
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:15,136
Yep people were sneaking llamas in heaven

1744
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:29,472
Having somebody on the news say and

1745
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,200
I think about there's definitely better

1746
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:42,016
Mechanisms to get a bomb somewhere

1747
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,040
Funny Rebecca.

1748
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:52,512
Circle wizard

1749
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:59,936
From the Middle East to the United States you just flip her over sometime and I'll over

1750
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:02,496
Ask you this Jordan if you were to put a bomb in a llama

1751
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:06,592
Would you or would you make the Llama eat

1752
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,360
Beat the bomb

1753
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,456
Belong with Ethan

1754
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:16,320
Nobody would be there a funny visual

1755
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
With the surgery

1756
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:20,416
And if you're going to make

1757
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,976
Okay if you're going to make it easier Gogoat

1758
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:29,120
The way that they are digested is they're going to explode

1759
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:35,776
Right

1760
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:41,152
You Babble I was well you cut open the belly of the Llama you put the bomb in

1761
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,432
What up

1762
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,200
Hastily

1763
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:48,576
Sitting inside the flama for a long time

1764
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:55,232
With proper Veterinary experience

1765
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,024
The best

1766
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:00,608
False

1767
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:03,168
Flood Infowars the whole time

1768
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,752
Clear Isaac Alex was saying that as a

1769
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,032
The joke

1770
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:10,592
Identity actually was saying there's a bomb in a llama

1771
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:14,688
I think that he was pictures of llamas

1772
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:17,248
Cowardice I don't know

1773
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,296
But also

1774
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:21,600
The top hat he's been poisoned with polonium

1775
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,880
Let's f*** off

1776
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,928
Is the top hat like

1777
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:31,328
The the Mad Hatter situation where that's where is fancy dresser

1778
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:36,960
Use a little bit of a puss

1779
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:44,896
Salat

1780
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,176
I wanted to try and

1781
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,992
Figure out what the f*** was going on with the polonium

1782
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:53,088
Any mainstream possible sources

1783
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:59,488
In my research I learned

1784
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,768
Rodger Stone has been banned

1785
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,560
CNN and NBC

1786
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,352
And the reason

1787
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
It's kind of fun

1788
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
Okay

1789
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,448
He says it's because he supports

1790
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:10,496
Trump and because

1791
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:11,520
You know

1792
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:12,544
Used to conserve

1793
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,568
Tiffany knows the truth

1794
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,872
What is

1795
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:18,688
That over a. Of time

1796
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,224
He

1797
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:25,344
Caught calling various media personalities who work for CNN and MSNBC

1798
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,112
A quote

1799
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,416
An arrogant know-it-all negro

1800
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:31,744
A stupid negro negro

1801
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:38,144
A professional negro a mandingo

1802
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,960
Quota

1803
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:47,104
Set a big dick guy right or no

1804
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,456
That's very not good

1805
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,992
I also he referred to

1806
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:56,064
I would assume is Rachel Maddow but I don't know it doesn't

1807
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,600
Specifically say who he was talking about

1808
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,624
Please call someone

1809
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,648
The Muff Diver

1810
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:00,928
So

1811
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,696
Pretty good

1812
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,560
Grow

1813
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:10,144
People who work for those stations

1814
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,448
There's a good chance he is almost

1815
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,800
Freezing

1816
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:17,824
Some pictures of

1817
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,152
Rodger Stone shirtless looking like he's at

1818
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,688
Mardi Gras in Brazil

1819
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,760
It was a woman licking

1820
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,552
Otherwise he is a Snappy

1821
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,344
He is

1822
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,904
Various sources

1823
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,464
Perhaps it in d.c.

1824
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:38,816
Professional negro

1825
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,352
So awful

1826
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:46,752
And it's like a wide

1827
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:50,592
Like that

1828
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,616
Look

1829
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,920
Do you want to cut the budget and maybe bounce

1830
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,200
That's okay

1831
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,224
Do not

1832
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,504
Racist

1833
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,040
Yeah but also

1834
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,576
The other thing about that

1835
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,904
It's because you're a

1836
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,672
Conservative

1837
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:05,696
Then you are

1838
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:07,744
Conflating that racism

1839
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,024
With conserve

1840
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:13,888
So if you are going to catch that

1841
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,728
But if you

1842
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,752
Kicked off for saying

1843
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,544
And then say it's because you're

1844
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,408
Dozer

1845
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:32,064
You do the same thing

1846
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:32,832
That is

1847
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,904
Conservatism is racist

1848
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,464
Yeah according to Rogers.

1849
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:48,960
Wasn't Poisoned With polonium

1850
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,496
No there's no possible way

1851
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,520
No

1852
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,288
F******

1853
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:56,896
Possible way the only images that he's released that prove it it just looks like he has

1854
01:30:57,408 --> 01:31:01,760
Like it looks like there's a little bit of a pockmarked face

1855
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:05,344
Claim about that

1856
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:11,744
Register claim that he was poisoned

1857
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,512
Is in the cage

1858
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,792
UB agent bright

1859
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
Putin

1860
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,608
And they

1861
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,168
Even more damage

1862
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,704
For that

1863
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:22,496
Is not going on Apple m

1864
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,032
But just been going

1865
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,056
Immediately to

1866
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,848
And Rodger Stone

1867
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
But he's debunking

1868
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,640
King things

1869
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,176
Is nubuck

1870
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:30,944
And you're like

1871
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,504
Sweetest little f***

1872
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:36,064
Selling the book

1873
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,088
Twist of like

1874
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,184
He's claiming something that's so easily to bunkable

1875
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,232
And also he's plugging his

1876
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,256
We're going to debunk

1877
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:46,816
Well it came out the other day

1878
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,840
He's under federal investigation

1879
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,888
Oh really

1880
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,680
Being in touch with wikileak

1881
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,704
Exam the Russian

1882
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,544
Wasn't

1883
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,872
An official Trump campaign person

1884
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:00,640
Might

1885
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,176
Be okay for now

1886
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,968
If you are President Trump

1887
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:04,736
Yeah

1888
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,272
With the capability to

1889
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,296
Stop

1890
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,064
That

1891
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,904
Manuel of the amount of

1892
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,464
The amount of political Capital that would cost

1893
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,792
Would be so tough out of the gate

1894
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:20,352
Yeah there is no more political capital.

1895
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:22,400
Control the entire government

1896
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,168
And Trump

1897
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,192
Is a f****** lunatic

1898
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:27,776
But why wouldn't you a minority in Congress if pushed

1899
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,056
Jafar in with millions of

1900
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:29,824
People on the street

1901
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,872
Could shut down the government a latte

1902
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,456
Like 88

1903
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:40,576
I think if he squash these investigations into his friends

1904
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:43,136
I think that it might be a Tipping Point

1905
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,160
That would be

1906
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:48,000
It would be cut and dry

1907
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,024
Legend

1908
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,840
Then why are we having a

1909
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,120
If you're going

1910
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,912
Squash investigation

1911
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,192
It that are that are

01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,984

Carter page

1915
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:05,408
You are essentially admitting that whatever their vest

1916
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:15,392
Right that's the is America today yesterday with the women's March

1917
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,416
We were like

1918
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:18,464
Genuinely not felt hope like that

1919
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,232
I'm such a long

1920
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:21,536
Still backed

1921
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:25,376
Picture of Rodger Stone

01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:44,832
Really test on himself over the last month

1926
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,368
Over the month of

1927
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,136
December

1928
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,160
9 into January

1929
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,440

In-Shape

1931
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,632
Do you know it started doing all this

1932
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,936
I just work too much at the radio I put on

1933
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:01,984
Pounds

1934
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,520
I just lost so much weight

1935
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,896
You know I keep my supplements on a lazy Susan

1936
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,944
On the table

1937
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:15,296
That someone took away the Lazy Susan

1938
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:21,696
CC has another table in his Lazy Susan with him stopping taking supplements

1939
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:25,280
The test on myself the next month

1940
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,072
Crazy he doesn't

He was like 9

1942
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:28,864
9 lb of something

1943
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,144
Who cares

01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:31,936
Show me pictures of

1945
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,472
Shirtless

1946
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,008
In these ads

1947
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,568
What is it with those big barrel chest

1948
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,104
Crazy it looks gross

1949
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:43,712
So he's out on the street

1950
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,504
Physical appearance

1951
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,528
This is not what we're here

1952
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,088
Doesn't the negative

1953
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:49,856
Thing

1954
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,648
Gross though

1955
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,952
That's a personal opinion

1956
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,304
Charlie Ann McAdoo

1957
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,912
Awesomeness but I will say this

1958
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,192
He couldn't hit

1959
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:14,688
Could not get it just a little bit later after

1960
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,224
Yelling about how you got to be humble

1961
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,528
And Rodger Stone has been poisoned with polonium

1962
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:21,600
Defines an Indian gentleman with a Maga hat on

1963
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,136
I make America great hat

1964
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:25,184
And this guy is

1965
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,208
F****** angry

1966
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,560
Nice to be here in nice to see you and my name is

1967
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:33,120
Naturalized American citizen

1968

Island

1969
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:36,192
Many parts of the world

1970
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,728
And I know how human rights

1971
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,520
Are being violated

1972
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,824
It all

1973
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,384
People of other religions are treated like dirt

1974
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:49,248
This country is a great country for the past eight years we had a nightmare with Obama

1975
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:56,160
Nightmares over today

1976
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,720
Accept the other brother

1977
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:03,584
You read Daniel chapter 2

1978
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:09,216
God is the installer and God is a remover Upton's today God and install

1979
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,240
Trump

1980
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:16,640
Country that's right we are already but nothing to do work you all turned against the promise

1981
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,944
Yeah

1982
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:27,904
Yeah

1983
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,952
Probably don't want to use

1984
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:33,792
Is in this situation there

1985
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:40,192
Irresponsible like they are there because of God's will

1986
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:43,264
The practice of religion

1987
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:50,688
Anyone can or can't practice whatever religion they want but this is a Christian country

1988
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,760
Kings Kings

1989
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,040
Kings

1990
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,064
What else you got

1991
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,904
I do like how

1992
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:04,768
Like you choosing your words carefully

1993
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,792
Because

1994
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:06,560
He was

1995
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,888
Very clear

1996
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,680
About his name being

1997
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,448
Phillip Thomas

1998
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,472
Yeah

1999
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,496
Now

2000
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:16,032
That was a chosen

2001
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,104
Picnic somewhere else

2002
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:23,200
Respect

2003
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:28,576
Completely there is a certain amount of nobody is more

2004
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,880
Fervent about the America

2005
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,904
Can dream then

2006
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,464
Immigrants because that's the whole reason

2007
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,024
Cuz that's the that's the idea there

2008
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:42,912
Dutch Friesen

2009
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,216
Maybe I can figure out the last name

2010
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,776
But Joshua be my first name

2011
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,800
Patel Vista

2012
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,336
Haiti

2013
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,408
I'm sorry I interrupted you

2014
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:57,760
We got the Kings there I agree with him on the human rights

2015
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,832
Sure I absolutely do I would like him

2016
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,600
To follow up with

2017
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,880
More wise

2018
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,648
He's unhappy with

2019
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,696
Why was a nightmare

2020
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:06,976
Why

2021
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,000
The human rights

2022
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:16,192
That's a really interesting thing that I would want to have a full conversation because he doesn't explain where

2023
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,472
To Grapple with it

2024
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:20,800
And if his argument is it's a human rights nightmare because of

2025
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:21,824
Like the Drone killings

2026
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:25,408
Conversation

2027
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:28,992
About Isaac

2028
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,784
That would be giving a lot of credits

2029
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,552
I think it's

2030
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,392
More brainwashing

2031
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,440
Right

2032
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:39,232
The next

2033
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,256
Here's the thing

2034
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,048
Gets to me about that narrative

2035
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,096
For that that brainwash

2036
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,888
Can you point

2037
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,680
To any specific

2038
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,984
That's not made up

2039
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,032
Where Obama has

2040
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,312
Infringed upon

2041
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,592
Any kind of rye

2042
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:55,616
Yes

2043
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,408
Environmental

2044
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,176
Okay

2045
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:02,528
Basically

2046
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:07,904
Really what they're going with recognized

2047
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:08,672
These gay marriage

2048
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:11,232
When it's against their religion to believe in

2049
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,000
Gay marriage

2050
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,608
Is that

2051
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:19,680
What's cake cake

2052
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,216
Right

2053
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,544
Who cares

2054
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:27,104
Make a cake

2055
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,664
Or don't

2056
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:36,064
Yeah don't but old is Joy of the blowback that's fine

2057
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,112
No gays allowed

2058
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:42,208
Yeah

2059
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:44,768
Down to like what the free-market literally is

2060
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,560
If you want to do that

2061
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,096
You know the

2062
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:52,192
People who are super like libertarian on free marketside

2063
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:52,960
We'll make the Oregon

2064
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:56,800
Yeah if someone puts up a no black sign at their restaurant

2065
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,080
Then they're going to go out of business

2066
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,408
Yeah sounds good in theory

2067
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:03,200
But if you look at what happened with g

2068
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:03,968
Chick-fil-A

2069
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,064
It doesn't work that way bother them at all

2070
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,368
Did Republicans rallied around it

2071
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:15,232
Conservatives are like Chick-fil-A and make a big deal out of how we're going to it

2072
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,536
Support them for hating gay people

2073
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:21,632
Do they know there are enough bigots in the world that will celebrate

2074
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,424
Kind of Wilkie

2075
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,192
Keep them in business

2076
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,496
But even then

2077
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:28,288
It's not as though he

2078
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,568
Anyone

2079
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,592
To do anything

2080
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,872
Other than

2081
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,432
The same thing that the government is therefore

2082
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,712
Which is

2083
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,016
In the eyes of our law

2084
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,296
That is the case

2085
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,600
If you don't want to acknowledge that

2086
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:43,136
The government

2087
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,184
Cannot arrest

2088
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:48,256
Unless you are working for the government

2089
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,352
Like a judge or the clerk

2090
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,656
The clerk that Famous Dave's

2091
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:58,240
Deny those license

2092
01:40:59,264 --> 01:40:59,776
Is that legal

2093
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:02,080
Yeah because that's a purely loss

2094
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:08,480
You don't have to acknowledge that they're getting married

2095
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,504
You're Jamaican

2096
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,528
F****** cake

2097
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,600
Nobody put those people

2098
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,416
I don't think

2099
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:22,304
With any understanding of God like I don't want to get off on a like God as I see him

2100
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:23,328
Rent

2101
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:26,400
Yeah but like

2102
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:29,216
Any word that is conceivable

2103
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:30,496
I can't imagine

2104
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:31,776
Him being like

2105
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,312
Order being like

2106
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,616
Hey you live a good life

2107
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,920
I appreciate what you did you had a great family

2108
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,272
That's a big deal

2109
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:45,600
That's hilarious God

2110
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:48,928
YouTube Pastor gave that was if that was really God that's

2111
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,208
Pretty funny f******

2112
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,232
Yeah

2113
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:54,560
This guy goes on little bit more

2114
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:05,056
And no you don't

2115
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:09,152
Ellison beat his ice moments

2116
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:12,480
He wants to destroy United States disagree with that

2117
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,272
An emergency break up

2118
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:18,880
If you don't wake up using your Slumber and your Slumber bleed to death

2119
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:19,904
Agree with that

2120
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:24,768
For different reasons for 3 on Dub City

2121
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:29,376
But the other two you'd disagree with what he's actually saying you just

2122
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,680
Agree with the literal words

2123
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:35,008
No evidence I can find that 2,000

2124
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:36,288
Some of the radical islamist

2125
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,128
Hi Google

2126
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,408
0 research

2127
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,944
That's how much research shiny

2128
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,760
Need to do a little and

2129
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,808
I've also done some research on this

2130
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,880
Choose another wild accusation

2131
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,672
Could you believe

2132
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:59,072
In Europe

2133
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,936
I've been watching is

2134
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:04,960
Videos

2135
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:08,544
He's a hardcore what lobbyist what's it will happen

2136
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,848
It's one of the branches of radical is

2137
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:12,896
Groups

2138
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:13,920
That

2139
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:14,944
Mostly

2140
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,224
Responsible for

2141
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:17,504
The terrorism that we

2142
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:18,528
I didn't know that

2143
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:24,672
Brennan former head of the CIA was a lobbyist

2144
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:26,976
Sleeper Cell kind of thing

2145
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:31,584
Is a

2146
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,352
It's like

2147
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:36,192
Therapy

2148
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:36,960
We talked about this

2149
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:38,240
Before which is that

2150
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,264
Because

2151
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,032
A lot of

2152
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:41,312
People are so

2153
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,104
If you want to

2154
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:43,872
Go

2155
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:44,640
And

2156
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,408
Paint them is

2157
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,176
Evil

2158
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:47,456
You have to make s*** up

2159
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:50,272
Yeah you can't engage with them on real

2160
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:56,928
Reasons that they have it narrative I wanted to get to the bottom of why they think that

2161
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:59,744
Brennan is at what happiest Sleeper Cell

2162
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,304
The dates back to him refusing

2163
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,072
To call

2164
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:05,888
The terrorists radical Islamic terrorist

2165
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:06,912
You want to call them

2166
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:07,680
Extremist

2167
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:09,728
Okay

2168
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:13,568
Like taking away the fact that they

2169
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
Were

2170
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,384
Obviously

2171
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,944
But just prioritizing with they are extremists

2172
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,968
Terrorist

2173
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:22,784
Which is really the more important Point probably

2174
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,088
What do you call the IRA

2175
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,648
You call that much

2176
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:32,256
Call them Irish Catholic

2177
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,792
Yeah radical Catholic

2178
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,656
But even then

2179
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,192
If you do call them that

2180
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:41,728
What are you

2181
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:42,496
You doing

2182
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,032
What is the what is

2183
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,312
The go there other than

2184
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:48,128
Demonized

2185
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:51,968
Yeah it's two tar other Catholics who are involved in their butt

2186
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:54,528
You're going to go with any kind of radical

2187
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,552
Religion there

2188
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,856
All you're really doing is saying

2189
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,136
These are the people

2190
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:00,928
Believe

2191
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:05,024
What they're saying and other people maybe don't

2192
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,328
Also believe that that

2193
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,096
This should be

2194
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:12,960
In that it's sort of like they're doing it we should too

2195
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:16,544
Mentality of being like these are the radical

2196
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,848
Islamist

2197
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:19,872
Is radically

2198
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:26,272
With radical Christianity

2199
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:29,088
Call whatever it is

2200
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,136
They say we're doing is what they're due

2201
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,952
Describe him.

2202
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,768
We can talk a little bit about Alex Jones

2203
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,888
I've been watching is

2204
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:47,520
Is videos on YouTube

2205
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:48,800
Don't don't don't

2206
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,848
Alex Jones news

2207
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:53,920
Very important and it's a shame America

2208
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:11,072
They got a lot of issues on their plate

2209
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:14,144
See that that dude just eliminated

2210
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:18,496
I didn't see that you liked all of your paper currency is now worth

2211
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,520
Whoa

2212
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:29,504
Did you see this guy right there.

2213
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:34,624
In the past talked about how India has monkey police

2214
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,928
Yes and people think that I'm

2215
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,208
Some sort of a xenophobic

2216
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:40,768
Bigot because I

2217
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:48,960
15 problems

2218
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:49,728
It's such a

2219
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,008
Huge place

2220
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,824
Cultures and languages

2221
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:54,592
Isn't everything

2222
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:55,872
Like a

2223
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:59,200
The North and the South are like night and day

2224
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:04,320
Hey we can't even really understand that we we think of our like

2225
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:10,720
Rural America and the urban Elite

2226
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,744
His well-being

2227
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:15,584
Whole thing it boggles my mind how

2228
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,632
It's all basically the UK

2229
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,728
Always their fault

2230
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:26,848
Whatever they just drew up random lines where it's like okay everybody who identifies as pack

2231
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:27,872
Pakistani now

2232
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,920
From wherever they were living

2233
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,224
Just drop these random border

2234
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,016
And that could not have caused

2235
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,040
More insane

2236
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:37,856
Remnants of colonialism being

2237
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:38,624
Being

2238
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,392
Brought

2239
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,160
The full light

2240
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:46,048
Another thing he wants to stay this is direct shout out to

2241
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:49,376
To the Muslims maybe another pro wrestling promo type of thing

2242
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:56,032
You don't let them people that's home

2243
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,568
Nobody says they're all good

2244
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,360
And also that's

2245
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,200
Simplistic view of

2246
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:04,480
By the world Muslim

2247
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,576
Fun

2248
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:10,112
It is it is

2249
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,392
They simply

2250
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:13,184
View of the world

2251
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:15,232
The good verses

2252
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,000
Evil

2253
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,048
Concept2

2254
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,144
It makes everything

2255
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:22,912
So easy

2256
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:25,472
What you missing the nuances that kind of reality

2257
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:32,384
12 years one more thing he wants to say and this really scares me quite a bit this is our last clip from

2258
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:35,456
Alex is breakdown of trump speech

2259
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,224
On the street

2260
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,016
A bit scary

2261
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:50,816
A military Secret Service out strong

2262
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,680
But pumpkin science

2263
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:03,872
Installed

2264
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:11,552
Yes

2265
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,320
That's true

2266
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,136
That is true we are the greatest

2267
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:15,904
Superpower in the

2268
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:20,512
Scariest possible reality

2269
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,560
Trump as the f****** president

2270
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:23,840
But just that part works

2271
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:25,632
He's like Trump will Triumph

2272
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:26,656
Screaming at

2273
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:27,424
Just like that

2274
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,448
So hitlerian

2275
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,496
Like that is the kind of

2276
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,288
Speech

2277
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:35,360
Would hear from people who are a super into

2278
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:38,432
And I'm not here to say that Trump is Hitler

2279
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:44,832
Simplistic

2280
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,624
Has a great little

2281
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,464
Concept

2282
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:53,536
I would rather we call him Hitler

2283
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:56,096
Before he becomes Hitler like

2284
01:49:56,352 --> 01:50:01,216
If Hitler was called out for being Hitler before

2285
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,496
That's a good thing

2286
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,800
That's a good thing that we're trying to

2287
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:08,128
Because we have the awareness of what has happened in the past week

2288
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,152
We should use that awareness

2289
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:12,224
Yeah it was the only way for never again to actually work

2290
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:15,808
The same kind of national

2291
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:16,576
Isn't that gay

2292
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:26,304
I mean like we're seeing these people on the street and they're all like they're wrapping up all there

2293
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,072
Religious beliefs

2294
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,608
Into this nationalist

2295
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,376
Sick movement

2296
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,912
And and whether or not Trump

2297
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:31,936
Means that to happen

2298
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:32,704
He's not

2299
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,472
Strong enough

2300
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:34,752
Control these

2301
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:42,688
Imagine a scenario where he actually does

2302
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,712
Just want to lower taxes

2303
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,040
If that were all he really wanted to do

2304
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:51,648
He still has these Fringe weirdos who are emboldened by him

2305
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:52,928
Powered by

2306
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:55,488
And they're putting whatever bulshit they have

2307
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:56,768
Into his victory

2308
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,304
And you can't control them

2309
01:50:58,816 --> 01:50:59,328
No one can

2310
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,608
No

2311
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:02,400
Which is the lesson that the GOP is

2312
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:03,424
Currently learning

2313
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,448
Because they couldn't

2314
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:07,776
Control truck party

2315
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,336
What day did we

2316
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,360
It was a piggybacked on it

2317
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,152
They could

2318
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,432
Minimizer

2319
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:19,296
If I mean you just look at how Fox News

2320
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:21,344
Instead of being the

2321
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,112
And alarm for the

2322
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:22,880
The GOP

2323
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:24,672
Became the

2324
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:25,952
Did Geo

2325
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,000
Yeah

2326
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:28,768
Dictate

2327
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,560
To the GOP what was going to

2328
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:31,840
Instead of

2329
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:32,608
Did you appear

2330
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,680
Telling them to Heroes talking points

2331
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:36,448
Exactly

2332
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,728
I mean

2333
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,520
If you if

2334
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:40,800
Just go by like the

2335
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,824
The stated objective

2336
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,384
Years ago

2337
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,176
It's in

2338
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:48,736
All the sudden now

2339
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,528
Not just

2340
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:52,576
Lip service

2341
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,344
To balancing

2342
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,112
In the budget

2343
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,648
But their use

2344
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,952
Troll like

2345
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:58,976
Okay

2346
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,304
Cuts for the rich

2347
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:04,352
What's the culture War

2348
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,656
The same like

2349
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:08,192
You get people to fight over.

2350
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:09,984
You can trick them

2351
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:10,752
Into voting a

2352
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:15,616
Alex Jones's analysis

2353
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:17,920
Has to do with the dumb s***

2354
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:20,736
He's not giving him the props

2355
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:21,760
Analysis

2356
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:24,832
Just want to give him

2357
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,184
Swing of his own language

2358
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,488
I want to end this episode with a couple of clips

2359
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:39,680
Awesome no please I don't I don't want to limit your phone down

2360
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:44,544
I don't want to limit your freedom microphone but it's important to hear what's being said about my religion

2361
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,104
So this

2362
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:52,736
This is an interaction that Alex had with a protester on the street

2363
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,760
Who are the

2364
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:55,040
I had to do with

2365
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:57,088
Free speech in the first amendment being

2366
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:58,368
Taking away and depressed

2367
01:52:59,136 --> 01:52:59,904
And what have you

2368
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:02,464
This woman I don't know who she is

2369
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,488
But she is my new hero

2370
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:07,072
Really

2371
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:08,608
Depress

2372
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,888
Wyndham legalising

2373
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,680
Obama

2374
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,984
Oh my God

2375
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,776
Oh my God

2376
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:20,384
Are you up

2377
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:24,736
Baby

2378
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:35,488
Fake news

2379
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,768
Earlier

2380
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,144
Yeah that's

2381
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:42,912
I had a coffee

2382
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:49,312
That's what you think

2383
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:53,920
But you have liquor on your breath

2384
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,712
Could you get out of the car please

2385
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,480
No I'm not

2386
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:57,248
Rhonchi

2387
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:58,016
Coffee

2388
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:00,064
I'm going to yell fake news at Kopp's

2389
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,856
From now on

2390
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:10,560
Mediamatters.org spaying three million people to protest

2391
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:12,608
Does that lady is

2392
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:14,912
Fuckingawesome

2393
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:19,264
Exactly what you did at mediately

2394
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,592
She started to throw that reality at him so you smell like booze

2395
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:28,736
I need to yell at someone like you

2396
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:34,880
Cuz they have another interaction

2397
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:40,512
This shows

2398
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:42,048
Thin-skinned cowardice

2399
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:50,240
Oh yeah you gotta Listen sweetheart

2400

2402
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,648
Note or something

2403
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,696
I'm over coffee company

2404
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:10,976

F****** dick

2411
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:35,808
Someone who agreed with us

2412
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:37,088
Acted like that

2413
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,904
We would have the same response

2414
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:45,280
Yeah that's insanely shity Behavior misogynistic

2415
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:46,560
Childish bully

2416
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:50,144
13 year old on the playground

2417
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:56,544
Who just can't engage with anybody on ideas

2418
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,616
Yeah

2419
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:01,920
Yeah that's full-on drunk

2420
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:02,944
F******

2421
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:07,552
For most of the time but they were

2422
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:09,600
Do you think s*** like that

2423
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:16,256
I can't

2424
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:18,560
I can't Co-op to the offense

2425
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,096
You know like

2426
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,120
It is

2427
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:23,680
It is not something that I'm offended by

2428
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:25,216
Because I under

2429
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:25,984
Stand any kind

2430
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:28,800
That I've never had

2431
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:34,944
A credit that lady handle that with aplomb and decency and decorum

2432
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:37,248
Even anger

2433
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:41,600
He would have pulled back

2434
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:42,624
And then like

2435
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:43,392
Taking the high road

2436
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:45,952
Look at this dump feminist

2437
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:49,024
Exactly little Rosa drill

2438
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:51,328
Accepted what he was doing

2439
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,960
Recognized it and then immediately minimized and narrated sort of the absurdity

2440
01:56:57,472 --> 01:57:03,616
The child small child what would happen to us if we ran into would make him

2441
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,760
So many times

2442
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,112
Cake

2443
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:16,160
Smiley f***

2444
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:23,840
Enough

2445
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:27,680
That is f****** b******* friend Marty DeRosa the other night

2446
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:31,008
A reminder he gave me a nice reminder of

2447
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,032
We watched

2448
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:34,080
Alex's coverage

2449
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:36,128
Which of Julian Assange

2450
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:37,152
Big announcement

2451
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:38,944
During the campaign

2452
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:44,064
At 3 in the morning I'm going to make a big announcement

2453
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,624
And so Alex and his whole crew

2454
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,392
To watch that

2455
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:48,416
And brought

2456
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:54,560
Cuz they thought it was going to be all about like a nail in the coffin for Hillary

2457
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,840
It was

2458
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:57,888
Was that it was Wikileaks 10th anniversary

2459
01:57:58,144 --> 01:58:00,448
Hahaha

2460
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:03,008
And so at that point they started

2461
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:04,288
Screaming

2462
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:07,104
Hillary's butt plug

2463
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,664
Look how much that's shifted

2464
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,200
With only a couple months

2465
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,992
Yeah only a couple months

2466
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:14,528
Now they're like WikiLeaks

2467
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:18,112
Is the oldest tourist true information

2468
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:21,952
It's such a wild hypocrite

2469
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:23,744
F***

2470
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,304
And this is

2471
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,840
The thing that you see on

2472
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:28,608
Twitter all the

2473
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:31,168
Or even on The Daily Show

2474
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:35,008
Right remember whenever John used to have those clips of

2475
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:38,336
Some playing some b*******

2476
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:40,896
Yeah and then four years later Mitch

2477
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,176
Richmond

2478
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:47,040
Conical

2479
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:49,344
Saying the exact opposite

2480
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,136
And

2481
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:52,928
The thing about

2482
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,232
Is no one cares

2483
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:57,792
Will you forget no one cares about hip-hop

2484
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,072
Because your team

2485
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:04,192
You forget that three years ago you only won the championship to the guy who beats his wife was on

2486
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:06,752
Have you returned to blind items

2487
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:09,312
So now you can still cheer for the team next

2488
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:12,640
Ran the ball real hard I know he punched his wife

2489
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:15,968
Drag her out of an elevator but man he ran the ball

2490
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,272
Over and over

2491
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:21,600
Problem IO

2492
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:22,880
Please have with

2493
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:23,648
Even even with

2494
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:26,464
Who just

2495
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,000
Accept everything

2496
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:29,280
No

2497
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:30,048
He was

2498
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,328
Critical in a lot of

2499
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,632
A bunch of waste

2500
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:34,656
To justify it and

2501
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:35,424
And I know he's met

2502
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:38,752
Then I can

2503
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:39,776
Possibly match

2504
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,312
That does not

2505
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:42,848
He is not still

2506
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:43,872
Been a hypocrite

2507
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:44,640
So many

2508
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:48,992
The argument that it's wrong to hit

2509
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,272
The team you're playing

2510
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,552
You should absolutely

2511
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:54,112
Like the Democrats right now

2512
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:55,136
They should

2513
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,720
The f****** women's March

2514
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:02,816
Well it's like it's like we don't need

2515
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:06,656
The

2516
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:10,752
Thomas Anderson

2517
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,800
That is

2518
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:14,848
Disappointed he makes that is very fine

2519
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:15,616
It's valid

2520
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:19,200
But anyway the inauguration happen

2521
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:20,224
Alex

2522
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:22,272
Was clearly drunk for a good part of it

2523
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:24,832
Which means

2524
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:28,672
It's time

2525
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:36,608
On the street and there was a very limited amount of time

2526
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,632
The he did

2527
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:41,984
And our next episodes will be back in studio I think we'll be able to bring

2528
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:42,752
Things back towards

2529
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,544
Backwards

2530
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,568
Normal Alex

2531
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:46,336
Screaming the whole bunch

2532
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,872
Good deal

02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:51,456

Text me about what it feels like to be an American in the age of

2547
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:29,344
I remember when I was abroad

2548
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:32,160
And there was a lot of everyone I was

2549
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:34,976
Your path

2550
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:39,840
I remember when I was abroad when Bush was president

2551
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:41,632
I got a lot of

2552
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:44,704
Got a feeling

2553
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,984
I can't imagine

2554
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:47,264
Any better

2555
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:49,568
I think I think if I do

2556
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:50,592
If I do a

2557
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:51,360
Set

2558
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:53,664
The first words I have

2559
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,688
Have to say are

2560
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:56,224
I'm sorry

2561
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:57,760
I'm sorry

2562
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,552
And then I can continue

2563
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,856
I like to start

2564
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:06,720
