1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's 5.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,280
Around novelty beverages

6
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,328
Alex woo

00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008

Whatsyourprice

9
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
Well this morning my Bright Smile Jordan is

10
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,272
But he's understanding the weather in Chicago was such

11
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,088
That the recording last night would have been a

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,416
Unnecessary risk

13
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,952
In terms of

14
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
Transportation

15
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:40,864
I'm antibiotic right spot I guess is that too because of that little scheduling

16
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
Mix up

17
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
Shake up

18
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
I was able to watch a little bit of the Royal Rumble

19
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,288
Okay so I got to

20
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
I love a Royal Rumble we know who we know this 30 people running every 5 minutes or whatever

21
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,760
3 minutes timer

22
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:03,648
Who is the who is the person this time and within less than 5 Seconds

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,464
I don't know if it was less than 5 Seconds

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
But the sort of joke

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
Illumination

26
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
10 person was always at the hurricane

27
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
Okay character who's a superhero

28
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
Carter

29
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
There's a guy named hurricane

30
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,408
Add yeah he he's a sort of Goofy character who

31
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Is the superhero

32
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,224
You are and yeah he got

33
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
I don't happen

34
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,112
But yeah I love a Royal Rumble I do enjoy this

35
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,440
The the pace of it I like the idea of

36
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
People just keep coming

37
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,584
Theme songs Kik

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
Thursday

39
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:50,240
Exciting returns and end

40
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
In that structure

41
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
And I enjoyed

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
Hydrated

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,712
Probably asking if I have thoughts about it

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,856
I don't have thoughts just was Hurricane was my favorite character

45
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
For sure

46
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,952
It was it was it was fun though

47
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,560
Who's nice is a movie called

48
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
Gigi colon

49
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Psycho Gorman

50
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
And it is

51
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,056
You guys you guys listening cannot tell the door very hard

52
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
There is a serious

53
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,664
It's one of those movies that was made by

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,992
Just somebody 450 bucks or whatever

55
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
And it is

56
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
A live-action cartoon that is

57
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,392
Very occasionally incredibly funny

58
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,464
In a dry deadpan way

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
And also incredibly terrible

60
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,328
But it's one of those movies that I'm not going to recommend anybody watch

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
But I'm so happy to

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
This what year we talkin

63
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
In about an hour

64
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
Immediate

65
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
Is recidivism

66
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,080
Okay and it's just

67
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
It's just

68
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,176
Wildin out there and I'm say it's one of those things where you're just happy

69
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
Is it something like that is real you know if it didn't exist I thought about willing something like that and dig

70
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,672
Existence before possibility of becoming

71
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
Cult classic

72
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:20,607
I do know people aren't going to watch it

73
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
It's there

74
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Manuel

75
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:29,055
High Praise

76
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,919
Absolutely feel like I understand exactly what you're talking about and I have no idea what this thing

77
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Exactly

78
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,063
Jordan today episode to be talking about the time span

79
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
Supreme January 28th

80
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
And 31st

81
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
When do you start loving to go

82
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,631
Black

83
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
Bacteria

84
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
About

85
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,847
The 29th on Friday cuz that was a travel day for Alex

86
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
Coming back from Utah vacation

87
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,991
I'm also not going to be talking about the 30th cuz that was Saturday

88
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:14,367
Although I do have a little bit of something to say our special report

89
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
With the Stuart roads

90
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Pompeo keepers

91
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
In studio

92
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:24,351
Where they did running commentary over a documentary about

93
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
Lockdown or something you are

94
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,031
I was watching it and maybe we'll cover this but it's just

95
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
The two of them having

96
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
Kind of a casual conversation about secession

97
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
Great

98
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Cigarettes not really

99
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:44,063
Beyond just saying that they did that damn that Stewart Roads is standing by

100
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
These keepers

101
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,695
The capital

102
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,279
I imagine he wakes up every morning is like a didn't get me yet

103
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
That's it

104
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:01,983
The other thing that was worth pointing out is that the roads were saying that like what you should do

105
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,335
Is throw a big Rave sure and then when the police come to shut it down

106
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:13,759
Basically was on your right to live

107
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Relay it man

108
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,927
Sorry I'd started off so here's what we do we set a trap for the law

109
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
That's basically his version of civil disobedience

110
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
And when they try to arrest you

111
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,751
Start fighting

112
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Before

113
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,847
We dig some trenches right outside the way

114
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
And then puts

115
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,967
Spikes in there and then cover it with leaves and when the cops come

116
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:49,343
Have you considered

117
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Qwiksite

118
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
Instead of

119
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
Spike's I find the quicksand work better

120
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,839
Destroys the evidence Derek actually came up with mote and but

121
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
It looks too much

122
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
I love notes

123
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,191
Now have you considered this

124
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
I know a guy

125
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,799
Ike's to hoist safe

126
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,127
Can I get a pulley system going

127
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:19,295
Hanging

128
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,599
Caswell

129
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,159
Dropped or safe

130
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
Also we need to have two people walk

131
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
By holding a very

132
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,471
I do like the idea that sat just turned it to Looney Tunes

133
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
Someone walks through with bunch of pies

134
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Yeah it's

135
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
It's not a good

136
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
Special Report by any means

137
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
It's not interesting

138
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
And it's very long

139
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
And 7 I'll be cover

140
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:55,647

Recording the show

143

144
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719

00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:42,047
F****** work on your thesis it's work on your history pieces

191
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,911
This has been slacking off too long to be positive

192
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,775
Ask that we wish him luck

193
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
Yep

194
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
I've decided to school

195
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,687
Absolutely also good luck on that

196
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,343
Happy birthday to you and also to everybody else who celebrate

197
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Birthday here in 21

198
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
There's one car

199
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
There's one birthday

200
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,279
From David

201
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,887
Who says that every song should have a recognition of

202
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
As well

203
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
And I hit song for happy birthdays happy birthday

204
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Do you

205
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Happy birthday to you

206
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,663
Did you know that the rate of prostate cancer in men over the age of 85 is 100%

207
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
So there you go happy birthday

208
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,039
What a downer

209
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,391
Burn in hell you Satan

210
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Wow

211
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
Quite adequate

212
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
Michigan Biden

213
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,631
By grouping that's a list of the to luminaries

214
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,983
I think of Nietzsche I think of biting someone I think a bike I think of

215
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
Of course

216
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
What is vitamin with the Ubermensch

217
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
Indeed

218
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Theory start on the 28th

219
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
Alex has

220
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,223
I figured out that at this point

221
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Avoid

222
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,575
Smokey Perez got arrested cuz they stormed the capital

223
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,671
I got to figure out how this works

224
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
Worth straight-up Oath Keepers and with a lot of these other groups

225
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,583
He's sort of been able to figure out how to thread the needle

226
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
Qanon it's like okay

227
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,519
Yeah it was all a setup with the proud boys

228
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,919
Obviously I hate them already there so

229
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,479
Soros Soros

230
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,807
Keepers are a little bit more difficult because Alex is

231
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,415
Longtime friends with Stewart Road but he's been a huge promoter of them

232
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
And so

233
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,535
Kind of has got to be like that if somebody infiltrated

234
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Three of their group

235
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Indicted

236
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Before going in

237
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Capital

238
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Performance

239
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Training

240
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
A month before

241
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
Capital incursion who knows if any of that true

242
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
But the point is is that

243
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
They are sending

244
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
Infiltrators into every major organization

245
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
So who knows

246
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Could be anybody

247
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,719
We're always were always infiltrated strong take

248
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
So I was I was kind of confused when I

249
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:27,935
It's launched into this episode cuz the day before this Alex had interviewed the Boogaloo boys

250
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
Mike Dunn

251
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,055
Episode

252
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
I realize that we missed

253
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
A real

254
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,735
Great opportunity for a Mike Dunn Mike down

255
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,343
Did we miss a great opportunity

256
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
UK opportunity

257
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
It was there on the table and we we missed it has been humiliated

258
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Browbeat

259
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
By this guy

260
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Okay

261
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,959
I know that he's going to interview another Boogaloo dude on this

262
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
28

263
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,519
That Junior 28 episode

264
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,359
Okay let's get to it to the market to it

265
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Instead

266
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
This kind of seems to be where his head's at

267
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
Let me just lay out what I think

268
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
Biggest and first and foremost

269
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
Trump if he gets off

270
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
Off defense could be

271
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,671
The president of the world as Chris reading

272
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Very important

273
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Chris Ruddy

274
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
Views as of this morning

275
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,263
Honey says Trump Canal because of the world that's actually a true state

276
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,431
What the f*** are you talking about

277
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,247
Okay so if I understand correctly Trump

278
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
Can become president of the world

279
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
Power and popularity

280
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,695
Hey man I got

281
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,743
You're just got to be the president of the world

282
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:01,887
You got it solutely there all

283
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:07,007
Aggressively against there are policies and I think you're a toxic influence

284
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:12,127
Burma now is that how this goes

285
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Command mark

286
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,247
Whatever it's taken over by junta

287
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
You making it

288
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Sandpoint

289
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,671
I would say the first president of the world doesn't exist

290
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:30,815
President of the world Buena position implies world government

291
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,655
If it if anyone could be a global issue would be president of the world

292
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
I don't want

293
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,591
Like Obama to be the president of the world I want Hillary to be the president of the world remember

294
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,991
Lot of time spent Infowars where Alex was talking about how Hillary was going to be the president show

295
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
Brandon bill was going

296
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,367
To become the Secretary General of the UN and then they would be

297
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,439
Together the president of the world

298
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
Alex's

299
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,303
Excited about Trump being the president of the world which

300
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
Again doesn't exist no

301
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Proof

302
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
Hellboy very dumb

303
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
Which street is it

304
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
Easy going

305
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,311
How to get the whole world or border would like what is he going to do with the whole day

306
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
I guess conquer them

307
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Yeah he would have to

308
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,247
There's a lot of stuff that goes unspoken

309
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,599
I know about Eritrea they're not backing down

310
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
Switzerland

311
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
Neutral

312
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
So

313
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
High-minded

314
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Concerns

315
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,375
In the possibility of being the president of the world

316
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
Certainly

317
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Very serious

318
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
Also Alex is a little bit Petty

319
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
She has to read a teleprompter speech

320
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
5 *

321
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
In that very short

322
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Shortest route

323
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,671
Yeah

324
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
He shot her so she doesn't know

325
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Planet

326
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
He is on

327
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,583
Is it possible that trumps was too long

328
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,959
Wyatt is preparation the worst thing a human can do in Alex

329
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,007
That is so bizarre like

330
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,335
Yeah oh he took it seriously

331
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,919
You know what I'm going to go I'm going to go crazy on Alex let me tell you this

332
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
I've got

333
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
Maybe 45 minutes of material

334
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,903
10 years to write that way more than 5 times performance

335
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,207
Is oftentimes

336
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Yooper

337
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Hair

338
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
2

339
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
Here unprepared

340
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,679
How to prepare natural I don't understand

341
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
You have to say something a million times to make it sound like you're saying it the first time there was a very big

342
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,407
Big difference between somebody who is

343
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:58,015
Desperately unprepared and off-the-cuff and somebody

344
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,343
Who is able to do things off the cops

345
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
I don't

346
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
I don't

347
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,255
This particular instance to is very bizarre to me

348
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
Because it's the inauguration speech

349
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
That's

350
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,399
Probably one of the most

351
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Important

352
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Highest

353
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
Spect the speeches

354
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,687
A big deal that you're going to give especially in the early times of your president so you're going to set the course

355
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,503
Maybe give a thesis for like what you want

356
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,319
I to achieve in your time and all that

357
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Atone

358
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:39,231
I don't want somebody just being like a f*** it I'm going to wrap

359
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
I think it would Alex is saying it's a bad thing about buying this a actually a really good guy would argue that someone who gives 8

360
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:50,239
10 minute speech over someone who gives an hour speech is always better

361
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
And

362
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
Maybe

363
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,431
The preparation allowed him to parse it down to 10 minutes maybe trim the fat

364
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
About getting rid of stuff

365
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
Yeah

366
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,599
So now that Alex knows that The Oath Keepers were there

367
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
And arrested

368
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
And that's going to be

369
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Maybe

370
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,535
Stewart kind of adjust

371
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,119
The Narrative a little bit and what I think is really funny about this

372
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
Is that Alex

373
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,799
Keep changing the narrative whenever new groups of right-wing people are proven to door

374
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Open mail

375
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,383
And arrested

376
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
If we just don't let

377
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
The music Apple event

378
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,527
But they clearly infiltrated Patriot groups that used

379
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
Delete the chance

380
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
People from

381
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
Large Patriot group

382
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Boogaloos

383
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
Quasi Patriot

384
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
Owen Shroyer

385
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Rolfing

386
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
Controlled

387
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:53,727
Organization they really remember us being together by Noah Troyer

388
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
Of course you got

389
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,079
Proud boys that

390
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,151
Orange glitter Albany

391
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
Infiltrated

392
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
Reviewed all the footage

393
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
They were boogaloos they were proud boys and there were

394
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
Keepers

395
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Deadly

396
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
Last night this morning

397
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
This morning

398
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
How to watch The Wall Street Journal report

399
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
The show Zoo

400
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
Sweet Frog boys being instrumental break

401
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Outside

402
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,151
They're not all sad summer just useful idiots

403
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
Got caught up in the mob psychology but

404
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
Like the media

405
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Why

406
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
It was all staged

407
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
If some of it was

408
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
People being foolish

409
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:50,559
Woody's trying to imply and does on this episode is that like the people who are leading

410
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
The charge

411
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,631
There is a couple people from

412
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,447
Each group that they had got set up right

413
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,543
To make everyone in those groups look guilty

414
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
This is complicated

415
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
So

416
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
Every single right-wing group

417
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,967
Was infiltrated

418
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
And then led to the Capitol

419
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
To overthrow the government

420
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,391
Right now let me ask you this question

421
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
Why was it so

422
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,976
Easy to lead them to the Kappa

423
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
Is it maybe cuz they wanted to do it

424
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
I mean obviously

425
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,656
It's not entrapment even if Alex's

426
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:32,032
Complete nonsensical conspiracy is true but also none of that is true

427
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,408
No you won't you guys tried and you failed

428
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
That's it

429
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,992
You've tried to overthrow a country

430
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,528
But you're not a user

431
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
So you failed

432
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
Yeah and also

433
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,928
I don't feel like Joe Biggs would like this kind of

434
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,952
Atone for Myla

435
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,512
Because it implies that it best

436
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
Computer useful idiot

437
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,144
Yeah he's calling everybody what it this is almost like

438
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
The Revenge of Stevie peas

439
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:05,056
Dammit

440
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
I'm still standing

441
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
Joe Biggs is got at like

442
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
I got to imagine

443
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
He's going to have

444
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
Some complicated therapy in prison

445
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
About

446
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
His relationship with Alex

447
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,672
He gets fired from Infowars cuz of pizza

448
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:25,280
The gates. Or he leaves he tries to start his own news Operation of go out

449
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Kind of

450
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:31,168
Is associated with but it's like I don't know keep it an arm's distance probably show up

451
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
Besides I'm

452
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Jumping in

453
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Both feet why not

454
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,080
He rises through the ranks of The Proud boys becomes like

455
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
Really high up in the problem

456
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,456
Make the name for himself in the in the

457
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
Aggressive dangerous right-wing

458
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Community

459
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,296
Batman storm

460
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Capital

461
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
Wow it's so crazy that when it be

462
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,672
Sounds convenient they just cut loose

463
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:58,048
Scalp isn't it so weird they don't have that loyalty or anything like that

464
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:04,448
Who would have guessed man who could have seen that coming we seen it happen with all of these groups

465
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:09,056
Alex Ernst born in Moore

466
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,872
So someone who is loyal to a fault

467
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
Someone who is

468
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Trista

469
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Just

470
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
You know true

471
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
True as

472
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
The day is long I don't know

473
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,112
Rodger Stone

474
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136
Okay

475
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,488
He kind of wants to imply that everybody history

476
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Is a secret life.

477
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
They want to erase this Wrecker

478
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Impeached

479
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
Nixon impeachment

480
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Impeachment

481
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
It's not right and it's not fair

482
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,800
And we know that history is written

483
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,408
The historians are left

484
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Pearlstein

485
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
As

486
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
This story is there a story ends there

487
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Again

488
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,160
We can't let this happen you see I think this last fine

489
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
For the price

490
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
For his legacy

491
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,304
There is this battle of

492
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,608
A historical

493
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Pushy

494
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:10,752
Yeah that you see that that is that is a really interesting thing that seems to be

495
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,848
At least subtly behind a lot of these these right-wing figures

496
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,152
But I find this very interesting

497
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,712
Alex believes in

498
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Lower

499
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,040
Beating real

500
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
And

501
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
Completely false version

502
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,368
History

503
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,184
Rodger is attacking nestorian to

504
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
Yeah

505
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
I'll be in the problem is

506
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,072
History is left-leaning

507
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,144
The more you read about history the more you like

508
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,448
Oh those fascists are bad

509
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:44,800
And the more you see the fascist you're like oh in the modern times

510
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,848
The people who are doing the fascism

511
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,152
Are Rodger Stone and his bill

512
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
So it's

513
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,760
Kind of does seem like it's in their interest to portray all of history is

514
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,856
History is unkind to those who want to

515
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,648
To cling to

516
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,208
Biases and bigotries of the past

517
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
And

518
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
I mean

519
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Pretty clear

520
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,632
Is that what's to talk to Rodger about

521
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
They

522
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,448
Impeachment trial is

523
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
Foremost in his mind

524
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
And

525
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
He really want

526
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,128
This f****** thing to be a circus he really wants Trump

527
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,968
Out of order

528
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
I don't

529
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,552
I wonder what would be

530
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
The most

531
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,624
Sort of politically useful thing

532
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:37,280
For this or the policies that we would like to hear would it be more effective for it just to be sore the quiet

533
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
And go through like

534
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
Process or would it be effective

535
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,912
I think if it's a circus it's

536
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
Probably more effective in splintering

537
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
The GOP

538
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
Yeah I think that it would

539
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
Lead to

540
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
Such

541
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Embarrassing

542
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,408
Showcase

543
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,760
You know people in the Senate would have much more

544
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
Baggage

545
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
But for not

546
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,856
Ludington

547
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Oh yeah

548
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,256
Absolutely think that maybe that would be politically useful but I'm not positive it would also be

549
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
A pretty embarrassing thing

550
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Just watch

551
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
I mean for the concept of

552
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Justice

553
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
Which

554
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
If you don't have

555
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
Kind of Sherrod Elementary

556
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Justice

557
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
Society

558
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,920
So the idea of holding like a two-day little like

559
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
Hey Trump your evil

560
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
5545

561
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
Your

562
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
Acquitted itself after

563
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,320
Expensive to the concept

564
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
Justice that it's like

565
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Why

566
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,928
White believe that any punishment will ever

567
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,208
Come to these evil

568
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,024
I'm not even trying to

569
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,072
Predict or talk about like in vic

570
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
Acquittal

571
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
I'm talking about the strategy of

572
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:53,056
That's what I'm saying about a two-day trial or something like that that's so offensive to me of like we have

573
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
Evidence

574
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,968
Is incontrovertible I guess I guess what you're saying makes sense

575
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
It's like a 2-day trial with an acquittal

576
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,576
Or whatever is kind of

577
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,136
Whereas whereas

578
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
A week

579
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,232
Two-week trial where Trump is going crazy

580
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,792
Screaming nonsense conspiracy theories

581
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:18,144
And then an acquittal could be toxic to the people who voted for acquittal here's the biggest

582
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,424
Here's the biggest reason

583
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
I don't know how long Trump

584
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Be quiet for his lawyer

585
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:29,920
True so the shorter

586
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
I think they all quit

587
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,480
Well I be

588
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,808
The five quit and now we got to like yesterday or some

589
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
Great lawyers

590
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,440
Oh yeah that was

591
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
Like

592
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,512
The longer it goes on the more likely

593
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
Play Trumpets to be like

594
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,328
I've got something to say

595
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,656
And once we get there then the fireworks start

596
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
Men left and right he's going to be born

597
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
Doesn't it

598
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,544
I Feel It In My Bones yeah

599
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,848
I can't wait to say good job Barnes

600
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
Bars is going to try and impeach

601
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Be so good

602
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
Trump needs

603
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
To go in there swinging

604
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
Prolon order

605
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,280
And the guy that was she'll try to expose this election fraud

606
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
Use that as a place to

607
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Put on

608
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,680
The evidence of election fraud could be able to tell him to shut up

609
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
This would be

610
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
This would be the ultimate

611
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,776
Reality TV show

612
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,568
Mini Scholars

613
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
We could get up to

614
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
2 months

615
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
Hell yeah

616
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
Degree up front

617
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
A few lawyers representing

618
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,808
If he does that they're going to hang him out to dry

619
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
You can tell him

620
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,648
Coushatta

621
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:48,000
Wiccan someone is being completely uncooperative

622
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,536
Just being like out of order

623
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,816
You can try a minute

624
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:55,424
Haven't you seen like I haven't you ever been to a quart

625
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,496
You know one of those quick traffic or it's where they go all day

626
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,568
You're allowed to just scream for as long as you want

627
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
22 months

628
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,944
And they can't do anything to you at all

629
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:13,856
Stopped in the Senate a crucial loophole that we refuse to close never if you just misspelled

630
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Court

631
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,440
Can you wait about

632
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,744
People say tubal-cain

633
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,280
Some people just wait about

634
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,168
Filibuster

635
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,728
I don't think it's a good idea

636
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,312
I do like I think this is dumb

637
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:39,200
In terms of the goals that Alex has I think it's in the real world it would probably be unproductive

638
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:45,856
And I think there's another idea that's going around that also would be unproductive to the bowls that Alex has also

639
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
Because I'm against those goals

640
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,256
I think that maybe they should do it I'm not entirely sure

641
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
I haven't I haven't

642
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:59,424
Thought about or considered the the logistics of the possibilities of this

643
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,216
Idea of the Patriot party

644
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
Party splitting

645
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
But just

646
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
From

647
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Basic View

648
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,176
I think what you would end up doing is

649
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,480
Completely fracturing the right-wing

650
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,040
The conservative vote would not

651
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,600
Be unified and Democrat

652
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,392
It probably it run roughshod

653
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,720
Attleboro

654
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
Seems like

655
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,840
That would be a really bad decision

656
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,144
In terms of the rice

657
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Electoral

658
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
A two-month trial

659
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,288
For Trump to present his evidence

660
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
They would have to talk

661
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
Real slow

662
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,456
I think Rudy could handle it

663
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,296
Rodger is against

664
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
This idea

665
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
Of the

666
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,648
The Patriot party which I think is probably good political in

667
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
Instinct on his part

668
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
I think

669
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,744
I think that there's a lot of dangers

670
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,560
In terms of like were that party to get rolling

671
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
Any kind of

672
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
Actual

673
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,216
Foothold in power I think you could end up with

674
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
A pretty

675
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,568
Terrifying Overton window

676
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
But

677
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
In terms of

678
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,152
Fracturing electoral power on the right

679
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
I think there's a

680
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
It would be dangerous for them

681
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
Yeah Anna and Rodger realize

682
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,088
Globalist

683
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
Fun 3rd party

684
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Because they don't work

685
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
English

686
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,816
Just give it legitimate shut off our energy supplies

687
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
Green Party

688
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,728
When you pull back from taking over parties you want to do is Soros and the globalist have taken over

689
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
Democrats

690
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,288
The comedy Chinese are taking them over

691
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,104
They're putting in their DA's are putting on their attorney general

692
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
It's a nightmare

693
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,200
We need as American people to control at least one party

694
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,992
We almost got there with Trump

695
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,552
Landslide

696
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,648
That is a nuclear option

697
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
Down the road

698
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,744
Just for him to run for president or something if he had to

699
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,632
We think that

700
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,728
He should run for governor or Senator or maybe he should run against Rubio

701
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
But I really think we need to get

702
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
President-trump

703
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,568
Back in

704
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Back in DC that is

705
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
What we need to be the real leader

706
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
I don't

707
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,248
Fucken understand why you think he has any interest in

708
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:27,648
Running against Marco Rubio I mean maybe for the campaign you have fun with that you are sure I want to be in the

709
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,696
Good god no

710
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
Imagine imagine

711
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Call God that

712
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,816
Terrible

713
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
Nightmare that

714
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,448
It's not all about

715
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
Trump

716
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,288
Cooperate

717
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:49,152
There's a minority whip tells you what to do

718
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,480
On the phone all the time trying to get donations and s***

719
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,760
Imagine that

720
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
Yeah

721
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:59,904
You imagine what kind of bills he would write in Cran

722
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,440
Brutal

723
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
Absolutely brutal

724
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,536
I've been able to

725
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
Provide

726
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,120
Senators in Florida with free fast food

727
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,424
No and it's a b so right

728
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,008
It's alright to be like 9 or we need to maintain the two parties

729
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,568
Sister because as long as both parties are awful

730
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,360
They can keep passing the ball back

731
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,712
You know so that means that they can still be owned by a billion

732
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,784
If any party governed effectively

733
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,576
The other party would be destroyed

734
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
You know like

735
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,720
Democrats already or like I know we promised 2000 but let's do 40

736
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
1800 you like

737
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,512
Guys

738
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
Really are we doing this

739
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,120
Okay we'll see the Republicans into years

740
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Thanks buddy

741
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,192
Good work

742
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
Yeah

743
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
Stupid

744
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
The bomber

745
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,336
But Trump will not be a senator or governor

746
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,664
Why would he run against desanti

747
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,760
If he runs for governor there's no way the state remains

748
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:04,160
In the union Trump is governor of Florida he is the president of the United flooring

749
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Lago de Texas

750
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:10,048
There we will take our second

751
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,584
That's not the Alamo ship

752
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
The Border

753
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
So Rodger is

754
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
Weird

755
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,520
Because he doesn't want a third party

756
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,592
Party is a bad idea

757
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:26,432
To give me the f****** money to the RNC f*** them

758
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,736
Trump should be president of the world

759
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,368
Republican National Committee

760
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,672
In the Infowars audience to follow

761
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,256
There is no chance that money is being

762
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Amazing point

763
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
Please go back to

764
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,704
He said about Trump can merely the

765
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
The president of the world

766
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
Nationalism

767
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,800
Patriotism for Papa

768
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,336
It was a better trade deal

769
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,432
How would you be the president the world for nationalist

770
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
Very weird

771
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
Saragarhi where

772
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,064
The world

773
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
No one can move

774
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,904
I think it's probably a politically

775
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,232
I don't know

776
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Active

777
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:16,096
To say hey we shouldn't have a third-party we got to take over there

778
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:19,168
The party but also give the Republican party any money

779
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
No no

780
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,008
Let's make sure we don't support them but also

781
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
We had to take them over

782
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Yeah we all got to give money to the right

783
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:29,920
So

784
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Alex

785
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
It gets mad

786
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,016
Here he's a Rodger

787
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
Takes off cuz he's

788
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
You said his Beast

789
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
And

790
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,392
Gets mad about Nancy Pelosi

791
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Because

792
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,696
She is not thrilled

793
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,000
With there being members of the House

794
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
Who sings

795
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,888
Seem to have hostile intentions

796
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,824
Marjorie Greene certainly has said some things that would make me feel unsafe and

797
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,128
Work environment

798
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,456
She's not Nancy Pelosi is not happy about that

799
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,992
Good for her cuz I don't think

800
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,784
She should have to put up with that

801
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,600
Right then you have the the Lauren boebert

802
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Of the world

803
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
Also

804
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
Making you feel super safe

805
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:18,816
Xog in an interview said that the enemy is inside

806
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,632
You know Alex

807
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,472
She's not thrilled about that not thrilled about that

808
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Chandler Bing

809
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:37,504
Hey lady it was your supporter when the shots delete the tried to kill 18 others you lying sack of garbage

810
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,784
Spell Pelosi

811
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,392
That's what I mean by that

812
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:49,536
Sing about that clip is it's one of a number of times Alex has to over

813
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,096
Clarify

814
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
Elisa B

815
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Alright

816
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:00,544
So everybody is getting caught for doing the thing

817
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,592
To do I better be real

818
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,896
I better redo it

819
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:11,296
Gloves you're going to burden Outlet by that I mean I believe that God has it out for you and

820
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:17,952
Your soul is going to have trouble and in this circumstance I'm going to put you to Romans 12:16 because nobody gets mad

821
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,792
Troy has been sitting along

822
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,864
He's theoretically hosting a show and Alex

823
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
Who's co-hosting but Alex

824
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
Doing the everything

825
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
Ideas what he wants to introduce

826
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,056
To the proceedings about how

827
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
Popular Joe Biden

828
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
I have some primary evidence

829
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,920
But I think it is

830
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
Stupid

831
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:43,040
But you know getting back to the Biden issue here Alex I was looking at this today

832
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,600
And I just have one little print out here just really work for the

833
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,880
The printout

834
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,184
Google search

835
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
Friends

836
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,280
The crew wants to do this they can do this I was looking at Google search trends

837
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:57,632
Biden as a Google search Trend was almost non-existent

838
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,912
In the year 2020

839
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,984
Almost non-existent Trump on the Google search stranded like

840
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,008
Number one

841
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,800
Overbite had the most votes

842
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
Ever

843
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,360
And then the other thing I noticed Alex

844
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
Two of the top

845
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
3

846
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,528
Word associations with Vidant really trend

847
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,576
Is this what we're doing

848
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
And dementia

849
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,928
So wonder why this diet

850
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,024
And by the way later

851
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:31,680
Because it doesn't really look good on a printout

852
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,264
The things

853
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,336
The Seminole

854
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
Because

855
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
This is huge

856
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,432
This is huge huge

857
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Yeah

858
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Google

859
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Trends

860
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,296
Trump put out an online poll where

861
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,112
98% of people said they wanted to be president

862
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
I don't understand how buying one

863
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
Possible

864
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:58,560
98% of Americans want

865
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Yeah this is

866
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
This is an instance of

867
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,680
Taking something on it

868
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
On the surface

869
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,032
Appears to be making an argument that Trump is

870
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,360
Is far more popular than

871
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,664
Not to the larger issue that there's

872
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
Since very dumb

873
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,504
So we got some guests coming up

874
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
After Rodger

875
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
We got a couple of

876
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,600
Big big hitters

877
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:26,208
But I want to let lister's also know Stewart Road

878
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
The last 30 minutes the next hour

879
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,560
Another one of the Boogaloo leaders

880
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
Joining us

881
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,376
A song about really happy

882
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
The capital

883
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Ocir

884
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
Bad

885
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,592
I get from his four

886
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
But only because you can't swing a stick

887
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,808
I'm looking to Enrique tarrio thing

888
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
Bad guy

889
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
I like it what but

890
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,000
And it just goes with the territory license

891
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
What

892
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,120
Wow that's weird

893
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
Is

894
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
If he is a bad informants

895
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,240
A literal demon servant

896
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
I like that guy

897
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
Hays good guy

898
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,384
Look I don't I don't know what

899
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,688
Natario was up to I don't know

900
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:25,088
Now maybe I still haven't seen concrete evidence that you was informing on the Proud boys

901
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,648
His perspective he has to think that he was

902
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:37,120
It makes no sense to be like this guy was a scary dude he was infiltrating the right-wing groups in order to make them look bad make

903
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,424
False Flags

904
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
Demon servant good dude

905
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:46,592
Good dude

906
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,152
Jarring to hear Alex be like

907
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:55,040
Look up doctor this Boogaloo guy said I was a f****** inside dude like I was both controlled opposition

908
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,856
I understand I'm saying the same thing about him

909
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:02,976
And maybe he's cool you guys are doing great work together

910
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
Together

911
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,024
Man that's some

912
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
That's a

913
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,400
Really fast

914
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,448
The Boogaloo boys were supposed to be his

915
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
You take it out of this and now he's like

916
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
These guys

917
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
We're all

918
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
Chooses

919
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,200
Sort of distorted views of what Unity

920
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
Is possible or is

921
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
A suitable

922
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,600
And Owen Shroyer seems to be really on the

923
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Unity care

924
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,672
We're outside

925
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
Project

926
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,768
He's talking about like reaching out to Black lives matter in

927
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:42,656
And folks on the last certain I saw I heard him screaming

928
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,472
F*** BLM

929
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,752
Positive that there was a

930
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:52,128
I think they burn the flag

931
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Puerto Rico

932
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:53,919
Okay good

933
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
And Alex

934
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,247
It's kind of like yeah

935
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,855
I'm supposed to be above partisan politics

936
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,415
What happened

937
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,743
I don't want to fight with

938
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:12,863
All demons

939
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,447
We get soap are described them as demons

940
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,823
I got to take over the populace

941
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
Liberals

942
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,431
What do you think

943
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
I think

944
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,807
The reality of what Alex is talking about is

945
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,647
Some people on the left were tricked by my opposition to the Iraq War

946
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,511
I miss back when I could yell about George Bush and I could be beamed

947
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:46,911
Not an incredibly insane extreme right-wing zealots there was a time there where I wasn't

948
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,215
In the pocket of somebody whose mood I was

949
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:55,103
I miss having the facade of rationality because I was to the right

950
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,895
Is George W bush

951
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,223
This is this is silly

952
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,295
Yeah I will I will accept it

953
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Unity

954
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,391
From these people when they apologize

955
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:13,279
Publicly and make amends for it and correct their mistakes then we can be unified again

956
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,559
Until then go f*** your

957
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,119
Speaking of unity

958
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:22,751
Owen believes that he sees opportunity in the GameStop

959
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,799
And Robin Hood situation

960
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:30,431
In order to bring people into the fold this disillusionment right with the proceed

961
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,455
Fairness

962
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,527
Of the stock market is something that he believes

963
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,831
That they can use to bring people into the rec

964
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,159
Of the Infowars universe

965
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,207
And I believe that that is

966
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,767
False Unity I believe that

967
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,839
The kind of thing that you see constantly

968
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,399
With anything that galvanizes people put

969
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
Pic-a-lilli online

970
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
You'll see an attempt

971
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
Infiltration of it by

972
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,287
Right wing

973
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
Demagogue

974
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,383
And I can see a bit of Owen

975
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,431
Seeing an opportunity there

976
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
Although

977
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
I don't think

978
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,039
That it's going to be a fat

979
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
It's going to be something

980
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,743
It's going to be even discussed on info about it too much cuz it's not

981
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:19,327
Not really a big issue and it also is something that

982
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,143
I just see it as being like

983
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,423
This might be a wedge

984
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,471
This might be something we can use

985
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,519
And Owen just doesn't have the shop

986
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,103
So we get to the the Nextbook book a little boy

987
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,175
Who comes a nice guy named Magnus pen video

988
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
Music

989
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:44,415
He is the Buffalo boy who was recently interviewed on the Jimmy Dore show seems to be somebody who's

990
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Sing the round

991
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,231
A bit in terms of like being

992
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,535
Someone who people will interview

993
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
Sure and

994
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,119
I can understand why because he doesn't

995
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
Sound crazy

996
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
Which is

997
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
I mean A+

998
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:04,127
For a public face of a group if I was going to be the public face of a group whose main goal was

999
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:07,199
The second Civil War

1000
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,527
Come on I'm a good dude I'm smart

1001
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:16,159
Conversational. I like all sorts of people

1002
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,231
And he has a different approach

1003
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,583
Sort of a good cop bad cop kind of thing with Mike Dunn

1004
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,631
Where Mike Dunn when he was on

1005
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,655
The day before

1006
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:30,239
Was kind of being brushed

1007
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,591
We're the ones who pretend you do

1008
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,151
Alex is taking that long

1009
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,735
And also now has softened so much

1010
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,783
Yeah, lip balm

1011
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,879
The salvage or feel better

1012
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,511
Give us your view on what the boogaloos really are and what you guys just did

1013
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
What just unfolded

1014
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,607
Activate the boogaloos

1015
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:03,007
Yeah we're just kind of a Libertarian Anarchist coalition

1016
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,055
Kind of a militia more of a movement

1017
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,847
We started off

1018
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,639
In the lockdowns that makes

1019
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,735
Expanded throughout the whole George George Floyd

1020
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,807
Once and we just continue to be operating on the ground is

1021
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
Kind of a moor

1022
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,135
Unifying not right or left

1023
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,671
Armed movements

1024
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
F*** you

1025
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,535
Like that actually I want to get the left involved

1026
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,631
Isn't the way

1027
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,679
No no

1028
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:36,287
I I think that you already see a contradiction between with Mike Dunn

1029
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
The saying and what Magna

1030
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Message saying

1031
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:44,735
He sang we got started in the lockdown this girl out of jokes about a second

1032
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:50,111
Civil War I am not going to be told lies about your own history by a fish

1033
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,415
Accountants sounds like

1034
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:58,815
Ifucking accounting damn you're just saying that cuz the release the Boogaloo is there a real dork

1035
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,631
Joke to start off an account

1036
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,167
Alex

1037
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Really

1038
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Making

1039
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
They talked

1040
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,103
Here you are and in a lot of ways he talks

1041
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
Talking about how like

1042
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,223
I had this bad feeling about Mike done but I was wrong

1043
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,327
Maybe I've been

1044
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,239
Have you guys over all do have a good goal

1045
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,567
Are you guys acceleration of do you want a revolution

1046
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,359
I mean

1047
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:47,967
We have you not only that A revolution is inevitable but yes we want a revolution

1048
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Form that takes

1049
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
Peaceful

1050
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,343
People's Revolution is he

1051
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,671
Ignorant

1052
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,207
Got to go after that they're going to try to

1053
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,999
The Destroyer

1054
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
On the offense

1055
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,607
So I just think that he's steamrolling Alex

1056
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,423
Letting this guy

1057
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,471
Haven't have a

1058
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
Very

1059
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
Friendly platform

1060
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,847
To present this exactly how he want

1061
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
And it's

1062
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:16,895
It is

1063
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
Unaccept

1064
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,455
Diebold assembling

1065
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,015
To be like we want a peaceful Revolution

1066
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
But

1067
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
No

1068
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
.

1069
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,183
Now if you want to continue that

1070
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
Thought and say

1071
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,999
We want a peaceful Revolution

1072
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
.

1073
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,351
We believe that there is going to be resistant

1074
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,655
To that we will fight that

1075
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,935
Peacefully

1076
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,263
Then that's cool. There's there's two kinds of

1077
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
Approaches

1078
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,823
That icbing

1079
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
Possible

1080
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:51,455
We have something like this group that is really interested in

1081
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,247
Gunma concern

1082
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,295
And what have you Second Amendment

1083
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:59,391
Stuff that you can have somebody who's like okay I disagree with oppa

1084
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
Open carry restrict

1085
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,255
So we're going to get people together and we're going to have an open carry March

1086
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Right right

1087
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,607
There's two things that can do to purchase you can't

1088
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:13,983
Take one is that we expect we're going to get arrested and then that arrest we will accept

1089
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,543
And we will use that to try and

1090
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
Change

1091
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,639
Public opinion by virtue of

1092
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,967
Are arrest seeming unfair to most people

1093
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:30,367
Or you could take the approach of we're going to do this and we're going to threaten people with these

1094
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Arrest us

1095
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,183
Someone might get shot

1096
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
I think the first

1097
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,511
Might be

1098
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:41,119
The first one is something that even if I disagree with your position on the open

1099
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
Open carry laws

1100
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
Are you Siri

1101
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:47,519
Problem with someone doing a demonstration in a protest like that

1102
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
When it comes to like

1103
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
Someone might get

1104
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:55,455
That's that's what we're in dangerous territory

1105
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,015
Eating their their b*******

1106
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,063
About unity and all that stuff

1107
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,159
I I think immediately to a Fred Hampton

1108
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,951
Like Fred Hampton

1109
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,719
What is

1110
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,815
A person who went into the Second Amendment groups these f******

1111
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,607
Militia groups and was like hey

1112
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,935
This is a class struggle this is about us

1113
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,471
And convince them

1114
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,751
And they joined

1115
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
And then they act

1116
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,103
Did peacefully and that's why Fred Hampton was murdered

1117
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,663
Because it was that moving to the left

1118
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,967
If it's the other way around

1119
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,991
Yeah we're in

1120
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:35,903
So Magnus believes and expresses that the man is trying to get everyone

1121
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
Each other right

1122
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Sure sure

1123
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
Alex

1124
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,279
Okay cool

1125
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,071
Cool

1126
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,351
But a

1127
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
The cops

1128
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
What about you guys

1129
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
Okay

1130
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,727
He does not get the answer he want

1131
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,519
Right now is

1132
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,055
Is trying to get everyone to fight

1133
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,615
And kill each other instead of coming together against

1134
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,919
They want all of these groups they want

1135
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,455
Antifa they want 34

1136
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,247
Centers they want all these groups to

1137
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,271
The other side

1138
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,807
Evil thing in the world and it's

1139
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
Secretly

1140
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
Destroy them

1141
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
So they can laugh

1142
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
All the way to the bank

1143
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,207
Kill each other

1144
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,511
But there's no doubt that's going on but I mean

1145
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:15,583
Local police

1146
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,423
At this point I find it hard to believe that the local

1147
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
When you look at Gunn

1148
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,775
Station

1149
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
Police are just going along with that and

1150
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,847
When you look at

1151
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
Lockdown

1152
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,639
When you look at a rest

1153
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,407
Asking people over

1154
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
When you look at

1155
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,223
Austin protest

1156
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,759
Whether they be right-winger left

1157
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,319
Task very aggressively and laughing about

1158
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:40,927
Obviously I'm not saying that officer friendly in a small town has never done

1159
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
Anything wrong

1160
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,719
Some horrible individual

1161
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,743
When you look at

1162
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,279
The institution of policing

1163
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
Bastian Tire

1164
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,607
Bape forsaken Liberty and all Direct

1165
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,935
Interesting here is that

1166
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,007
Magnus is coming in with a complex.

1167
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
Alex

1168
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,823
Can't really deal with

1169
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,615
Well he started with

1170
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:06,015
People are trying to divide the left and right saying both sides are the most evil people on the planet

1171
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,063
So they can never communicate with each other

1172
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,367
And while they're doing that they're laughing all the way to the bank

1173
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,159
Remind you of anyone

1174
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
1

1175
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,743
Connect individual comes to mind

1176
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:20,863
The exact person that he's talking to his all of his time talking about how

1177
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,911
Methhead demon-spawn

1178
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
Whatever

1179
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,727
Leaving that aside

1180
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,495
Like

1181
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,591
I I don't agree and I'm not going to side with

1182
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,127
Magnus

1183
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
Issues with

1184
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,431
Policing

1185
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,479
Issues with police

1186
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,599
And Alex can try and deny that kind of stuff as much as he wants but

1187
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,183
Magnus says he has a more interesting perspective

1188
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,463
Savannah on

1189
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,255
The police then Alex

1190
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,303
I would counsel

1191
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,327
Very hard

1192
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,607
To remember

1193
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,143
This m*********** is lying

1194
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,215
He said he's making well

1195
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,775
Making good point maybe in the service of

1196
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:04,127
Lies maybe not lying cuz I do believe that he does have problems with police

1197
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,199
That's more I think

1198
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,503
What is

1199
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,807
His attention to know this is

1200
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,879
This is absolutely a f******

1201
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:21,535
B******* way of being like see I listen to the problems on the left and we're going to pay attention and when they

1202
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Join us

1203
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,607
We're going to team up and solve those problems

1204
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,655
I don't know Dan

1205
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,959
Have we seen what happens when

1206
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:33,823
Let's say right-wing grifters find something no longer used

1207
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,615
8 oz

1208
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,943
But I would suggest that if you were

1209
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,967
Thinking about

1210
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,271
Them having good point

1211
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,551
You remember what they

1212
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,319
They do whenever

1213
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,343
You're no longer you

1214
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,879
Yeah and

1215
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,415
I mean not for nothing

1216
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,743
In the wake of this dude being on Jimmy Dore show

1217
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:52,767
Some people did

1218
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,815
Look through his Twitter and found him

1219
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,887
Supporting Kyle Rittenhouse

1220
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:03,775
I don't know man I don't know I don't know about this

1221
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:10,175
For Alex though the question comes back to pretty constantly as it did with Mike

1222
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,711
Kuiu Target in

1223
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,503
I want to ask you about

1224
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,039
In a revolution and what

1225
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,087
Your goals would be of that Revolution

1226
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,135
Will that do Declaration of Independence

1227
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,719
Big Tech

1228
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,279
Nether

1229
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,543
Tweakers attacked Apple they would have legitimate

1230
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,687
I'm just saying all the time or what

1231
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,711
Are the local police

1232
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,271
That sounds like a communist takeover of local government

1233
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:54,207
No time for him to respond to that diatribe

1234
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,791
And again it just comes down to Alex like is his

1235
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,351
His two issues seem to be like

1236
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,399
This isn't being director

1237
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
Goodbye me

1238
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:06,239
And you're not targeting the people that I want you to talk

1239
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,519
Yeah yeah

1240
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,311
My biggest issue

1241
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,591
Is

1242
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,151
Why isn't everybody doing what I say

1243
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,687
Belkin b as X

1244
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:21,087
Is Italy anti-global is very clearly like I am against global

1245
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,367
Globalist

1246
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,487
It doesn't matter because Alex doesn't see them blowing up

1247
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:35,935
Can you imagine that's what Trump in the Senate would be like he's like why is everybody doing what I want to do

1248
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:40,031
That's the whole thing it's a quorum I am a narcissist

1249
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,055
I can't spell quorum

1250
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,615
Soccer notes quorum

1251
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,639
Quokka

1252
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,919
Alex

1253
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,455
Do you know he is problem

1254
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,991
Seems to be that like

1255
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
They have a revolution in mine

1256
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,575
Revolutions probably good

1257
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,183
It's not my Revolution and it kind of is a problem

1258
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
Annie Bakes

1259
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,255
An insane analogy

1260
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
We had

1261
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
But you're done on yesterday

1262
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,143
Really thought about after the interview

1263
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:10,239
In the world

1264
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,615
And if they can successfully who that be great

1265
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,663
I'm just really concerned about

1266
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,223
The goal

1267
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,623
General

1268
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,415
Respected lawyers and

1269
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
The Confederacy

1270
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,231
You're literally describing the Confederate

1271
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:37,119
That's 100%

1272
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:42,495
And so we will reform our new Union and we have that right

1273
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
I just see what happens

1274
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,055
The capital

1275
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,079
Which

1276
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
Those two burglars bragged about

1277
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,407
Don't try to walk that back whatever

1278
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,711
I wouldn't call it a salt

1279
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,479
I would call it a

1280
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,039
A pissing contest I would call if you like

1281
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,391
That's what you call it

1282
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,999
Wow

1283
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
Dan

1284
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
What you see

1285
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,351
Movies like Animal House

1286
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,471
Walking off of lectern

1287
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,543
In the door there was some ass Justified

1288
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,567
It was wrong

1289
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:22,943
Not a new Pearl Harbor

1290
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,247
Your mouth is open as if in

1291
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Surprised

1292
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,087
But what you don't understand is that the storming of the capital of was

1293
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:32,159
Is basically like you know how like an old TV show

1294
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,023
So so what

1295
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:41,119
Is that the Patriots

1296
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,679
Jump the General Lee over the capital bill

1297
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:48,031
That's what we're describing here basically it's

1298
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
Blake tpn

1299
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:54,175
Yeah yeah lot of cops.

1300
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,991
The right-wingers just egg

1301
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:03,391
The capital what are you do we were throwing a little prank come on

1302
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,207
Let me put the capital

1303
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,231
Wow

1304
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:13,887
Just while they waited until the capital passed out and then they put shaving cream on it and tickle the capital with a feather

1305
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,167
I just don't know what to

1306
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
Juon

1307
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
And someone would

1308
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,727
Try and say that

1309
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
Like I just

1310
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
Caesars

1311
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,055
What is just

1312
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,103
I want to get a white

1313
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,943
Glove and challenge him to a duel I don't know what to do about that

1314
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,735
I would say that

1315
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,527
If this is just like

1316
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,807
Slightly above

1317
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,087
Brett pranks

1318
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:37,695
Why are you talking about it so much that's a good plan

1319
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,767
Also I don't remember

1320
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:44,607
Spending days and days trying to scapegoat a frat prank

1321
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:48,703
Anyway Alex is seeing the interview with Jimmy Dore

1322
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,727
Did this guy did

1323
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
And he loves it

1324
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,823
And even before I even went on Jimmy Dore the only

1325
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,359
I could even get on with

1326
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,199
Which was a small decentralized

1327
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,159
Yeah and I'm so happy for him to have me come on because

1328
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,975
What is given me the ability to do is to break

1329
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,791
Through all the mainstream media lies about us because

1330
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,559
Bears

1331
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,607
Extremist experts and journalists

1332
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,399
Covered us all year long

1333
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,935
Buckler eight-year-old

1334
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,703
A video in

1335
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,007
Text evidence showing what are movements about

1336
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,799
And it doesn't line up with the with the main

1337
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,823
It has all

1338
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,895
These extremists

1339
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,943
Work for DC

1340
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,735
And quote them on certain parts

1341
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063
What time is this

1342
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Yes we work with

1343
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
Dlm

1344
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,391
Those parts of their report and

1345
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,927
And run us all rough

1346
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:45,023
The media and I feel the same thing

1347
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,071
3%

1348
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,143
Yeah

1349
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,423
F*** you

1350
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:57,311
The criticism is that the mainstream media Lacks

1351
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,847
Some sort of nuance

1352
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,383
Staying reporting on groups

1353
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,407
Particularly like

1354
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,431
The bugs

1355
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
Sign

1356
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,735
Great

1357
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,807
I don't know if you're broken

1358
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,111
I'm through that by being with Jimmy Dorsey

1359
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:13,439
Say no I would argue no but then you know this

1360
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,463
This is going to wind up with

1361
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
This dumbass being all over

1362
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,023
For the place I imagine

1363
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:23,679
Jimmy Dore

1364
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
Assertive

1365
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:30,079
High point of it will be him going on Tucker

1366
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,615
But I don't I don't know if

1367
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,895
I don't know if he has the Escape

1368
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,663
Trajectory

1369
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:37,503
To get out of that bubble very much. I mean like

1370
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
It does

1371
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,295
It does indicate

1372
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:40,831
Kind of

1373
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,855
Places

1374
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,391
But he has access to

1375
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,951
Includes Infowars

1376
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,511
Jimmy Dore yeah

1377
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
At that should

1378
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,095
How to put pause in a lot of people's minds

1379
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,119
It's not a good sign

1380
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:53,887
No

1381
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,655
No

1382
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,191
So everybody

1383
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:58,495
I'm going to go out on a limb

1384
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,799
And say that most white supremacist

1385
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,079
Would deny it

1386
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,407
Oh yeah I've been emptied the issue comes down to

1387
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,199
The group is

1388
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,783
The character the group itself is not white supremacist

1389
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
And a lot of

1390
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,087
I mean obviously there

1391
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,367
Probably are

1392
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:19,999
A fair number of white supremacist to fall under the Boogaloo category

1393
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
Fair enough

1394
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:27,167
The group itself is not white nationalist way to supremacist

1395
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,191
Dim character

1396
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:28,959
And that is something

1397
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,983
That's the nuance

1398
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,519
What's that is kind of difficult

1399
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,311
For people who aren't

1400
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,591
Engaged in these things

1401
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,871
The relief to really

1402
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:40,479
That's where clunky conversations,

1403
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,527
The white supremacist Boogaloo group

1404
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
And then

1405
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,343
Kind of blue look

1406
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,647
I'd like you don't know what you're talkin about

1407
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,463
It's difficult even for me

1408
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:54,047
Definitely understand where exactly a lot of the lines are

1409
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,095
Alex tries to

1410
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,887
This conversation

1411
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,935
Far nicer

1412
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
Then the one with Mike

1413
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,239
And

1414
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,287
It's weird because

1415
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:08,639
The territory that Magnus is getting into should be really hot

1416
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
Stole stuff for Alice

1417
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,687
Like

1418
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
Magnus

1419
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,991
Is defending a

1420
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,807
Alex Jones

1421
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,855
And that's weird secured

1422
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,671
You believe in free speech antifa doesn't

1423
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,463
Is funded by Soros on record

1424
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,743
I mean

1425
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,567
The police infiltrated

1426
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,871
To cause chaos

1427
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
False flag

1428
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,919
Some of those same

1429
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,735
People that were at those WTO riots in Seattle

1430
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,015
Are the same people that I

1431
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,807
2 today better part of panties

1432
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,391
Going to get really disillusion when they hear things

1433
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,975
Just like you they hate

1434
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,255
They hate

1435
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,791
Goebel oatmeal Corporation

1436
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
Free speech

1437
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,863
Fox News or something

1438
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,399
The camera on one guy that has a

1439
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,959
I speak for all of Auntie

1440
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,751
Global

1441
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,431
This is a problem for Alex

1442
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:17,503
Because he has contracts

1443
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,295
To remember the things I say

1444
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,855
Well that's a problem but also

1445
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:28,255
If Alex actually believe that the quote-unquote Soros antifa contracts at Harrison Smith out of 4chan

1446
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,839
Document should not be compelling to him

1447
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,375
This argument to be like

1448
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:36,447
Do you understand I have contract between Alexander Soros

1449
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:41,823
America

1450
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,103
You sir

1451
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Don't know

1452
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
You're being trick

1453
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:48,223
By the people on the ground who are

1454
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,039
Who are all time, yeah

1455
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:02,047
Magnus ver magnusson or whatever your name is

1456
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,583
Let me tell you this right now

1457
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:09,983
Everyone in antifa had to sign a contract I've got the document for you right here go ahead and read through the old

1458
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:16,639
An idiot aren't iPhone 0

1459
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,687
Stuff up because Magnus would laugh in his face

1460
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,967
I supposed to think

1461
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:26,111
It would be embarrassing that's why Alex is derrida's fall apart because they're built on nothing

1462
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,415
Alex himself doesn't believe them

1463
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:32,767
When presented with somebody who probably isn't going to play along

1464
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
This is what I keep

1465
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,327
Coming into is that like

1466
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,351
Alex

1467
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
Should not

1468
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,167
Engaged

1469
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:39,935
With zelle

1470
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:44,543
Yeah he's a pretend Zealot and he's going to get found out when you go up against a real

1471
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:50,943
And that's why he can't bring out his real narratives that he uses all the time on his show because

1472
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:57,343
We'd be punctured so fast he's an instant disadvantage and somehow he still believes when he has these people

1473
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,903
I can take care of it

1474
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,255
The great reset is the problem

1475
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,815
Or something needs to be a revolution

1476
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,887
Probably Alex to work with

1477
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
Antifa

1478
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,751
We should be able to unify everybody against the great race that is literally

1479
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,311
A corporate takeover consolidate power

1480
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,335
Mentalism

1481
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
31

1482
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,919
Universal income

1483
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:24,223
So they can dictate the terms of our surrender we have

1484
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:24,991
Got

1485
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,271
To get everybody mobilizing

1486
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,831
What is your view of Magnus about

1487
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,599
The great reset

1488
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,415
I agree and

1489
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,719
Because I had this conversation with an aunt

1490
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:37,535
Remember they agree to it's not that

1491
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,071
That's the idea of like Alexa

1492
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,631
System everywhere but they are perfectly aware that

1493
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
People that are pushy

1494
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,495
About all these multinational billion-dollar Banks and everything

1495
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:56,223
We need a reset but it's not this recent don't you this is a horrible reset start

1496
01:05:56,479 --> 01:06:01,343
There's a difference between a reset that involves rethinking our approach

1497
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,903
To climate issues rethinking our

1498
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,927
Approach

1499
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,207
To what

1500
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
People need to live

1501
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:12,095
Kind of thing and reset that involves

1502
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,887
A civil war

1503
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:17,727
Those are very different and if you talk about them

1504
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:21,311
Revolution

1505
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:26,687
Not just like us your buddy in the water is in a way that is incredibly unfair

1506
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,967
And that is

1507
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,295
When you engage in that kind of a disingenuous

1508
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,575
Sleight of hand

1509
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,623
It leads me to suspect

1510
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,951
Maybe a lot of the stuff that you're saying is not

1511
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,999
Since you're not genuine

1512
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,583
And that's one of the problems that I run into with Magnus

1513
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:47,679
And in this next clip I think we really get to see this

1514
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,447
Pretty clearly

1515
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:54,591
Actually I was just on the phone with the woman that was at the WTO riots and she said she would be willing to

1516
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,127
Come out and talk to you so

1517
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,151
If you want to talk to him

1518
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:57,919
Antifa member

1519
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,199
Talk to an antifa member

1520
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,735
But I never one

1521
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,039
Like obviously the

1522
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,343
The dictionary definition of acceleration

1523
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,367
Basin is imbibe

1524
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
Be correct

1525
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,927
Everyone is calling

1526
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
Think everything is

1527
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:16,095
Fundamentally flawed and it will not change without radical change then literally everyone is

1528
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,399
Acceleration

1529
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,703
Acceleration is Rand Paul's

1530
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,263
Accelerationist

1531
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,543
Everyone acknowledges

1532
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,591
Totally

1533
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,127
Destroyed

1534
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
The board

1535
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:36,063
Exactly sold like a lot of people say like oh you want a revolution your acceleration

1536
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,855
Everyone wants a revolution right now

1537
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647
Talking about it

1538
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,415
Twitter

1539
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
This

1540
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:45,279
Is another manipulative sleight-of-hand

1541
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:50,655
The accelerationism that people are talking about when they talk about Fringe right-wing groups

1542
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:54,751
The militia isn't isn't accelerationism towards

1543
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,031
Shooting violence

1544
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:59,359
Ethan accelerationism that's rooted in

1545
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,407
Heightening tensions and

1546
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,943
Highly tense situation

1547
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,479
And protest that

1548
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,015
Have the potential to

1549
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,039
Spin out of hand

1550
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,087
And prove to be an inciting event

1551
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,879
In a conch

1552
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:14,207
Between supposed

1553
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:19,839
Got it size of a civil war we see the water boiling and we want to push it over the edge

1554
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,375
Accelerationism

1555
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,399
That he's

1556
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,679
Trying to make

1557
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,215
The same

1558
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,543
As accelerationism where you have people who are saying

1559
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,079
Climate change is

1560
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,407
A problem that cannot be ignored any longer

1561
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,687
Yep we need to

1562
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:38,271
Elect leaders who were willing to

1563
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,295
Explore ideas

1564
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,831
About regulation

1565
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,367
Okay

1566
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,903
It's not the same

1567
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,231
Recognizing that our system

1568
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,791
Is flawed in many ways and we are pasta

1569
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,095
The point possibly even past the point

1570
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,631
Where we can

1571
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,471
Totally fix all of the issues sure he's not the same

1572
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,519
Is thinking everything is f*****

1573
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:02,079
And we should hope for a civil war

1574
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:02,847
Because

1575
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,431
It's going to happen eventually so why not do it now

1576
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,479
That's dishonest

1577
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,759
100%

1578
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:15,647
I I mean yeah I understand this guy and you're you're 100% right good cop bad cop

1579
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,439
Bulshit with these two

1580
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,231
But God I prefer

1581
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,535
The a****** from the other day

1582
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,327
Cuz he and also he's just going to be like

1583
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,863
Yeah f*** yeah

1584
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
Blow it up

1585
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:32,799
You know like I don't like this lying piece of s*** coming at me with his accountant I think that Mike was still lying to

1586
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:36,895
It was still trying to put on a Pioneer

1587
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,967
Facade do what he actually is believing

1588
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,735
In promoting

1589
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,783
But yeah this

1590
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,319
This is

1591
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,391
Just intrinsically unfair

1592
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,439
Yeah yeah yeah

1593
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,975
What do you presenting

1594
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,255
It's intentional

1595
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,047
Because

1596
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,119
He kind of understands that there's a lot of Alex's audiences

1597
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:57,887
Probably pocha

1598
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:03,263
And it's hard to like bring up AOC and all I think of is

1599
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:08,127
Ted Cruz being like being like hey you tried to murder me go fuc

1600
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,663
Yourself

1601
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:14,527
I get it you can bring up how antifa and BLM are also against the

1602
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:18,367
Bad or whatever it is you want you tried to murder all of us

1603
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:22,719
The other problem too is that I do

1604
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:27,839
I do think that there probably are some accelerationist types

1605
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,607
On the left

1606
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:35,007
You can rationalize I'm get away to that issue of like

1607
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,031
You can

1608
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,567
Find Eco fascist

1609
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,359
Find eco-terrorist

1610
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,943
That's not the mainstream

1611
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,247
And I'm ghetto

1612
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,039
I would save it probably

1613
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:50,111
The Boogaloo boys are a little bit outside of

1614
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,159
The strict mainstream of the right

1615
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:58,047
But they're closer than eco-terrorists are to the mainstream of the lab

1616
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,351
Mnm comparing

1617
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,167
You know I don't know I don't know if he would do this

1618
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,959
By comparing like

1619
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,239
I don't know

1620
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:09,311
Gun-wielding accelerationist to protest

1621
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,103
To Greta thunberg

1622
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:17,759
I think it's unfair comparison

1623
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:24,159
AR to the UN I remember that didn't she do that what you gave that speech

1624
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,463
So Magnus wants

1625
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,487
Peaceful option

1626
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,351
Again do you leave a public representative of a group that isn't

1627
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,631
Hayirli based around

1628
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,191
The fantasy of a second Civil War

1629
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:39,263
To the point where

1630
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:42,335
Listener pointed this out to me

1631
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,383
Bring it up on her last episode

1632
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,455
Wearing a Hawaiian shirt

1633
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,991
Is about Civil War it's

1634
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:52,319
The gate have to get around social media

1635
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,647
Big luau instead of Boogaloo

1636
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,719
But everything is about you anymore

1637
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:01,791
You got

1638
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:05,631
I think that he is one Alex over to an embarrassing extent

1639
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,167
And we need to keep trying

1640
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,703
Peach blossom

1641
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,495
The armor to BP

1642
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,031
They continue to

1643
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,591
One after another

1644
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,431
If they keep doing that

1645
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,223
Keep denying people

1646
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,247
Redress

1647
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,575
Then you're going to have

1648
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,647
And it's going to be really bad for

1649
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,439
For them for us and for everyone involved

1650
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,279
I'm really impressed

1651
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
I'm glad

1652
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
I love to have you on with the

1653
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,399
The lady

1654
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,447
Reach out to these folks that I understand that

1655
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,471
We can all drink

1656
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:49,407
You're not drinking to mainstream media Kool-Aid it's your Kool-Aid

1657
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:53,247
Magnus has got Alex so on the ropes

1658
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,783
But he's willing to work with

1659
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,807
Antifa

1660
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:02,719
I mean China run antifa it's hard not to see that like

1661
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,023
Oh well you're just nicer to Alec

1662
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:09,119
You know like he healed course he agrees with all of this s***

1663
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,655
Theoretically in his mind

1664
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
But

1665
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:19,103
This guy's being nicer than my done so you guys might have a good point you're being real deferential and I do

1666
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:23,199
I don't see you as a physical threat so who knows

1667
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:27,295
How this would have gone if Magnus was the first one

1668
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:30,111
I don't think this interview can be seeing

1669
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,903
Outside of the context of

1670
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,439
The prior one

1671
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:35,231
Very badly for 100

1672
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:40,607
And it's not like I made you have to be delusional to think that Mike and Magnus don't know each other

1673
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:44,959
Yeah you're probably right

1674
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:50,335
About Alex getting

1675
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,871
I'm going to go on

1676
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,407
It was cool

1677
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:59,807
All you got to do is say that he's a good dude and super smart

1678
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:03,135
This is embarrassing and Alex

1679
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
Is

1680
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Just

1681
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,999
So bad speaking of

1682
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,839
Interviews now Stewart Roads of the oath

1683
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:16,959
Keepers comes Andre could work into this idea that some of them got arrested

1684
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,519
And took

1685
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,311
Shifting gears

1686
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,151
Constitutional lawyer

1687
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,687
Award-winning researcher

1688
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
You name it

1689
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,807
What awards

1690
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,087
Nonviolent

1691
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:33,855
Defensive

1692
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,695
Keepers

1693
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,231
Arrested party

1694
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,255
Members of Congress

1695
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,583
What do a very good job there in the capital just run around Lihue

1696
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,631
Any of that

1697
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,167
Y'all when we woo

1698
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,215
They were like Jeffrey Osborne

1699
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:52,287
Junior

1700
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,055
It is

1701
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,847
It's kind of astonishing

1702
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,919
Quickly

1703
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,943
Hand wave

1704
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,759
A literal violent coup

1705
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,319
Yeah it's Astana

1706
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,367
Well it's so important

1707
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:09,695
For people like Alex of people on the right to do that because

1708
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,487
So indicative of

1709
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,791
The sort of danger that they present

1710
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
X2

1711
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:18,655
A civil insane Society could say that the enemy is within

1712
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,727
It's very important

1713
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:26,079
That's the hand waving have just don't understand why people who

1714
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,615
On the other side

1715
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:28,639
Don't

1716
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,919
Keep stressing this

1717
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,991
Really aggressive

1718
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
Cowardice

1719
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:34,783
Money

1720
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:38,623
I think I think maybe but I think also just kind of like

1721
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,927
We all are just exhausted

1722
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:47,071
That part

1723
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,607
Go to bed

1724
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,655
A lot of the time whenever I'm

1725
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,727
Lionel getting an episode ready Alex will say something like

1726
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:58,335
Yeah and then I have to like

1727
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,103
Deal with it

1728
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,151
Sometimes in life

1729
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,967
You run into walls like that news don't want to deal with it

1730
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,551
Maybe some people don't want to do

1731
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,623
With veteran hand-waving is a good way to do it

1732
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,415
I mean when you look for Alex

1733
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,975
It's it's an existential threat

1734
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:18,303
Recognizing that his worldview implies this

1735
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:24,447
Is is really dangerous crap conclusion of what you say

1736
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:28,031
This is not some like infiltration this is not some like

1737
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:32,383
Oops we were meaning to do this and then this happened this is what

1738
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:35,455
End goal was and you did it stupid and you lost

1739
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,807
Unlike Jeffrey Osborne who won

1740
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:46,207
Trying to do it. I was just

1741
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:49,791
Talking about in terms of awards Stewart Road

1742
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,583
I don't know what

1743
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,607
The case is here

1744
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,679
You what he was at Yale he apparently one

1745
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,983
An award for paper on enemy

1746
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,007
Combatant status

1747
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
But he wrote

1748
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,567
Think I was able to find the paper

1749
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,847
Any flaw

1750
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:07,967
I didn't read all of it but I read some of it in as I kind of seems like college paper

1751
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,295
It would have been a

1752
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,575
Pink 2000

1753
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,647
Conveniently

1754
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,671
Yale

1755
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:19,999
Their records online come out 2005

1756
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,047
Oh so weird

1757
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,631
So I was able to find the recipients list of pea shooters

1758
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:30,751
2005

1759
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:34,847
It reminds me of Mumford the movie Mumford

1760
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,175
Oh yeah yeah

1761
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:44,575
It's being a psychologist everybody who could verify his time in college.

1762
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:49,183
Daiso weird so weird we've we've met some people like that in the past

1763
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,487
So

1764
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,023
Store

1765
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,839
Is kind of like a

1766
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,143
Where the situation that our founding fathers

1767
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,727
That's what we need to do is set up a ton of a cities

1768
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
I think okay

1769
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543
Make sure you do with the doubters to

1770
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,383
The reunited

1771
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:11,199
Mutual defense and also for

1772
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:11,967
Grassroots

1773
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:12,735
Politics

1774
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:15,295
Separated themselves

1775
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,343
Even before

1776
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,439
Smuggle

1777
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,007
Underground let's jump

1778
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,799
Let's just

1779
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:42,943
Alex is currently in a luxury resort in Utah

1780
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,247
He has an iPhone in his pocket

1781
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,319
This is this is ridiculous

1782
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,599
God damn I hate

1783
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,367
These people Selma

1784
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:53,183
It's a bit of a mess but not as much of a mess

1785
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,743
As Alex's narratives about January

1786
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:58,303
Yes this is a huge problem for him

1787
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,887
Because as we've seen he's had to gradually expand the narrative

1788
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,167
Based on

1789
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:10,079
New people who get arrested eration of this narrative

1790
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,127
One of the reasons for that

1791
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
Is

1792
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,199
The people that he's tried to blame

1793
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:17,247
The Boogaloo boys stood up to him

1794
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:20,831
And he got embarrassed by two of them

1795
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,879
He can't

1796
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,415
Throw The Oath Keepers on

1797
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,719
He's too connected to them

1798
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,487
Stewart Road

1799
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,791
This is good buddy Yep they're they're tight

1800
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,071
He can't do it

1801
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,119
Cowboys

1802
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:39,775
He also probably can't throw them under the bus completely Joe Biggs was like the second-in-command he used to work it in full ride

1803
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:46,175
Enrique tarrio they were independent contractors that kind of stuff that those people

1804
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:51,295
On the show before he spoke Alex's c-pack of honey

1805
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,575
This

1806
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:59,743
Alex could be like I was in bed drunk

1807
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:05,887
It's too difficult for him and so now he has to kind of like

1808
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
Do this

1809
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:21,248
Founder of the OT bridge is here with us

1810
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,040
Worried about this

1811
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:27,648
12 hours or so self-styled militia members in three states begin

1812
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,720
WebAdvisor capital

1813
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,512
Breach USC

1814
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,352
Well I sure didn't bring the weapons and I sure didn't do all the things they supposedly

1815
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:45,312
It was the Q phenomenon behind the scenes that also secretly Trump's giving orders to storm DC and all that

1816
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
Honest having

1817
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,640
People demonstration

1818
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,688
Calling for a senate investigation

1819
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,968
Ted Cruz is calling for

1820
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,248
When you get the demon

1821
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,552
System

1822
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:56,832
Weather

1823
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,416
What is the capital

1824
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:03,744
Ellie got a few problems you get a few boogaloos you get a few

1825
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,024
Keepers in the mix

1826
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,216
This is the new Pearl Harbor

1827
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,776
The Narrative now is just

1828
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:22,432
So intensely complicated and shifted so far over the course of the last couple weeks

1829
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:23,968
It's

1830
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:28,064
Continuing to go along with this is

1831
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,088
Just embarrassing

1832
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:30,880
Cuz Alex

1833
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,208
At every stage is that he's proven all the thief

1834
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,488
Yep and then everything

1835
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,768
Things shift so now

1836
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,536
Hugh

1837
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,608
Is the Q movement is the real villain Shore

1838
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:45,728
And there's a couple of people who I guess I would go probably I'm going to guess soon he's going to say sheep-dipped

1839
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,520
You going to call these people shoot

1840
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:51,616
Yeah there's going to be a couple sheep-dipped people in each of these groups

1841
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,688
That were there as infiltrated provoke

1842
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:58,272
Contours all these groups are actually good

1843
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,808
Just had a couple people who are

1844
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,832
Apples

1845
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,880
And those groups were actually globalist

1846
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,904
Plants

1847
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,184
Busy

1848
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,464
Too complicated

1849
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:12,352
I guess I guess he has too many Q followers that listen to his show but if it were me I would just go

1850
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:15,168
Hardon cubing controlled by the globalist

1851
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:15,936
The whole way

1852
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,728
I know he's hurting the cube

1853
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:20,288
Turn all the cute people into global

1854
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,824
Snow that's kind of where he's at

1855
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,872
Right but I mean like straight-up

1856
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,152
Queen braids

1857
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:28,480
Everything is their fault they're the globe

1858
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,248
Sure

1859
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,272
You know

1860
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,808
I think that's interesting

1861
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,344
I think

1862
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,136
Can you be difficult

1863
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:35,904
2

1864
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:42,304
Like argue that all the people who believe in queue are aware of a globalist Plata but they're apart of

1865
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,072
Kosher

1866
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:43,840
That's okay

1867
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,376
He's he's saying

1868
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,656
Accu is globalist

1869
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,680
Intelligence and

1870
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
Like that

1871
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,776
But the people who fell for it and we're in on it

1872
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,568
Or do you not like that the followers

1873
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:59,968
Weirdest good researchers who got taken down the wrong path them in with all the people who use eight

1874
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,016
Francophile Democrats

1875
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:08,416
Are evil people there just been caught up in this whole thing you know you just

1876
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,768
Depends on his mood

1877
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,048
Yai

1878
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,632
He don't know I strive to

1879
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,656
Yeah I keep

1880
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,680
Any kind of

1881
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:20,960
Through

1882
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:27,104
We are through line or belief that Alex

1883
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:33,504
Someone is to blame and it's not us it's a fake group is controlled by the global

1884
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,368
Show up against a Boogaloo boy and they're like you're like

1885
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:43,744
Accu s*** man you are the stupid ones you are being controlled by The globalist Who Run cute

1886
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:45,536
I don't know

1887
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:49,120
I think Alex realizes that the new generation

1888
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:52,192
Not going to put up with his b*******

1889
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,472
Stewart Rhodes

1890
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,008
Is not like Outlet

1891
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,032
In many ways

1892
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,080
He's scarier

1893
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,360
Terrified

1894
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:01,920
But Andy also is not

1895
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,456
Somebody who throws people under the bus

1896
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:07,552
That's true Alex is willing to throw anybody under the bus right

1897
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,320
Immediately

1898
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,600
When it's convenient

1899
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:14,464
Yeah I imagine that military service will give you more lawyers

1900
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,512
Loyalty to your comrades in arms

1901
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:19,584
Radio host

1902
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,912
So one of the people that was arrested

1903
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,448
Storming the capital

1904
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,496
One of the three of keepers

1905
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,288
Stewart Rhodes knows for a fact

1906
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,568
Is an oath keeper

1907
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,360
And you won't deny that

1908
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:37,504
And he also spent some time on the show promoting her crowdfunding caved

1909
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,552
GoFundMe set up or not to GoFundMe

1910
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,832
It's on rally today

1911
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:44,928
The fundraiser for Hulu

1912
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,744
Actually remember who was involved in that

1913
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,792
So we can always sit behind our people

1914
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,816
So there you go

1915
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,888
But you aren't part of this

1916
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,424
Nachle na

1917
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,240
I'd never do that now I am going to

1918
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,824
Try and help fun to defend somebody

1919
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,848
They're my people

1920
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,896
That is

1921
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:07,200
A kind of loyalty that is

1922
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:07,968
Foreign

1923
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,736
Infowars

1924
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:15,392
Are you saying the cheetah thing that you personally think was

1925
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,416
The bad idea

1926
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,464
But you're still going to Defender

1927
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,024
What if you threw her under the bus

1928
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:27,424
Then maybe you wouldn't have to deal with it all your money

1929
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:33,056
So we are now in a situation that is exactly the same

1930
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
Identical

1931
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,384
What the colony

1932
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,152
Saw

1933
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
In the colonies

1934
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,968
Okay

1935
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,248
What do you spell

1936
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,296
He's deteriorating

1937
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,600
Extremely, he looks like

1938
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,304
Walmart

1939
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,352
Blue Bloods

1940
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,888
What the hell's going on here

1941
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:05,568
It's you should look at this as DC is now the green zone

1942
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,920
From communist China

1943
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,536
And we're the same exact position

1944
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:28,864
Exact position

1945
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,424
Explain to me how they're the exact same position

1946
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,216
Storages Deadman

1947
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:35,008
I disagree

1948
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,032
Stronger

1949
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:41,664
Stewart is he's not an acceleration is

1950
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:48,832
Siri said we're in the colonies and I'm pretty sure that what that required was that a literal Revolution

1951
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,624
Before that they had people writing pamphlets

1952
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,416
And stuff

1953
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,488
The Oath Keepers are very similar to Thomas

1954
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
Pain

1955
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,536
What might

1956
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,816
1

1957
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:02,400
Were they to be Stewart Road might say that

1958
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,424
Stewart's

1959
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,216
He's trying to

1960
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:05,984
Have this like

1961
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,824
You know like that it's not time for action or whatever

1962
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,360
But he does

1963
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,128
Give

1964
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,432
A little bit of a contradictory message

1965
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,200
Pier

1966
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,480
And It's upsetting

1967
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,784
That shows our weakness because

1968
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:38,752
When they when they try to give orders to violate our rights

1969
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,104
Territorium George

1970
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
We're

1971
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:47,200
We can't wait too much longer

1972
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,480
Because

1973
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:54,880
Confederates

1974
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,464
You have to do something

1975
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,584
The timeline

1976
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,376
Globus tours

1977
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,144
But we've got to do

1978
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,424
I mean folks nobody's happy

1979
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,216
Panther

1980
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,312
I told you that was coming back

1981
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:16,640
3 minutes

1982
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,432
Before you let out literally

1983
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:28,160
You have Stuart saying that there's a sweet spot

1984
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:32,768
I think we have to do something before the military is done purging

1985
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:39,168
Also the military has started that put the clock on it

1986
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:45,568
QVC we're not into acceleration what we are saying is that it's going to happen shortly

1987
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,360
Anybody

1988
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,152
4550 minutes

1989
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,200
Yeah that's not good

1990
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:53,504
The 28th wraps up

1991
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:56,832
Snopes

1992
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,600
You're so good

1993
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,368
You're so good

1994
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,392
29

1995
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,696
Alex is like I said on the road

1996
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,232
He's come back.

1997
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:04,768
30th

1998
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:09,120
Roads are in studio

1999
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:11,168
They're talkin about this dumb documentary

2000
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,960
Talking about how they got a seed

2001
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,496
Very stupid

2002
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,288
Navigate to the 31st

2003
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,056
Sunday

2004
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,080
Episode

2005
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,104
Open Alex's

2006
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:22,688
Basically describing how where in Revelation

2007
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,064
John the Revelator the Isle of Palm

2008
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:28,832
Patmos

2009
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,416
The Beast

2010
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:35,488
Looking forward to it

2011
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,304
That part wasn't in the Bible

2012
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:41,120
Is Drake Marvel

2013
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:46,752
World government cannot buy nor sell that a marshmallow out of the hand

2014
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:53,408
You Must Destroy every genetics you must kill the Earth

2015
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,712
Are you will not be allowed to live

2016
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,992
La pelota

2017
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,808
Believe

2018
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:06,208
John was the greatest science fiction writer ever 2,000 years ago it was not for whether you believe he was

2019
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:08,000
Inspired by God he was not

2020
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
It is not

2021
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
So

2022
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:21,056
The old Chinese proverb says

2023
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:21,824
13 *

2024
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,872
We certainly aren't

2025
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,640
Fishing times

2026
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,712
Armageddon with the dragon

2027
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,064
Folding

2028
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,624
Go get your pop

2029
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,208
Cuz you got front row seats to

2030
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:44,352
Is it 10 years 100 years hours 60 minutes away

2031
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,960
Being an hour

2032
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:53,312
Dragon might be here in an hour okay

2033
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:57,920
Okay so I'm not fair I got to pitch for you

2034
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:58,944
I heard the Grapevine

2035
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,272
Let me get the character

2036
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,928
Okay so

2037
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,232
You've got the Book of Revelation

2038
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:14,816
You've got this whole like Heather the hand on the mark of the bee

2039
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,864
Butcher of the devil

2040
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,144
And you realize

2041
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,936
Everyone has a phone

2042
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,496
So do you get around being

2043
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:25,312
Higher Book of Revelations if you just never attached it

2044
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,104
To somebody's hand or forehead

2045
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:31,968
He just win does he win if everybody has the mark of the beast in there

2046
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:37,856
I mean it would certainly seem to indicate that the prophecy was a little bit

2047
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:39,392
Pittsburgh

2048
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,184
What about like

2049
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,232
I don't know that there's so much

2050
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:46,560
Any of those prophecies like

2051
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,840
Like why

2052
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,608
Custard

2053
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:49,888
That's true

2054
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:52,704
Existed

2055
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:58,592
What am I trying to think.

2056
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,872
French fries

2057
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,920
They did not have those

2058
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,968
That true they can even have friends

2059
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:09,088
I don't know what I'm trying to get

2060
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:12,160
There were some things that were missing

2061
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,440
From the

2062
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:17,024
In terms of it being a wormhole

2063
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:20,352
I don't know I think it's unfair for Alex

2064
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:22,400
Looks to be like could be a hundred years could be an hour

2065
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:25,472
Get your popcorn out you might die before it starts but

2066
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:30,080
Do you have them up already

2067
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,872
Or in 100 years

2068
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,712
So big news

2069
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,248
Yes on Sunday

2070
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:39,808
And it's that Australia has ended

2071
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,856
It's covid development program

2072
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:49,792
I'm about to go Australia suspend Nationwide their entire vaccine program

2073
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,640
Now ladies and gentlemen

2074
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:10,272
In the world

2075
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,344
We are ending our vaccine program.

2076
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,112
House not work

2077
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:17,184
We believe you cannot make a vaccine

2078
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,256
That works to cure the common cold and that's what this is

2079
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:24,096
With even more mutation so it's even more impossible

2080
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:26,656
Alex's editorializing on what the

2081
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:32,800
These companies are sad

2082
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:35,360
Problem

2083
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:43,040
There is that like the one in Australia was developed by the University of Queensland and a biotech firm called CSL

2084
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:45,344
And the one that mercury

2085
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,112
Different

2086
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,648
Don't say we're working on

2087
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:50,464
And those are also different than the Pfizer

2088
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,256
Anna Madonna ones

2089
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,280
They're all fake

2090
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:57,632
Tall fake vaccine treating them like they're all the same thing

2091
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:04,288
It's a it's a syringe with some liquid in it Dan it's the same s*** it's very weird

2092
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,592
Perspectives doesn't understand anything

2093
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:09,664
Actually that's not the news

2094
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,712
Breakfast for the news

2095
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:14,784
The big news has to do with Emmanuel macron

2096
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,576
French president

2097
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,136
Who came out yesterday

2098
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,160
Chronotope

2099
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:20,928
Globalist

2100
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:23,232
Understand

2101
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,280
Metra crime you'll be torn limb from limb

2102
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,304
The riots

2103
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,864
All the signs are coming out

2104
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,240
As opposed to the other

2105
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,080
I told you months ago

2106
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:40,896
I talked to the head of a major biotech company

2107
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,432
That's real gene therapy

2108
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,760
They also sell pillows

2109
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:47,552
And he said you're absolutely right

2110
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,088
Giant Total Takeover

2111
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:52,160
The vaccine will destroy and sterilize women

2112
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:55,744
Kill your immune system off the charts and give you cancer

2113
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:03,424
Too bad for somebody with knowledge

2114
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,960
Potentially save

2115
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,984
The world

2116
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:10,080
Billions of people seem like he would want to get that information out there

2117
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,360
I guess

2118
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:15,200
He's not responsible for

2119
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:21,088
French president macron said that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine appears to be

2120
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:24,160
Quasi ineffective in people older than 70

2121
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,184
65 excuse me

2122
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:28,256
Which is a claim that scientist strongly rebutted

2123
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,280
What about the top

2124
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,072
I don't know who that what that mean

2125
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:37,472
Did not come out against the vaccine or vaccination nor is he trying to save himself from being torn limb from limb

2126
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,496
Also this

2127
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:44,640
Is not the same vaccine as the ones put out by Pfizer in moderna which are the ones that are currently available in the United States

2128
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,944
The claims that Alex is making our

2129
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,992
Surd and it's super convenient

2130
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,528
Big Time specialist

2131
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,088
With magical Medical Technology won't come on the show

2132
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,136
But honestly this is your

2133
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,440
What do you think that's the most I'm about this

2134
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,280
Good enough

2135
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:07,680
The AstraZeneca vaccine that macron is talking about season 2 in mRNA vaccine

2136
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:13,824
If you were a member of the Infowars audience you would think that all these vaccines are getting developer all the same thing

2137
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,664
As if a company is racing to finish the same recipe

2138
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,688
But that's not the

2139
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,456
Case

2140
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:23,552
These are different approaches being taken of varying levels of success Sunset back

2141
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,344
Alex doesn't understand

2142
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,368
The basics of the topic

2143
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,648
Pixies cover

2144
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,672
Cuz work

2145
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:31,744
It is not meant to reflect reality it's meant to push an agenda

2146
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:35,328
And this is just really sad cuz all his

2147
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:39,424
His ideas are about mRNA vaccines being different than vaccine

2148
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:43,264
And that's why this is particularly evil Hema Kronos that

2149
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,104
And that's why he's getting rid of this Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine

2150
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,664
But it turns out isn't an mRNA vaccine

2151
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,200
But Alex doesn't know that

2152
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,504
Macron claims

2153
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,416
Prezenta is almost in effect

2154
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:03,488
Over 65

2155
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:07,584
Alex doesn't know s*** he doesn't know anything he's talking out of his ass

2156
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,888
It's so this is how arguments get made

2157
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,168
So

2158
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:11,936
Australia

2159
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,264
Does not work

2160
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:16,288
Does not work

2161
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,312
Not work

2162
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
Does not work

2163
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,384
That's it

2164
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:23,968
That's the level of shitties bring into the compelling

2165
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:29,856
That is compelling I remember going to

2166
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,904
The mighty first year

2167
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,440
I didn't Ridge

2168
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:36,768
Start out in literature I originally started out in audio production

2169
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,072
And I was there and I was looking

2170
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:39,840
Clipboard

2171
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:43,424
Going through all this stuff and I remember my teacher screaming at base

2172
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,752
Yeah

2173
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:51,360
I think that's part of the game that's being played here is like

2174
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:52,640
The audience

2175
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,944
Is obviously humans

2176
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,224
They

2177
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,016
I think that if someone is yelling

2178
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:58,784
This

2179
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:01,600
Repeatedly over and over again

2180
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:06,720
So definitively he can't possibly be making this up how could you be this

2181
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,768
Confident and make something up at

2182
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:11,072
The same time people can't do that

2183
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,608
Possible.

2184
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:14,144
Simply inconceivable

2185
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:14,912
And

2186
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,448
Unfortunately here we are

2187
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:18,240
So

2188
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,008
Staggering

2189
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:22,336
Statistics about this vaccine that I would beg him to

2190
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,104
Demonstrate

2191
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:25,408
To the vaccines killing

2192
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,456
Not just the famous

2193
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,224
Baseball

2194
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,832
The vaccine

2195
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:35,392
50 year old 6 year old

2196
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:36,928
Dodge

2197
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,464
Before they even leave the clinic

2198
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:43,328
And then have a convulsion and bye-bye an hour later

2199
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,096
Bye-bye

2200
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,824
Absolutely

2201
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,128
They all report

2202
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:58,432
Putting in hospitals and nursing homes that

2203
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,480
5% of the patients are

2204
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:01,760
Dying within a week

2205
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:03,808
The MRNA

2206
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,344
Holyshit

2207
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,160
5%

2208
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,440
Fatality rate

2209
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:13,792
Alex you need to demonstrate that

2210
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:18,656
That is a legit like there should be illegal

2211
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,680
I mean that's it

2212
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:24,544
Insane you could need to somehow demonstrate that like

2213
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:28,896
The him saying that people believed it and it led to harm

2214
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,664
But I do

2215
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,432
Don't think that

2216
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:35,808
Like I don't know how you'd prove it but I believe it like I believed that causes harm absolutely

2217
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,832
Without question

2218
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:39,392
5% mortality rate

2219
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,416
Out Quest

2220
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,952
That's outrageous

2221
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:42,720
F***** up

2222
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:49,120
So f***** up that would be the number one story in history

2223
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:56,544
Culmination of all of Humanity's knowledge about infectious disease results in 5% of

2224
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,080
People dying immediately

2225
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:02,688
And I don't think that you get to make claims like that

2226
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:03,968
Willy-nilly

2227
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:06,272
And yet

2228
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:10,112
If you can't yell fire in a crowded theater you can't tell you it's a lie everybody that they're going to

2229
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:11,392
Die

2230
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:14,208
So the vaccines are a bio-weapon

2231
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:14,976
Apparently

2232
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:18,304
I would like to stress this important point

2233
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,584
That I brought up that

2234
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,912
I don't think Alex knows or cares

2235
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:26,240
These vaccines are all different vaccines

2236
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:29,568
And somewhere not mRNA vaccines

2237
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:32,640
The closing and everybody down right now

2238
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:36,480
Nest

2239
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,528
World leader starting with d

2240
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,576
And starting with senators

2241
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,880
Come out and play

2242
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,928
What do you think

2243
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,696
What do you think

2244
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,720
Kronos

2245
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,512
Do you think the Australian snow

2246
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,560
Suspending their vaccine program

2247
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,328
Because it closed

2248
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,376
Does not work

2249
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,192
Quotes

2250
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,728
Work macron

2251
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,544
Work Australia

2252
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:04,128
It's a f******

2253
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:05,152
No weapon

2254
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:10,016
The MRNA vaccine 14 Serebii

2255
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:12,576
Make train your body

2256
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:19,232
Well one of them at least

2257
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:22,816
That you were bringing up isn't it Mr

2258
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:26,400
Placentas nonsense but there is that

2259
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,936
I just

2260
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:28,960
I don't know

2261
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,496
This is desperate

2262
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:32,288
Anyway

2263
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,824
We don't have time

2264
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,896
Ester all-white

2265
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,432
The inevitable thing

2266
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:41,504
It's going to happen as has always happened

2267
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,320
Is it Alex says something it sounds silly

2268
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:47,392
And then twenty years later what do you know Alex is right

2269
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:50,720
All the way we are living in

2270
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:55,840
Exactly what Alex predicted we would be in 1991 if there's one thing I've learned

2271
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:56,864
From doing this podcast

2272
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,632
Best hits

2273
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,168
Don't

2274
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:02,752
Ever doubt out

2275
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:06,080
It stands up to scrutiny true

2276
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:08,384
He's he's right almost all the time

2277
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,664
Even when it contradicts

2278
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,968
Other things he's almost always right about

2279
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,064
Be very prestigious

2280
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,600
Yeah never believe

2281
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:19,136
He's very dumb

2282
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:21,184
Mostly it's just talkingshit

2283
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:24,512
Remember the s*** he said

2284
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:31,168
Abu don't have time to wait for him to be proven right we need to act on the things that he saying now and just trust that in 20 years

2285
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:37,312
Yours will look back and be like that God we listen to Alex I just don't trust people who make me want who say I should do that

2286
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,616
Very very dangerous types

2287
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:40,640
We don't have time

2288
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,248
Or here later

2289
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,296
How to get that song about who's right

2290
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:50,112
The enemy has written plans

2291
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,416
It's so easy to beat the

2292
01:42:56,512 --> 01:43:02,656
Operation lockstep Rockefeller Foundation

2293
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:03,936
Online

2294
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:07,520
We just bring in a planetary police state

2295
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:12,384
Buy disease X something like a weaponized cold virus

2296
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,272
Control

2297
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:21,856
Variance would show up all the time so that

2298
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:23,392
Lockdown

2299
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,928
Just making that s*** up yep

2300
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:29,280
I don't know anybody that's actually has adamantium claws

2301
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:32,608
In 20 years will look back and be like

2302
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:34,656
I can't believe

2303
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:36,448
That this was okay

2304
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:39,264
Did this guy got away with this ship

2305
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,568
That's my prediction

2306
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:42,848
So if you want to

2307
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:46,688
Now think about like

2308
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:49,504
Okay you think that you're going to be proven right about everything

2309
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,296
Here's the kind of shity

2310
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,600
This is an exact

2311
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:59,232
In elementary school in German

2312
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,768
Play the actual train videos

2313
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:04,352
When you're seven-years-old you should have to marry a Muslim

2314
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,376
514

2315
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:11,008
Muslims will be the future of Europe to Christianity fat

2316
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:19,200
I would like to see those I would like to see it

2317
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:20,992
Very funny video to share on the internet

2318
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:21,760
Where

2319
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:23,808
The Germans are teaching

2320
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,088
Elementary School

2321
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:30,976
Behind if you're not dating Muslim by fourth-grade eleven-year-old what are you doing single

2322
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:34,560
The Old Maid

2323
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,608
Never get married at this rate

2324
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:41,472
You're in sixth grade you should just get some

2325
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:46,080
Some cats and I love my cat there's nothing wrong time cat

2326
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,664
Yeah this is the kind of s*** that Alex says

2327
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:52,736
Horribly bigoted nonsense yeah

2328
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,784
Anyway the globalist

2329
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,832
Yes senor

2330
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:58,880
Always

2331
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,416
Might just be a few years behind

2332
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,208
What about Plan B

2333
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:06,304
Plan B never said that

2334
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,072
Stop

2335
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:08,096
Didn't happen

2336
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,400
Find

2337
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,984
Listen to Iowa

2338
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:18,592
You were supposed to have a whole internet shutdown

2339
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:22,944
Independent Media left before they did this they weren't planted launches for

2340
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:24,736
They want this early

2341
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,016
Nearby schedule

2342
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:26,784
Ketchup

2343
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:27,552
By launching early

2344
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,600
What future plan

2345
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,136
What

2346
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:35,744
Everyone hates them out

2347
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,792
Call Schwab

2348
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:42,656
Boris Johnson

2349
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:45,728
He's talking about like the releasing of covid

2350
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:48,288
Release the covid-19

2351
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,312
Brothers chicken

2352
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,640
The idea that he's putting

2353
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:58,528
Fourth is that the globalist or a few years behind and so they had to pick up sometime

2354
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:03,648
Super Evil worldwide organization that is orchestrated everything

2355
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,416
Still a few years

2356
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:07,744
This is a plan that goes back to the devil

2357
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,888
Beginning of History I do appreciate that the devil cannot keep a timetable

2358
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:14,656
Bright

2359
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:21,056
Just behind a little bit in the song He's behind

2360
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:23,104
Kicked out of heaven

2361
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:28,224
Realflow Face outlet

2362
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,576
This plan that is

2363
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:34,368
Millennia-old

2364
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,928
And has to do with Trump

2365
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,208
Seguin office

2366
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:39,488
Or something sure

2367
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,280
They're behind on it

2368
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:43,584
This evil plan

2369
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:47,424
And so they decide to release covid a couple years earlier

2370
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:54,080
What's the point of a few years

2371
01:46:54,336 --> 01:47:00,480
Honestly if you have a Bolivia old plan and you're only a few years off 6000 years later what

2372
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:04,320
That's really efficient. No one's going to remember though that

2373
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,856
Really official

2374
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:09,696
A few years in this scale at time is meaning

2375
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:16,096
You got your ID of work project it supposed to last a year and you're 3 months behind people are furious at you

2376
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,448
Get my pickups

2377
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,216
Sometimes

2378
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:27,616
Hey guys we're not ready yet for this plan that's going to end the world

2379
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:29,152
I figure we just go for it

2380
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:35,552
We got a 50/50 shot the problem is that Alex is still on the internet

2381
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:36,832
Crackdown

2382
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:38,112
Time that they released

2383
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,392
This thing right

2384
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,416
So

2385
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,768
Yeah

2386
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:50,144
I didn't get a reason for why they should problem why didn't they shut down there

2387
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,680
Can they not

2388
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:56,288
The goal in the motivation is to make up some lost time but

2389
01:47:57,056 --> 01:48:03,200
The plan that they're engaging in requires that the internet be shut down to be pulled off successfully

2390
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:08,832
Why would they do this thing to catch up on time but they don't have one of the essential pieces in place for

2391
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:10,368
Right so dumb

2392
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:13,440
Okay so here's our plan it can only be stopped

2393
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,536
If we allow Independent Media to reveal our

2394
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,328
Plans Ryan stop everything

2395
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:21,632
I'm glad we're having this meeting

2396
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:23,936
Crucial first step

2397
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:27,776
Terms of us being able to pull off this in a barbecue it's the only

2398
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,312
We can take

2399
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:32,640
If we wanted to go early I'm glad we're only

2400
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:35,968
I'm glad we're all on the same page

2401
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:42,112
Alex will destroy our planet

2402
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,560
Movies that back to

2403
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,144
Devil's eyes

2404
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:56,960
Our plan was to go

2405
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:59,008
Rewrite on this evil

2406
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:05,408
Atlas is about to Marvel at our great beasts and then he's just going to go back in in the seals are going to close again

2407
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:07,712
Cuz we forgot to shut down the internet

2408
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:08,992
F*** dammit

2409
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:12,576
You know what this is on us

2410
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:15,392
We can't claim ignorance on this one

2411
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:21,792
We knew that Alex was going to f*** us up there are exit interviews for the higher-end

2412
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,584
Sorry guys this one's on me

2413
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,376
My bad

2414
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:27,680
I'll take credit for it anyway this is

2415
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:32,032
Catalog this in the Alex's plans of the globalist to make no sense

2416
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,568
Yeah they're real bad it what they

2417
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,592
They're real

2418
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:36,384
Bad guys almost like he's making it all up

2419
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,920
So

2420
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:43,296
I got everyone really excited and over the weekend was there was a piece of Wall Street Journal

2421
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:46,368
About Alex being involved in the funding

2422
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:48,416
King of the

2423
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,952
Bastille January 6th

2424
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,232
Yeah yeah yeah

2425
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:56,864
I read that article and I don't think that Alex comes off looking back

2426
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:58,144
Terrible I mean

2427
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,168
It's just

2428
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,728
Organizing and fundraising

2429
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:04,544
Alexander Augustine looks like way more of a

2430
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,640
He's a real dangerous lunatic

2431
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:14,784
Somebody to get my radio show and then maybe the profit incentive will keep them for being too much of an a******

2432
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:16,064
Possibly hair

2433
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:18,112
Alex response

2434
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:22,720
Do this piece in the Wall Street Journal and I think he responds exactly how I did

2435
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:24,000
And that is

2436
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:26,816
I said all of that stuff on air

2437
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,864
Hundreds of articles

2438
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,912
TV shows

2439
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:38,592
Call breathlessly saying

2440
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,872
Rally funded by

2441
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:41,920
Help

2442
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:43,712
Jones organizers say

2443
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:48,576
Forward what I said

2444
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,672
Rally the 6th for the money

2445
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,584
Got to secure the venues

2446
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,912
Authorized

2447
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:04,448
Porta potties

2448
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:10,080
Well-known

2449
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:15,712
I was planning

2450
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,832
To try to do all of this

2451
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:23,904
So that we could storm the capitol

2452
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:26,976
From my perspective I think Alex is kind of right

2453
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:30,304
Yeah but I think it's this reveals a couple of really funny things

2454
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:34,912
First of all like just beat the idea that he's like why are they

2455
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:35,936
I said

2456
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,728
Yeah yeah

2457
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:44,384
Constantly said the lot of the stuff that's in my Wall Street Journal article to sort of Revelations

2458
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:47,200
Are things that you would know if you listen to Infowars

2459
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,016
The thing I think is really funny

2460
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,296
Is

2461
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:53,600
Like let's say January 8th

2462
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:55,392
Alex has been talkin about

2463
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,440
Paid

2464
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:59,232
For part of this rally there's that

2465
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:06,400
Wall Street Journal would never report on that cuz it's just Alex saying that's fair

2466
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:07,424
That is fair

2467
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:13,824
Alex is an unreliable we believe anything this guy says

2468
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:20,224
Alex Jones and I don't believe a word of it to someone else

2469
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:26,112
I don't know I think that would almost be something that

2470
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:31,744
Alex should be called as a witness at Trump's impeachment trial is going to be

2471
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:38,144
I mean he did just say that Trump told him you know I didn't have a hard time putting himself in the center of a

2472
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,424
Metrology

2473
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:41,984
Because of this Wall Street Journal PDF

2474
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:46,080
Don't never call me as a witness because I tried to stop

2475
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,360
The storm

2476
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:54,784
I'll call you in a minute

2477
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:59,904
Only way to make the impeachment trial board Ludacris would be to invite Alex Jones

2478
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,952
Can I remind you you're under oath

2479
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:04,000
I don't even know what that means

2480
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:06,560
Yeah that's why I think it's really funny that

2481
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:09,888
Like a lot of the underlying information of this article is

2482
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,168
Stuff that was public

2483
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,472
Prior but also

2484
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,544
Maybe bulshit not Coronavirus

2485
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,336
It's not proven

2486
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:21,152
I thought the second thing that I think is really funny

2487
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:22,688
Is

2488
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:28,320
That the article says quote mr. Jones personally pledged more than $50,000 in

2489
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:30,880
Seed money for a plan January 6th

2490
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:37,280
In exchange for a guarantee stop speaking slot of his Christ according to his funding document outlining a

2491
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:43,680
Bo between the company his company and an early organizer that pay to play of course

2492
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:46,752
To get a speaking slot

2493
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,544
That's wild

2494
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:53,408
That that's kind of embarrassing it's in the article it is

2495
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,944
I'm paying for Acts

2496
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:58,784
Yeah there's there's money and you don't have clothes

2497
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:05,440
And there was no way that I was going to get a speak inside of Trump's actual good god no

2498
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,744
So I mean I figured

2499
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,768
He did speak tonight

2500
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:10,816
Before that might have been what he paid for

2501
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,656
Yeah kind of a bummer

2502
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:18,752
But I do think that those two things in the Wall Street Journal article are pretty fun

2503
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,336
The unreliability of Alex even speak about his own life

2504
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:28,992
To pay to get a speaking slot weird how you can both fall so far and you

2505
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:33,088
At the same time Inspire Rave literal overthrowing of a country

2506
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,112
It is

2507
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:37,440
Interesting up-and-down kind of scenario there

2508
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,208
It is interest

2509
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:42,048
So we end this episode now Jordan

2510
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:45,888
Evidence of why Alex should never have to pay

2511
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,424
To speak somewhere

2512
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,448
As long

2513
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,472
As he's forced

2514
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,008
To speak over assert

2515
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:51,776
And song

2516
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:16,864
Understand

2517
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:21,472
Is there ashamed of their power they don't want to force their way to the front

2518
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:22,240
Humble

2519
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:23,520
They love their man

2520
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:26,080
They love their friends

2521
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:31,200
Do that

2522
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:34,528
You belong in charge

2523
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,856
You belong in charge of your life

2524
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:41,440
Your family your destiny and if you don't take control

2525
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:48,096
Corrupt system

2526
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:56,800
Call Amanda follow the basic code God wrote on your soul and it stopped

2527
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,640
Because they're not following.

2528
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:03,456
Falling the Fallen one

2529
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:12,416
Absolutely

2530
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:14,208
That's why you

2531
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:15,232
Say that

2532
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:22,144
That was not the best work he's done over that song

2533
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,168
There were moments

2534
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:24,192
Flickering

2535
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:24,960
Passion

2536
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:26,240
I would listen to

2537
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:28,800
Cover album of him sing talking Woody

2538
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:29,824
He thinks the lyrics

2539
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:30,592
The songs are

2540
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:32,128
I don't want him to do that

2541
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:34,432
Although I do think I'll be interesting at the side

2542
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:38,784
I want an album of just that song 12 tracks

2543
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,576
Just that song

2544
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:42,112
But different days

2545
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:43,136
Alex just

2546
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:45,952
How old is Drake freestyling

2547
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,744
Whatever is on his mind

2548
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:52,352
This is like a great thesis at the beginning

2549
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:54,656
I know about powerful man

2550
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,424
Go from there

2551
01:56:55,680 --> 01:57:01,824
Go for it

2552
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,360
About Alex

2553
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,128
All he does

2554
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,920
Does something to him

2555
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:12,320
It doesn't it I didn't hear much of what he said I was too busy singing a lot

2556
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:14,368
What is a sultry a sock

2557
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,136
Grapes

2558
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:20,768
I mean it's a the lonely Shepherd

2559
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:24,864
It clearly

2560
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:27,936
What's Alex into some kind of his own without like

2561
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,264
Blowhard

2562
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:37,408
No narratives right now I'm just going with straight inspirational f******

2563
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:38,432
Clear Eyes

2564
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:43,296
Full Hearts belong to this I can see the right hundred percent

2565
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:49,440
Absolutely a bunch about like being able to kick himself into a psychic State and I don't believe that but

2566
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,976
That song kick him into something

2567
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:51,744
But something

2568
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:57,120
So we come to the end of this exploration Jordan and I'm left with

2569
01:57:57,376 --> 01:58:00,448
Sort of a bad taste in my mouth for Alex and his

2570
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,240
January 6th to narratives

2571
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:07,360
I think I'll be interesting to see as we get closer to the impeachment how Alex

2572
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:09,664
Probably trying to egg Trump

2573
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,432
Into

2574
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,992
Turning it into some kind of a circus

2575
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:15,552
What ends up happening with that will be

2576
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:17,088
Fascinating to watch

2577
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,368
Alec Steele

2578
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:22,464
I do worry about his malleability

2579
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,256
These

2580
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,792
The fact that he can have

2581
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:27,840
These people the bugaloos

2582
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:32,704
But he decided where afbi cutout group yep and he said he'd

2583
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:34,240
All of this

2584
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:36,032
Women have two of them on

2585
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:39,104
To manipulate him and embarrass him in different ways

2586
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,128
So easy

2587
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:41,920
It's it's

2588
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:42,688
It's a mess

2589
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,712
Yeah

2590
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:45,504
Yeah I imagine that

2591
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,528
This is

2592
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,832
I think what scares me most about this

2593
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:51,648
Is how easily

2594
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,952
They are hand-waving away

2595
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:55,232
What even Alex

2596
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,000
It was like

2597
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:57,280
This is going to f***

2598
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,072
You know Alexa

2599
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:02,656
Aluxes Isla I got to back away from this this is all

2600
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:04,704
This I know this is bad for me

2601
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,984
I know that this

2602
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:07,264
January 6th

2603
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:11,360
Takeover of the f****** country is bad for me but it takes

2604
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:14,688
Two weeks for people to convince me that

2605
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:19,296
That's not good cuz he's trying to have it both ways

2606
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:25,696
Trying to retain that this was bad but also like all of the actors who were actually involved in

2607
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:27,744
There were just a

2608
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,608
A few people in their organization to her secret globalist we're trying to make them look bad

2609
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,632
It's too late

2610
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:38,240
It's too complicated are you still trying to run interference for people who are

2611
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:44,128
Going to do what he wants them to do is going to steal fundraise

2612
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,664
For his housekeeper folks

2613
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:46,944
Who stormed the capitol

2614
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:49,504

2615
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:50,272

01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,552
