1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

3
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,360
We are to be like to sit around and drink wine and watch the world burn

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,920
It sure is doing that

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:22,784
Listen to Infowars

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
In particular

7
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,344
Describe the events

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,880
Other unfold

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416
My friend Jordan here

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,464
Consistently shots

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
Appalled

12
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,840
Overwhelmingly confused

13
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,376
Overwhelmingly

14
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,960
The world is on fire as we speak

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
We're recording this on Thursday afternoon

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
Attorney General Sessions

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
As they would say

18
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
He's in the soup

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,136
Up to his thorax

20
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
Who knows

21
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:07,840
At this point it's like it reminds me of that Patton Oswalt

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,656
George Bush and Dick Cheney

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,008
General Lee over there

24
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,592
Probably going to get out of this morning

25
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
Yeah

26
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,248
Don't feel like they are as slick as Bush

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,576
Is it like

28
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392
What are the most fumbly bumbly dumbasses

29
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
In political History George W bush

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
Looks kind of slick

31
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,536
I think I think that was his genius at 9

32
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,352
I think that was the reason that he got away

33
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
And no matter how evil he

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
There is still that party those like

35
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,384
Just seems like a down-home country eats the marketing that like I

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
You want to go get a beer with him

37
00:01:54,176 --> 00:02:00,320
I never felt that way I think that was just in here

38
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,208
Trillions and trillions of dollars

39
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
And here we are

40
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Here we are also

41
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,840
It's come out

42
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
Met with Russian

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,032
All of the stuff in the dirty dossier is very true

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,736
Unfortunately at practice

45
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
When are recording this

46
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
Some of these Revelations came out after

47
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:39,232
Today's episode of The Alex Jones Show

48
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
Kushner news

49
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Broke life

50
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,008
Right so I thought like f****** Alex Jones

51
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,776
Who's going to be on

52
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Fire

53
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
Anyone about the case

54
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
He wasn't

55
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,664
He was subdued heartbroken

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Boring

57
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
It was just like

58
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
He was calling

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
Bachelorette

60
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,416
The game is part of the job he's on the

61
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,768
Who's on the Senate subcommittee this job is to talk to the Russians meanwhile

62
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,888
Across-the-board

63
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,960
0 of them

64
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
He didn't feel the

65
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
Flames,

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,848
In today's episode but I think tomorrow

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
It's going to be a breakdown

68
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
You don't think it's possible that

69
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:36,064
He's finally seeing the writing on the wall of his own

70
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
I'm starting

71
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
Did you just pull your ear

72
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
Oh no

73
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,304
I just I don't know

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,608
Disinfecting all of us

75
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
We're all part of

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,728
Even though today's episode was kind of boring

77
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
There wasn't a lot of

78
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,544
Like worthwhile s***

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
Get a bunch of interviews with people who

80
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
But luckily

81
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Some stuff from the wind

82
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040

Just some of the goings-on

86
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744

Cuz he does bring up session

90
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Of course

91
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
But I want to start the show off

92
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Today Jordan

93
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
We talk too much s***

94
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
But Alex Jones

95
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,663
Listeners

96
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
I think it's important

97
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
That we let the man

98
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Gibson

99
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
Improper

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
When he deserves

101
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,463
Right and I want to take a moment to celebrate some things that Alex Jones does incredibly well

102
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Okay

103
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
First thing

104
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Lie

105
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
These amazing why

106
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
His intro music

107
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
In-N-Out of commercial break

108
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Strong

109
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,543
You are praising him for things he's not yet

110
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,919
Knew he was using that we probably

111
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,479
Moby's Extreme Ways comes in

112
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,551
Awesome Quarterflash Harden My Heart

113
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,111
Is a banger

114
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
You played a Triumph

115
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,439
Yeah you actually had

116
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
You texted me about that like a motherfuker is playing some solid music right now

117
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,959
Power Trio

118
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,263
Great you choosing good music

119
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
And I want to

120
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Celebrate that

121
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,687
Cuz I'd forgotten about Quarterflash

122
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,271
Didn't you know he's in the groove salad musical cities

123
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,343
They're so I expect

124
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
At least some of that

125
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
Yeah but

126
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
This is a little bit about

127
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Reviews on marijuana

128
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,959
No plan as more medicinal

129
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
Uses then

130
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Mary Jane

131
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
I fully support this

132
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
That's amazing

133
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,367
Unqualified agreement with Alex Jones

134
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
We have

135
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Found it

136
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
Connolly Middle Ground

137
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Gym from here

138
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,119
Yeah so what we'll do that's why I want to talk about this

139
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,679
This is an episode that will be like no other

140
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,495
Because there's another one

141
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,335
I think they will both agree on

142
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
A hundred percent

143
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,455
I still think you're a big but I agree

144
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,783
Marijuana can be used for so many different things as there's no reason

145
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:55,743
He goes into talk dimensional shift so maybe we're all better off whenever Mary Jane is legal

146
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:01,631
I don't like your calling emergency

147
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,215
Who you Tom Petty get the f*** out of here

148
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,311
What about reefer

149
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:14,431
I didn't know that was one I feel like a little boy

150
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
Back in the day we found like this that long printout of slang terms of the years for marijuana and one of them was

151
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
Little Indian boy

152
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
Every now and again you'll see those breakdown

153
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
Call soda and some

154
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
50%

155
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,143
Soda 20%

156
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,983
And then like

157
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Fizzy water

158
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
50/50

159
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,063
I like that a lot marijuana from now on

160
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
French for fizzy beverage

161
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:01,279
You tricked me so Alex actually if you talk to you in a little bit more I believe dinkova

162
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Ultimate in

163
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
Plants that can heal people I have no idea

164
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,471
Nicolette

165
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,871
What's up you're never with mr. love

166
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Global Noble

167
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,247
His feelings about marijuana and

168
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
Next clip

169
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
And one thing that's really actually

170
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
Super awesome about

171
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
This

172
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,951
Isn't that he talks about it in opposition

173
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,255
To the beliefs of the trumpet

174
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,863
What I don't know it's crazy

175
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,471
Legal marijuana

176
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Support police

177
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,199
Funding

178
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,599
And Anna not demonizing PlayStation unity and holding up the good officers as an example

179
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
Realtree

180
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,975
Make an honorable profession so we get more good people

181
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,839
And don't make it be based on Revenue generation

182
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
What in God's name is happening one of you.

183
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,663
Text before this episode just like hey let's see what kind of cool should we can get him to say

184
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,647
Find the others

185
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:45,471
That's the whole reason that they that sessions wants to criminalize it

186
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Because of Revenue

187
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
Because one of the things that is that

188
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
If they

189
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
Expect money

190
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Involved with drugs

191
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Yeah

192
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Well

193
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
Seizure there a note

194
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
Challenge to that you

195
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
I can just take it

196
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
I put this

197
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Clipart

198
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,975
And go to another clip

199
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
If you guys

200
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Want to call Lynn

201
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
Disagree with me

202
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,983
About my gushing over Trump please call in and make sure real point

203
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,823
I don't like the asset forfeiture seizures a lot of us unconstitutional

204
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
F*** is happening

205
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
Corrupt

206
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:40,511
And there are some bad places in East Texas from there

207
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
No I'm not bashing

208
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Mrs. Basham

209
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
Can you text

210
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
He's a nose

211
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
Casinos in old lady

212
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:52,031
You got a man who's like

213
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,039
Sweet old lady

214
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
Yet another thing we agree with him a

215
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
Forfeit forfeiture is

216
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,327
I think that to some degree you should be able to take ill-gotten

217
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Games from

218
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,375
People you know like

219
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
Marauder

220
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
Antique dealers who get their shift taken away

221
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,175
It should be all sorts of like only apply

222
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
Higher Global recession

223
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,551
Write all of the rules that

224
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Reception

225
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,159
Reception

226
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
Nice

227
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
Topicals fuc

228
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
No like those guys

229
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
Destroyed everything

230
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
But because they're still billionaires

231
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,823
Now you know

232
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,687
Making all that s*** is getting repealed because they're rich enough to buy Republican

233
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Yep

234
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,807
The more f***** up is the Wii

235
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
Concrete examples

236
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
But Alex is saying

237
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
Philosophical agreement

238
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
So

239
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
24 the plus column

240
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Yeah

241
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,423
And what is it 6470

242
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,823
Before in the negative forgot little check marks on the other

243
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
Man

244
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,271
Alright on the weed brother

245
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
Again he is in Austin

246
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
In like I bet

247
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
I bet he walks

248
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
On the streets and just smells marijuana

249
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
All day everyday

250
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
If you're if you're that

251
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
Do kind of believe

252
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
That if he just

253
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
Accepted a lot more black people

254
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
Into his life and

255
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Is community

256
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,407
He would think the same way about them as he does about marijuana where's inside

257
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
We should just leave those people alone

258
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
What are we doing

259
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:17,951
Tanya Burr

260
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
No

261
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:26,655
But if he didn't erroneously the globalist were behind everything

262
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
He might be a great person

263
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,687
Comes from his belief

264
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Benny thinks that it's

265
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
Social manipulation

266
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
And trying to control us

267
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
Through getting rid of genders

268
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
I'm trying to spark race Wars

269
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,487
And stuff like that if he didn't believe that there was a shadow

270
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
New Order

271
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
Really what do you think

272
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,631
What's behind it

273
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
Believe that

274
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,287
Federal Way

275
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
I kind of angry dudes

276
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:12,223
Who'd also believes that weed should be legal and doesn't think the cop should fuk with you

277
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Then

278
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
See that

279
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,063
That's the ultimate issue here

280
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
He's only anti-immigrant

281
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,767
Inasmuch as he speaks about on his show right because he thinks that the globalists are flooding our country

282
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
With emigrants to destroy up

283
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:32,959
Does he is that really why he's anti-immigrant is it the racism is it the racism

284
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:38,591
Comes from the global or is it the globalism comes from the race that's a great great

285
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,967
Yeah it's the chicken legs aren't allowed to procreate

286
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,783
Tuskegee I don't know that one got away from me

287
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,135
Anyway this is all going to be in Alex Jones lovefest just not

288
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,487
I wanted to know it is important

289
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
We are fair

290
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
We're not here to just

291
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
S*** on everything

292
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
He says

293
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
He has some good points but I also want to say

294
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
They will when we get to this

295
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,031
I want to remember

296
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,359
The pro decriminalization of marijuana

297
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,407
And the anti civil forfeiture

298
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Right

299
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,527
And I want us to think about how little agreeing philosophically really matters

300
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
How is it that

301
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Doesn't

302
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
Take the very same

303
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
For those thing

304
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
That he makes

305
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
And then realized

306
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
Is that he is making the eggs

307
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
Exact opposite of those

308
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
For so many others

309
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
You don't know how do you not have

310
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
Any kind of logical

311
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
I don't know I mean

312
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,615
Admittedly this is not a trait that is unique to him

313
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,175
Who suffer from

314
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,759
This is kind of a human

315
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Situation

316
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:59,231
Well like being in the news

317
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
Now where it's like

318
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,167
Shyamalan movie The Village

319
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,007
Starring Jon Hamm the most handsome man that

320
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
Aliens I've ever created

321
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
No the town that

322
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
Was overwhelmingly Proto

323
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
70% of the Town voted for them

324
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
And then all the sudden

325
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
They know a guy who getting

326
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Kicked out there like

327
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,815
Oh wait I didn't think you were going to kick out a good illegal immigrant

328
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
No

329
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,567
I feel no sympathy for them I feel Sympathy for the guy was getting deported

330
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
Although although no it's kind of like dude

331
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
Those guys kind of hated you

332
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
You see that right

333
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
You know what it is it's the inverse

334
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
Of the Guard guns

335
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:03,487
Yeah it's like they're going to keep

336
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:10,143
Literally what they're saying violent criminals and illegals

337
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
That's not what's going to happen

338
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
Cuz that's how you keep

339
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
You can't

340
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,943
Figured that out at the other side

341
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Meanwhile

342
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
The right is

343
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
Obama

344
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
He's not right

345
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,695
Please stop that's not

346
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Lorde

347
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
I mean

348
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
I think it's

349
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,631
Genuinely turned into everybody now lives in their own reality

350
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
And

351
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Cloosiv

352
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
2

353
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
The GOP

354
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
Although the GOP is

355
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Entirely

356
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
Living inside its own reality

357
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,455
Yeah

358
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
There's only three possible

359
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
You're either

360
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
In denial

361
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,879
You are stupid

362
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,303
And I think all three of those I think they've mailed it

363
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
Is the

364
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:17,471
He's the only pure Trump I think he's the only global

365
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
We war games that last night

366
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,943
Yeah we there's just no downside in all of this

367
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
Tear itself apart with his

368
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Fake

369
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,831
A hundred-thousand-dollar a year salary sitting on

370
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,647
Possible hundred billion.

371
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,719
Plug-in

372
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:43,327
Tower like Scrooge McDuck he knows that the only downside possible

373
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
Is another proxy war

374
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,935
And the only downside to that

375
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,775
He might lose some troops but most of the casualties will be

376
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
Of whatever country

377
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
And the Beanstalk

378
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
Write like in Syria in

379
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
It's nonsense

380
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,479
That's not a real.

381
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,951
But you know with with other with other autocratic dictators you know like your

382
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
You're saddam's

383
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
Of the world

384
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
I assume there's more

385
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
They

386
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
That you know that guy

387
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
After Iraq fell

388
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
Hiding in underground bunker

389
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
And then

390
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
Right

391
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
You do not see Putin get murdered

392
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,223
Even if the entire country unites against

393
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,271
He's in a helicopter

394
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,575
Can Mars tomorrow living like a billionaire

395
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,623
What is a base on the

396
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,183
No way you get

397
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:46,303
Rambling talking about weed

398
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,631
Cuz here's where it takes a strange makes an admission about

399
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Jeff sessions

400
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
And we don't want to run around

401
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,799
Going after half the young people smoke pot

402
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,127
Quit smoking pot Senator sessions

403
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,455
Listen to Michelle I'm sleep with that

404
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
I know

405
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Well that's scary

406
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
Don't answer me

407
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,511
And you do that

408
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:33,407
He was very proud of that in another reminder

409
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
It was the day before

410
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
These

411
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:43,647
It's amazing now that we're on a What A Difference A Day Makes every single day

412
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,463
He keeps ending up one that's why I wish

413
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:52,863
Then the next day you would have been in hardcore defense mode as opposed to just dismissive

414
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,679
This is nothing that's boring

415
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Right

416
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,983
Position of that isn't really

417
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
It is not really that much different

418
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
His habit

419
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,847
Cuz he doesn't think all this is real

420
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
I didn't think all the Russian stuff in

421
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,991
The perjury stuff is in the same way that I made the argument

422
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,063
Kind of does because he has said in the past that

423
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
Who was involved in the election

424
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
We agree on.

425
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
And

426
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
You don't want to start a fight with

427
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,568
What's the statistic

428
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:47,392
That's Google tell me American smoke marijuana

429
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,560
This is a disaster for Trump

430
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:07,360
Then I would say it's not hypocritical but liquor kills a lot

431
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,272
He said marijuana causes people to be

432
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
And causes violent no it doesn't

433
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,184
Marijuana

434
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
The road,

435
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,824
Heating up this is beside of Alex B

436
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Warriors

437
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
Dumb people in

438
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
Yeah again because

439
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,272
I hate that our first 25 minutes

440
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
Love Love Fest

441
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:55,488
Well I mean over the

442
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
The course of this last

443
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
I don't know 23 months

444
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
Listening to him everyday

445
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
Never heard him break rank

446
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,472
With the Trump Administration

447
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,056
The only time he's ever criticized Trump was about torture

448
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,920
And we played that clip on this episode has reasonings because it

449
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:20,320
You shouldn't torture people cuz it causes bad PR

450
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,880
You got to kill him that was his ark

451
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,720
Like if you arrest people for marijuana

452
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
Is marijuana

453
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,472
Then killer monkey syllogism but yeah I've never heard him

454
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Like even

455
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
Will you be like

456
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,592
This is a bad idea don't do this

457
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
Write the only other thing I guess

458
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
Maybe like kind of agree with him

459
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
If a different reason

460
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
He was like don't let

461
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
Flynn resign

462
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
Yes I agree with him

463
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:58,976
But but only if we're being strategic about Trump's goals

464
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
Just getting head

465
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,536
When would have been a

466
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
Great distraction

467
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
For that

468
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,632
Flynn there

469
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,680
The more he's like the

470
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
The beach house

471
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,056
Yeah and everybody else is all of their Russian connections the entire f***

472
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
In administration

473
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:20,480
Yeah you need like role-playing games

474
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:26,880
You need to tell you need someone who's just got a lot of hit points

475
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
The wizard in the background

476
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
I don't think sessions

477
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Can betta tank

478
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
Yeah he's a half elf half half wig

479
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,752
He's got a phone call

480
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
And then the Dominos.

481
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,616
Just keep going to hold strong with Flynn

482
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,664
But once he wants

483
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,992
Then everybody it because and we said this back then

484
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,576
Now there's blood in the water is everywhere

485
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:02,208
Different size

486
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,768
Impressive

487
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
To me to see that

488
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
Disagreement with

489
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,144
He's about team

490
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Yes

491
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
If it's me it's early meaning

492
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
I hope

493
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
.

494
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,688
I would like it if you was more like this

495
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
Regularly

496
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,296
I would like literally anybody

497
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
It was more like

498
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
This regularly

499
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:32,160
They just voted against

500
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
Trump from releasing attack

501
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Tax return

502
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
Or anybody

503
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,704
Some Senator came out of the secret room where they've got the new healthcare bill

504
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,288
And he was quoted as saying there

505
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,872
Rand Paul went on a nice little chick today

506
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,432
Brought a printer with

507
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,528
Also it was a giant didn't have like a travel bag with a

508
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,624
Knightsville printer is old school

509
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,744
With the with the poles that you have to punch off

510
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,072
Carrie the paperweight

511
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
There's a show called House of Cards

512
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Cuz this house of cards

513
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
Fall seems like it

514
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,568
At least people

515
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,944
What's the show up until his wife gave a dying due to handjob and then I kind of

516
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Like I'm out of here

517
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
Wait what

518
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
I watch the first season

519
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,880
And then the first episode of the second season whenever you push that reporter off of the

520
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:40,768
Spoiler alert

521
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,352
Where are we are we doing that let's not turn this into

522
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:50,496
TV review show agree with him without then just kind of rambling off.

523
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
What the f*** is happening

524
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,592
The premise of our shipment

525
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:58,432
Premise of the show is to document what he's up to

526
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,760
Unfortunately it's usually terrible

527
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:07,392
Terrible

528
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
Hey

529
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,256
You support marijuana legalization

530
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
You also support

531
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,888
Keeping trans people stuck into their f******

532
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,704
Horrible

533
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
Here is our next clip

534
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
This gets away from the good bad

535
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
Dichotomy

536
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,992
Rite Aid this is just Alex through talkin about how he's not a fear monger

537
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:38,624
And then also gets a little bit into the Trump

538
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
Speech before the house

539
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,768
There are there

540
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,680
Other

541
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:58,336
Groups world

542
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,176
He popularize a lot of those I can say our audiences

543
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,736
Get that info out I always believe that

544
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,552
The world

545
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,880
Exposed

546
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,816
I probably always existed

547
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
I've gone

548
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,680
A lot of stuff that he Direct

549
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
People to

550
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
And it doesn't say the things you do

551
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
Equine

552
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Of course

553
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,616
In much the same way that he just misrepresent

554
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,272
New stories that read based on headlines and bakes building up his case

555
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
That

556
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
Evil globalist

557
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:48,512
You don't here's the weirdest part I am starting the more I listen to him

558
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,816
The more I'm starting to notice the

559
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
Parallels between his globalist

560
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
Ranting

561
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Billionaires

562
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:00,032
Like it does seem like all billionaires basically

563
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,848
All of them are directing every country

564
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,152
Like even though I am

565
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,464
Now I support Alex Jones out of marijuana which basically means I agree with everything he's ever said now

566
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,328
The more the more I think about this whole Trump situation

567
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,656
The more I think you know who the real enemy is

568
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
Billionaires

569
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,240
The entire government

570
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,616
And this is always been true but now they finally won

571
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
These people don't

572
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,760
They don't have any association

573
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,880
Oh no

574
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,976
They don't care if the country goes well or Batman care about poor people

575
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:56,352
What's a really care about is getting as much money out of

576
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,144
Guess what

577
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,520
You are

578
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
Just to be listenable

579
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:21,440
World governments good we should all just accept it and so what if it's an elected

580
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,512
How far we've come

581
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,864
Trump taking control of it

582
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
I don't think

583
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Anything even

584
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,240
Similar to ordering people

585
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
Loan

586
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
Money is a small bit

587
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,944
Certainly not

588
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,040
Federal Reserve is private really weird murky territory

589
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
But also I don't know if

590
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,136
Authority to take over

591
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:56,000
Frankly I have read so much about

592
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
The Federal Reserve

593
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Still have

594
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:04,448
No f****** clue what do other than sometimes somebody will go on TV and be like

595
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
Point

596
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,824
They do 5% control the money supply

597
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
In order to

598
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,152
Make sure that our

599
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Dollar doesn't

600
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
Become valuable

601
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,552
That's a large part of what they do

602
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
Okay

603
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,648
A mother

604
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,696
Yeah it's not it's not a government

605
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
It is its own

606
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:31,328
What is a thing

607
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
Intimately intertwined with

608
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
Otherwise it with

609
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
Otherwise you just cut ring

610
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,712
Private doesn't take everything

611
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
Account but it is

612
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,808
If you just take that simple fact

613
00:31:53,856 --> 00:32:00,000
Really more of the details about the government being able to impose things on it

614
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,048
Nefarious

615
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,168
Nearest Microcenter

616
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
Currency is

617
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
Regulator

618
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
She's just

619
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
The fearless leader van like

620
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:22,272
I have no clue what it is that

621
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
The Federal Reserve

622
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:32,000
We aren't Economist policy was the Federal Reserve

623
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,984
Truxedo power of the Bigfoot

624
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,544
That's why they are

625
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,408
Particularly

626
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,784
Power us and it be dismantled

627
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,208
It's dinner

628
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
So when

629
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:10,400
Yeah.

630
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,704
I wish

631
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Soul winning

632
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,336
Trump actual number friends

633
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,152
Strfkr

634
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:27,296
Sure thing would hang out with him but also that

635
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
I lost my phone

636
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
What I'm not the first

637
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
Now

638
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,912
Come on we're going to win win win

639
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,264
No

640
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,920
I remember

641
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
You're totally right

642
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:05,184
Been in the video he's about to hit the desk really hard and fake laugh

643
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,768
Oh my God come on man

644
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,424
Clunky he was he was about to pray and then he started laughing like what is happening to emphasize his wife by hit

645
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
Does he hit the desk all the f****** time

646
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,336
You can here in just about every clip

647
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
Sunk

648
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
I hear that my

649
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
Dreams

650
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,552
100

651
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:38,464
But turn towards truly next level

652
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,512
1st BC

653
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Trump

654
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:46,144
Started talk about again in science and technology

655
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:51,264
Right around the corner and look in his eyes they are got them

656
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
From the top dimensional beings

657
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,712
Trump

658
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,648
Before I'd the water in the vaccines with additives

659
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,440
What the hell have people

660
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,584
Go to more Focus

661
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,424
Here's this is after the State of the Union

662
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,824
It wasn't the State of the Union Address

663
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,664
Even though

664
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
Prices like

665
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Well he sure did

666
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
Look presidential guy

667
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,576
Like

668
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
What a group of pussies

669
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,928
It's an a for effort

670
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,464
You know it's like

671
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:48,352
Damning someone with faint Praise of like grading it was just

672
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
Plus minus

673
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:57,568
It's literally what it was I who went to like an alternative school

674
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,152
About

675
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Feel me

676
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
Feel about

677
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,808
School

678
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
Cures and all that

679
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,648
We're going to let loose all of the

680
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,208
B all these life-saving technology

681
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,536
That's not what Trump is doing

682
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,840
Maryland

683
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
Still not a thing

684
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:24,960
No talking about Aldi's

685
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:30,848
Chores and stuff like that what he's talking about is making it easier for drugs to get on the market

686
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,944
About repealing regulations of the FDA

687
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,528
Drug don't have to be tested

688
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,600
Who is going to Tesla

689
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,392
Then people would be cured of cancer

690
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,208
The most expensive part of creating a drug

691
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,280
Because you could do serious damage to people

692
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,376
Yeah and I can't wait for the FDA

693
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,936
Literally

694
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,752
I don't think that you should have to serve drugs work

695
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
What

696
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:06,688
Yeah I was like I don't think the environment

697
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,224
Imma get it

698
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Alex being like

699
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,208
Marijuana should not be Criminal

700
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,024
Right down the middle

701
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
Yeah

702
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:29,472
Him saying that Trump is about to release these mysterious secret cancer cures

703
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,544
Some s*** is him reading into what Trump is saying

704
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,616
Is essentially I'm going

705
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,384
To make

706
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,944
8004 drug companies f*** you over

707
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
Where is his interpretation of Alex

708
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,088
Oh my God all the secret technology we're about to go

709
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,904
And this is where he becomes an idiot

710
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
Although although now I

711
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Do you think

712
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
Tell Trump

713
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,840
Doral Academy

714
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,960
I don't know no cabinet

715
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,288
Nobody in the government

716
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,336
The cabinet by the week

717
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,896
Yeah he's running

718
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,712
I saw earlier today that they

719
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
Confirmed

720
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
Wait

721
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:29,120
I think the worst part is that Rick Perry is probably the most blameless person

722
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:35,776
I don't know if he knows where he is at any given point in time he is becoming the

723
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,056
The cabinet member

724
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,384
He strikes me as a less funny version of

725
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,920
From the critic

726
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:47,808
It is also she has those Hillbilly Bears

727
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,464
Where do bears who sing for Duke

728
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
Is everything you read about

729
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,328
And heard about it

730
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,848
More

731
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:22,112
And they just make up news reports weather

732
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,936
With his son-in-law

733
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,264
Decided

734
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,896
Of Defense intelligence

735
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,064
He's complaining things there

736
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,904
That's very different view makeup

737
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,440
The well done steak and

738
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,488
Jamaican look gauche

739
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Who cares

740
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,168
Who cares whatever bulshit

741
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,200
You're revealing a lot about

742
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,016
Good writing articles

743
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,624
People like giffer will eventually get big enough for the wapo

744
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,928
To be pissed off about your food choice

745
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,464
Are we could only help

746
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,024
But the Japanese thing

747
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,584
The prime minister.

748
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
Situation

749
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,216
Vector pictures

750
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
They're pictures of that

751
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:49,152
Everybody's watching it

752
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:57,088
Good reporting on that know the intelligence as the good reporting show.

753
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,112
The intelligence was like

754
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
Maybe don't do this

755
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,280
So are you playing golf or some s***

756
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:09,632
That's what they said at the same time that the Yemen raid was going on

757
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,240
All of this

758
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,264
No one

759
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,312
You're making up is it true

760
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,384
But goddamnit he can repeat it real strong

761
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
Goddamn

762
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
He did

763
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,192
Maybe not randomly randomly

764
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,056
Of him over a well done steak

765
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
Indigent with that steak knife

766
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,640
Poor and more and more catch up on

767
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,199
Just going like

768
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
Let's just send one guy

769
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
Yeah

770
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,319
Just just Ryan

771
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
Poor Widow is used as a

772
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,975
Prop we're going to get to that in a second

773
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
I mean nothing

774
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,047
Nothing but respect for our fallen

775
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Yeah I don't have any

776
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,935
Pain and some people got killed

777
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:41,791
Welfare rolls

778
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,007
The glory

779
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,359
Soldier

780
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,943
Do you think he's going to say that Trump is trying to

781
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:05,343
Steal the glory agreed with him multiple times today so

782
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,671
Noemi's Noemi

783
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Whammy

784
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,975
A sailor

785
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:18,399
Trump's opportunistic

786
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
Chicken

787
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,359
Standing ovation

788
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
No one said ratings

789
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,247
Argument of writing saying it was tacky for him

790
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Bring soda

791
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
Crowd response

792
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,623
It was manipulative tacky

793
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:44,511
Military folk that I've seen responding to a degree with

794
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,447
Since he died

795
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,983
Incredibly inappropriate

796
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,591
I do I do want to I do know I

797
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,407
I don't know how much I agree and disagree with

798
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
That's what they signed up

799
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:07,039
Because there is a certain amount of that word is

800
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,135
Military

801
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,183
You are a Navy SEAL

802
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
You knew when you want on this

803
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,767
This mission that there was a possibility of the

804
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,863
Entry level position

805
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Those dudes go through

806
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
Crazy

807
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,727
Training

808
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
The others thought that I have

809
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,103
Which is that one of the main reasons that

810
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
Because they are

811
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
Airport

812
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
The way out

813
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,759
They aren't all these programs

814
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,575
Insurance

815
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
College

816
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,927
Nobody's going in there

817
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,279
Especially if you join during peace times and then there's a rapport

818
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:54,399
And then you're in if you get stopped lost Futurama episode where is like

819
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,775
Unless

820
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
Declared

821
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,567
And then

822
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,407
Declared

823
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
Lower back tattoos

824
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
TV review

825
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:13,599
Never going to stop but yeah I agree with you that it's a murky area the idea of just missing Soldier

826
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,391
That's because they signed for it

827
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,695
First of all you should never minimize

828
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,719
Their deaths

829
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
Because of that

830
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
But secondary

831
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,071
I think there is difference

832
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
Supreme

833
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,143
A private entrance

834
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
And someone on the seals

835
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,983
3rd there's a difference in

836
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
There's

837
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,847
Their goals are what they're capable

838
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,151
Absolutely because if it's

839
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,991
I mean it is one of those things where you know one who knows

840
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,527
You do know that

841
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,343
The seals are really really good at this s***

842
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
And there's a

843
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
There's a possibility

844
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,439
Maybe not a great one

845
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
That he completely secede

846
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
No one signs up

847
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,143
No one signs up

848
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,823
What's a good way to go we're not going to get some Valor

849
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,431
If your family is like people who died by the cops

850
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:15,039
To say some crazy people choose death by cops

851
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,087
Yeah

852
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,183
That's one way to do it a little less Valor and that situation plum

853
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
Some more thought

854
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,351
Her feel good and it was so

855
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:32,959
Charisma

856
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
Admittedly

857
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:02,655
Got a whole bunch of hard drives and computers and the rest of it that's why they didn't just drop a bunch of

858
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
They didn't get any

859
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Good information

860
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
Multiple

861
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,311
Multiple sources

862
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Yep

863
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
Very clearly said

864
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
No we got nothing

865
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,479
Yet

866
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:22,623
So there is a decent chance that maybe something will come out but it was a success

867
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Decent is very Optimus

868
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,951
There's a possibility I would not

869
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
Decent

870
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,839
I'm sure there's an outside possibility, login

871
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:35,679
Whatever

872
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,959
Preston

873
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:40,031
Making the argument that they got great information out of it

874
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,103
A Michael Moore is suggesting otherwise

875
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663
Absolutely just lying

876
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
So

877
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
I don't care that you like weed

878
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
This was the

879
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:00,511
For much of the Middle East

880
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,559
And their headquarters

881
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,095
Wasn't

882
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:10,495
Or they could have just

883
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,543
C-130

884
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,359
Howitzer

885
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,663
And blown the place in the molten slag

886
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,967
They want

887
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,271
That's the point of going on the mission

888
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,087
Also they couldn't have done that because I would have been in

889
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,111
Credible war cry

890
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
Yeah

891
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,791
No and it's even like

892
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
Hachi

893
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:39,679
Vicki killed like what 30 civilian I like I like how you very nearly said

894
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,983
Even for America that's a war

895
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:45,567
Even for us

896
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:49,663
Indiscriminate like going in killed tons of civilian

897
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:52,223
Them bombing would have killed hundreds

898
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,759
Civilians

899
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,575
China Wok

900
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
I mean

901
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,903
Yeah Obama killed a lot of civilian

902
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,207
You you can't argue that point

903
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,743
And he's not off the hook

904
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
We are concerned

905
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:10,143
We are liberal-minded people who have always been opposed to that

906
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,215
Then we've spoken Houghton

907
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,007
Maybe yeah

908
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:21,151
So like it been himym saying like you can't go with that

909
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,175
Scorched-earth

910
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,455
Iteknic

911
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,527
At no point

912
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,807
Does anybody bring up

913
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
Cuz it's

914
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,903
Yeah scorched-earth is bad

915
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,975
We know that cuz we didn't

916
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
We don't learn the lesson

917
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,399
Let's break it down

918
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,471
You got to get to a show so we've got a shorter episode today

919
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
Yes I apologize

920
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,799
I am going to drop it

921
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,103
Quit after our theme song

922
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,663
Which is the better I love you

923
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:03,903
I have to do some major editing

924
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,951
Recorded episode a couple weeks

925
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,071
Dear friend. Hilarious comedian Marty DeRosa

926
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,399
We recorded episode after the Superbowl

927
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:20,799
Breakdown of the Super Bowl

928
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:25,407
Into the end of this episode after after we're done so look forward to that

929
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,479
Before we get out of here we got one more clip

930
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
This

931
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
Is where everything goes

932
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:40,767
But we started on such a good one

933
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
The

934
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,607
The graph for this is the opposite of the graph for climate

935
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:53,311
This clip is why no matter what you think about his philosophical beliefs about

936
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
Super Why

937
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,359
Asset forfeiture

938
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,407
Marijuana legalization

939
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,479
I just can't get this guy cuz he's a f****** dick

940
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,271
He's a f****** dick in an idiot

941
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,575
Here we go

942
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,023
We got to start over cuz you yelled

943
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
So much worse

944
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,911
If that was too much

945
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,615
Scared

946
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,687
Over guilt

947
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,015
At 16 years of age with a half-drunk six-pack beer

948
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,879
Two girls in the car my buddy coming back from the beach driving back to Dallas

949
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,695
And because we are both have blonde hair

950
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:46,303
Hitler

951
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,631
In that white racism

952
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:56,287
Very much so just say that I haven't seen any white racism and then

953
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:02,687
Say Heil Hitler comes up with

954
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,271
Zachary water

955
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,599
Now

956
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,159
Watch as he continues the story

957
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
Alright

958
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,999
Doesn't get the point and then

959
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,327
Lipsett anti-black

960
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,119
Alright

961
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,335
Balances on

962
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,575
Because you can

963
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,903
That's why you don't do something to somebody cuz what color they are

964
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,743
What somebody does and what they stand for

965
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,679
Racist white stuff I've seen I've got

966
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
From

967
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,151
What

968
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
A white male

969
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,407
Comment fait stuff about it go

970
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:43,551
Weird

971
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:57,631
Takes about a subject to think about all the angle

972
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,447
The white nationalist angles you can

973
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
Was

974
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,055
2 minutes long

975
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:09,663
It's not edited in any way and it's fully exposes

976
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:14,783
I hate you racist man I hate it when we take him out of

977
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:21,695
We have contact

978
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:30,655
I'm policy walk

979
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:37,055
White racism doesn't exist a Nazi pulled me over and let me go cuz I was white

980
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:40,383
Sherwood want to be black getting pulled over by this guy

981
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,431
What did walking Justice

982
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,551
I wouldn't want to be A different race because of this racist

983
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,343
Who's White

984
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:53,439
Also 300-401

985
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,463
Noches

986
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,279
Hypothetically created the exact

987
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
Right

988
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,583
Image in his head

989
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,959
To be black be pulled over by this guy

990
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:11,359
Ford Amphitheater in that situation was not empathy it was an imaginary situation image of a black person

991
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:15,455
Pulled over by this guy would be wild

992
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
Nazi has

993
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,271
Never pulled over a black guy

994
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,551
Yeah he's like

995
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
It's

996
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,135
If you want to think

997
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,415
Then he's halfway there

998
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,439
But he's not

999
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
He's Living on a Prayer

1000
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:31,839
He's not halfway there this is ever going to make progress

1001
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,399
No she has

1002
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,679
Enough

1003
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,983
Maybe maybe on his Deathbed

1004
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
He'll be like

1005
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:40,799
No

1006
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,871
Not enough

1007
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,687
On his deathbed is going to be like

1008
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:53,599
Trump has a life-saving cures going to come in a pack

1009
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,975
Trump has already been hung for treason when he's on his deathbed he's like

1010
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,655
There was a false flag hanging

1011
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
So like

1012
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,727
I mean this is I think

1013
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,287
The essence of what I always want

1014
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,055
The show.

1015
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:13,823
To be about

1016
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,639
And I'm glad that it can be very clear in this up

1017
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,711
Despite some

1018
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,759
Some decent

1019
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,039
Things that he says

1020
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:23,807
Which are

1021
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
Incredibly rare

1022
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,903
He is one of the worst people

1023
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,927
Ever

1024
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,255
Terrible

1025
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,791
Is always

1026
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,327
Is always the weird thing

1027
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
About

1028
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:41,215
Families in my own and I'm sure plenty of our listeners have the same

1029
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,007
Dissonance

1030
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
He describes

1031
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,823
This is how I raised my children

1032
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,407
Raise them to be tolerant I raise them to love people

1033
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,175
Yeah

1034
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,711
You're doing great

1035
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:55,551
He's like but also I teach them of that white racism doesn't exist

1036
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:02,975
You're doing wrong what white racism doesn't exist but racism against exact 100 times more

1037
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,535
More than anything else

1038
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,607
All of the all of the Christian

1039
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,887
Is now just going like

1040
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:14,239
Hey we should love everybody Jesus said love thy neighbor as thyself

1041
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:19,871
All of this stuff and then the like but yeah let's kick immigrants out as quickly as possible and ruin their lives

1042
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,711
You're so close

1043
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,551
Not close it appears close so far away

1044
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:33,951
It appears close to not close at all it's so hard to sit at thank

1045
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,719

00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:44,447
You're a bad person

1049
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,239
Not really.

1050
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,055
I know my mom wouldn't like all this

1051
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,151
Made my mom mad

1052
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,479
Suck it you just made Jesus Christ

1053
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,015
That's not a first for us

1054
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
I wish

1055
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,111
That we had more time

1056
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,391
I also wish

1057
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,671
But Alex would stop playing

1137
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,647
That investigation which is a little ambitious

1138
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,463
Please let me down

1139
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,487
Twice

1140
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,047
First off

1141
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
I thought we

1142
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,839
Hillary

1143
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
Sure

1144
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:15,775
We go we both kind of got a little bit duped by that her being sick

1145
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:16,799
Oh s***

1146
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,567
And then

1147
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:26,015
I wish I wish we would have talked more about that when you were having those feelings I could have helped you out a little bit

1148
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,551
And I do her eye hurt

1149
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
I got an A List

1150
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,111
A-listers

1151
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,903
Celebrity ringleader

1152
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,719
Eyebrows

1153
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
How to write his name

1154
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,559
Cuz I'm not going to

1155
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:42,143
Stillwater run slander laws

1156
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,167
And and I think

1157
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,727
Mostly excited to know what you think

1158
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
Is an a-lister

1159
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,383
But some people. He was head of the

01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,711
Corey Feldman

1162
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,551
Celebrity

1163
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,647
Story is old

1164
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,463
Last time a real big celebrity

1165
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
If you know what I mean

1166
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:07,999
Yeah

1167
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:12,095
Wink clear I do think that's that there is

1168
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,143
Abuse that goes on absolutely

1169
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,935
Dennis

1170
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,263

1173
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
Sure

1174
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:30,015
Power exists everywhere and

1175
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,039
Damaged quote

1176
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575

Enjoy your Super Bowl gif

1180
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,471
Teaching

01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:54,335
Teaching underprivileged children

1182
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,871
Adobe funny

I say entrepreneur

1186
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,271
Your sense of humor

1187
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
Eyeglass

1188
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
Toboggan

1189
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:11,231
Just do lunch football jokes

1190
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,791
Like the greatest Super Bowl of all

1191
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:16,351
What time was the first one that ever went to overtime

1192
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,631
It was and it was the largest

1193
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:26,335
Pretty nuts that this year we had all of these major sports championships be like really Buckwild

1194
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,895
Defeated

1195
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:29,919
The Cavs

1196
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,479
Came back from 3-1 to win

1197
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,759
The Cubs

1198
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:38,367
Broke 108 in Maine

1199
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647
Heat off of

1200
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,415
Golden State

1201
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:45,023
Because the Golden State blue 3-1 lead

1202
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
It seems fun

1203
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:53,727
Well

1204
01:07:53,983 --> 01:08:00,127
During the Super Bowl Lady Gaga

1205
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,151
Illuminati ceremony

1206
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
You're coming out to visit

1207
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:08,319
Your coming-out ceremony much sure there was

1208
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:12,671
Little to say about that

1209
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:18,047
Literally and figuratively

1210
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:21,887
I just start off the show

1211
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,655
Theme

1212
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:25,727
Overarching theme of the show is

1213
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:29,567
Insecurities

1214
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:34,175
Polish people

1215
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,039
Fruit

1216
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:41,343
All the same

1217
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:45,951
Waking up in the poll numbers show him going straight up

1218
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,815
41 before the election was

1219
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,983
Hours for Trump

1220
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:03,359
Is real numbers are above 70 right now

1221
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,919
Because there are internal polls

1222
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:15,903
That that that that you can cut the hair

1223
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,255
Methodology

1224
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,239
Call.

1225
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,287
Houston and

1226
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,175
Scallop and so many others this is very

1227
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,223
The real news

1228
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,503
He's not

1229
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:49,695
First thing that's funny is there anymore

1230
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:52,255
It's gone down yeah I pulled up these Bowl

1231
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,791
Okay Rasmussen

1232
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
He cites

1233
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,351
Actually pretty good

1234
01:09:56,607 --> 01:10:00,447
54% approval rating 46 disapproval

1235
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,775
The only one that has big of a swing

1236
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:08,127
Is a Politico online poll

1237
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,407
41% disapprove

1238
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,735
Those are the only 13 Hazmat favor abilities of a

1239
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,575
Approve - disapprove

1240
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,623
He also cited the gout

1241
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,927
-9

1242
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,951
Metaphorical

1243
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:25,023
43% approve 52% disapprove

1244
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,095
Look it's not good

1245
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:32,703
Basically if you average out what is like 10 poles that were taken in the last

1246
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:37,823
Week and a half or so 44.9% approve 47.4 disapprove

1247
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,847
On average

1248
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,151
-2.6 net approval

1249
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,687
Now

1250
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,479
To break it down a little bit further

1251
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,503
It turns out

1252
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,527
But he does

1253
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,855
Better in polls where you can be anonymous

1254
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:55,487
Internet polls and that sort of thing he does very well comparatively on those

1255
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:58,559
The ones where you're actually talking to somebody on the phone

1256
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,839
Not so good

1257
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
Moscato

1258
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
Election to

1259
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
Yeah

1260
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,703
People just don't want to admit

1261
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,495
Is that it

1262
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:10,079
Admit I didn't there's some people I mean if your

1263
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,687
Some basic ass white person in

1264
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,247
Indiana Ohio or

1265
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,527
Nearest Pilot

1266
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,063
So far so good

1267
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,599
Not really affected me much

1268
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,367
You know

1269
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,415
Be the same people who probably think like

1270
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,695
Feminist

1271
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:34,143
Way things are

1272
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,167
Quite a few people who want

1273
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,519
But if you go

1274
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,543
The trumpet his people you would

1275
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,591
Course they are

1276
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,871
Everybody's

1277
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,783
Very important

1278
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,807
OSHA

1279
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,343
How do you

1280
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,415
So yeah I think a lot of it is

1281
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,695
And then also

1282
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,719
Trump

1283
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:07,167
That was it that was ill-advised

1284
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,959
Hey bro bro bro bro bro bro

1285
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,239
Notre Dame

1286
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,079
Alright

1287
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:17,407
Delusional is f***

1288
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,575
Cookie is listen

1289
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:33,791
East Allen Reagan photo

1290
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:37,631
You know the General Public

1291
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,495
But what's really going to hurt me is

1292
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:49,151
Being on the street

1293
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,967
You care so much

1294
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:57,343
What's really going to hurt him is when people can't afford to buy his b*******

1295
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,111
Have you ever

1296
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,463
Graphs

1297
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,023
Got some beautiful Reagan

1298
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:05,791
Trump won

1299
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,655
He was selling them for 9

1300
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,447
$18

1301
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:16,543
These are too cheap tomorrow

1302
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,455
They are in the hallway

1303
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
Cuz the lights aren't

1304
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,647
America is on the rise

1305
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:34,463
Also this is an important point that I want to bring up

1306
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,303
I've noticed he brings up Americana a lot

1307
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:44,703
And I think that in the next like 6 months or so we're going to see that become a really dark buzzword where there's America

1308
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:50,591
Yeah we're going to see like the Americana movement

1309
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:55,455
Sounds good I'll share this like America Tropicana I like both of those things

1310
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,735
No this is

1311
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:02,367
This is white nationalism with another guy

1312
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
Now it's

1313
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
It's pretty scary

1314
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,743
Kind of feel

1315
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,143
I might be wrong

1316
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,447
Possible

1317
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:21,055
He's been saying it for a while now and I kind of think it's like

1318
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,615
Just not going to happen

1319
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:33,599
So I don't know I don't know how you feel about sports

1320
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,879
Talking about sports

1321
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,511
It's you know what it is

1322
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,559
The people who are interested in a certain thing

1323
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,095
I love that except

1324
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,119
30 for 30

1325
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:51,519
Oh yeah

1326
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,847
The nature of sport

1327
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:58,943
Okay

1328
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,479
When does Super Bowl

1329
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,551
I can care less about the Atlanta

1330
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,111
Aw

1331
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,647
Seriously I'm having a

1332
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,439
Falcons

1333
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,791
Bulshit

1334
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:19,167
I know this is all been built up and designed so that men put their normal male Energies

1335
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,959
In a watching a bunch of other

1336
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,007
Overpaid spoiled rotten men

1337
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:25,823
Involve themselves in what is Proto

1338
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,103
Virtual reality

1339
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:30,175
The original

1340
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,807
A business

1341
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,879
Competition

1342
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,959
But it's not real

1343
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:58,591
At this point I don't totally disagree with his metaphor

1344
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:03,455
Foot sports are a way for us to get out Primal aggressions in a healthy

1345
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,015
But I don't like that's not his

1346
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,295
That's not what he saying

1347
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
Right

1348
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,367
If that's what he was saying I would agree with

1349
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
Leasing there's some evil

1350
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:17,279
Motive

1351
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:23,423
He was Alex would rather you actually go to war

1352
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:31,103
The NFL has decided is a boner pill

1353
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,687
Sure because he was talk hey for men over 40

1354
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:42,367
It's so expensive how much is it I think it's like 60 bucks for a bottle

1355
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
Maybe I'll buy you a bottle

1356
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:50,815
You were so close to actually Buy credit card

1357
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,655
Alright what would you want

1358
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,127
He has more to say about that

1359
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
Weird cat

1360
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,663
Metaphor

1361
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,991

1362
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,039
In the kitchen I never seen it

1363
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:24,095

Dog man

1365
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:37,407
Portuguese

1366
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:44,319

Bring in all the world nothing is more important

1376
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,391
Meanwhile

1377
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,951
I don't think he knows what his point was

1378
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:25,279
They're also his show is the laser pointer

1379

Is a lot of Black Cadillacs a and he also

1382
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,215
Seems to have no sense of irony

1383
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:33,983
That

1384
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,263
Him and

1385
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
People like him if

1386
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,823
Created

1387
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,871
Sort of inside joke of the Illuminati

1388
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,919
It's a punchline in jokes now

1389
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:45,503
Go to clothing stores like Illuminati

1390
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:48,575
T-shirt Lubbock the Eye of Horus

1391
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,111
Make no mistake about it

1392
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,647
People like Lady Gaga

1393
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,415
Know that

1394
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,183
And there

1395
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,719
Putting this in their stuff

1396
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,487
Number one

1397

01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:13,151
Yeah I thought that I

1404
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,967
I saw someone post

1405
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,015
I'm not that confident

1406
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:22,367
I just thought

1407
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:26,463
People putting all of these Illuminati symbols and stuff

1408
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,487
In things

1409
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,535
Is kind of marketing to a

1410
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:34,399
Another crowd people interested in a movie unless

1411
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,447
It'll take a certain subset

1412
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:41,311
They do free promotion for you if you just put a bunch of weirdos

1413

Movie app

1414
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,479

1454
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,000

01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,696
We discovered three years ago via ice sources

1477
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,232

To let people in his nothing to do with Obama being like

1501
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:29,824
Either they're being ordered by the government to let people in

1502
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,152

1574
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,816
Strippers

Super Bowl

01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,568
And someone who's involved in it

1580
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,104
Maybe you shouldn't

1581
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,456
And then Lady Gaga and the Pope

1582
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:27,648

1624
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,384
Take a second to pause here

1625
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:00,736
I've noticed that he starts rubbing his ears

1626
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,528
As a nervous tic

1627
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:09,184
And when he said all the drunkenness he rubs his ears which is just wasted public

1628
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:14,816

1646
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:56,032

01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,376
Not true at all

1652
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:24,704
That's not true at all

1653
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:29,568

Talking about

1660
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:49,024
The Pope says person

1661
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,560
He's not really my Pope

1662
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,144
Not my phone

1663
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,960
Protesting when he got put in right you wanted that.

1664
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,496
Seabeck

1665
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,032
Pedophile

1666
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,312
Apologist

1667
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:05,408

01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,712
Spreading and

1670
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,992
Taking in

1671
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,272
Of obviously

01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,040
Free fake

1673
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,064
News

1674
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,344
All these stories

1675
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,880
It's the equivalent

1676
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,904
Sexual pleasure

1677
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:21,792
Maybe he did say that

1678
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:27,936
Please play a different way

1679
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,472
Go to let you go with a different way

1680
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:35,872
The thing of things anyway

1681
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:40,480
This statement is just all about

1682
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,528
Insecurities it's real nice

1683
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,064
This is really what Alex

1684
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,112
What is all about on this episode

1685
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:49,184
Is that Infowars and himself in particular

1686
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,512
Are not getting the recognition they deserve

1687
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:55,840
They need to be everyone's favorite thing

1688
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
They're not

1689
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,680
Is really pissing out

1690
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,960
I was watching

1691
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,264
Press conference

1692
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:04,800
Very funny

1693
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,080
Cherise is mine

1694
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,616
And

1695
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,456
Obama

1696
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,272

Apparently that's the modus operandi

1702
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:34,496
First of all but I congratulate you on a wonderful victory

1703
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:38,080
President Trump has always been always will be a friend of the show

1704
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,616
Any justice f******

1705
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:40,640
Weirdo

1706
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:43,200
You know and his questions are like

1707
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:49,600
Does Donald Trump and if maybe a hard-hitting question does Donald Trump know he's doing a great job cuz he is

1708
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,416
Will he ever

1709
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,512
Doubt that he's doing a great job but if he does he can come to my show everyday

1710
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:01,888
First date first time

1711
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:05,984
Yeah

1712
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,544
The real

1713
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,568
What

1714
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,336
Fox

1715
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,128
We had to get degrees

1716
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:17,760
Hey bro bro bro

1717
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:23,392
Sure there was a whole thing about the White House said that they did not offer Alex

1718
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,696
Infowars

1719
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,720
Alex

1720
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:30,304
It's for the taking

1721
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:32,352
He started opening up a washer

1722
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,632
Camden Bureau

1723
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:36,192
Jerome corsi

1724
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:42,592
Who is a guy who as I mentioned wrote an entire book about how Obama

1725
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:46,176
And also was a guy behind the Swift boat attack

1726
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,480
That were proven

1727
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,248
Tubi

1728
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,016
Erroneous

1729
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:52,064
And the term swiftboating

1730
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:56,928
Has become getting rats

1731
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,720
It's like dirty political trick

1732
01:35:59,232 --> 01:35:59,744
Hey man

1733
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:01,792
Empire

1734
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,632
And the guy

1735
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:10,496
He was probably alone in it one of the main guys behind it is now Alex Jones

1736
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,520
The bureau

1737
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:15,872
Chief who is trying to get credentials for to be in the pressroom

1738
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,640
Yeah it's

1739
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,920
F****** insane

1740
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,712
Real procreate

1741
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,856
Brain Force

1742
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,672
DNA Force

1743
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,280
She is very careful not to answer that question

1744
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,560
Okay does he not

1745
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,096
Poison Journal

1746
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:39,680
You know how whenever drop his ass

1747
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,472
Like the most recent one was

1748
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,520
You've got a bad man out

1749
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:46,592
They wield one out of the Superbowl

1750
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,872
The bad duties

1751
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:49,152
Globalist

1752
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,200
L dentist

1753
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,504
Alex has a lot of that

1754
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:04,768
That kind of thing and like we really need to worry about the Communist Chinese that's what he's more up on

1755
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,816
Whatever Russia comes up it's like

1756
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:13,472
Saudi Arabia the Communist Chinese

1757
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:16,032
Matt Damon

1758
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:19,616
He just went on Rogan's podcast and he kind of

1759
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,920
Sort of Cox out

1760
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,992
List

1761
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:27,040
Okay I can watch it

1762
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,856
But never really had him desire to watch it

1763
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:33,952
When you mentioned I had come on we'll talk about it

1764
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:43,424
It was way more of a train wreck that expect

1765
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:44,960
Brogan's

1766
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:45,984
Little cohort

1767
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,640
Anyway he's

1768
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:56,992
Alex unintentionally disparaging things about Joe Rogan

1769
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:00,832
Alex yeah

1770
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:05,184
But then I'd ever won a Superbowl

1771
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,720
They're not

1772
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,744
They're not cry babies

1773
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,560
They're not act like acting out War

1774
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,656
Is football a fake volcano

1775
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:19,264
Yeah I don't think that'll be as argument but it would probably be more logically sound

1776
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,544
Okay

1777
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,312
Anyway

1778
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,080
This is

1779
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,104
Incredibly in

1780
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,384
Secure and very sad

1781
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:30,528
Podcast get out the pups we already dominate to a great extent

1782
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:32,064
The internet

1783
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:37,696
Political news

1784
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,768
Infowars all put together

1785
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:43,328
Media outlets in the world

1786
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,144
Not sure but also

1787
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,424
I want to save this

1788
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:52,288
This is going to go on for a little while it's a little bit long and I apologize

1789
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,824
Put in the middle of

1790
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:57,408
Alex accidentally said one of the funnies

1791
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:03,808
Just wait you'll know it when I was going to say that me when it's ready

1792
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,112
I trust my comedic chops

1793
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:09,440
For me it's not a big we are

1794
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,192
Hi daughter.

1795
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:26,848
200 million people

1796
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,896
Watch or listen to

1797
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:32,224
The podcast out some people obviously don't see the whole thing but

1798
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,088
Infowars

1799
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,392
Basically do the same thing

1800
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,744
The biggest

1801
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,536
I went on Joe show

1802
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:51,168
Did you catch that was fun that was

1803
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:54,496
Look I don't care we do that or more I don't care about numbers

1804
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,544
Yeah also that so wrong

1805
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,824
That's awesome selfie

1806
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,848
There's no way

1807
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,616
That many people

1808
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,200
It's hard to tell it because it's a gather they're not a hug

1809
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:09,856
What he calls the derivatives are really trust attractive

1810
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:12,160
I don't know what it adds up to

1811
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,952
After like

1812
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,768
45 days or so

1813
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:20,608
The episode on YouTube was about like 2 million

1814
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,400
But if you would say that

1815
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:25,728
Like 100 200.

1816
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:26,752
Joe Rogan

1817
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:27,520
Pulling in now

1818
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,592
You would not be able to leave your house.

1819
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,360
Watching Joe Rogan

1820
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:33,408
Okay

1821
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:39,296
That's probably true

1822
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,064
Public

1823
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
Would be

1824
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,416
All Joe Rogan all the time

1825
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:48,768
I just realized if you like to yell about her CNN

1826
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:51,584
Like their best shows have Abby worship of 1 million

1827
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:53,376
So Rogan's getting

1828
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:55,936
200 * 7

1829
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,984
They're only get 1 million

1830
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:05,920
Ever

1831
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:13,088
And he said he's been on iTunes for 7 8:30 years since they started he said it never happened

1832
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:20,000
Up to the very top of the charts

1833
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:27,680
And of course you know there's hundreds of YouTube versions of it was 1.9 million three hundred thousand thousand thousand

1834
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,944
Blackout

1835
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:43,040
I just remember time to research 45 minutes

1836
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,880
Why he's going he's going on all the different

1837
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:53,536
Things and counting the numbers and stuff while he's spending like 5 minutes of his own show talking about how many views

1838
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:08,896
What the f*** I got a notepad

1839
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:10,944
Just right number

1840
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,760
Old timey adding machine

01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:18,112
Pink

1842
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:23,488
First of all I mean like

1843
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:27,584
Not accounting for overlap gas abilities

1844
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,056
Anyway

1845
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,896

Joseph Watson all he does is sort of race-baiting

1885
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:17,728
Complain about social justice Warriors

1886
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:22,080
But you just makes me super manipulative videos

1887
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:24,640
About like a

1888
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,408
He attack

1889
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,944
He builds up tweets

1890
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,248
As a straw man for himself to attack

1891
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:36,672
No nobody on the left really agrees with that

1892
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:41,024
He probably isn't

1893
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,072
Angry

1894
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,632
He looks like he's about to cry all the time

1895
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:47,168
Looks like

1896
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:54,336
In desperate need of some like red eyes

1897
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:58,688
He is the world's biggest p**** and he's always at the vet

1898
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,784
Boulder social justice Warriors make me

1899
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:05,088
Is British guy I hate

1900
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,416
I hate him

1901
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,184
It's

1902
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:13,536
You know it's me

1903
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,656
Not like this

1904
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,800
Today this whole thing is the prologue

1905
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,592
Joke around

1906
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:31,712
I didn't buy him a

1907
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,992
Resurrect

1908
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,272
Time machine

1909
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,552
Sing together

1910
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:39,648
His eyes are straight now

1911
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,184
Hallelujah

1912
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:45,536
Other stuff goes on on this episode that's not really important

1913
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,072
One of the things

1914
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,912
He has Rodger Stone on

1915
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:51,680
Rodger

1916
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,752
Ready to schedule stomach

1917
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:01,664
Narrative

1918
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,224
I think everyone laugh

1919
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,272
And now he's just not using that all

1920
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,184
They tried to spend that as that wasn't actually Putin it is MI6

1921
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:15,744
Which is

1922
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:18,560
Unnecessary layers for

1923
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:19,584
Anyway

1924
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:23,680
He was on it what they were talking about is about how there's leak

1925
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:24,960
Coming out of the

1926
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:25,984
Trump's house

1927
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:29,568
And if there's a civil war within the administration

1928
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:33,408
Yes

1929
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,968
Americana Grill Trump Folk

1930
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:38,272
Evan you have kellyanne Conway and rims

1931
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,040
Priebus

1932
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,576
We're trying to sink the ship

1933
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:42,624
Work there never trumper's

1934
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,648
Is hanging on

1935
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:44,672
Because they know that they can

1936
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:45,952
Keep some power

1937
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:49,536
And it's fascinating

1938
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:50,304
Yeah

1939
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,072
Okay

1940
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,864
We tried to make a Democrat

1941
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:59,264
The enemies of their consolidate against us

1942
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,312
What do you do

1943
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:03,360
There's division in the ranks

1944
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,152
Yeah I ran

1945
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:07,968
With with

1946
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:12,320
They tweeted did anyone else

1947
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:21,280
It's just like

1948
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:23,072
He sounds like a weird

1949
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:23,840
Star Wars

1950
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,376
We're going to get to the

1951
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,400
But

1952
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:30,752
Dragon Ball Z made it through the parsec

1953
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:32,544
Nobody

1954
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:33,824
There's cat look

1955
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:34,848
These people

1956
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:35,872
Around me

1957
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:37,408
There's no way driving to get

1958
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:38,944
Even if Papa

1959
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:46,880
With words fun is your ear like I was talking about this on the last episode that I have a little bit of hope that everything

1960
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:47,648
I'm going to workout

1961
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,464
And one of the reasons is because of this trend that I'm seeing

1962
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:53,024
Which is once you start blaming your own

1963
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:58,400
Deck collapse

1964
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,424
Gangnam Style

1965
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,752
Do you think I'll make it out for you

1966
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:03,776
No

1967
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:06,080
No I really don't think so

1968
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:09,152
They're already

1969
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:12,736
Mexico

1970
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:13,504
Impeachment

1971
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,552
He's doing it to himself

1972
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:18,368
He's making the case for himself

1973
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:25,792
Look I'm no super liberal I'm not a big limit

1974
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:26,816
But like

1975
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,608
Course he has to be in

1976
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,144
This is

1977
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:33,216
We're going to end up in the weirdest f******

1978
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:37,824
Situation in the world cuz he General Flynn

1979
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:44,224
At the same time they're getting a dick sucked by Russia in 69 they're both everyone's dick-sucking with 60

1980
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,552
Usher comes out

1981
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:53,952
If you want us to fight Isis with you a rain comes with the package deal

1982
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:02,400
Ran Rush is going to be mad about that

1983
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,752
Think about that possible angle

1984
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:10,336
Oh no I have a crazy wife

1985
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:13,664
So none of this is going to work out it's all embarrassing

1986
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:16,992
Sup

1987
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,784
Got a guy killed

1988
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,320
Kill tons of civilians

1989
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:21,856
Including a child

1990
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:25,184
Who I was the daughter of that out

1991
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,720
Atari guy

1992
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:28,768
He was a US citizen

1993
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:29,792
2

1994
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:32,096
Who's over there

1995
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:34,656
Also you know what

1996
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:35,936
She was a citizen

1997
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:40,544
You're not living at

1998
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,312
Abroad

1999
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,336
They killed in the sub

2000
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:44,640
Does raid in Yemen perforce that's Obama's fault

2001
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:45,664
Anyway

2002
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:48,992
But yet know it

2003
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:51,040
Once we have this narrative being

2004
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:51,808
Insolvent

2005
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,344
Listen

2006
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,880
The real problem

2007
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:56,416
Is it within our own org

2008
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,184
Organization there are

2009
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:00,512
We're witnessing essentially like

2010
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,048
Come out about

2011
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:09,984
Get were darker

2012
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,288
The weekday

2013
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:14,592
Trump loves the

2014
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:22,784
Cuz it keeps people guessing but also cheap

2015
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:24,064
Getting together

2016
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:24,832
Hey

2017
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:27,392
Have a little bit of a clip about

2018
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:28,416
Yemen

2019
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:29,440
And delete

2020
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,304
Crazy fanfiction

2021
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:39,680
You're on the air

2022
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:46,080
American snakes

2023
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,992
I saw that earlier in the week and then I

2024
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:59,392
And the list

2025
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:01,696
Because it was so effective and you know

2026
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:04,768
Obama doesn't want us to get rolled up because

2027
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:07,072
Hillary and Saudi Arabia

2028
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,216
Yes

2029
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,408
And we know Obama wouldn't bring like these list

2030
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:26,272
Special Operations

2031
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:27,552
Want to go after

2032
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:32,928
That's what happened

2033
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:37,024
Instead

2034
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:43,168
Obama wants because it's his real command bases

2035
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:53,152
And then that now moles in those very groups have now leaks

2036
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:56,480
Fortune show up

2037
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,528
In the world

2038
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:01,088
Inform

2039
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:03,136
That's one Theory

2040
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:05,184
Yeah it's

2041
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:07,744
Not substantiated or backed up

2042
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,280
Wasn't in the war room

2043
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:15,936
New York Times

2044
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:22,592
They talked about this

2045
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:23,616
These

2046
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:27,712
Yeah but when

2047
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,248
Secret service agent

2048
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,528
Telling him about Hillary

2049
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,552
It was a patriot

2050
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,088
Course I get the word out

2051
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,880
Yeah course

2052
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:39,488
Put a tiny bit on that

2053
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,352
Seriously

2054
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,424
Petty against

2055
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,728
Trump by leaking the location

2056
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:52,544
And that will get good man killed

2057
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,360
Waiting for that bread

2058
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,408
You know

2059
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:59,200
In some bizarre world.

2060
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:03,296
Maybe possible but also another possibility is

2061
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:06,112
Just doing a really bad job with preparation

2062
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:08,672
And going in half-cocked not knowing what the

2063
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:09,952
Situation is on the ground

2064
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:14,304
Never go in halftime to be by my male Vitality quarters are better

2065
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:18,912
Everything I've seen seems to indicate

2066
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,704
That is what happened

2067
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,240
They did not

2068
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:23,264
Thoroughly

2069
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,312
Figure out what was going on on the ground

2070
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:29,152
Why they walked into the situations they were unprepared for

2071
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:31,456
And

2072
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:34,272
I don't think the Lakers fault

2073
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,296
Tappan Department

2074
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,112
Yeah but it's so much more satisfying

2075
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:41,696
How to say you like someone else

2076
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:46,304
It's a great narrative there's no

2077
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:47,840
Curious to see if he ever does call

2078
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:48,608
Call trompo.

2079
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:53,472
But it's a great narrative

2080
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:55,264
Torture torture

2081
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:58,592
Which was interesting but his reasons for being

2082
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:01,152
Against torture we're not really morally

2083
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,432
Flat major chord

2084
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:04,224
That my problem

2085
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:05,760
The main room

2086
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:07,808

2087
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:10,880
Patriot

2088
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:12,416
Apple crate

2089
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:17,280
Is reasons we're like that if you torture them people can

2090
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:18,304
Use that against

2091
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,840
PR campaign

2092
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,608
The garlic

2093
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:21,376
That's not the real

2094
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:29,056
This is a little bit of a shorter show in terms of I liked because it was

2095
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,848
Yeah

2096
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:31,872
I think

2097
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:33,152
I don't think this is your fault

2098
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,688
I think this is Alex's fault

2099
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:37,760
Okay this show is not boring

2100
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:44,672
Not I'm not saying

2101
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:48,512
I think it's the Lord's Day

2102
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:54,912
And it was the Superbowl

2103
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:57,984
The Super Bowl

2104
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,544
Hey you not going to eat

2105
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,416

Good luck

2111
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:43,040
If you was going on he started this by saying I'm boycotting the Super Bowl and then started playing the Super Bowl

2112
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:49,440
Live live streaming at Super Ron's guns illegal also

NFL

2114
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:54,304
But also it's the opposite of boycott

2115
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:59,680
Hey guys I'm going live to prove it

2116
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:01,472

Super Bowl

2121
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:38,080

01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:52,672
Before Trump been in office

2124

The president-elect Obama passes a law signs it

2125
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:59,328

All shows got Trump's here is here

2136
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:47,200
And they're trying to censor it because it went to number one on Amazon political and it usually goes number one after that

2137
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:51,552
They want to ignore the fact

2138
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:58,208
Play Alex Joe Rogan podcast

2139
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,840

And he can't stop

2147
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:41,728
Just talkin about how great he is and how people don't give him enough attention

2148
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:48,128
Basically breaking multiple deadly sins

2149
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:49,664
Who's there

02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:08,352
In the middle he talked about how they're trying to ban websites that thing that Obama pushed through this legislation

2156
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:12,448
I would everyone if you're curious about this go ahead and read it

2157
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:14,752
2692

2158
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:16,544

02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:26,784
I'd love to hear that

2163
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:29,856
Important propaganda and disinformation act

2164
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:30,880
It is

2165
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:44,192
Poppycock bulshit I'll address to website you go online and find

2166
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:52,128
Also one of his bigger narratives is that it was pushed through by Obama during Christmas so no one would notice it

2167
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:55,968
In a bipartisan group

2168

Idea to that like

2185
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:39,232
Anytime there's censorship stuff we got to leave

2186
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:44,608
Also play this really quick

2187
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:49,984
It's probably one of the funniest things I've ever heard

2188
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:51,520
I'm a policy wonk

2189
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:55,872

I'm going to have that always ready on my phone

2193
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:06,880
Just in case I get in conversation I don't want to be in

2194
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:11,744
What does that mean I'm a policy wonk

2195
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:14,304
It's an expression that people use

2196
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,840
In political circles

2197
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:16,864

Chemtrails were justified by this

2206
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:48,352
Subsection 1520 paragraph B

2207
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:49,376

2212
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,688
What a deck

2213
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:03,712
