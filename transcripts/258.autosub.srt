1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:05,632
Just wanted to jump it with a

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,424
For this episode first stop

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,704
First piece of business

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,312
Two little bit of an apology

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:18,688
On the Rodger Stone being an indictment I apologize

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,480
It is a seven-count indictment

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,760
Mix that up

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,880
I had a little bit of a mix-up delivering information

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,416
Because the obstruction charge

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,720
And the witness tampering

11
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,488
DeSoto Blended

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,536
Tiny bit

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
Confused by that

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,888
Beyond that

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,960
We got episode here's the situation

16
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,800
We recorded this episode intended for it to be Monday's episode

17
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:50,688
Because of Rodger Stone business we had to

18
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:56,576
Here we are with a 2009 episode on Wednesday hoping no one is confused by that either

19
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
But

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
Because we got our days screwed up because this the world is crazy and Rodger Stone has trouble

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,816
Very special shout-out

22
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:12,192

23rd year here on this Earth

29
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,256
Let the episode of Rodger Stone

30
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,608
Eddie's on our part for that Rodger Stone

31
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520

Appreciate it

33

And

34
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,920
Holding

35
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
Alex

36
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,560
About Alex Jones High Jordan

37
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,912
What's the last time you heard of

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,496
You know those

39
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,080
Live comedy show in

40
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,384
Comedian

41
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,456
Sings A the theme from The Bodyguard but he puts

42
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,272
I can't think I can't think of any info

43
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,856
Listen to that I'm very glad that I haven't

44
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,208
I'm 37 years I blocked out

45
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,768
Things the only in Chicago

46
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
Songhai that I remember

47
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:48,704
Was the Iceman the Iceman open mics

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,104
He would sing a song called the best party ever

49
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,784
You know the song called the couch cows that I found really affect

50
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:10,208
Is lazy and not funny videos about being overweight girl on the couch

51
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,840
Worse than a fart song

52
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
That's as best I can do to fulfill your interview

53
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
But we can do

54
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,616
Is think some people who signed up

55
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Next

56
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,808
James Garner

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,624
I'm a policy wonk

58
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,912
I'm a policy wonk

59
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
The group

60
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,056
There hasn't been a raptor princess

61
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
People

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
It's tough to become a specific about what that actually means

63
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:11,392
Barely intentionally so where you donate above this amount and then you get

64
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
I don't want it to be more of a spiritual thing

65
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
Above and beyond

66
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,607
What could be considered

67
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
Monetary gain

68
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
Like that

69
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
Tritonlink

70
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,759
I just know I feel like it's kind of shity of us to not be specific about what it requires

71
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,367
This person donated on it

72
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,511
The show we can call this Criterium at

73
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
Everybody wants to hear the drop so let's hear it

74
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,311
Someone someone

75
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,711
Set me a bucket of poop

76
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Call Tori

77
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Control

78
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,775
Abused

79
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,383
Joseph Stalin

80
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Stop.

81
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
Welcome to McDonalds may I help you

82
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Really dark

83
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Click the button that says

84
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,447
Please do thank you so much

85
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
April 12th

86
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,927
Took me 10 minutes of listening to the show to realize oh this is the Chuck Norris interview I've already heard

87
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
You do it be really fun because we've seen so many times to do a present-day episode and then we go back into 2009 and itself

88
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
Hilarious

89
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:37,055
I don't know who this is Rodger Stone guys Rogers

90
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,151
Years after the point in 2009 that we're covering

91
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,911
Face on his back there's no way I would ever hang out with that guy

92
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,007
Keep this for me in the future if I ever

93
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:11,103
Rodger Stone

94
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,455
ABS this is actually I think it's going to be kind of fun

95
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Maybe a little bit

96
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
The 13th is a nature

97
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
It always is nice to remind

98
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
People that on April 8th

99
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Alex

100
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
Real hard on Soros

101
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,791
And then immediately started talking about how we like Somali pirates

102
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
What who knows

103
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
I'm so we find ourselves

104
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
You're on

105
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
The 12th is a Sunday

106
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Monday

107
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
I'm kind of expecting to

108
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,383
Somali pirates

109
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,479
I-80

110
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,551
At least

111
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Listen

112
00:07:54,367 --> 00:08:00,511
Don't talk about tomorrow you can't be that guy hey man you might not have a grasp of the story

113
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
You should you should probably

114
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Let It Go

115
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,495
On the 13th Alex

116
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,079
Somali pirate stuff because on the 12th

117
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:19,455
The story came to a head on that Sunday when he had the day off the best of episode

118
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,063
You should come in

119
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Was not

120
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
One way or another either they car

121
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,719
Sort of Valerie kind of narrative words

122
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:36,351
Yeah that's okay we got this guy's free from the clutches of these terrorists

123
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
You expect something

124
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Nothing

125
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
The day after Captain Phillips is freed

126
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,103
Nothing zero lose to though

127
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
What is it what

128
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
Even fighting again

129
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
You got

130
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,295
No real Soros talk to speak of

131
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
Nothing none of these trends

132
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Continuing at all

133
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
Everything is just

134
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,743
Everyday Is Random it's like it's a different show

135
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,559
There's no sterilize aspect to it

136
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
There's very little continuity

137
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,679
Is it anything to the point where I was second-guessing myself on my

138
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
Did I miss label these episode is this from 2010

139
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,335
Or something like that

140
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Double-check

141
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
Because it's so

142
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
Ingress but like I said Alex

143
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Sunday off

144
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
On the 12th and comes in on the 30

145
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Out of context

146
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
Very very relaxing actually have two full days off I didn't do

147
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Any word

148
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
Saturday or Sunday

149
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
Well it's not really true I only did 45 hours a week

150
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Research

151
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,175
Saturday night Sunday night but I don't really call that work so

152
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Call Schiff

153
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,111
The cover today important broadcast

154
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,975
I'm just amazingly important news and information

155
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,279
Okay so I

156
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
No chance

157
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,655
I mean you did take 2 days off whatever Centro

158
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,751
Four to five hours of studying on your the f*** out of here Alex

159
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
F*** out of

160
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
So

161
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175
What is

162
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
He starts off the show with

163
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Is

164
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Bird flu

165
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
Right but

166
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,647
It's confusing to me because the narrative hasn't developed at all

167
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
The exact same

168
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,255
That we heard any Baxter Pharmaceutical

169
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Narrative that we heard

170
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
So here is Alex jumping back in

171
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,223
People dying

172
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,831
Bird flu in 18 countries mixed with the vaccine

173
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
Directions being injected with live Birds

174
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,791
That's why they got

175
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,311
Bird flu

176
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,615
Mixed with regular human

177
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,607
Fulbright

178
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,959
He's just hitting those same points about that story all over again

179
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,311
And if you recall much of the information about the story was based on

180
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
Supposed there was written by Paul Joseph Watson

181
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,175
On Infowars

182
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
Why not just keep

183
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
Likes o this is

184
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,279
They have dipped

185
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:22,911
Talk about it

186
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,263
Backup

187
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Like a timeline

188
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Just doesn't

189
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
To be relevant

190
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
Russia

191
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Mystery Theater

192
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,767
On PBS

193
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,519
Research Saturday

194
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
Play on the backyard

195
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
Play in the sandbox

196
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Playing with cars on the floor

197
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
All sorts of evil things like that

198
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,015
My family going up my email

199
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:20,255
So he's responding a defensive about someone

200
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,071
Bring up got to bring back up

201
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,519
Is actively working for the opposition

202
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,615
Not talking about it

203
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
Absolutely negotiates with

204
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
Trolls

205
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,391
Of The Message Board variety

206
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,751
Alex can trace back where this criticism

207
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
From

208
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
It's another

209
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,639
Gcn talk show

210
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
Okay let me look at it

211
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
So I sit there

212
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
And I listen to it

213
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,607
Call radio show

214
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
And I

215
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Find talk show host

216
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,847
Is Mark Marek

217
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
You're that lady for calling from New York

218
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Freaking out

219
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,831
1 800 2599 231

220
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
What's your address

221
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
She says

222
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Oh my gosh

223
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
There's a truck driver he Spanish

224
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,239
These silos

225
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
From Spain

226
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
And it's delivered

227
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,527
And

228
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Department

229
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,023
And you listen to it and I just know what's real I know it's not.

230
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
Another Genesis

231
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,911
Communications Network show got a collar lesbeth

232
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
Extravagant

233
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,751
Bird flu conspiracy theory

234
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,079
And Alex demonstrates pretty clearly

235
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,943
To engage in critical thinking what he wants to that is a little bit of a towel

236
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,039
Number of people

237
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
The show and heard this caller

238
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Believe

239
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,695
Theory is Alex of covering up this stuff

240
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:03,583
So this leads to about a 40-minute chunk of Alex's show where he's super defensive about that

241
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:11,263
I do however

242
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,127
FedEx

243
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
He had no f******

244
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,559
Conspiracy theorist

245
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:41,215
I've no idea what was going to go down

246
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
1

247
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Could imagine

248
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
In the

249
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,063
Find a word I can mispronounce

250
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,135
Emagine

251
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
About listening

252
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,583
To Alex playing that caller

253
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,191
He doesn't really have much analysis other nuts

254
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,007
And does you wrong and I know that

255
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,335
I know but my version of stuff is the right version

256
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
And so it's

257
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
The fry on this

258
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
You're lying

259
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
These disease silos or whatever

260
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,351
11

261
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
You know you didn't mean

262
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,471
From Spain mean from Spain

263
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
You didn't mean

264
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
A Spanish man

265
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
There's bigger fish to fry

266
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,919
But before we get to those big fish

267
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
We need to know what we need to know once

268
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,575
Something I don't know I don't know if we

269
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,879
I have ever considered

270
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
This way but Alex

271
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
About to tell us why he's successful

272
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,511
I'm successful

273
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
In reaching people on this radio show

274
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:18,239
Hyperventilating isn't reason I'm successful myfreec hasn't reason I'm successful no it's because

275
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,799
What can be proved

276
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Bulshit

277
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Bat

278
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
Is a

279
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
F******

280
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,855
Only focus on what

281
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,695
That's unfair rude

282
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
Nothing to say

283
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,839
Especially so strike and force

284
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
You can't be that can

285
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,727
Convinced of the thing you know

286
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:54,079
You're not doing yeah it is weird especially where this episodes going

287
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
To go like

288
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
Report

289
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:03,551
Can't prove

290
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,903
From Alex Jones his entire career there was Sable

291
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
This episode

292
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,743
I'm and he brings up one of them

293
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,791
He can't prove anything you saying about that

294
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,383
Homeland Security documents

295
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
Read the document in about 20 minutes

296
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,647
And I was sure it was real because paragraph

297
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
New realm

298
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Dafont

299
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,471
100 series of federal control numbers I've seen on documents

300
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:00,383
But I went ahead and emails I went ahead and called

301
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,455
I went ahead and called the

302
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,575
Infrastructure protection Fusion Center numbers on it

303
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:14,719
Talk to the watch captains that I had it

304
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
Broken the last 12 hours

305
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
Classic Tech

306
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
I could we want to wear

307
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,039
Superman

308
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,087
So two narratives on the show

309
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,671
Both of them have been the result of people bullying

310
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
Which isn't good that doesn't seem like a good way to go about

311
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,583
I'm so there's a DHS Department of Health

312
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Security.

313
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
Is reporting on

314
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
These folks and he's proven that it's real

315
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
Looking for this next clip and then I'll address that

316
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,687
Call the FBI phone numbers confirm

317
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
Yes

318
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,135
In Missouri and talk to him and I said yeah that's our report

319
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,976
Are you noticing anything that seems really strange about the way he's speaking

320
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,840
Infrastructure Fusion

321
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,144
Things about

322
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
Yeah I would like to know more about that

323
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,592
Call the FBI

324
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
Exist

325
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
Department of Justice

326
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,432
Which is a separate government body

327
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
From the Department of Homeland

328
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Insecurities

329
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:45,856
Actually have phone numbers on

330
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,952
But they're all dhs.gov

331
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,256
Email addresses not FBI email addresses

332
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,096
The FBI doesn't factor into this at all the only place the FBI comes up is

333
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
Is in a footnote

334
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,936
The desert people should report potential terrorist activity

335
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:05,312
DHHS FBI and says the FBI's phone numbers can be found on the FBI's website

336
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
Alex is clearly just making s*** up

337
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
Female bows

338
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,504
Those those addresses that's entirely possible

339
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,832
But that you could not have called the FBI

340
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
From this document

341
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,720
Actually just to correct myself a little bit

342
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,000
There are some numbers for

343
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
DHHS

344
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,328
In that footnote about call them

345
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
So there are those phone numbers

346
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,496
Was more that I'm making is that Alex

347
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
He's staying

348
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,824
He called the FBI and that's absurd

349
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,224
I wonder if you could like

350
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Google Hangout

351
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
With the DHHS

352
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,488
Baby eats one of those email addresses

353
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
Actually has

354
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,120
I don't know in 2009 probably.

355
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,912
So you might be asking yourself

356
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:08,032
Alex's confirm by calling the FBI

357
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
Whatever

358
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
You guys know this document

359
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,712
Sure Alex go the f*** away

360
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,760
What

361
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
What is it about

362
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,120
And I have confirmed its authenticity

363
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,216
And

364
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
.

365
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,800
.

366
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
Hardcore

367
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,296
Off-the-charts long pause hardcore

368
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:55,904
What do you know Alex Jones is editorial line is backed up by

369
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,232
Secret document that's been released isn't that amazing

370
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:05,632
Every single thing you find evidence that the government people with guns it's strange

371
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
Knows how to read

372
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,944
Turns out he's not a reliable source

373
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Let's just

374
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:32,256
So if it's a little bit more about this

375
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,544
You are the number one federal government

376
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
That's what

377
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:54,016
Document number 18-025 7-0 999

378
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,392
And you can call the FBI up right now note is there.

379
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,208
It's not their document why would you call the FBI

380
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
DHHS

381
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:08,608
Report

382
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,680
Is called

383
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:16,032
Current economic and political climate fueling resurgence radicalization

384
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
And it's not a document or anything

385
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
Sing like that

386
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,200
It's definitely a real document is for official use only

387
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,480
Which of the designation

388
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,528
Documents that the relevant

389
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
Government

390
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
Have a reasonable expectation

391
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:32,160
What cause harm to an ongoing effort should the information

392
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
He made public

393
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,280
You can think of it as something akin to like an interdepartmental equivalent of like

394
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,840
Attorney client privilege

395
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,704
This document is any bird sitters then Alex's take on the miac report

396
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
But it's

397
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,568
In both cases Alex's mystery document

398
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,152
It's not to describe legitimately dangerous militia and extremist activities

399
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:56,736
And because a lot of it is stuff he's pretty models description

400
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,576
He gets defensive and screams about how the document is secretly about him

401
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
It's not

402
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
There's nothing in this document

403
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,952
To suggest that the authors of this reports American

404
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
As their main enemy

405
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,840
For fucksake literally says quote

406
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:18,240
Both right-wing extremists and law-abiding citizen shareablee that Rising rates

407
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,568
Make the purchase of legitimate Firearms a wise move at this time

408
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,408
That's a weird thing for people looking to demonize gun ownership to say

409
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
Legitimate firearm

410
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,528
Law Abiding Citizen

411
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
That's not that's not what gun

412
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,880
Demonize others would say

413
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,696
Mysteriously that passage is absurd

414
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,280
From all reports

415
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
The strongest statement the document makes

416
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
About Gunn

417
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Is this

418
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,192
And I think it's a measured and reasonable stay

419
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,544
Weapons rights and gun control legislation are likely to be hotly contested

420
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Subjective

421
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,360
In light of the 2000s

422
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
Court decision

423
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
In. DC vs. Heller

424
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,504
Which in which the court reaffirmed the individuals rights

425
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,064
Keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment to the US Constitution

426
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,160
But left open the debate the precise Contours of that right

427
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,720
Because debates over constitutional rights are in

428
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Deeply-held some

429
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,840
Fear but vastly the Virgin beliefs

430
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
Violent extremists

431
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
May attempt

432
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,192
The Coop use the controversy

433
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
Happy as a radicalization

434
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
That is very

435
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,312
Correct

436
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Not

437
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
2

438
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,896
Editorialize

439
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
On my way

440
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,296
This report also could have been called

441
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,856
I think a good name for it would have been

442
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
There's a black president these ships

443
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,184
Are going crazy

444
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
Well let's keep an eye on it

445
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
Everybody's buying gun

446
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,048
Because everybody's going crazy

447
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,912
There's a piece of that in terms of the

448
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,752
The stuff in the

449
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:01,920
This document that motivates

450
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:08,832
But it's important to point out that this does not mean in any way that they're applying to Alex or anyone who shares that world you are terrorists

451
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
Or even extreme

452
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
I would put it to you this way

453
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
I believe strongly in animal rights

454
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,024
Which is a position that I share with groups like the animal Liberation Front

455
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:21,888
If I were to report about how extremist for animal rights believe that animals shouldn't

456
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Be tested on

457
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,496
I wouldn't think that apply to me just because I agree that animals shouldn't

458
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Be tested on

459
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,336
Is very Elementary stop in the idea that Alex

460
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,664
Not to get it could be seen as proof that he's dumb as a rock

461
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
But he's not

462
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,296
It's very clear.

463
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
To create the image

464
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856
A repressive government

465
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,440
It's going to turn on the noble white gun-owning Christian anytime now

466
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
He's doing this because he needs to

467
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Create an anime

468
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
Fruit

469
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
Which is ironically a large

470
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
Part of what this report is about

471
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
Using the threat of the government

472
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:03,872
Guns as an Avenue to radicalized

473
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:10,016
Well not necessarily in the case of Alex

474
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,856
Info Warrior fold where you just give Alex money

475
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
This report is

476
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,000
About Alex

477
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,584
Because here's the deal

478
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:30,752
Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you based on his response

479
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,104
It says that right-wing extremists are using fears of illegal immigration

480
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,152
Radicalized

481
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:43,808
But it also goes on in April 2007 6 militia members

482
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
We're rested

483
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
For various weapons and explosives violation

484
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,928
1 open source reporting

485
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,488
Alleged

486
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
Conducted surveillance for a machine gun attack on

487
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Hispanic

488
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,144
The report says that fears about the election of the first a

489
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,192
Can American president were being used by extreme

490
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:04,032
But it then says that it's talking about things like how quotes

491
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Intuit

492
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
In the run-up to the

493
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:11,968
Extremist appear to be in the early planning stages of some threatening activity targeting the Democratic nominee

494
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
But law enforcement intercede

495
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:19,392
You can be a racist gun-loving New World Order figurine Christian identitarian

496
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,440
And the Department of Homeland Security is not going

497
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,976
What to give a f*** about you

498
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,024
They start caring when you start committing

499
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
And planning terrorist

500
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,352
The text and that's what this report is about

501
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,424
Alex isn't doing that he shouldn't take it personally

502
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
The fact that he does take it so personally

503
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,032
If 6th grade so much drama about this

504
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,312
Kind of leaves me with a science

505
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,872
But he identifies with and supports the goals

506
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Of terrorists

507
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
Status report

508
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
Is actually about

509
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:49,088
Because I was about to say that I feel like one of the big reasons that

510
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:54,976
Feels like they are talking about

511
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,792
Just a regular gun-owning the America

512
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
We keep going back to

513
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Like

514
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,680
Every time he has one of these new document proves all of his

515
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
His b*******

516
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
About how the government

517
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,056
Stop anyone who has a right Lena

518
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,408
Every single time we just get more and more indication

519
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,480
It's like it's about you Alex

520
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
And because of your response

521
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,320
You're clearly indicating that

522
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
You identify with

523
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:28,512
These like it's very clear as you read the document it's not about like a blowhard on a radio show

524
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,584
It's not about johnny-come-lately who's got a gun

525
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
They don't give a fuk

526
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,144
Militia members

527
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,544
Of which Alex they don't even care about militia members they care about militia

528
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
Remembers that planned violent attack

529
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
It's clear

530
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
It is very

531
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
Very clear

532
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,736
The report is specifically about people who plans Island

533
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,528
If you don't plans Island

534
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
And you're not

535
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
In some kind of

536
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,856
Violent group

537
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
Then

538
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,184
You know you shouldn't be

539
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
Offended

540
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,280
In fact I think you have a greater

541
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,584
Impotent to support this report

542
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:10,240
Because you don't want those violent people watering up your movement

543
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
If you legitimately believe

544
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
All of the things

545
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,104
Malicious

546
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,968
Armed Rebellion against the United States

547
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
Their existence

548
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
Kind of hurt

549
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
You

550
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
You would say

551
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
Yeah you would think

552
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
What was the what

553
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,720
Supreme Court case was it

554
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,304
Use the Second Amendment to protect their right to

555
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Plan violence

556
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,656
That's just free speech dantos DC vs. Heller

557
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,776
Love that too fast

558
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:48,128
Stop it for now but I assure you we will get back

559
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,176
Gets distracted

560
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
Mr. crappie describes what the globalist

561
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,784
Ideal

562
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
That situation that there were

563
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
Working

564
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,136
If you listen to this I think

565
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
Familiarity

566
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
Understand what the setting up here

567
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,280
Highly controlled

568
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
Government

569
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,888
In private corporate reservations

570
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,824
They're called shroud of National Security

571
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,872
Outside

572
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Highly controlled

573
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
Compact City

574
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,880
Private manners

575
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,928
Plantation

576
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,208
Outside

577
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
Image of Allstate

578
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:46,496
Don't have it yet

579
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
They're very close

580
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Be afraid but

581
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
He always strikes

582
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
Those are whatever

583
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,040
Okay if you're talkin are you trying to describe

584
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
Is that what he's doing

585
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,160
I don't think he's describing

586
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,184
Is anything different

587
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,744
The situation

588
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,096
Living in isolated

589
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Nice

590
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,960
Manners and then everybody else

591
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,568
Struggling to survive

592
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,640
But he's kind of talking about the real world but

593
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
Justin

594
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Like

595
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,968
Distorted and twisted

596
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,016
Crazy-house mirror

597
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,136
He's talking about something real

598
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
That is a huge problem

599
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
And yet

600
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
He is defending the people

601
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
Who have created that problem as being

602
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
Perfect

603
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,352
Was there the middle class

604
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,936
Compare to the globalist

605
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,496
Okay fair enough that's kind of how he looks

606
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Documentary

607
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,360
Days off

608
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
It wasn't

609
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,528
This weekend

610
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,576
America

611
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,392
About the Reverend Moon

612
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Crazy

613
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,816
Alex has seen a documentary about Reverend Sun Myung Moon

614
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,120
I knew you liked that guy is crazy

615
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,080
Is the Washington f****** time that is owned by The Moody

616
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,712
That's ridiculous

617
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:38,112
He was referencing a documentary about the guy from San Francisco 100 years ago

618
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
He's also not talking about the gentleman

619
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
Columbia Missouri

620
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:51,936
When I was growing up there

621
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:58,848
Because he wouldn't stop bothering people downtown crown

622
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,152
Yeah I recognized massage

623
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,480
We need to have a cool looking

624
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
And it doesn't get worse over in that a Burger King

625
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,648
Hilarious that Alex

626
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,696
Can see that's crazy

627
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,744
But can't recognize them

628
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,280
He gets a lot of his information

629
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
We've been looking at the

630
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
Tea party stuff

631
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,912
Yeah in the course of

632
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,192
2009

633
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,752
Completely forgot we were looking at a party stuff

634
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:32,896
I forgot about the questions kind of an answer

635
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,968
Actually I think we might

636
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
Be about done with

637
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,064
The band

638
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,648
I still think there's a lot of interesting stuff going on we see these like

639
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
Real formative block cehs

640
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,000
Support is really important

641
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,048
My acropora is really important

642
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
Slimes are the bird flu narrative

643
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,400
It really important to Alex's

644
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Like

645
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
He builds

646
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
From here

647
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,032
Seneca's Value Inn

648
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,104
We set out to figure out when you started talking about George Soros

649
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
We found that April 8th

650
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
2009 episode

651
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,504
And then going to be awhile till we get back to it

652
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
I don't think they do

653
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
Yeah

654
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
I don't

655
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,672
I from the episodes that I've listened to after it I don't think

656
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:21,536
Like he was in a mood that day or something like that I don't know exactly what's going on

657
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,840
But I feel kind of resolved about like

658
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,144
When it started when it's flared up

659
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,448
And then secondarily the other question was

660
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,752
You know when did he get on board with

661
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
Tea Party

662
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,848
I think based on the factory cini's interviews with Stewart Road

663
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
The Oath Keepers guy

664
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,944
I hate glad back

665
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
Stop

666
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,272
Starting to feed exactly what happened there

667
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Mystery

668
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
He decided

669
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
Large groups

670
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
You're close enough to his beliefs

671
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Go f*** with them

672
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
The straight up

673
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
What kind of answer

674
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,864
I believe I do remember this reading this new story on April 8th

675
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
2000

676
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,912
At around

677
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
AIDS

678
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,264
George Soros did cut off Alex

679
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,456
How old is Dory

680
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
So

681
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,600
When I say that I think we kind of answer the question about the

682
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,392
Tea party it also involves

683
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
The clips that were about to

684
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,280
Can I take this kind of made my mind up

685
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
This is this is what's going on

686
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,608
So you get the call from a guy

687
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,168
Who is in San Antonio

688
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,704
Hattie's

689
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,264
You got the news about the San Antonio Tea Party

690
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
Coming up

691
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,336
Matthew in Texas

692
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:46,784
Hey God bless you like this is Matthew from San Antonio change reported in

693
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,600
Creepy party update

694
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
Okay

695
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
Okay

696
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:58,560
1023 parties basically saying because

697
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,608
They don't want Alex Jones here

698
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,144
And they said

699
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,984
What do I got to do for creditor group and he's basically getting Intel for us

700
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,800
Didn't want any bull horns

701
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,616
Because they're troublemakers there anybody with a bullhorn

702
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,152
Is the troublemaker

703
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,624
Nannying or so Freedom will just have your own

704
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,096
Fox News and Glenn Beck are trying to take over the

705
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
Tea Party

706
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
Alex Jones

707
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
Is now

708
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
Taking ownership

709
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,728
In retrospect

710
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
Yeah

711
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,848
Yeah that's what he's already here in April 2009

712
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:47,712
What does the Fox News and Glenn Beck

713
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,064
Bright literally

714
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,160
Another thing to say about the

715
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,032
Notice how they're trying to take over

716
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:17,920
Show up at

717
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
You gotta love it

718
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,528
That

719
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
Piano

720
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,112
The tea party was large

721
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648
Ashley AstroTurf

722
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,464
Fun

723
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,840
Forgiving them

724
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
Tons of money

725
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,680
Freedomworks and Americans

726
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,472
Prosperity

727
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,264
They came from

728
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,800
In the group citizens

729
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
Without a condom

730
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,128
Their first chairman

731
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
Was Ron Paul

732
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,968
It was funded by the Koch brothers

733
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,272
Citizens First sound economy

734
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,088
Had registered a tea party website

735
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,392
A 2002

736
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,232
They already had some sort of plans of trying to

737
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
To do something like this

738
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
Before

739
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,072
But the climate wasn't

740
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,120
Right there wasn't the ability to

741
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,400
To make these

742
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
These things

743
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,496
Make it make it a real

744
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,312
There is no reason to believe that

745
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,896
The idea that Ron Paul is behind the

746
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,432
Real tea party

747
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,712
Glenn Beck

748
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:28,064
And his Coke funding through forget works is behind the real Noah's Ark

749
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,112
Contradictory

750
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,648
They're exactly the same

751
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,512
This Is The Life in the right-hand basically

752
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,536
Absolutely

753
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,816
It's interesting

754
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
To see cuz I

755
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,424
To know if I understand

756
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
Finding out

757
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
If he asks

758
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
He knows that

759
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
Is the Koch brothers

760
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,872
Who's funding the entire

761
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,967
Or if he thinks it is inorganic I find I find this fascinating

762
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
Because

763
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,391
I mean what you what you got a movement that Alex thinks is being taken over by Glenn Beck

764
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,439
Not recognizing

765
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
Find it

766
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:07,999
Alex

767
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
Want

768
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,303
To take ownership of it

769
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
So he is

770
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
Free dating

771
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
His check

772
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,167
He's like

773
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:21,567
To make it look like he bought this before

774
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,639
The first party was on the 27th of February

775
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,687
And we've been going over it since then

776
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
When that happened

777
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,807
What it was

778
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,343
You did back then

779
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,903
Koch brothers knew what it was

780
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
So

781
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,511
I don't know I don't know what this means other than like

782
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,559
There's no mystery to me anymore

783
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:46,399
Alex just believe he's the true version of it

784
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
That's about it

785
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,799
It's not if there's no there's no mystery

786
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,615
Left in their Tea Party

787
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
Part of

788
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
Open the app

789
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,855
San Antonio

790
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,903
Okay

791
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
I didn't ask for updates

792
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
S***

793
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:20,447
Why are you giving me an update let alone that

794
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:25,311
The color is like we've infiltrated

795
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:29,919
Retro meeting infiltrated it cover

796
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:40,671
Federate flag

797
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:46,559
Whatever

798
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
Complaints about Glenn Beck

799
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,167
Stealing his movement movement

800
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
He also thinks

801
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Contact

802
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
I mean I feel like I'm

803
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:21,631
You're about to say something

804
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
What

805
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,447
Which one

806
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,687
You are the fake mini charm

807
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,087
That these are people to watch these are people in the back

808
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,135
And

809
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,607
You got to find any man really got to stop saying fake mini charm either like it means something what does that even mean

810
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,911
I just hate

811
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,471
Fix that he's not sincere

812
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:03,871
That's part of it threatened by because it's not masculine

813
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
And he labels that

814
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,479
Yeah

815
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,759
How do you say Mini

816
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,319
That many times.

817
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:16,159
You know you know what you're trying to say but you don't want to say

818
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:16,927
Exactly

819
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,487
Answer in the next clip Alex.

820
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,535
He makes clear

821
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,303
Orgone

822
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,631
And you support Glenn Beck

823
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:32,031
No

824
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:32,799
Michelle

825
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,615
Because in Texas

826
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,199
Fort Worth

827
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,759
And how they work

828
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,463
I mean

829
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:54,047
This is this is where they castrate

830
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,495
I think I know what William Travis would have said

831
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:11,199
That's probably a big part of this big old drunk

832
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:17,599
Right left her with child because I was wanted by the police

833
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
Want to go to prison

834
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
Ended up

835
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,719
Running a militia at the Alamo

836
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
Cardi B quotes

837
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:35,007
So if you support Glenn Beck

838
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:41,151
You go to this event going to get two balls chopped off whatever that whatever that is

839
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
Questions

840
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,999
I think it is just a matter of

841
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,303
Thinking Glenn Beck stole his s***

842
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,327
I want to get back

843
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,887
And the BMV more extreme version

844
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,935
By virtue of Association

845
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
More with yolk

846
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
Keepers then

847
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,519
Tea party 912

848
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,055
Middle-of-the-road

849
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
You can hear it here

850
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,943
Website backup

851
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,279
Against the private Bankers there looting and rioting

852
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,815
Which is very popular right now

853
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
What's the truth

854
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
Weird

855
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
A good guy

856
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,775
It's the

857
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:45,407
I think it was on one of our recent episodes feel like it's going to be such a bummer if the answer to this is

858
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Team sports

859
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,015
It wasn't about the Tea Party but turns out in terms of

860
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,551
Edwards

861
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,111
It was

862
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,743
Bulshit was that organic or were they also fun

863
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
I'm sure they got some

864
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,583
I don't know enough

865
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,239
That's that

866
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,823
I started this thing

867
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,175
Being on Alex's show as the

868
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,503
Alternative the more militant alternative

869
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,063
I bet also being accepted

870
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,623
So I think there's a possibility

871
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,159
She served as like a middle ground

872
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,463
And that led to what

873
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,255
Membership rolls

874
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,559
And then along with that financing

875
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,607
I have no idea I don't I don't know entirely

876
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,423
It was entirely organ

877
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,959
Yeah that's probably

878
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,799
OrganiCann

879
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
Apps

880
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,127
Salute like it was

881
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,431
It does seem like the tea party was

882
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,991
Fully financed

883
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:59,391
Tea party. Blogspot.com

884
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,927
I didn't want to buy it

885
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
Which

886
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,023
You're not the only reason you wouldn't do that is if you couldn't

887
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,607
Yeah

888
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
The cash to throw into

889
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
So

890
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
At this point Alex jump

891
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,215
Back to the

892
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,007
DHS report

893
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,103
He has Naomi wolf on for an interview

894
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,663
Considering she's a democratic

895
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Strategist

896
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Advisor

897
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
Contentious

898
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:34,463
Yeah that's what I'm not working

899
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:39,071
She's like in the middle of a sentence

900
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,679
What's going on

901
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,983
Answer the quarterback on the phone and then

902
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:52,383
I can't hear you at all you could hear her saying I'm really sorry I can't hear you

903
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,759
It's okay if it doesn't work interview m

904
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,039
Nothing happening

905
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,111
They even have like how much

906
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,647
Talking to they actually do

907
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,511
And that was it

908
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,815
It was more

909
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
Friendly then

910
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,631
Expect

911
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,703
Add a little bit of that is because a lot of position she was

912
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,031
The table that were critical of Obama

913
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
Slipknot

914
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
At this point

915
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,127
April 2009

916
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,455
You know you been in office a month or two and she had

917
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,503
Some of the similar complaints

918
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,295
Alex

919
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,111
Getting rid of stye

920
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:38,207
Choose choose coming from

921
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,231
The centre-left

922
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,047
I guess making those Critters

923
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,375
I think you could have been an interesting conversation and actually kind of dip

924
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,959
Interesting to see how that dynamic

925
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,751
Play doubt

926
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,567
We could just get a f****** broken phone

927
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,967
It's one of them it's like a similar conversation to what I would have with

928
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,759
I would imagine

929
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,599
I'm criticizing Obama for fake

930
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,159
And I'm like

931
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
I'm just criticizing him

932
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,975
I'm for real thing

933
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,303
The our disagreement comes. From

934
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
He is deserving

935
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
But that your credit

936
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:24,287
Or even I don't know if your family be on this side but I think

937
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,335
To this would be

938
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Is

939
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,151
Make the same criticism

940
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,223
As a legitimate

941
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,015
And then the other side

942
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,295
Is exploiting

943
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
And using

944
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,135
Basis

945
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:44,255
Extrapolate into irresponsible Ludacris

946
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
I kind of think that's

947
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,327
I think it's really in

948
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,607
Interesting because of

949
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,167
Superficial agree

950
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:55,519
They would have probably both of Tears through like

951
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
Oh Alex

952
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:00,383
No do not hold on because the f****** phone broke

953
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,455
The reality of a conversation

954
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,247
My family would be there arguing

955
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
Ridiculous s***

956
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,599
Because there is a receipt

957
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,647
The best

958
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
Criticism

959
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
Things that are you are

960
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,231
Bingo

961
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:20,863
Difference between arguing Ludacris things in good faith versus arguing

962
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
I don't know

963
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,471
Will never know

964
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,775
Maybe until she comes back a week from now

965
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:31,359
I don't know

966
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,895
Tooth is DHS document

967
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,247
It's interesting to hear him try and discuss this be

968
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,783
Because he's just lying about ever

969
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,831
Like legitimately

970
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,879
Even lying about what's in the tech

971
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,439
Vale

972
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
It's about races

973
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:53,375
This is the election of the first African-American president

974
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,143
Unique

975
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,703
Drivers for right-wing radicals ation in

976
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,751
Recruitment

977
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,287
They're not applying everybody's races

978
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:04,639
That's not what that sentence means at all

979
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,431
On its face you can understand that

980
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,271
At the beginning of a clip you said this is inspection to you

981
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,087
Every paragraph start

982
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,135
With you dash dash

983
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,695
Ouo

984
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,487
That's the designation

985
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,071
Fouo means for official use only

986
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,351
You mean

987
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,887
Unclassified

988
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:29,215
Hid the fact that he's saying this is infection you

989
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:33,567
It doesn't understand that they you before the paragraph means unclassified

990
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,639
It doesn't realize that all the paragraphs

991
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:40,479
It leads me to believe that he doesn't have as much experience reading documents

992
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,575
As he claims to the fact that he says I can read this

993
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:51,231
I can look I spend all my time the last 20 years reading these secret official document and I'm

994
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:58,399
That I understand what they're saying when it's not literally what they're saying I can read between the lines

995
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
Do-Re-Mi

996
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
This is pathetic

997
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
Yeah that's

998
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,287
No

999
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,103
Alex

1000
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,639
Flexion

1001
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,687
He is right

1002
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,991
They are all section

1003
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,319
Trying to say this is the part of the document at the yeah

1004
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,111
I don't help you with that at all

1005
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
Crazy

1006
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
Brazy

1007
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,207
And I don't have experience

1008
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,255
Like secret government document

1009
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,071
I don't I can't trust

1010
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,095
I just was like

1011
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:34,495
If you did have experience really secret government documents you wouldn't you wouldn't be able to tell me I believe that you do

1012
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,263
Experience

1013
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
Secret government.

1014
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:40,383
I believe this is an entirely controlled opposition

1015
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,455
Situation you are funded fully by the government

1016
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,735
This is all a

1017
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:50,623
The wish

1018
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,439
You could walk out of here

1019
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
Angle

1020
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,743
You're fully furnished

1021
00:54:55,999 --> 00:55:02,143
I don't actually live where is bag of chips

1022
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:08,543
Sitting on my deck clearly from Iran your wallet is February

1023
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,823
Sorry 2017

1024
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,407
What else could that mean if your a secret government operative

1025
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,783
Real for Kootenai the wall calendars are in effect

1026
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:25,695
Possibility in February 2017 Diane aspirations

1027
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
The organization

1028
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
Because it is

1029
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,887
Indication of him not having

1030
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
The Bona fides

1031
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:39,519
Pretends to have been willing to believe that

1032
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,543
Read a bunch of

1033
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,103
Unclassified Declassified

1034
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:49,759
Stuff like that like I didn't understand what he was reading or he was just making up stuff about them as read them

1035
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,623
But that's beyond

1036
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,695
Anybody listening

1037
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:01,791
Who actually does understand any of this stuff should also be like

1038
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,815
Oh no

1039
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,095
Alex

1040
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,631
You just gave it up

1041
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,679
You just you just indicated that you don't know what you're talkin

1042
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
And about

1043
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,495
Government

1044
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,543
It also makes it hard

1045
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,335
Makes it hard for me to believe

1046
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,103
Anybody who

1047
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,383
He's in the military

1048
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,199
Or anything like that or in intelligence

1049
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,015
Anybody who is in those fields

1050
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,319
Isn't motivated to support Alex

1051
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
Based on his

1052
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,647
I don't understand

1053
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,927
He's a credible source

1054
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,719
In terms of like facts

1055
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,487
Information

1056
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,839
There are government

1057
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,375
With section

1058
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,191
Sections you if you will

1059
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,751
So I would invite you to read this document

1060
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:46,847
Every single paragraph

1061
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,663
But if you had not read this

1062
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,687
In particular

1063
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,991
You would be fine with him saying sexy

1064
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,015
Norwood

1065
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:58,879
Oh okay

1066
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,671
Arbiter

1067
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,279
No it doesn't work

1068
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
It would work

1069
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,583
I understand what you're saying

1070
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,631
Let him off the hook

1071
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
It's an excuse

1072
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,007
Listeners who haven't read this.

1073
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,031
Particular

1074
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,383
I think it's just an indication that anyone who believes that he knows what he's talking about

1075
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,943
What he's talking about

1076
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,623
So in the next flight

1077
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,927
Alex talks about the idea

1078
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,975
Dhs.gov

1079
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:42,911
Right-wing extremist have capitalized on the election the first American American president Republican efforts on

1080
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:47,519
To recruit new members

1081
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,055
Mobilize against tyranny

1082
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,127
And rodner stubborn appealed and propaganda

1083
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:55,199
Attack plan

1084
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,111
Real quick it doesn't list Mainline ghungroo

1085
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,927
It doesn't list groups at all

1086
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:07,999
That's not in the document at 11 list an email

1087
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:14,143
Nothing else know it doesn't is it especially not after that paragraph

1088
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,935
Call

1089
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:25,151
About like these people this group of six people

1090
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,991
Machine gun

1091
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,319
That's a group of people

1092
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,087
Right

1093
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:33,855
It would come

1094
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,391
Concern me if Alex

1095
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,695
Consider that a Mainline ghungroo

1096
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,231
I mean it

1097
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
Did you save that

1098
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,119
Cuz he hasn't read the document

1099
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,935
It sort of leads you to believe that that's the point

1100
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
Is f****** shity

1101
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,287
I meant secondarily

1102
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,591
This is a

1103
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359
About

1104
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,383
Violent

1105
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,735
Not middle-of-the-road people who like guns that are conserved

1106
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,783
That is not what this is

1107
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,551
Twisted in adults

1108
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,831
The fact that I was

1109
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,623
Does responding to his like saying

1110
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,439
These violent groups are using

1111
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,511
The first African-American president existing

1112
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,303
As a source of radicalization

1113
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,095
And he says

1114
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,679
Supposed to recruit

1115
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,215
Alex

1116
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,775
You're supposed to mobilize is also what

1117
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,591
Weekend

1118
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,895
The little bit

1119
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,175
DHHS

1120
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,455
Doesn't actually

1121
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,759
Do the research into the Tea Party

1122
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,063
Movements

1123
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,903
These propagandists are using a president

1124
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,463
But when they say like these

1125
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,255
These propagandist are using a black

1126
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Recruit

1127
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,559
And do all that stuff

1128
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,607
You'd almost hope they were like

1129
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,167
Any propaganda serve paid by the cobra

1130
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,191
You know like

1131
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,727
The Koch brothers are there

1132
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,519
Reason that these propaganda

1133
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,543
Do all this

1134
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,335
Like if the DHS

1135
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:05,247
None of the law-enforcement groups are at all willing to

1136
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
2.2

1137
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,087
So much of this being the result of

1138
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,391
Those two f****** billionaire

1139
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:16,767
And other people too

1140
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:23,167
Conservative

1141
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,239
Foundation

1142
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,223
Becomes shorthand

1143
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,759
But the Koch brothers

1144
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:42,623
And I think that's kind of wrong but it's the primary funders of

1145
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,439
Sentence for sound

1146
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,743
And Americans for Prosperity

1147
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,791
Which were the biggest funders of

1148
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,095
Like

1149
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,119
Foster the

1150
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,191
The only super rich

1151
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,727
Right-wing people

1152
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
Find it

1153
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,079
With the amount of dark money that they filter through all of

1154
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,871
Different nonprofit

1155
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,151
Which again

1156
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
Wow

1157
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:06,943
We should

1158
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
Really

1159
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,271
I don't know laws

1160
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:11,807
Goodnight

1161
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,647
Mainline gun

1162
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,695
Advocating

1163
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,487
For the thing that this group is

1164
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
Report

1165
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,863
Because he hasn't read it or possibly

1166
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,631
Because

1167
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,167
Underlying

1168
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:43,039
Anticipation of restrictions in Van

1169
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:46,111
The primary concern

1170
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:54,815
The primary concern is the fact that you're buying that everybody by

1171
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:00,703
Their primary concern law enforcement guns and ammo

1172
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,751
I did not at all with reports

1173
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,519
It says

1174
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,311
Right-wing extremist

1175
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,847
Our stockpile

1176
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,615
Klingons

1177
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,407
That part is absolutely true

1178
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,455
It says it is 80 Prime

1179
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,759
Concern the primary concern

1180
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,295
And I.

1181
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,623
Like to live in a world wasn't the primary concern

1182
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
Really paranoid

1183
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,511
Violently anti-government

1184
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,815
They're stockpiling weapons

1185
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,095
Guys

1186
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,887
Look over there

1187
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,191
I think that's an important thing

1188
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,239
For people to know about

1189
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:37,823
Especially people who are trying to keep

1190
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,871
Everybody send them a cop

1191
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,687
Oh no

1192
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,015
Broken into alive ring

1193
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,039
Name check

1194
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,319
Seattle

1195
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,647
And then at no point does it say that

1196
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,183
No point does it say that

1197
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,463
Gone

1198
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,743
Bad or suspicious

1199
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,791
Send

1200
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,607
Are the paragraph where they're talking about

1201
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,887
Citizens owning legit

1202
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,727
That's very clearly not anti-gun

1203
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
Alex

1204
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
Wheatley lying

1205
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,383
They say he's racist

1206
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,199
They don't say that at all

1207
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
That is not

1208
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,551
Been there no but it does sound like Alex's

1209
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,575
Responding to the

1210
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,879
The fact that say they say that

1211
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,671
The black president

1212
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,951
Used as a propaganda tool for

1213
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,999
Recruit as them

1214
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,535
Specifically pointing out that

1215
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,071
He is afraid of a black

1216
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,095
And is using

1217
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,143
And so he has to be like

1218
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,935
Now they're calling me a racist

1219
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:38,751
They're definitely not calling me an opportunist

1220
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,031
Right right

1221
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,335
Goes back to my

1222
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:48,223
It goes back to my first like my primary conviction

1223
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,039
The only thing that is

1224
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:51,807
Response to it

1225
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,343
The only way in which this

1226
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,367
This report is about him

1227
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,903
Is how he is behaving

1228
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:01,023
He makes it about him

1229
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,071
If you if you saw this before in your life

1230
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
Move Along

1231
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:12,031
Hey guys there are people within our communities

1232
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,079
That are giving us a bad name

1233
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,103
Do we need to be on the

1234
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,383
Lookout Ford

1235
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,199
Or anything like that but

1236
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Hey

1237
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,015
We need to do better within our communities

1238
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,807
Whatever

1239
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,343
That would be a fitting response

1240
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
Defending

1241
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Deflecting

1242
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
Lion

1243
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,207
He's a lying about this report

1244
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,999
In order to suit his

1245
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,791
The government is your enemy

1246
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
Rhetoric

1247
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
That behavior

1248
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,119
Is suspicious

1249
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,911
It's pretty suspicious

1250
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,191
Yeah

1251
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:42,239
I would also probably

1252
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,567
Under the category of like

1253
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,319
Why are they talking about

1254
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:05,791
Whether it's a specific person or just spiritually

1255
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
Self-defense

1256
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
Specs of it

1257
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,495
I'm trying to make sure that

1258
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,287
He's never seen

1259
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,311
Is advocating violence

1260
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,079
Exactly

1261
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,431
We are still fresh off the Pittsburgh

1262
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:26,527
So that's true

1263
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,623
Depends on the show

1264
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,903
Though it is mansion

1265
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,439
Articles

1266
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,463
Forbes.com

1267
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,743
They talked about how

1268
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
This

1269
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,071
Incident is in this report

1270
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,423
People have tied Alex to this report are go

1271
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,215
This report is about Alex

1272
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:48,287
But the report doesn't mention Alex it doesn't mention

1273
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
That's something you have to

1274
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,871
To bring to the report

1275
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,663
You have to

1276
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,039
The thing about

1277
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,855
Doing this serialized over

1278
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,159
We do a 2009 Epic

1279
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,487
It's easy to forget

1280
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,023
The context within which he is

1281
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,303
Acting so petty

1282
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,327
Twozies

1283
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,655
Is reading that email at

1284
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,679
React

1285
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
Think so

1286
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,215
F******

1287
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,263
What

1288
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
You mean this report

1289
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,847
No they email

1290
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:29,247
The people saying that he's not

1291
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,319
About the Pittsburgh

1292
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:36,415
Singing people timer

1293
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:38,207
He's on that red alert

1294
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,255
I got to be making sure that

1295
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,535
People don't think that I'm

1296
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
Attached

1297
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:46,143
Whatever it is

1298
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,519
Yeah I know and controlling my own narrative

1299
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,799
I think I fixed it

1300
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
I think that's a

1301
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,359
Probably small

1302
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,175
The bulk of

1303
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,967
You knows that

1304
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,503
This is going to be a really affect

1305
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,271
Active

1306
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,551
Is the government

1307
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,575
And make it look like

1308
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,903
For you

1309
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
Which works out

1310
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,719
Reinforce

1311
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,255
Bolster the other narratives

1312
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,815
I think that's mostly what it is

1313
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,607
That on this next

1314
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,935
Historical presidential election

1315
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,775
Social programs and Firearms restrictions

1316
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:27,871
Bring the policies of Barack Obama is also they're saying

1317
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,687
The terrorist

1318
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,759
It goes on to say

1319
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,551
You see that

1320
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,831
Twisted

1321
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,159
That's indicative of I'm going to

1322
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,695
Use this however I can

1323
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,279
Which is not

1324
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,559
Most of the report

1325
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,143
What do you want

1326
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
Doesn't say

1327
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,191
Merit all right

1328
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,983
That clip

1329
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:54,751
Is like

1330
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
It does not matter what

1331
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:57,823
Headset

1332
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,383
No.

1333
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,431
It doesn't matter

1334
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:05,503
It doesn't matter mentioned Ron Paul

1335
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,087
As being like we found a guy who said Ron

1336
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:09,855
Paul's name

1337
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:11,903
He would have

1338
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,559
We don't want to sell knives and even like to see this is the first step in them,

1339
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,607
Right

1340
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,655
They think that it's wrong

1341
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:27,519
Outlaw knives tomorrow it's gone

1342
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,287
Yeah

1343
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,823
It doesn't matter what

1344
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,151
Just going to use it as a prop

1345
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:42,623
This DHS report was written by a guy named Darrell Johnson previously spent 15 years studying domestic terrorism

1346
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,439
He compiled data create a new databases

1347
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,719
The track correlation

1348
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:50,303
Automatic Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups

1349
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,607
4 years Hammer drop,

1350
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:58,495
2000's backlash

1351
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:01,055
The DHHS cave and ended up refudiate in the

1352
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:01,823
Report

1353
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:06,687
In April 2010 DHHS dissolve Johnson answered the security

1354
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,711
Consultancy business

1355
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,551
Unsurprisingly as the threat of right-wing extremism is grown

1356
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,831
From 2012 onwards

1357
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:16,927
Constantly been interviewed by places like

1358
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:17,951
The Washington Post

1359
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:21,535
About how we tried to warn people listen

1360
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:23,839
They're too focused on Islamic terrorism

1361
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,375
And two willing to bow down

1362
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,167
Coordinated right-wing media pressure

1363
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,191
To do their job

1364
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:34,591
Not much else is there to say about this other than the exact Behavior demonstrated by Alex in this episode

1365
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,127
Is directly traceable

1366
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,663
The weakening the government's ability

1367
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,199
To deal with violent extremist

1368
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,479
Because his feelings

1369
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,247
He's got hurt

1370
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,063
That is all of its manifest

1371
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,623
If you read interviews with Daryl Johnson

1372
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,671
Inside a number

1373
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:53,279
He talks about how like back then there were so many more people studying

1374
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,047
Tracking

1375
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
Islamic terrorism

1376
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,631
That was working on

1377
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,911
The non-islamic the message

1378
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,007
Snowman after if

1379
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
Immigration

1380
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,567
You know of this report that he

1381
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,383
He put out the backlash that came from it

1382
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,407
You get to April

1383
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
2010

1384
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,247
And now there's just one guy

1385
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,271
Who's working

1386
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,063
For the DHS on that

1387
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,855
Tire world

1388
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,415
Of the non-islamic

1389
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:24,767
Rite-Way interview it's gone up a little bit but I'll be surprised

1390
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,535
If it has

1391
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:29,631
Considering we've had an increase in domestic

1392
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,167
Terrorist

1393
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,959
Domestic terrorism and hate crimes

1394
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,727
And all that s***

1395
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,799
16

1396
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,127
Recently increase the air they increase the size of it

1397
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,175
Yeah maybe they did

1398
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:48,575
But the people who run the tahs Earth

1399
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:52,415
All of these tools and

1400
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,231
You had come up with within the DHHS

1401
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
Tracking

1402
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,791
Understanding the service of a solvent

1403
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,863
Yeah we're all

1404
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,447
His career

1405
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,007
Just like the printer in office space

1406
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,567
Completely ineffective now

1407
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
Is it

1408
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,175
One of them was

1409
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,711
12

1410
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,783
Particular

1411
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:21,855
Shooting spree

1412
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,879
Lone Wolf

1413
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
Shooter

1414
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,487
You know that the stuff

1415
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,791
Is important

1416
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
Pay attention

1417
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,863
But even if nothing

1418
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,399
I don't think we could have done it

1419
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,423
Anything about this guy

1420
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
Yeah

1421
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,287
When I hear something like that from someone who studies

1422
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,079
I just hear

1423
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,359
Expert

1424
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:48,223
You know I hear a sincere voice right because someone who's trying to run a con

1425
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,271
Or someone who has bad faith

1426
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,551
Position

1427
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:55,647
If they're being interviewed after the fact about how right they were

1428
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,207
And we're shut down because they were right

1429
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,839
They would lionize everything they wouldn't have even in perfect

1430
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,119
Situation if nothing happened

1431
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,167
This guy probably would have slipped through

1432
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,215
Crack because there's no way to track

1433
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,751
Attached to any

1434
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:15,871
Or anything like that that's humility that's humble

1435
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:19,455
If it were Alex in that situation

1436
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,271
Giving an interview about how

1437
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,039
He would have said

1438
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:27,647
If implemented with this guy would never have happened

1439
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,975
What would matter if that was anywhere near true

1440
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,279
But just by

1441
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:38,655
That's not just Alex oh that's so many

1442
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,679
Also people

1443
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,983
Experts on

1444
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,895
Over-promise in a hypothetical path

1445
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,455
You know you like you have like if this had happened

1446
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,015
Some sort of counter-factual

1447
01:12:54,271 --> 01:13:00,415
Tractor

1448
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,767
Resist that impulse

1449
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,559
Because he knows what he's talkin

1450
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,327
About

1451
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,375
Johnson

1452
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
The real sad

1453
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,239
Picture of it is real sad

1454
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,591
To think about how much that really did

1455
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
End up causing

1456
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,175
Crippling of tracking

1457
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
Right wing

1458
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,991
Extreme nationalist

1459
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
Supremacist

1460
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,551
Neo-nazis and that's everything

1461
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,343
And the fact that Alex Jones

1462
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,367
Was

1463
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,415
A part of the backlash

1464
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,207
That led to that

1465
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:39,583
What are you doing this facilitating all of this right-wing terrorism

1466
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,607
That we've seen

1467
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,887
In in the last

1468
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,423
Yeah it's really it

1469
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:46,751
It's really weird it's hard to say if there's intention behind it but

1470
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,031
I don't really care

1471
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,847
I think something that is kind of fascinating about that

1472
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,127
Is that Obama

1473
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,151
Who was

1474
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,479
At a disadvantage

1475
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,527
While trying to

1476
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,575
While trying to kind of

1477
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,599
Tackle Vista

1478
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:05,695
Would appear so much worse than

1479
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,743
Saying we need to follow up on me

1480
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:14,399
Because because you're more like

1481
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:22,079
More at a disadvantage in trying to tackle terrorism

1482
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,359
Because he's black

1483
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:27,455
In the court of public opinion

1484
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,759
Absolutely

1485
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:35,903
But here in the sex with Alex gets back to talk about Glenn Beck

1486
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,439
Because a collar brought about

1487
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,791
The powers-that-be

1488
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,327
Glenn Beck

1489
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,863
Trey's the Patriots

1490
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,399
For thirty pieces of silver

1491
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,919
Because everytime I remind me to something I remember

1492
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,759
Of the truth

1493
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,207
Victims family

1494
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:12,767
He hates the Patriot movement he hates malicious

1495
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,047
He hates gun owners

1496
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:21,983
We love you we love you Vic

1497
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,031
Co-op

1498
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,823
So we can destroy

1499
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,103
Absolutely

1500
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:27,871
Cargo head

1501
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,407
Absolutely

1502
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:31,967
Came up

1503
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,319
That literally happened

1504
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:40,927
That literally happened I was hoping update on the San Antonio

1505
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:45,023
I was really hoping

1506
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,583
5 times in a row

1507
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:51,935
Hey just wanted to give you another update the Tea Party is about an hour in

1508
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:54,239
Still in bed over here yet

1509
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:01,151
Where was this at

1510
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,943
Back in a bit

1511
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,015
Here is Alex

1512
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,319
Just would have reinforcing my position that I think

1513
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
Just realize that

1514
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
We could exploit

1515
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:10,879
Tea Party

1516
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,439
He realizes

1517
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,231
That it's a

1518
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:19,327
Perfect way for him to get his documentary The Obama Deception out into the world

1519
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,823
But not just there

1520
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:33,663
Obama Deception

1521
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:40,319
This film is about the bankers Financial

1522
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,903
And this film

1523
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:49,279
Needs to be seen by everyone

1524
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,327
That supports the radio show

1525
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:54,655
Really is effective as Aaron on Access TV

1526
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,007
Make copies of it giving it to people

1527
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,287
Filmmaker

1528
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,847
Future film

1529
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,615
Filmmaker

1530
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,479
You see their MBA

1531
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,527
Just Junk

1532
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,807
It is

1533
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,879
You can get

1534
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,159
And go out and give

1535
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,183
The people at the party

1536
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:24,095
Spare the dumb people they're literally the ones that we are recruiting

1537
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:29,983
Using anti-propaganda

1538
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,263
Right

1539
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,567
And they'll be all congregated in

1540
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:34,847
In person

1541
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:39,967
In physical reality go and give them copies and DVDs

1542
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:40,991
Wake up

1543
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:44,575
So I thought the VHS

1544
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,343
Report was going to be

1545
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,879
In terms of like

1546
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,159
Alex

1547
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:48,927
Specific

1548
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,463
His narrative

1549
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,999
But I call or calls

1550
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,303
Sort of

1551
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,583
Not aggressive

1552
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:59,935
But he's just doesn't know what Alex's narrative about the mass Graves

1553
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,703
Bizarre

1554
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,263
Mass graves are piece of Alex's narratives

1555
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,799
About

1556
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:12,223
There's he's like there's all these last two coffins.

1557
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,367
You go in Bullet to the Head

1558
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,415
I am so just call her ask

1559
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:22,207
Where's that mass grave stuff

1560
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,487
Coming from

1561
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,023
More like

1562
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,583
Hissed off

1563
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,631
Staff to answer this question

1564
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,423
How many does a really bad job

1565
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:36,543
Man I presented you with mainstream news about the mass Graves incinerator

1566
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,359
Did you hear me

1567
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,687
Unfortunately I did not

1568
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,247
Well we written articles about it and post

1569
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,551
Let me just show you again

1570
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,879
I just had

1571
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,951
Over and over and over and over

1572
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,975
My job

1573
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:58,559
Bring it up again

1574
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,983
Imma show it to you again

1575
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,311
Masquerade folder

1576
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:13,151
Always listen

1577
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:16,223
Going to fold is it Manila

1578
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,807
Prepares for bioterrorism February 8th 2003

1579
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,599
The state of Colorado

1580
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:28,255
Extreme circumstances

1581
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,815
For the use the event bioterrorism attack

1582
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,631
When it goes into the governor's managers

1583
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,679
The mass grave site

1584
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,727
Generators

1585
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,543
And how they're getting ready for that

1586
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:43,359
Point of order

1587
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:44,895
It doesn't go in

1588
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:47,455
Governor's orders all that stuff is Alex make

1589
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,527
Really lame

1590
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,599
April 2009

1591
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,695
But the government is planning a mass casualty

1592
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:01,791
Is it there was an article in the Rocky Mountain X from 6 years prior

1593
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,327
Is that 27

1594
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:09,215
Then this article better literally about the government agent a mass casualty event

1595
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,751
Put that these graves are for

1596
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:17,408
You think that's what this article is about very small folder

1597
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:21,504
The story about it all

1598
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,320
This one is really hard to find the actual article

1599
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:27,392
It's reference repeatedly and Infowars articles

1600
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,952
Always citing the same quote that I was just

1601
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,768
That's all

1602
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:38,144
I found that I took that link and the quote

1603
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,168
Search for it

1604
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,704
Wet through bunch of nonsense

1605
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
Website

1606
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:45,056
And ultimately I traced down in Arizona with a Blog

1607
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:48,640
Who actually links to the real article that I can take that

1608
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,176
Internet archives and find the article

1609
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:54,272
If you do read this article about you

1610
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,296
But make it clear

1611
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,320
Why Alex doesn't

1612
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,368
To the whole article or what anybody

1613
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,208
The first thing is that this has nothing to do with the federal government

1614
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:05,536
It's all about the governor of Colorado at the series of eight

1615
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,864
Executive orders regarding emergency prepared

1616
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,448
Alex certainly isn't against the idea of having a planet

1617
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,728
In case things go bad I mean

1618
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,264
Any cell survival food

1619
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,824
His problem is that he thinks the federal government in

1620
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,848
FEMA are evil

1621
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,896
I fixed it states rights are Paramount

1622
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,944
Nothing in the story should have said that's

1623
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,736
Sensibility FEMA isn't involved

1624
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,272
It's all about the state

1625
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,040
Government

1626
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,576
What are the orders

1627
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:33,952
Specifically talks about State healthcare workers being allowed to come and do your drugs from Pharmacy

1628
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,488
In the case of an emergency

1629
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,536
Lays out the rationale that

1630
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,352
The federal government

1631
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,376
Provide those drugs

1632
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,912
Button emergency

1633
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,472
People on the ground can't wait for any possible delay

1634
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,008
These pharmacies be conference

1635
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,800
Of course

1636
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:53,408
Three of the remaining seven orders had to do with suspending licensing

1637
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,480
Emergency workers could prescribe medications in

1638
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,248
In a crisis

1639
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,808
Something that would be allowed in Normal

1640
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:05,440
Alex hates regulations and chiropractor friend doctor should be able to prescribe meds

1641
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,744
So I don't see what his problem

1642
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,840
What are the remaining four orders makes it so an emergency

1643
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,120
Emergency rooms

1644
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,656
To be able to turn away patients

1645
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,936
Something that is a

1646
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,728
Lauren Colorado under normal conditions

1647
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,800
The reasoning is that in a biological attack

1648
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,824
Or something like that

1649
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,360
Emergency medical station

1650
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,128
Will be set up

1651
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:28,480
Patient will be processed and appropriate hospital to avoid making the situation

1652
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,808
Again I feel like Alex as a Libertarian

1653
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:38,208
Should be totally cool with the idea of hospitals being able to turn people away since they shouldn't be forced into helping anybody

1654
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,024
That is libertarian principles

1655
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,560
I don't know what his problem is

1656
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:47,936
What are the last three orders makes it so mental health patients could be kicked out of their beds

1657
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,752
In hospitals to make room for biochemical attack

1658
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,568
This TV

1659
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:55,104
I kind of understand the reason

1660
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:58,432
I would hope they wouldn't just throw mental health patients into the street

1661
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,200
But who knows

1662
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:01,504
It doesn't specify what the process would be

1663
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,040
Anything like that

1664
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:06,624
Drawn carts

1665
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,648
Is that they would just

1666
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,464
I mean in a legitimate emergency

1667
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,232
Someone

1668
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
Who

1669
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,536
Deserves care

1670
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,328
For mental health condition

1671
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,864
I understand why you would

1672
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,144
Would you prioritize that

1673
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,704
People who possibly are suffering from

1674
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:22,496
Biological

1675
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:27,360
I'll tell you what reason to get him out of there because everybody else in the hospital is Ben

1676
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:31,712
Biological that's another reason

1677
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,248
That's a really good angle on it

1678
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:39,648
The last two of the orders are about easing by Burial and funeral

1679
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,672
Regulation

1680
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,720
To accommodate possibility that there were

1681
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,744
Would be tons of body

1682
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:48,096
The short time and some of the red tape could get in the way

1683
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,120
Things like

1684
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:51,168
The family of prison

1685
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,472
By law they have to

1686
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,496
Sign off

1687
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,776
On how they're buried

1688
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,592
Stuff like that

1689
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:01,152
Be a time that you don't have

1690
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,176
Yeah in the virgin

1691
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:05,760
The difficulty of figuring out the

1692
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:08,320
Your family you might end up spreading

1693
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,648
Something

1694
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,928
So often it's like

1695
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:17,280
Look unfortunately we're going to have to burn these bodies

1696
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,680
Germs are still there

1697
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:28,288
It's horrible to think about but the situation that they're talking about is like

1698
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:29,824
Real

1699
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,592
F****** Siri

1700
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,432
You put your brain into like

1701
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:39,296
Ebola outbreak Airborne Ebola outbreak in America

1702
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,600
And if it really sucks.

1703
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:46,464
Control of the burial process

1704
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,488
But

1705
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,024
It's an existential crisis

1706
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,608
It's very much like look I get in the

1707
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,144
During the Black Plague

1708
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:54,912
Gets like

1709
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,728
We still need

1710
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:04,128
To give them a religious burial in your like now you got a burn that chick cuz everybody you know is going to die that's exactly the point is going to

1711
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:07,456
Get to is it like weed

1712
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:10,016
Like a dead body that could be infected

1713
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,808
Public Health crisis

1714
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,088
We learned that

1715
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:20,256
A few years back

1716
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:23,072
Thousand years ago whenever people were

1717
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:26,912
Catapult in order to spread

1718
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,448
Exactly

1719
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
And so

1720
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,264
It sucks

1721
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,544
But even here's a quote

1722
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:38,944
I don't want to come across as saying the state's going to make this decision to do Mass cremations in ruin the lives of families

1723
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:45,088
Marquette prison program coordinator for the state

1724
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:45,856
Department set

1725
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,136
But it

1726
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,976
Executive order just gives up maximum Flex

1727
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:51,744
Stability

1728
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,328
So he's even saying like I I don't like this

1729
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,632
I really

1730
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,400
Really

1731
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,168
Really hope

1732
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,728
That we even in a biological crisis

1733
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,776
We don't have to do it

1734
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:06,080
Right

1735
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:07,616
Like

1736
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:10,432
This is only if it gets

1737
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,456
The most worth

1738
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,064
These executive orders have never been

1739
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:21,952
And if you look on colorado.gov you can find the list of Governor Bill Owens executive orders

1740
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,256
It doesn't even look like he's wherever sign

1741
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,304
I don't know for sure

1742
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:31,424
I don't know for sure but from what I can tell this was a series of executive orders that were written up his draft

1743
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,984
And Governor Owens didn't signs

1744
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:38,336
I could be wrong but I can't find any evidence that they were anything more than these draft

1745
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,408
And the article Alex is referencing even says quote

1746
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:46,528
Executive orders yet and there's a good chance they'll never be

1747
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,880
This is not even just

1748
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,928
Like we've signed this

1749
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,976
Into

1750
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,768
Route 8 in Toulon now

1751
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
This is

1752
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,072
Should

1753
01:26:59,328 --> 01:26:59,840
This happen

1754
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:00,864
We will sign

1755
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:06,496
We have these executive orders ready Eggman acts much like Alex

1756
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:11,104
Another week in order to draft

1757
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:15,712
Something I think it's possible or it could be just that they

1758
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:16,992
I don't know

1759
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:20,320
I don't know exactly what happened

1760
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,112
You're two of

1761
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:22,880
Billowing

1762
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:26,464
Governorship looked at all of the executive orders

1763
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,488
Most of them

1764
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:35,168
Here's the new guy who's the Secretary of about looks

1765
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,520
I didn't find anything

1766
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:45,920
There was the weird one where you signed into

1767
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,456
Borders was that

1768
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,736
Dubstep was the new Nash

1769
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:52,576
National weird 1004

1770
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:57,440
So crazy little broad for Colorado to prep these executive orders

1771
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,816
The things that they're talking

1772
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,120
Extreme aversion

1773
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,400
But you also need to

1774
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,680
To keep in mind

1775
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:10,496
Anthrax

1776
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:14,336
Android app for war in Iraq

1777
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:18,176
I don't think it's for a person who's responsible for the safety

1778
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,968
Tires

1779
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:23,296
To consider what the best way to address a possible emergency would be

1780
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,064
Ahead of

1781
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,112
And that's really all this is

1782
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,392
Especially since their talk

1783
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,416
Think about a

1784
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,952
Which would

1785
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,488
Of course be more associate

1786
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:36,352
Going to put troops on the ground that's not going to happen

1787
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,120
But

1788
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:43,520
They can slip a terrorist in who's going to release a biological weapon we have that we have the

1789
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:46,336
Gift of hindsight, we can laugh about like

1790
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:50,432
Isn't it isn't it crazy that sort of dirty bomb is coming

1791
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,200
But

1792
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:57,600
Whether everybody did or not I'm sure there were some people some

1793
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,136
Commentators who like

1794
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:03,744
You guys are over exaggerate your dad you're being hysterical

1795
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:08,096
But I don't correct for someone who

1796
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,376
Possibility for

1797
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:12,448
An entire States population governor.

1798
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,264
Ears on them

1799
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,544
Play many ways to help

1800
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,568
Protect the safety

1801
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:22,432
Of people from things that people shouldn't have to worry about

1802
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,200
So

1803
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,736
I get

1804
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,064
Exaggerating

1805
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,600
Little propaganda

1806
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:34,464
Kind of crack

1807
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,000
These sorts of things are

1808
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,048
This idea of preparation

1809
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:43,424
YouTube orders this Rocky Mountain Times article that Alex is referencing

1810
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,776
I don't I don't see anything wrong with it I only see how it's like

1811
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,056
Yep that's it

1812
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,080
Yep

1813
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,872
No disagreements here

1814
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,432
So you then goes on to talk about another piece

1815
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,224
Lisa Babbitt empty house about Mass Graves

1816
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,760
It's not good either

1817
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:06,720
Could you call the phone number

1818
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:13,888
Article written by Aaron Dykes plan for Mass Graves confirm government surveying Cemetery Readiness for flu outbreak

1819
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,704
Country

1820
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,752
Tens of thousands per Cemetery

1821
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:22,336
Phone number to call the state

1822
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,408
Boring

1823
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:32,576
No one video no one will discuss

1824
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,368
No one will get into it

1825
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,160
They won't because it's b*******

1826
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,952
I mean this is a real doctor

1827
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,888
Miac documents real DHHS documents

1828
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,424
But I found this

1829
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,240
PDF on Infowars

1830
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,568
Like this document about the the New York Cemetery

1831
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:58,432
If you go through it it's just a bunch of question it's a 5-page questionnaire

1832
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,224
It sent out to cemetery

1833
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,504
Better just trying to

1834
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,272
2 gauge

1835
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,320
Whether or not they could accommodate

1836
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:06,112
Of

1837
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,416
Disaster which again

1838
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,952
From a public health

1839
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,488
Makes total sense

1840
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,536
If you need that

1841
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:17,376
It is good to know ahead of time where you can and can't go

1842
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,144
And

1843
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,704
It's respectful to them as businesses

1844
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,496
Like one of their questions

1845
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:24,032
Infection

1846
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,312
Anno doesn't mean something

1847
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,592
It's actually section

1848
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,408
Is the cemetery able to sustain itself

1849
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:32,992
In parentheses Cashflow it do to a mass fatality event

1850
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:38,880
Interment space and burial fees are delayed or a government reimburse

1851
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,440
So this is even asking

1852
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,464
If you had to like

1853
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,232
If we needed to

1854
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,024
To commandeer your Cemetery

1855
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,072
Could you work for free and then we'll pay

1856
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:49,120
Or would this be

1857
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:56,032
Cuz if this is going to bankrupt you if we're not going exactly and it has

1858
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:57,824
Fremont

1859
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,128
6 months 12 months

1860
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,152
24 months

1861
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,944
2 is even respectful of

1862
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,712
The business

1863
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,296
Be like

1864
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:10,368
You know I do you have

1865
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:11,904
Capabilities

1866
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:12,928
You have Wi-Fi

1867
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,208
5

1868
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,744
Biscuits

1869
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,512
To the

1870
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:18,304
Propagandist bread-and-butter

1871
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,328
Which is that if you

1872
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,608
Prepare for an emergency

1873
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,400
The propaganda says you're going to

1874
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,168
Creative

1875
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,960
And if the emergent

1876
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,800
Why didn't you

1877
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,568
You should have fuc

1878
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,336
Getting prepared for

1879
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,616
They have

1880
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,640
Are you coming and going

1881
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,176
Right cuz they're cheap

1882
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,456
Prices of cheap

1883
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:43,392
I see I can read this document and I can't see nothing wrong with it I see exactly why it exist

1884
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,696
Exactly

1885
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,744
Bread Butter Alex is making out

1886
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,280
I just think like

1887
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,072
It's not

1888
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,400
It's not reading comprehension

1889
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,448
Like I know he can't read

1890
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,984
And stuff like that but

1891
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,544
It leads me to believe that because

1892
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,568
So lazy

1893
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,104
And such a just a reaction

1894
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:03,872
Kind of guy

1895
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,688
I think the real

1896
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,712
Like

1897
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,784
Insidious evil at Infowars

1898
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,088
Is those people who write the articles

1899
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,136
Because Alex isn't

1900
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:18,720
Read the Rocky Mountain Times article

1901
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,256
He didn't read

1902
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:22,560
The DHS report

1903
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,352
But you didn't read these things

1904
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:27,424
He read the Infowars articles about them

1905
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,216
I haven't responded to it

1906
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:35,872
Suits the people like Curt Nimmo who have read the article and then the X report or whatever

1907
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:40,224
Alex

1908
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,272
Nefarious

1909
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,040
Evil behind

1910
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,856
Alex is still f****** evil as s***

1911
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,648
You stupid do you think

1912
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:49,184
In the writers room

1913
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,888
Able to be the news desk

1914
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:00,448
You know where all of this stuff happened

1915
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,728
I mean

1916
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:03,776
Do the writers for

1917
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:04,544
For Ziva

1918
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,312
Coming to

1919
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,736
Tour of their eyes

1920
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:16,832
Okay I've seen the layout of so he's not in the editorial picture

1921
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,112
Absolutely

1922
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:24,000
Yeah hangover or start one

1923
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,048
So the

1924
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,584
This probably goes

1925
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,400
Was is not Alex's in the editorial

1926
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,936
Talking about here this

1927
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:34,496
We want to cover Alex's Talent

1928
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,080
There's a there's an editorial room where they're like

1929
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:44,480
Hear the narrative we've got that it's less like a news desk and more like of the writers room in SNL

1930
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:47,552
Turn on Skype

1931
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,600
UK

1932
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,952
Yeah

1933
01:34:54,464 --> 01:35:00,608
So Alex is actively involved

1934
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,912
Please call Paul Joseph

1935
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:07,264
I need you to write an article that sums up all of this

1936
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,080
True but that was because he wants

1937
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:13,152
Have access to what the narrative should be

1938
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:16,224
I think there's a decent chance it's because he doesn't know what it should be

1939
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:17,504
She needs

1940
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,808
The directions are more like Paul Joseph Watson

1941
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,088
Who's smart enough

1942
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,368
Figure out okay

1943
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,672
This is the way we package it

1944
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,952
This is the way you text

1945
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,232
The truth of this

1946
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,256
And turn it into the

1947
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:29,536
You can sell

1948
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,816
So you're dumb audien

1949
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:35,680
I think that's probably what's going on

1950
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:39,008
This is such like somebody going on the road and they're like

1951
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:42,080
I brought I had an hour of material for 10 years

1952
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,104
Can't write anymore

1953
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:46,688
X Factor

1954
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:52,320
Early days of his Shoney's has burned out on that

1955
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:56,672
Hey I need a new joke

1956
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:59,232
I understand really hard

1957
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:05,376
Hours to go through this.

1958
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,936
For five years from now when we hired

1959
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:12,032
Script

1960
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,848
So I seen a bunch of stuff here

1961
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,640
DHS document is being used

1962
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:19,200
Completely flagrantly irresponsibly

1963
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:24,576
Just a mess just a mess what he's doing with this document

1964
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:26,368
He's turning it into the

1965
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,184
Which

1966
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,720
Is it Services brand

1967
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:31,488
Fairies

1968
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,024
So f****** wrong

1969
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:35,328
And then you see this Mass grave stuff

1970
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,096
Come up

1971
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,912
You know he's wrong about all this stuff too

1972
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:41,984
It's interesting that he decides to

1973
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,824
I wish everyday this one real

1974
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:50,176
I wish everyday they weren't shipping birds with all the world shooting people are pleasantly dying

1975
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:56,320
Mental block or something from

1976
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,624
They only cover the weird made-up crap

1977
01:36:59,136 --> 01:36:59,648
It's

1978
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,184
It's a weird

1979
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,744
Saying that Alex is the luckiest man in the world

1980
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,792
He wishes that none of this is real

1981
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,072
And I'm here to say

1982
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,864
None of this is real

1983
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,656
You have gotten your wish Alex

1984
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,496
Anyway

1985
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:17,824
I think this is interesting cuz of these like

1986
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:20,384
You know New pieces that we can bring

1987
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:22,688
And then it's the same time because I think

1988
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:25,760
Does represent mean

1989
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,784
Tea party stuff

1990
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,832
Hiperdex

1991
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:30,112
Strongly

1992
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,416
Just this trend continuing

1993
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:37,536
I think there'll be varying levels of intensity that Alex feels like

1994
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,304
His movement

1995
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,912
Is operating position

1996
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,192
That's going to be where he goes

1997
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,984
Which

1998
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:50,848
We had a we had a goal

1999
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,944
Mission accomplished Somali pirates

2000
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:57,504
Wonder if you can talk about that

2001
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:00,320
Next episode

2002
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,088
Consonant

2003
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,904
A decade ago to now

2004
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,440
Is the thing that I

2005
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,720
I hate most about

2006
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:11,072
It's the thing that I hate most about so many of these guys but

2007
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:11,840
Alex's bike

2008
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:14,144
I said number one guy I know

2009
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,424
Who

2010
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,472
Will directly assert

2011
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:18,752
The exact

2012
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:19,776
Opposite

2013
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:25,408
Like so many people

2014
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:30,528
So many people in the right-wing propaganda

2015
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,552
Trying

2016
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:36,160
Twisted they try and spin it through all of this stuff

2017
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:38,720
Take reality and make it mean something else

2018
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:41,024
And Alex just says directly

2019
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:46,912
The opposite of what you say is true 104 180°

2020
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:49,984
Perfectly is what is true it still

2021
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,032
Aggressive

2022
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,568
I just want it like

2023
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:57,408
So much more comfortable with 170

2024
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,688
Degrees of spin

2025
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:01,760
Address

2026
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:09,952
With no.

2027
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,024
He's trying to perpetuate

2028
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:20,448
I feel like a woman from old

2029
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,800
So we're done

2030
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:27,104
Here at this episode but

2031
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:30,688
Guy who wrote DHS report

2032
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,224
Yeah he's never killed

2033
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:36,832
Anybody he just tried to warn people about dudes who were going to be killing people in the news

2034
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:37,600
Your future

2035
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,136
Yep

2036
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:44,256
Actually was part of shutting down

2037
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,536
He's warning

2038
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:47,072
About people are going to kill people

2039
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,376
We probably killed somebody

2040
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:52,704
I thought John here we are

2041
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,776
Holding

2042
01:39:57,824 --> 01:40:01,408
Alexandra Thurston color
