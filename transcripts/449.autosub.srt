Yes yes

10
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
Right at the gate

11
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176

12
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,832
Okay I just I got a little overexcited did you start doing hot yoga

13
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
Just exercised

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,744
Competitive

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
I don't know what

16
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
It's not okay

17
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
Saturday's that's with knights

18
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:45,472
I'm used to you yelling all the time even somehow that was

19
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Too much

20
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
The podcast

21
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
What's up

22
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
Can I ask a question

23
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,672
Start I'm going to go

24
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,000
I finally bit the bullet and I was done with all the side quest

25
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
Yelling

26
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,120
Horizon zero Dawn

27
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
Wild DLC

28
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
Play the main storyline in in

00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Fantastic

00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,640
Fandango

31
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,760
I don't think it's going to be out until next year probably this evening

32
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,088
Because I don't want to buy a PlayStation 5

33
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
I don't know

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,000
I always get really mad whenever there's new systems out cuz like this is how they scam you

35
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,400
Allure these games that you want to play you have by the system in order to play them and then they're obsolete in the news

36
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
I turn into a cranky old man

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,824
Excited about the new system no

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
Betta with a better format if you had a Time

39
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:01,504
Stamp on it is way better

40
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
Congratulations

41
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,624
Are you an alien

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,768
Into the year of the

43
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,376
We are now 152 South years into the year of

44
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,704
Deserves a little bit of a celebration

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,616
Crazy

46
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Yeah that's

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688
That's a lot of stuff.

48
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,576
Good-natured ribbing about not liking Seltzer's themselves

49
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:41,952
Shelter podcast

50
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
To bring some sort of normalcy

51
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
You can still enjoy and I enjoy bubbly water

52
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
Everything I was I wanted to bring

53
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
Sharp Focus 250

54
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Shelters in

55
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,456
If you look at the top five Seltzer's that we have

56
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
There are two that are from Mars Brewery

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,624
Even existed

58
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,696
Shelters for starting

59
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,768
Score stop for fifth

60
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:21,631
Now between Lacroix and hibiscus

61
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
Hibiscus

62
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,031
Either of those if it wasn't

63
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Naturally

64
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
Black cherry coffee

65
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
Isn't it a number 2 on the list

66
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
Of the top five

67
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Absolute

68
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Pedal

69
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,999
The Elderberry flower

70
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
Stood at the store

71
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Some hippie-dippie

72
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,703
Little bug water with flowers on it

73
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,799
It's a one of these it's really nice as being able to

74
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
To force myself into position for him

75
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Trying a bunch

76
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
Lo and behold all of the things that I

77
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
I had

78
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Before

79
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,295
Are found wanting compared to these new things that I'm trying to

80
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,879
Who played CeraVe microcosm with life

81
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Yeah you do a little bit of an exercise something

82
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
It seems really stupid like I'm going to drink 500 South

83
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
Do you find

84
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
Really good one

85
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
But you never would have tried

86
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,727
Maybe you can incorporate into your life to make your life better moving forward

87
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
When we get to

88
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
U300

89
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,687
Will you be so exhausted with seltzer

90
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,271
Nothing is going to break into the top five

91
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
So

92
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
Because there's

93
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,623
Untappd stuff

94
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
I might be able to find

95
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
Craps

96
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:57,631
Nature's next one to hundred

97
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
Should I

98
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Phenomenal

99
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,359
Standard ass lemon lime grapefruit

100
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
And

101
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,455
It does lead to a little burn out until the

102
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
Like well maybe that would have been a 60%

103
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
Yeah yeah

104
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,207
Is grapefruit but that's how it goes

105
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Except

106
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
I think as we go along with

107
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
Even greener pastures

108
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,679
Wondering if we're going to get a perfect score

109
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,007
Blue whale

110
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
It's possible

111
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,151
I've been very conservative with my scoring

112
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,967
If I were to guess based on how this is gone so far

113
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
It'll be something floral and something

114
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,111
T related

115
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,183
Those are clearly the best

116
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
Sure we get off of here this

117
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
Fort Morgan

118
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,655
Will you consider revising a score

119
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Later on

120
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
General Sam

121
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
No

122
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Okay

123
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
I don't think I should

124
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
I think I think that would be

125
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,431
Dirty pool

126
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,759
That we get to the end of the highest scores in 86

127
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
Does that mean everybody

128
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
It's 14 more points attitude

129
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,671
I think I think

130
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,559
350 or now 64

131
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,959
If it ends up in a situation where we get to 500 Mi scores 93

132
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
Or something like that

133
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
Did there is the the platonic ideal

134
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:49,759
100 round

135
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,367
That's okay

136
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
In itself exactly

137
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
Year of the seller is very philosophical at this point

138
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Alright

Oppressive

184

From policy wonk.

186

00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
This will be my life

195
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
It for now

196
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
It was going to become another job

197
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,631
You know like I'm just existing I also have a job

198
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
Do end up feeling like

199
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
Chores

200
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,455
Could you have to wait a day in real time to farm

201
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
It's a little exhausting

202
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
Intensely difficult

203
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,535
Focus on doing this year

204
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,607
Because of Alex it's his fault

205
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,423
Been good there's still some interesting things

206
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,983
Definitely requiring

207
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
Track of butt

208
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
So many

209
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
Guests on these shows

210
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Is just like

211
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
I don't care about any of these people I don't

212
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
Care

213
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
I couldn't give a

214
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,367
Write a large portion of of the time

215
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
It's sometimes

216
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
Listening

217
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
Because there's interesting things regularly or he's being entertaining and yelling like a dumb dumb

218
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,263
This is the office hours of listening to him

219
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Caribou

220
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
Dog shots

221
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
However

222
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
We start here on the 23rd

223
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
We start with

224
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
Oz on this episode

225
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
That is very bad

226
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
The rollout

227
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
Is covid-19

228
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
It is just excuse

229
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
Hysteria and

230
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,327
Why we're making a big announcement later

231
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
In a second hour today

232
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
I'm a nationwide movement

233
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Can't breathe

234
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:35,615
It'll be all the video

235
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
I will be out at the

236
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Texas

237
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
Capital this Sunday

238
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
By noon

239
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
Protest the governor's

240
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Capitulation

241
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
2

242
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
Gavin Newsom in the UN

243
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,303
Yes I heard that and I really set me off on a bed

244
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,351
Feeling like

245
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
God

246
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,447
I don't even want to do this anymore like

247
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,287
I just see the machinations of it I see the what

248
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
He's doing

249
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,919
You trying to trick people into getting mad at him

250
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
Illicitly distasteful abrasive

251
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
In order to be like

252
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,111
I'll pay attention

253
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,463
Insane it just feels so lame

254
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
It's just eat

255
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,071
Bad Pro incredibly

256
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
It's on

257
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
The same yeah it's just shity trolling but on a genocide scale like what he's describing what is essentially biological

258
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
At this point

259
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,943
I'm going to go out and spread this disease

260
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
Possibly can

261
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,759
As a form of troll I mean

262
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,599
It's hard to say how many people

263
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
How much

264
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,439
Denial

265
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,815
First and most important Point here is that words of George

266
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,679
Eric Garner

267
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,239
That's a profoundly disrespectful and race

268
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Stacked

269
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,055
I was just trying to protest the fact of Texas

270
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,151
Does dum-dum Governor Greg Abbott state is in trouble

271
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,759
Do you spell safety measures in place like telling people to stay at home

272
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,831
Put it possibly I haven't some masks orders in

273
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,671
Alex and his buddies have already protested

274
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,487
They were the ones who were doing all those

275
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,375
Add Alex and Owen went out there with their bullhorns back at the end of May and yells about how the state needed to reopen

276
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,191
Texas's report reporting

277
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,007
4509

278
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,823
As of June 23rd that number was

279
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,103
120,000

280
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
300

281
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
70 cases

282
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,479
Haven't reported over 27,000 new cases in the past week

283
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Alone

284
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
We flattened the Curve

285
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,391
Alex's.

286
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Import

287
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
On some level I think he knows that

288
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,839
The best I can really do is go back out and argue that the numbers are alive and Texas

289
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,911
Should be afraid of clearly spike in covid case numbers

290
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,215
And that's not going to get him the attention that he wants

291
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:14,079
But if you flexes his racist muscles and tries to start a we can't breathe movement

292
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Maybe just

293
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Maybe

294
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,943
Erlanger people enough to get them to cover image

295
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
Disgraceful and desperate and I hope that people don't

296
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Take the bait

297
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
The Free Press

298
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,367
Yeah it's it's like the next day

299
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Just coming out

300
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
I Have a Dream speech

301
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
She's being like

302
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
I stole a dream

303
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
You miss the point

304
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,031
We can't breathe the name of an organization that already

305
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
Whose mission statement reads

306
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:53,759
Create

307
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Disparity

308
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,599
Together we create

309
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Community Through Loveland

310
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Peaceful intent

311
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,743
Something tells me that they're going to have a bit more traction than Alex is dumb

312
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Publicity stunt

313
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
I went to his new website

314
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,727
It's just got a bunch of Infowars videos posted on there and then there's some posters you can download without masks are bad

315
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,543
Here's the thing that I think is really funny though

316
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,359
All of the posters include the weather

317
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
Which is we can't breathe.

318
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
But in Egypt

319
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,759
Booster the apostrophe is included in the word can't

320
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:32,671
If you type a URL in a zit appears on those posters you will never find Alex's website and it just seems like bad playing from

321
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
Graphic design stamp

322
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Apostrophe

323
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
The demographics of their older people

324
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,663
I have a strong suspicion that this protest

325
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,479
But he's trying to get going we'll be very underwhelming

326
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:02,623
They plan to meet and have a prayer service at the Capitol then March to the governor's mansion.

327
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Mask-wearing

328
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,975
That's a little scary in there right up is this

329
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,071
Freedom lovers are welcome and then in all caps

330
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Mask-wearing is discouraged

331
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
!

332
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
All right guys

333
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,287
This is dangerous and irresponsible but actually just

334
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
Stop them from holding the event

335
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
I'm guessing turnout

336
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,687
Ignore them and not give

337
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Attention

338
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
How Alex

339
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Named

340
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
The most effective response I think

341
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
It sucks because

342
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
You know

343
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Defensive

344
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
I think the best response

345
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
Strategically is just Veigar

346
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
Just ignore it

347
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Proposal

348
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
And that is

349
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Rent

350
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
Attached to them

351
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,591
A giant

352
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
During the protest

353
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
Has to have the

354
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,759
Captors drop the Dome slowly on top of that

355
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,087
Albion

356
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
What what are holes in there

357
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,863
Wicked wicked frolicon player

358
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,447
Going to run into money

359
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,519
Talking about some other stories

360
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
I got a bad angle on this one

361
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
Early Hollywood is collapsing

362
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,735
A bunch of producers are dying committing suicide

363
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,599
That is all coming up in that size of the giant pedophile Networks

364
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,391
Collapsing

365
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
In big

366
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
Darius substantial trouble

367
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
The blackmail

368
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
And control the population

369
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,631
I told you

370
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,679
24 hours left

371
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,031
The big mega sale in the items that are still

372
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
60 to 70% off

373
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,383
Nailed it

374
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,759
Sweet that was rough

375
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Lubed up

376
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,879
Alex's

377
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,463
Hollywood producers dying from suicide like

378
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
True but

379
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,303
He's just embellishing the story one recent headline

380
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
About the death of Steve Bing

381
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
The window of his 27

382
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
Floor apartment on Monday

383
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,799
There's no connection I can find him being involved in the views of children and

384
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
Close to the factory statements there if he's not careful

385
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,503
Mental illness for years

386
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
And quote

387
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
His close friends are devastated about his death

388
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,623
But sadly not surprised

389
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,023
Other discusses trouble with drugs and the fact that he appeared really rich on the surface but

390
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,071
He made a lot of ill-advised

391
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
Investment

392
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
People imagine

393
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,679
And it's impossible to run through 600 million dollars but

394
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,639
I guess I guess if you Brewster's Millions then you win I don't know I don't know what to say

395
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,391
Tragic story

396
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
Two claims in anyway this is another example of

397
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Your stamp

398
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,328
Beat him making up details about a story in order for them to

399
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
Predetermined area

400
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,704
It is

401
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
It is a

402
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
Double exploitation of something that's

403
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
Multiple tragedy

404
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,640
He's all in the same kind of situation

405
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
The

406
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
Real pedophilia

407
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
To score points

408
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,784
And then exploiting a man suicide

409
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
Due to

410
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,904
Host of factors including mental illness

411
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,768
Moved on with his life like that's fine like we all the rest of us have

412
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
How to deal with this post

413
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
He just gets

414
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,912
I'm not

415
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
Defending this guy

416
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:05,056
This producer I don't know anything about any

417
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848
The insinuations that Alex

418
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
Just trying to make

419
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
The mark of someone who is a real pilot

420
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
But

421
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,528
Even though Alex is a pile of s***

422
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:19,392
That doesn't mean he doesn't want to surround himself

423
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
And we meet the first one

424
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,512
Have you here when the only people as band as I am

425
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
Elite fraternities

426
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
You for joining us my friend

427
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:36,544
Well you got banned on YouTube let's get into that and let's get into the State of Affairs and trop and where you see this all going at

428
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,080
Can still find you

429
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
Uncensored unfiltered at censored.tv

430
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
Yeah it's the last

431
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,808
What about band.

432
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,368
Do you know who that is do you recognize his voice

433
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
I do not know

434
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
Okay

435
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,816
Play along

436
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
Damn it up Gabba

437
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,032
It's the whole time how much

438
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,408
Credibly long because a lot of it is Alex just rip

439
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:17,248
Repeating nonsense that he says all the time between sucking boring for us

440
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
To keep going over

441
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
Gavin

442
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,440
No I'm not really interested in gathering McGinnis

443
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
Hard-hitting takes on

444
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:33,376
The present let me do my impression all right

445
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,288
Website

446
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
That happened for a while because

447
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,688
Did you get them promotional attention out of here

448
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,760
This is not the first time he's been kicked out YouTube

449
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,064
In December 2018 he was booted for

450
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
Copyright violations

451
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Opportunity

452
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,744
Respond to these copyright infringement claims

453
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,304
It appears he did not resolve them which is what Alton

454
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
Smitley lied to the bank

455
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,168
This is around the same time that Glenn Beck Network The Blaze

456
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Publicly dissed

457
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,984
Themselves from Gavin

458
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,288
Unfunny fascist piece of s***

459
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Hotels right

460
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,384
The splc

461
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,272
Arrow flurry of stories about that back in February 2019 but mysteriously nothing meaningful sense

462
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Tivoli with the law

463
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,304
So I assume

464
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
He got back on YouTube

465
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
Is it considered incitement towards violence

466
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Well I don't know this

467
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,104
Pacific spice

468
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,152
Deserve and overdue

469
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,016
I went to his website what a roster of losers who got working for him

470
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832
You got Milo Alex's former employee

471
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,928
Pizzagate Rambo Joe Biggs

472
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,488
Jacob Wohl and Laura Loomer

473
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,768
Call Manuel

474
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:14,240
Italian Job level crew right there talking about terrarium bubble

475
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,592
Keep them all in one studio for like a marathon or something

476
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,456
Former boxer breaks down

477
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
Whatever

478
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,416
You can't watch any content on his website

479
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
Subscription

480
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
People stuff

481
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,328
10 bucks a month or $100

482
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,424
Hundred dollars a year to get access to all the stuff that those buffoon

483
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
Can't imagine

484
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,288
Talent pool like being compelling sales pitch

485
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,688
For people but that's what you're going to do good luck

486
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,296
Not to read anything by those I honestly if you if it was

487
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,576
Between giving you money

488
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
And just reading one of their articles

489
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
I swear to you I will give you money

490
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:12,608
Now I was going to say that like it wasn't behind a paywall maybe I'd do some like episodes by Rapido big butt

491
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
I realized

492
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,216
Since there's no way I can do that

493
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
You take it back not to going

494
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,152
Conservatives

495
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,784
Is complaining about how like all these people who censored

496
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,904
Remembers that like Ralph Northam did blackface

497
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,192
You're a Nazi helmets

498
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
Everybody

499
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Jason says

500
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
You should be banned

501
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
So

502
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:02,016
It's really interesting to hear Alex struggle to come up with a reason why you shouldn't do blacks

503
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,808
You started say it's too dangerous

504
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
Correct

505
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
Lathrop

506
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,000
Use originally trying to say it's

507
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
Could kick your ass

508
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
We just got it

509
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,656
Also do yourself a favor and Google Gavin McGinnis in blackface

510
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,472
I'm sure he's never done it

511
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Fun fact

512
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Blackface

513
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:30,176
Gaston Steven Crowder show the title was time for blackface

514
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
The time I didn't know exist

515
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,784
Is it also in 2014

516
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
What's wrong with blacks

517
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Lots of things

518
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:42,208
Alex could hardly the worst person to be like hey you never done that

519
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,144
Publicly defended blackface

520
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,984
How is it that

521
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,824
Sahara Desert

522
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,432
Respect there's no such thing as history there's no such thing as

523
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,736
It's all in the present

524
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,784
And usually that's a good bet

525
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
B-real

526
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
So Gavin

527
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
I can't

528
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Get myself

529
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
To care about

530
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Interview

531
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,512
The more we sort of ignore

532
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
That's a great show

533
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,960
It's not

534
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,056
I love your old white man

535
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,944
Is it just next Cliff we get to another gas

536
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
Powerhouse Duo

537
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,528
Again

538
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,160
He's known for a while

539
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
This is

540
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
There's a big story at

541
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,840
Josh. Cam.com

542
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
Content moderator

543
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
If someone's wearing a mega hat

544
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
I'm going to delete them for that

545
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Facebook Insiders

546
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
McElroy

547
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
What is against Trump supporters

548
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:14,112
So are we get another person project Veritas name Zach

549
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,672
So

550
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:22,816
I'm so proud

551
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,144
The guy's name is Zach Michael McElroy and

552
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,680
Is a Content moderator for

553
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Cognizant

554
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,496
Is a company that Facebook subcontract

555
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
Run moderation

556
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:37,152
According to his telling of the story people he worked with a cognizant conservative bias

557
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,736
Which is that being used say the Facebook hasn't anti-conservative is

558
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
This doesn't work

559
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,600
Even if we accept Zach's premise that his co-workers were all out to go

560
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
Get conservatives any problems with Cox

561
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,744
You should be under contract with cognizant

562
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
If you was trying to do anything

563
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:57,120
Not his ankle problem

564
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Specific

565
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
The cognoscenti

566
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:02,240
We're not about winning or doing the right

567
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,288
Even having a

568
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
This is about screaming about something

569
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,480
I watched the video and legitimately the first thing that

570
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
It's brought up doesn't prove anything

571
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
James O'Keefe

572
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,112
Ask Zach about these

573
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Temeku

574
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,696
And Zack says that 75 to 80% of the post

575
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
Nike you came from Republic

576
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
Open pages

577
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
The first problem is if there's no metrics

578
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
Provided on this

579
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,864
It's just that estimation which I have no reason

580
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
And believe or trust

581
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:35,776
But even if he is telling the truth and this number is accurate that conservative bias

582
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:40,128
Maybe there's more harassment being done by right-wing Associated Facebook pages

583
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,408
Maybe they're not

584
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,480
There are other explanations for the phenomenon has described

585
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,528
But the conclusion is reached

586
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
Just more evidence

587
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Facebook

588
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
Republican

589
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,160
That's a sloppy assumption and if that's other videos opening

590
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,744
You can't really have much they're going to do much better as it goes along

591
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,328
So his idea though is that there would be a 50

592
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
50

593
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Reporting

594
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
If it was objective

595
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
Yes that's basically his ark

596
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Yeah

597
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,752
Ruby equal

598
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
Even though

599
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
That's

600
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,568
Simply not

601
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
Function of either minutes

602
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,176
Human behavior

603
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,528
You can have a perfectly Fair algorithm

604
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
And it could be like

605
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,088
90%

606
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,880
Because

607
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,280
Facet of the online Republican necessarily

608
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,328
Nothing to do

609
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,912
The large section of Republicans

610
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,472
The ones were buried

611
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,336
Plus they never really

612
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,128
Q is whether or not it's

613
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:47,968
Just things that are automatically caught by algorithms or if it's

614
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
Things that are recorded

615
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,808
Manually by people and that could make

616
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,368
Did giganti difference in terms of what ends up

617
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,952
Temeku

618
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,352
Say I trust any of this

619
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
Words taken out of context

620
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,520
Conservative post

621
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,824
Even if they're not violating the rules

622
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,664
However Veritas forgot to cut out the part where she says

623
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,296
I don't give no fux it's like 1 week

624
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
She's clearly someone who has quit

625
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:30,720
Is working

626
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:34,560
Which implies have consequences

627
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:41,216
To the video actually proves that deleting conservative post that are not

628
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,800
Think about it

629
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,896
Do not use the part-time great work veritas

630
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
And then

631
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,760
I do like

632
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,416
There's another exchange moderator who's

633
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,720
Conservative post even though it's supposed to

634
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
That should be taken down

635
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
So she's kind of like almost

636
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
The sympathetic

637
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
Person

638
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,864
And then

639
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,680
The office

640
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,776
Insert slur for a little person

641
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
Harass about his height

642
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,152
Okay this is making a strong case about this harassment stuff

643
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,624
The sympathetic person is a person who

644
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:36,000
Person who's doing khubaib your butt at work

645
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,024
Oh great

646
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,352
This is just another standardized Veritas by all the trash

647
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:45,984
Is there a test wanted to do some work that actually was meaningful maybe they could have been like Casey Newton at the verge

648
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,824
Who didn't expose in early 2019 about the horrible working

649
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,616
Conditions of Facebook moderators

650
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
A cognizant worth

651
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
Subjected to

652
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,456
Helped Along by Newton

653
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:00,576
Recording Facebook agree to a court settlement

654
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,856
For the mental health issues

655
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,136
The moderators developed

656
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
From filtering

657
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
Terrific content

658
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,232
On the platform keeping all that stuff off

659
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
German article about that

660
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:15,936
Moderator will receive a minimum of $1,000 in additional compensation

661
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
Stress disorder or related

662
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Conditions

663
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,800
The settlement covers 11200

664
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
50 moderator

665
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,384
That's reporting that matters

666
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
It makes people's lives better

667
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
Scandal

668
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
If you never

669
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,552
Good C project Veritas even coming close to it

670
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,392
They don't cover actual fraudulent Hatchet pieces for profit

671
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,512
But it's not surprising exact McIlroy has already put up a GoFundMe page

672
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,840
Is looking to raise $150,000

673
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:49,472
Episode it's been up for a day over thirty $4,000

674
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
F****** cry

675
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,800
This is the right wing Griffith

676
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,384
It's very profitable

677
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,944
It's just not a gig that last very long

678
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
So you get your GoFundMe

679
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,600
And then you are you just nothing for you to do

680
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,696
Got nothing else to do maybe you kind of working a crunch

681
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
That's going to look good on a resume

682
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
Step Up

683
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,912
Just don't understand why

684
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Conservatives

685
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
Can't demand better live at

686
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:25,056
Like James O'Keefe's videos all suck

687
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
And half

688
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Time

689
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,200
The opposite Point than what he wants

690
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
True

691
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,832
Demand better don't get all the money until he makes it better move

692
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
Yeah it's tough

693
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
Because you know he had the back

694
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,024
Sitting in the support of Andrew Breitbart

695
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,840
He's almost royalty in terms of

696
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Like those

697
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
Connections

698
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
That's where you at

699
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,616
You just can't let him get away

700
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,152
Well speaking of that

701
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
James

702
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
He shows up

703
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,040
Show up

704
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,832
Whistleblower and

705
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,392
And so they're just talking about

706
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,792
This is how

707
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,400
Thumbs up what Mark Zuckerberg is doing

708
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,216
So what is essentially done here

709
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Is he subbed

710
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
Contracted

711
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
Out his

712
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,848
To these third

713
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,872
Party companies

714
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
Like

715
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
The one that's

716
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
Cognizant

717
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Outfit

718
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,552
Which is where all these content Reviewer is do their business

719
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
Because Zuckerberg wants Maybe

720
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,696
Separation

721
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,744
Motorcycle game

722
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
That's all he's done like a mafia

723
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,072
Littlesubgirl

724
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
Yeah the mafia create a little sub fam

725
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Facebook

726
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,728
Didn't create cogs

727
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,776
Borders

728
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,104
Dad was wrong.

729
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
Whatever

730
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,432
Interesting point

731
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,992
But it relies on a large unproven assumption

732
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,808
In order for this argument to fly he needs to Devin

733
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,880
What street did Facebook subcontracted cognizant in order

734
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,696
If you wanted for Facebook

735
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
Wild Fork

736
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,536
Conservative Target

737
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
Keeps his hands clean

738
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,376
Has not demonstrated

739
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
Visit all

740
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,960
Easy to accept literally every piece of evidence

741
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984
Presented

742
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
I believe it this is

743
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
The problem with

744
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,312
Cognizant and not with Facebook

745
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,104
That's one of the reasons why this is

746
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,408
Incredibly sloppy reporting it doesn't mean anything

747
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:44,576
There's another huge problem with this story and that is at the end of 2019 it was pretty

748
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
Technology Solutions

749
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
Was getting out

750
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,416
The content moderating business

751
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,464
Delete all 6,000

752
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,048
Employees and told investors in a financial operations

753
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,352
Within a subset of the content operation

754
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,400
Business are working

755
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,472
Don't determine whether certain content violates clients

756
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,776
Objectionable material

757
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,104
We've determined that this subset of our work is not in line with our

758
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
Dziedzic vision

759
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
Or the company

760
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,224
In response to the news Facebook's VP of scaled operations

761
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
We respect

762
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
Target's institutions

763
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,648
Content review services for social media platform

764
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,720
Had a 100 million dollar per year

765
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
Deals Romney's moderation

766
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
Facilities

767
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,096
Sounds like a ton stand

768
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
Parkinson disease

769
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
A huge and diverse company

770
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
The revenue last year was

771
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
18.8 billion dollars

772
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
Giant

773
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
What the f*** are these people

774
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Right

775
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,688
Be phased out over 2020

776
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,760
It calls into question a lot of content

777
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,808
4th and o'keeffe's

778
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,600
This interview it seems

779
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
Like it might be old

780
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:57,280
Yeah it sounds like something up here but I don't know what it is and doesn't add up

781
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
2

782
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
Out the window

783
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:10,336
Another important point is that there's a bunch of companies that Facebook subcontracts to do moderation work

784
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,432
There's pron unlimited Accenture Badger LG

785
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,016
Global company

786
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
Yeah

787
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,344
Give me the more than

788
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,952
Do you need people to be doing this 24 hours a day or else

789
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,024
People posting beheading videos

790
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:34,144
Get to the beheading videos

791
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,192
Text dad that leaves them up

792
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
414 hours

793
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Right

794
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
It's it's

795
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,896
This isn't even for project

796
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
Disappointingly week

797
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,296
Yeah

798
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,624
That's essentially exactly what Alex.

799
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,744
He constantly tells his audience

800
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
Block Story

801
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,072
Exactly

802
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Different

803
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:08,448
Business strategy entirely at this point just trying to

804
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
Gives you different names

805
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,544
Getaround

806
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,640
He is a biker gang that has to say

807
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,968
Ridiculous

808
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
She's bad at Rebrand

809
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,808
Newswars it's just going to be spelled with a

810
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Dino

811
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
.

812
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,184
Alex's mad about masks

813
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,488
Tomorrow because it looks like

814
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,328
Governor Abbott's going to mandate wearing masks name in

815
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
Sores inside

816
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
I hate you

817
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,168
F****** mascot

818
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
Alex

819
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,360
California or Texas

820
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,576
I say California.

821
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
Here we go

822
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,840
You could go

823
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
Course they can

824
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,656
Can't make you wear that

825
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,960
California.gov is not an actual webs

826
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
It's ca.gov

827
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
Freddy California

828
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,896
Leaving that aside of course some people are not required to wear

829
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:27,808
Princeton's in California people communicating with someone who needs lips

830
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Communicate

831
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,392
Restaurants in or able to sit

832
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,976
Speedway from other parties aren't required to be Maxwell eating

833
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:39,072
People doing outdoor recreational activity don't have to wear masks as long as they

834
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Can stay distance

835
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
From others

836
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,496
Their folks medical mental health or developmental disabilities that make it so they could not wear masks

837
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
Safeway

838
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,080
Those people are exempt from the requirement honestly

839
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
If you have a medical issue that makes

840
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,895
Makes it so you can't wear a mask

841
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,687
It seems like you might not risk

842
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,479
Going into places at their height

843
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,783
People during an active pandemic

844
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
Then such

845
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,159
Most of such medical issues would likely involve breathing related condition

846
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,463
Before put you in a higher risk

847
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
Category

848
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,071
Like this is the angle that

849
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,399
These exemptions pretend we all have those

850
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,471
Exemptions

851
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,639
Just f****** we're messy like people used to get medical marijuana

852
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,991
I got a cough so I'm going to get a weed card man

853
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
There's a difference

854
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,623
What is a similar Behavior

855
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,023
Got it just

856
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
This is another thing

857
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,119
Just goes pretty much throughout these days

858
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,215
Decided to run this we can't breathe March

859
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,775
Going hard on this mask exemption

860
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
It's sad but it's

861
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,663
Also serious

862
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:02,015
Stupid petulant stupid

863
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,063
Are you going to get people killed

864
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,879
Just don't understand

865
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,951
This is stupid on a level

866
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:14,303
Is is problematic for me because it suggests that like where's the f****** lie

867
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
You know like

868
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
The government mandates

869
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
Taxes so you pay f****** tax

870
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,799
Not over you that

871
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
But you get

872
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,895
From paying the taxes

873
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,431
Entirely for granted

874
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:37,599
Part of you love so god-damn sidewalks

875
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:44,767
Lake Michigan

876
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,351
There's 100

877
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
Examine

878
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,935
Things that you just go about your life and you don't realize are taken

879
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,983
Tara by everyone Poseidon

880
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,775
Chip in for taxes

881
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,591
And the same thing with this to

882
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,663
The government says we gotta wear masks going to go inside businesses

883
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,735
You know there is a collective communal

884
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,271
Responsibility

885
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
Taking care of that

886
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
And that's another thing

887
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,855
Charlie Clips

888
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
Consistent

889
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
But like

890
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,743
Start using shown that masks

891
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,119
No one is arguing

892
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,655
Will protect you as a Sara Lee

893
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,959
If everyone wore a mask

894
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,519
It's about stopping the spread.

895
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,543
During any

896
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,895
I just

897
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,711
Boggles my mind like I'm not saying

898
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,087
Is it blanketly accept anything that the government says like you were saying with Tex

899
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
Can take for granted

900
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
And in this case

901
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,463
Is that why you can take

902
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,279
For granite is when you can see directly in front of your face

903
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,839
People are f****** done

904
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:55,935
You know where goddamn ask everybody

905
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
Dying

906
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,519
Look at how great it was that we more warm at

907
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,335
Comparison between Texas

908
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:07,199
Get the little bit murky

909
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,247
There are number of people who

910
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,111
To take a conscientious stance of non-payment of rexhaj

911
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
I have that kind of

912
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,839
There isn't an analogue for that

913
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:27,935
Your face gets

914
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
Sweaty sometimes

915
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
That's about it

916
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,055
What's

917
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
It was a tough

918
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
Like its first

919
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,735
Day

920
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,599
I'm not a guy who accessorize has

921
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,183
Perhaps I've never had an earring

922
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,719
I don't like sunglasses

923
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,535
Sunglasses my cross eye

924
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
I've never put

925
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:04,287
Beads in my beard

926
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,919
It was a tough little bit of a just

927
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,039
I'm choosing to do this looking at me

928
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,207
That's pretty quickly

929
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:28,095
Attention to yourself wearing this accessory would be drawing attention to yourself

930
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:33,215
Inferior

931
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Get over it

932
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,359
He's mad at Governor Abbott

933
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,919
Interesting

934
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,223
View of how come

935
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
Alex

936
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,023
The most out there conservative

937
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,559
Nonsense

938
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
Is

939
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,423
He's taking the virus seriously too late

940
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
Best

941
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,519
The governor California sets the precedent

942
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,055
I told you other taking follow

943
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
And then

944
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,687
Is now literally the Mini-Me

945
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,063
Follow his orders

946
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,367
The taxes is not just been colonized

947
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
California rejects now

948
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
We are now

949
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,743
Governor Newsom

950
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,791
Gavin Newsom

951
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
The governor of Texas

952
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,655
Governor resigned earlier yesterday

953
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,007
California governor

954
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,287
Might as well

955
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,591
I know that Alex is trying to be like kind of

956
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,383
Funny it's not funny but

957
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,919
You really is like

958
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
Overly dramatic

959
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:51,551
His life is over

960
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:57,951
This crush doesn't want to go to this Governor does almost everything in line

961
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,511
I like isn't doing what I like this time therefore

962
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:04,863
California metals

963
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,959
Call myself in the street cuz now the Newsom is my governor

964
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:13,567
I think there's something interesting about this idea that California was going to put in this

965
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,103
Mask requirement

966
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,711
Following the governor of California

967
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,759
An underlying element of this is

968
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,039
Is the Texas would be just

969
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,831
Following California's leave boat

970
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:29,183
If I were to tell you the California was not the first state to require masks in public

971
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:35,327
California's order when to place on June 18th because I live in Illinois I know that we've had that shipped

972
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,143
And we already been the first

973
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
State

974
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,983
According to CNN the first state to require masks

975
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,055
New Jersey back on April 8th

976
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
Alex

977
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
Bill Murphy

978
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,735
He is currently the governor of New Jersey Rhode Island Pennsylvania New York New Mexico

979
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,527
Massachusetts Maryland

980
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,087
Kentucky Illinois

981
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
Delaware Connecticut

982
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
California

983
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:03,743
Wow he really you know I knew there was a power vacuum but I didn't know you

984
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,511
You could really

985
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,791
You could really grab it

986
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,399
0 powers

987
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:14,751
Country

988
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,615
Not a bad little kingdom guys got going on

989
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,943
Most of the economic centers of country

990
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:28,831
You got a lot of Leverage California

991
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,111
You got Illinois

992
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
Yeah

993
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
Hey wife

994
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,487
Stupid

995
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,559
California

996
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,655
Recognized

997
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,215
Doing

998
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,287
Has like a like a

999
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,359
Hyperbole

1000
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,663
Over and over and over again

1001
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,223
It's all funny the first time it's not interesting

1002
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,247
I don't know

1003
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,295
The failure engine sounds like a baby

1004
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,831
Also it's

1005
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,879
Today is it's one of those things where it's like

1006
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:09,535
How long before you'll be next week whenever is like

1007
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,303
Cuz he did this

1008
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,583
Missing you like what the fuc

1009
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:17,215
Right right

1010
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:24,383
Love is Real Deals number one guy

1011
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,711
So Alex gets into talk about somebody's exemption

1012
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,271
Are there available for people with masks

1013
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
For hearing impaired

1014
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,183
Hearing impaired

1015
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,975
Running ability to see the mouth

1016
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,511
Is essential

1017
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
Discovering

1018
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,983
State federal and regulations in

1019
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,335
Yeah they just passed along California exempt of your brown

1020
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,151
I'm not joking

1021
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:01,247
So pretty cool to hear Alex

1022
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,527
You just lie about being

1023
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,111
What revolutionary we have on our hands here

1024
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,695
Do you know when you're willing to die for your car

1025
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:15,327
Pretend you have a disability

1026
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,375
Was not about that

1027
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,167
It was about

1028
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
Updating

1029
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,471
Heelys

1030
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
I got nothing

1031
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,031
I do have to admit that

1032
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,335
Frequently lied about being astute

1033
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,871
To get cheaper movie

1034
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,663
I mean that's fair

1035
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
Right

1036
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,735
Slightly different

1037
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,783
Same behavior saving those two bucks

1038
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
Exactly

1039
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,599
Different saving

1040
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,903
That last part is really into

1041
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Purpose clip

1042
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,975
It's not entirely made up but

1043
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,279
The stories talking about wasn't California

1044
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
An Oregon

1045
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,887
This is a specific in Lincoln County in Oregon

1046
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,423
Population 49 South

1047
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,959
Does 90%

1048
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,495
Less than 1% black

1049
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,031
The reasoning behind

1050
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:01,407
Exemption for people of color to not have to wear masks

1051
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,479
Explain by Trevor logo

1052
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,015
A professor at Ohio State

1053
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,343
Wear a mask seems like a reasonable response

1054
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,135
Unless you sort

1055
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,439
Take American society

1056
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:19,071
When you can't do that you're basically telling people to look dangerous given racial stereotypes that are out there

1057
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,631
After the Raven media picked up on the story

1058
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,935
Started

1059
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,263
But how this is racist

1060
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,031
Against white people

1061
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,359
This last weekend

1062
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:36,991
All the sudden or call center blows up with whoever answers the phone

1063
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,295
Spokesman Casey Miller said

1064
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,903
Exemption whether it was

1065
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,231
Completely stupid idea or was well-intentioned but misguided

1066
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,303
One thing we can be sure of is that Alex has no idea what he's talking

1067
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:56,703
He said it was the state of California when in reality it's a small County in Oregon who's already reverse the exempt

1068
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,007
As is so often the case

1069
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:02,847
Oz angry misreporting about a story that is no longer even

1070
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
Betsy's just

1071
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,919
Wasting his time

1072
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
You know it

1073
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,479
It's it's really

1074
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
It's really frustrating

1075
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,039
How well the right

1076
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
Can weaponize

1077
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,391
Old man house phone version of Addie.

1078
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,439
Like they just

1079
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
You just

1080
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:23,071
Get of all of these idiots

1081
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
People are

1082
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,399
Fake

1083
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:30,495
The Viagra horse

1084
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,823
Sucking ding-dongs just call and yell and that's enough

1085
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,847
That's just a nut

1086
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,895
Right that's enough

1087
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
Goddamn Street

1088
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,223
Tear gas left and right and it's enough

1089
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
Just a call

1090
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
In this

1091
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
Case

1092
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,855
I mean I don't know I don't know Alexa

1093
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,391
I don't think I have

1094
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,159
Any kind of

1095
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,439
Real position

1096
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,743
To speak on whether or not that exemption

1097
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,071
Is appropriate or not I would like to hear Rhonda side of hearing

1098
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,351
From the voice of

1099
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
The people who would be affected

1100
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,983
If that would be an insult

1101
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,263
Exemption

1102
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,031
To be put in

1103
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,567
Something that people would be

1104
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,335
Beyonce bro

1105
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,615
I'm not entirely sure

1106
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,711
I don't know

1107
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:17,087
Amazon

1108
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,367
Carrie slays

1109
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,903
You know do the whole thing

1110
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:23,487
So from the 23rd

1111
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,559
And I've never heard on

1112
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,839
Before and I didn't

1113
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,863
I couldn't even

1114
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,887
Be bothered to look into

1115
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,167
Actually turned off

1116
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,447
The episode

1117
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:37,311
Real boring

1118
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:41,407
I'm not going to listen to Alex interview somebody who's inspired by Alex

1119
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:46,527
Listen to him interview has some sort of a website

1120
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,551
I don't care

1121
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,831
I can deal with

1122
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,159
The second-hand version of him

1123
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,719
A sycophant

1124
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
Exactly

1125
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
Buck

1126
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:02,911
We can start with what you said when I watched you back in about 2,000

1127
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,215
Very

1128
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,751
Pointedly saying

1129
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,103
You going to bring back Human Sacrifice the UN Agenda 21

1130
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,991
I heard you say back then

1131
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,807
I thought that was a little off but I was already kind of

1132
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,599
Conspiracy

1133
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,623
Surely not

1134
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:26,463
And you know what I did Alex I went and I got at my library

1135
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,487
About 40

1136
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,511

00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,767
So this guy's name is Jay Dyer

1149
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,047
I don't know anything about him

1150
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
I don't care

1151
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,583

Ghost in the Machine music philosophical text

1153

Analysis of it is basically proof only

1154
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,519
Dense material

1155
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:16,639
The book itself is Arthur Kessler's attempt to explore the duality of the human

1156
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,919
Prince in the mind and body

1157
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943

Consequence of nonsensical passion

1162
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,207
That's the central question being dealt with in this

1163
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:30,975
Attract

1164
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,815

Apologist

1169
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:47,871
Too little attention to the earliest ubiquitous manifestations of

1170

The delusionary streak of the human psyche

1171
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,479
The institution of human sacrifice

1172

I'm flattered the Gods

00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,135
It's found at the

1178
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,439
The dawn of civilization in every part of the world

1179
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,231
It persisted through the height of

Pre-columbian cultures

And it's practically still being practiced in the remote corners of the world

1183
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,423
Usual attitude is to dismiss the

1184
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,215
The subject is a Sinister curiosity

1185
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,007
Superstitions

1186
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,055
What does attitude bakes

1187
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
The question of the universality of the

1188

The phenomenon

1189
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:23,199
Ignores the clues that it provides to be delusional

1190

A man's mental structure and

1191
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,271
Its relevance to

1192
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
To the problems of

1193
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:27,807
The present

1194
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,599
In the context of the book

1195
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
Kessler

1196
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,671
Use the phenomenon as

1197
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,695
Ruby symptoms

1198
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
Split between reason

1199
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,255
Emotion-based

1200
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
Which produces

1201
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
Delusional

1202
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,327
Streak running

1203
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
Through history

1204
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
According to his

The refusal to accept death

1206
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:48,031
Fear is a natural or is a final phenomenon

1207

Ghost ancestral spirit

1208
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,359
It's God's demigod

1209
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,383
Angels and devils

1210
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,175
Bear became saturated

1211
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,479
Invisible presences as in a mental home

1212
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,271
Most of them were malevolent

1213
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,575
The vengeful or at least capricious

1214
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,111
Insatiable in their demand

1215
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,903
They had to be worshipped

1216
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,695
Bejeweled propriate Adora

1217
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,743
Possibly if possible

1218
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,303
Hence the insane gesture of Abraham

1219
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,095
The ubiquity of human sex

1220
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,143
Surprise at the bloody dawn of civilization

1221
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,423
The holy Massacre

1222
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,703
If continued ever since

1223
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,751
If anything this book

1224
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,031
Encourages the pursuit of a

1225
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,055
Secure

1226
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,847
He calls this delusional Street

1227
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,431
Tessler believes that this could result in

1228
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
Human Celtic

1229
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:27,967
Extinction

1230
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,991
And that

1231
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,159
That was not

1232
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,207
I don't believe this guy has read this book

1233
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,047
He has an assessment of it reveals

1234
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,071
He's not good at assessing

1235
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,119
Information

1236
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,655
Quick Stop

1237
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,959
People really don't understand

1238
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:50,751
Reading is hard

1239
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,287
If you're doing

1240
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,335
It takes time

1241
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,359
You should take

1242
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,431
Notes

1243
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
Engage with

1244
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
Thought

1245
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:05,855
Don't don't be like oh look at this you said you would sacrifice was all over

1246
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
Cool

1247
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:15,839
Lisa said something that always makes me laugh about the whole leg

1248
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,887
Hear it hear an English class

1249
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,911
You speak English

1250
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,495
Just cuz you can read words doesn't mean you can read

1251
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:26,079
Like that's just the reality of it and then we have those

1252
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,103
Russian literature

1253
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,663
And that's the way the people who make fun of us

1254
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,687
For having us

1255
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,991
I say s*** like this

1256
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,039
And you can

1257
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,575
Is there end

1258
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:41,695
Compression like is Impressionism

1259
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,863
Globalist elitebook yeah yeah

1260
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
It said

1261
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,191
Just basically someone who's like

1262
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,983
I can see I see what Alex is doing

1263
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
Sexually

1264
00:59:55,519 --> 01:00:01,151
And if they're in your face are the f****** elitebooks why are they in this dude's local goddamn Library

1265
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:01,919
Everywhere

1266
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,479
Larry Wyble

1267
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,503
Available

1268
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:11,903
Cuz it's a widely available for people

1269
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:17,791
Lesser Magic

1270
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:24,191
Are Librarians all-in-one

1271
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,519
No problem

1272
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,663
So there's not much going on here cuz

1273
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,199
Again

1274
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
A bunch

1275
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,735
Suggest

1276
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,063
Episode

1277
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,343
I don't know

1278
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
View

1279
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:50,303
The sense that I get is like I think that this Jay Dyer guy maybe has a big audience

1280
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,655
You don't know

1281
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,215
Gavin has a

1282
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,495
Pretty broad appeal

1283
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,775
I think that he thinks

1284
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,335
Veritas is like a

1285
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,871
Going to go places

1286
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,967
Some of the people that he has on this episode

1287
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,759
On the 24th to

1288
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,039
Kiipix is going to Broadway

1289
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:11,807
Is is

1290
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,575
Israel

1291
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,903
And maybe help promote his rally

1292
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,743
Cute bed when you go

1293
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,535
Clout chasing at the bottom of the barrel

1294
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:27,935
You know dick down in their to-go glad we got Gavin McInnes coming in here

1295
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
For the Stars

1296
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:32,031
And you just go dig it out of the bottom of the bucket

1297
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,663
We got

1298
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,711
Who who attacked

1299
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,503
James Wood coming on

1300
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:46,111
A little bit of his luster

1301
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,719
Sticking out my head

1302
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,743
Is it like James

1303
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,791
Is the right guy

1304
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:00,703
So we start off

1305
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:04,543
You know we got the narrative about the other NASCAR is in a

1306
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,175
Bubba BS Wallace

1307
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,271
Rope to pull down the garage

1308
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,343
What's a noose

1309
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
Enough for a cat

1310
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,975
Big Hero

1311
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,559
I know all the details of the Bubba Wallace

1312
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,375
Situation but I'm pretty comfortable

1313
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:35,775
He spends a lot of time on this episode going on about how Wallace is trying to get attention for himself and make a hoax

1314
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,543
Hate crime

1315
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,847
I'm not particularly concerned with Alex

1316
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,151
Because he has a very basic

1317
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
Facts of the story wrong

1318
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,223
What was didn't report

1319
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,807
Someone who worked in his garage found it and recorded it

1320
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
NASCAR

1321
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:53,183
What was himself only found out about it after NASCAR's President Steve

1322
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,255
Contacted him to inform him of what if

1323
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
Confound

1324
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,559
Ultimately

1325
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:02,655
Castigation determined that the news have been there since at least 2019 but there was no way

1326
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,679
The guy at the garage

1327
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,447
To have known

1328
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:08,287
He was part of Wallace's team and they have just been transferred to that garage

1329
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:11,103
The guy who found it checked out the other garages

1330
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,663
Before recording on it and found no other garages

1331
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,687
Is halved Oracles

1332
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,223
That are tied like a noose

1333
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
Which was part of what caused alarm

1334
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,855
When was discovered that this wasn't an attack that targeted

1335
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,135
What was said

1336
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,719
I think will gladly take a little embarrassment over what the alternative

1337
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Could have been

1338
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,047
Giving away this unfolded I think that's the correct

1339
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:33,887
Also it's important to recognize the context we're in right now

1340
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:39,007
This all happened in June which is suspicious

1341
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,823
Instances of people of color being found hanged in public

1342
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:45,407
These have been ruled suicide

1343
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,455
Contrary

1344
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:53,343
Further investigation for cases of needed it for sure

1345
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,647
Easy to see how the worlds

1346
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:58,207
Make it through something like a noose

1347
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,255
Being found in NASCAR garage

1348
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,535
Abused by a black driver

1349
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,583
That's not something you can really ignore

1350
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,375
Particularly if you are now

1351
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
NASCAR

1352
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,959
Information roll

1353
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:12,287
With someone is checking the other garages

1354
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:18,687
Am I making a big deal out of finding

1355
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,991
To NASCAR

1356
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,271
NASCAR hears about this

1357
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,575
They cannot not enjoy

1358
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:28,159
And then

1359
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,279
Chain of events happened exactly

1360
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,631
But Alex is trying to turn it into Joe

1361
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:41,471
Exactly and over and over again

1362
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,031
What a prick

1363
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,455
Yeah cuz they escorted release

1364
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,783
A picture of it that I saw today

1365
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,599
That's no knot noose

1366
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,159
Not something

1367
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:04,511
Speaking

1368
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:08,607
There's one version of

1369
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,399
Is that something f***** up

1370
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,703
Somebody's really f***** up

1371
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,751
We could have been somebody

1372
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:19,871
I don't know it's weird and stuff everywhere

1373
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
It's still

1374
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
Take the news.

1375
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:29,343
If you're moving out of the garage and you had that up for your ass out with you

1376
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,391
Better than that would have been

1377
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:35,231
Probably the appropriate way for this to be handled

1378
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,535
Experience what you're leaving behind

1379
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,327
Exact absolute

1380
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,863
That would have been better

1381
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
So Alex

1382
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,679
Now he's doing his March

1383
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
Come Sunday

1384
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,983
At the Capitol in Austin

1385
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:50,079
This to be a nationwide movement

1386
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:56,479
Missy bath and everywhere don't wait for orders from headquarters this Sunday your capital

1387
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,759
Your city council

1388
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,831
Yorktown ECUA one person you maybe Tempe

1389
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,927
But you got a real Church you should go have your open-air church service

1390
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:08,511
Even believe a cupboard house at the same place to be

1391
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:09,791
Sunshine

1392
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,351
The First Amendment which is Free Speech

1393
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,375
Religion

1394
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,215
Appreciate

1395
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,799
Church service

1396
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
This Sunday

1397
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,103
Capital

1398
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,991
A shame on you

1399
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,295
I can't wait to

1400
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,319
To see the

1401
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,111
Relative size

1402
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,159
Call Debbie huge

1403
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,719
Compared women

1404
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,791
All around the globe

1405
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,863
70 people in Austin

1406
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
Maybe

1407
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,447
Couple hundred

1408
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,727
And then compare that to

1409
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
Thousand

1410
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,543
Black lives matter

1411
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,103
Man I can I can imagine the howl

1412
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,151
Would be deafening

1413
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,431
Beyond all reason but

1414
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
If I could

1415
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,991
I'd have liked A Little Agency

1416
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,783
In the IRS

1417
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,087
Just like sending people around waiting

1418
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,111
For this kind of stuff

1419
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
With a little signature on a

1420
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,695
Losing your tax exempt status

1421
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:14,559
That's right just like waiting moment he's like and that's why we should

1422
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:19,423
That would be faster.

1423
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,703
That's never going to happen.

1424
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,727
Trump

1425
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,775
That would be really interesting of like

1426
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,055
You doing this

1427
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,847
Would be crossing the line

1428
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,663
Retrieve your your church is not a political Act

1429
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,431
Exactly

1430
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:33,503
Kind of

1431
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,271
Is going to happen

1432
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,063
Meetup

1433
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,903
Status that would be wild

1434
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,463
Don't think it's going to happen but

1435
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,487
Play America

1436
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,255
Can Inquisition

1437
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,815
Alex is really

1438
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,839
Desperate

1439
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,631
About this masks stuff

1440
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,679
Understand

1441
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,007
This is getting YouTube

1442
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,543
Submit security can come in

1443
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,359
I don't agree with his assessment

1444
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:02,175
I give you saying that

1445
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:07,295
But there's an intensity behind

1446
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,231
Does the health risk to me

1447
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,767
Ada and

1448
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,911
Ada violation

1449
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,703
Information line 805

1450
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,263
14001

1451
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,311
Can be fine

1452
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,871
$7,000 the first Ada violation

1453
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,175
Violation

1454
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,455
Attention government agents

1455
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:38,783
Farad

1456
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,927
Flyers

1457
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,463
Use the law

1458
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,743
This is accurate

1459
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,047
It's not

1460
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:55,423
When I first saw it on social media 80% chance that Alex

1461
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,447
Be tricked by the fake

1462
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,007
Exemption cards ever going around

1463
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,031
It looks like he has

1464
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:04,127
You should come as no surprise seeing as he had dr. Reba labo

1465
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,943
General stubblebine

1466
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:14,367
40 bucks a laminated don't vaccination card

1467
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,999
That goes deep

1468
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,071
Viral online

1469
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:23,839
Piece of paper

1470
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:30,239
There's no backing of the Department of Justice or the Ada to carrying this Garden

1471
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,567
We resulted in

1472
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,591
Whatsoever

1473
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,639
The card has a website on it

1474
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,455
Dftba

1475
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,991
God

1476
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:44,319
Dammit this is not a real entity and their website links

1477
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,367
That's already been taken down

1478
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:53,279
Is there a website in its original form

1479
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:58,655
It's just yet another right-wing Griff take advantage of you were scared about the

1480
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,215
But are also super weird and paranoid

1481
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,519
As it turns out there

1482
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:08,639
Another recently-created call Diante mask task force

1483
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:12,223
I guess they thought that their new name sounded better and was more conducive

1484
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,295
I'm pulling off this card hoax

1485
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,831
Oransi Max Casper

1486
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,879
I really

1487
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,671
What kind of has a ring to it

1488
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,207
Clayton

1489
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:27,071
So on the 23rd at Gavin McInnes

1490
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,351
Guy kicked off YouTube

1491
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,631
Navigate another gas

1492
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,655
Pancake toppings

1493
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,215
We got Carpe donktum who just died

1494
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,007
Trump's favorite meme maker

1495
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:37,055
Because he dare criticize CNN

1496
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,335
Show me giant

1497
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,127
Carpe donktum did not

1498
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:44,479
Twitter for daring to criticize CNN

1499
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,271
Copyright rules

1500
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
End up coming

1501
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:51,903
Completely derailing his life

1502
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,719
Manipulate couple of toddlers

1503
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:58,047
To create a parody of

1504
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,583
Make a CNN report out of it

1505
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:05,471
The video itself shows a black and white toddler recognizing each other and running towards each other to embrace

1506
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,751
Diversion that the dog

1507
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,311
Put out

1508
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,847
This is a CNN report

1509
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:15,455
Terrified toddler runs from racist baby

1510
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,503
Suggest that the white baby is

1511
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,527
Is a trump supporter

1512
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,831
The structure of the video is

1513
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,391
Like this is like

1514
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,695
CNN's report

1515
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,743
Story

1516
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:31,839
What the actual story is

1517
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,863
Then yes

1518
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,143
Very clever.

1519
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:43,871
My point because all they do is show the real story

1520
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:49,759
You don't need to you're the part where you're lying about

1521
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,319
Who cares about the second part

1522
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:56,415
You're missing my point well that's fine

1523
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,695
Although I disagree

1524
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:01,535
You're not even paying attention to my point which is why you're going to

1525
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:08,703
Basic level I can see how this could fall under the

1526
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,031
Suggested

1527
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,991
Heartwarming

1528
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,295
Human interest story where these two babies are friends

1529
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,855
The impression that the doc was hoping

1530
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,135
Recipes

1531
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,207
Is directly contradicted by reality

1532
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:33,023
Search fails to really be satire as much as it is just

1533
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,559
Race-baiting and white

1534
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,327
What propaganda

1535
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,631
You swear to

1536
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:41,727
See you if I could I would start a Consulting if anybody was in

1537
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,007
I would start at

1538
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,055
Consulting firm purely for

1539
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,335
Judges

1540
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,103
And alike

1541
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,943
Like I'll just be there I'll

1542
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,759
Just have complete written summaries of lice

1543
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,343
Is satire and then we can deal with the first

1544
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,647
Because like

1545
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,439
You know

1546
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,463
Still protected

1547
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,303
Exactly what I'm not saying he's a tire

1548
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,911
Guantes versiti Center

1549
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,727
It is knowing what is and is not satire

1550
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:20,127
Regardless of its quality for you

1551
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,151
Use myself

1552
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:26,271
Ultimately whether or not this video is that tire is probably the least of the doc's issues

1553
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,319
According to an article in Forbes

1554
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,159
The parents of the children are suing

1555
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:35,487
For using altered footage of their children

1556
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,279
Creative quotes

1557
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,303
Advertisement

1558
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,607
Political propaganda

1559
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:48,543
The fact that Twitter and Facebook disabled this fake video within 24 hours of President Trump in his campaign

1560
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,847
Coupled with Twitter permanently

1561
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,383
Is very strong evidence

1562
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,687
We find it

1563
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,991
People broke the law by using this video

1564
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:00,319
Is advertisement and political propaganda

1565
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:05,183
It's tough to say which direction this is going to break but even if the lawsuit isn't successful it's important

1566
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,487
Is a huge piece of s***

1567
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,767
And appearances of the

1568
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,095
A video to sports

1569
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,399
Don't want their kids being used like that

1570
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,679
Makes a lot of sense

1571
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,727
Real City

1572
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
My lawyer said

1573
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
Carpe donktum

1574
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,615
He put out but nobody

1575
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,247
I don't know

1576
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,015
Just going to go

1577
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:35,391
Yeah this is it this is one of those situations

1578
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,671
And where you know

1579
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
For a fact

1580
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,719
That it's wrong

1581
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,023
And then you go into the legal C

1582
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:41,791
System in your life

1583
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,583
I don't f****** know how they're going to

1584
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,119
DeWitt right right

1585
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,423
What the ship is going on with their head

1586
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,471
Is it

1587
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:54,591
Like how could you not be entitled to some sort of topical

1588
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,663
Your f****** like

1589
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,735
26 month old child is being used

1590
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,295
For purposes that are abhorrent

1591
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,575
Without your permission

1592
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,951
They cover the video they got permission

1593
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:13,279
Do use it

1594
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,071
Yeah yeah

1595
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:18,399
Really hope that there's a hammer coming down on me

1596
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:22,495
If they're the heroes take down as like let's start

1597
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,151
Alex

1598
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:35,039
Gets to Carpe donktum a little bit down the road

1599
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:35,807
Kudlow

1600
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,087
Who

1601
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:37,855
Used to work

1602
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
Governor Abbott

1603
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
Champagne

1604
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,231
But now works overnight

1605
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
Doing stocking

1606
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,791
H-E-B grocery

1607
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,559
Restore

1608
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,327
But doesn't

1609
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,607
Work there anymore because

1610
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,655
Cuz she refused to wear a mask and got fired

1611
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:51,935
I don't care

1612
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:56,543
This seems to me to be someone who was just there talk s*** about

1613
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:01,663
Governor Abbott and promote the upcoming I don't want to wear a mask March

1614
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,967
Rabbits

1615
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,271
She's on

1616
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,807
And

1617
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,343
They talked about this

1618
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
The situation

1619
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,135
Just weird

1620
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
Bonnie

1621
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,999
What do I met before out of second amendment rally

1622
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:25,983
HEB

1623
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:31,103
Asthma

1624
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,223
Oh yeah

1625
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,295
Pallets

1626
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,599
He's known for no workers comp

1627
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,159
Closest laborers you can get terrible company

1628
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,183
People

1629
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,487
Family know my back

1630
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,911
Did you recap the story

1631
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,727
Broken

1632
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,799
Dragging around the mask

1633
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,711
I have no idea what's true about the story about this woman being fired for not wearing a mask

1634
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,735
I have no idea

1635
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,039
If she is someone

1636
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,319
Example from wearing a mask

1637
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:15,647
Then I assume that she should have a pretty decent wrongful termination

1638
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,951
I'm playing but to go on is the

1639
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,743
But you said these things on Infowars

1640
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,791
Which isn't really fill me with a lot of coffee

1641
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,839
What I find more interest

1642
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:26,143
Thing is how detached from any real semblance of

1643
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,679
Suppose Alex is here

1644
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:32,543
He wants to evoke sympathy for cudlipp so he's talking about how H-E-B didn't pay her Workman

1645
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,823
But if I'm not with

1646
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,615
Position

1647
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,895
You shouldn't leave

1648
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,967
Employers should be required to pay that kind of compensation at all

1649
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,735
Absolutely

1650
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:44,575
Workers enter into a contract of employment aware of risks involved

1651
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:48,415
Forcing an employer to pay for any clumsiness or carelessness of his

1652
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,463
Boys that's an undue burden and it's

1653
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,255
The breach of the freedom of Association

1654
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,863
His professed libertarian ideas should make it believe that Bonnie had no right

1655
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,655
To the job that she wasn't doing it to

1656
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,191
To the satisfaction of require

1657
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,751
She entered into the contract with the employer

1658
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:05,311
And she breached the terms of it by refusing to wear masks

1659
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,847
H-E-B with a

1660
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,639
Absolutely within their right to fire her

1661
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,199
Who's one of the reasons that libertarianism

1662
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,991
Pretty tough to defend the real world

1663
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:18,623
I would stand by his principles that he pretends to have

1664
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,159
Even if she's very sympathetic

1665
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,183
Has a broken foot

1666
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:25,791
The very safety nets that we have to protect someone for being unjustly fired or

1667
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,351
A company to pay for on-the-job injury

1668
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,911
It only exists because of the work of people Alex

1669
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,191
Who called demonic globalist

1670
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:32,959
Communist

1671
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,751
Go f*** yourself Alex

1672
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:37,311
You want to live in the world that your enemies create

1673
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,847
That's why you live in Austin

1674
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,151
Dumb assholes

1675
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,455
No it's it's like when my oldest brother

1676
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,735
Was on unemployment

1677
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,527
This started

1678
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,087
Then then shut the fuk up

1679
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,391
You never get to speaker

1680
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:55,487
Sherry

1681
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,535
Social safety net

1682
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,839
Thank God I had this unemployment

1683
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,375
Check to help me get through this

1684
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,911
And then what

1685
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,983
You said thinking well other people

1686
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,519
If they go through this

1687
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:11,615
They deserve that same kind of thing and then all the sudden every

1688
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,895
Conservative

1689
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:14,687
Is over

1690
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:17,503
Do it for me

1691
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,551
Everybody else

1692
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:23,135
The man's Workman comps

1693
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,159
And

1694
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,719
And

1695
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,535
Protection

1696
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,351
You don't believe in any of that stuff Alex

1697
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,143
Supposed to

1698
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
Yeah

1699
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,447
Socialist

1700
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:38,495
For me and my wife

1701
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,775
And no one else

1702
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,799
So

1703
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:46,687
I don't care about their interview about her being fired or anything like that

1704
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,967
So I don't have

1705
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,735
Any

1706
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:51,551
Prospectors on it outside what's presented

1707
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,415
I can't really work

1708
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,439
I don't even trust

1709
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,719
But she's got an actual broken foot

1710
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,559
I don't believe anything

1711
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,375
Carpe donktum and it's just like

1712
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,703
If they can take me out they can take anybody out

1713
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,543
I don't know about that

1714
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,567
Top of the list

1715
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,592
Stopped out

1716
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,920
Spartacus

1717
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,224
Whatever.

1718
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,576
Just last week

1719
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,136
Playing phone tag

1720
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,304
Wawa big national news story breaking

1721
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,328
Yesterday

1722
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:36,864
Dumb dumb

1723
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,936
Video

1724
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:44,032
You got to go

1725
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,824
Reproductive health

1726
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,920
2nd channel on Pandora

1727
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:56,320
Catalano for rent

1728
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:04,256
Everybody cares real hard this is another one of those things or just feels like Alex is trying to cash in on some sort of

1729
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,304
Attention of these people have like a

1730
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,632
Flickr there's a little bit of a window where it's like

1731
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,400
And even

1732
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,936
Carpe donktum says something

1733
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,960
To be effective like

1734
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:16,032
It's really nice to talk to you whenever there is chaos

1735
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,848
And it feels like yeah

1736
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,616
The only

1737
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:22,944
Anytime that you are valuable to Alex Isley

1738
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,552
From something

1739
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,856
Knowing what's going on artist salary

1740
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,880
He somewhat oblivious

1741
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,440
Like he's aware so unconsciously of the

1742
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:37,024
The pattern gets hard to tell it could be annoying

1743
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,608
You keep doing this

1744
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,888
You know hey

1745
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:48,544
The lights the Whirlwind it's always nice to take time out of my day to talk to you

1746
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,312
I found

1747
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,360
To be a little bit telling whatever the

1748
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,384
Intention of it was

1749
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:57,504
So you got it already has

1750
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
That's great

1751
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,832
Discusses this

1752
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,904
This is why I quit but I have cuz he just

1753
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,928
Interviews Larry Payne

1754
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:07,744
Anthony the guy from the Black Panther

1755
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,536
Nope

1756
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,352
It's just the 2:30 yelling about Patriots

1757
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,632
Patriotism

1758
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,080
It's been talking about like Banta

1759
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,408
Musically admits why

1760
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,992
You censoring everybody on his own websites

1761
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,808
Anybody want to channel

1762
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,856
That is a known quantity

1763
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,976
The Forum on their words like

1764
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,792
Section 230

1765
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:47,168
So he understands that if he opened up his platform the way that

1766
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:49,472
Large corporations and large

1767
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,008
Online

1768
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:51,776
You would get sued

1769
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,568
And

1770
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,128
He knows that in order for that to happen

1771
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,920
He has to censor content by

1772
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:01,760
Not even allowing people to upload stuff onto there

1773
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:07,392
For his own space

1774
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,720
Willfully

1775
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,768
About stuff

1776
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:14,816
Solenoid

1777
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,120
It's very nice

1778
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,704
Who keeps shity videos like the man

1779
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,520
I think it's actually kind of a good sign

1780
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:25,056
Because I think it means if people just

1781
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:25,824
Don't give a s***

1782
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,272
Conditional breakspot

1783
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:39,392
Anyway that brings us to the end of this

1784
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,184
I found these couple days

1785
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:42,976
Yeah

1786
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,512
Really bad

1787
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:45,280
Just

1788
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
Just a

1789
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,584
F******

1790
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:50,400
Sahara Desert

1791
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,960
Care about any of these dicks come on

1792
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,992
Alligator

1793
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,784
But this Facebook.

1794
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,576
Cognizant guy trying to run

1795
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:13,184
Hey he's going to be testifying in front of Congress

1796
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,488
She broke her foot

1797
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:18,560
It just all seems very desperate and it steals

1798
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:22,144
Attention-grabbing abedin with the

1799
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,984
The we can't breathe website in March and all this stuff

1800
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,032
Just feels like this show

1801
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,336
It doesn't always feel like this

1802
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:33,152
This stretch time particularly just really feels like

1803
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,688
Impotent weak trolling

1804
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,832
Not interesting at all

1805
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,624
The first time that they really did

1806
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,416
Get together in a writers room and like

1807
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,696
Toss around ideas

1808
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,232
Said all of the ideas were like

1809
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:50,048
He's got a little heat on and let's bring him on the show

1810
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:50,816
That's it

1811
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,864
Yeah and also

1812
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,424
How could we be more

1813
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,192
Racist

1814
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,472
And defensive

1815
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,752
Let's just

1816
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,776
Brainstorm ways

1817
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:06,176
And let's not check and see if we can't breathe is already the name of something there's no way anyone else could

1818
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,200
Should have thought of this

1819
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,992
Where your info

1820
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,528
Where's the tip of the spear

1821
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:11,808
Holy Ship

1822
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,600
I pray for

1823
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,928
Metaphorically

1824
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,696
22

1825
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:20,768
You create some Greenery

1826
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:24,096
Before you go

1827
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,632
I'd be funny if they were praying for rain

1828
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,520
On Monday for another episode but until then

1829
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,080
Wave website

1830
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,872
I got to get knowledge fight. News

1831
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:43,808
Like I should ask him for

1832
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,720
Don't think that would go well

1833
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:51,744
I think that would break

1834
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,584
No interfering with

1835
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,192
Observations experiment

1836
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,472
Lettuce

1837
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,520
Right but he should of course he should

1838
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:07,616
I feel like this might be a point where I could break it on Intervention

1839
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,664
Do you think this is

1840
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,992
Entire campaign

1841
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:13,760
Coward

1842
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:17,344
Why don't you

1843
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:21,184
Yeah

1844
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,232
Criticized him for

1845
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,000
However

1846
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,024
This would be fun

1847
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,400
Exactly

1848
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:37,824
Together with the word cuz we would have absolutely no intention

1849
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:45,504
I'm going to say we're not going to do this but keep it on the back burner and paint

1850
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,856
Maybe we should have that is like an outrageous patreon goal

1851
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,904
Subway

1852
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:57,792
We are not go to bed

1853
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:58,816
Carpe donktum

1854
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,096
Which is now available

1855
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,144
We're also on Facebook

1856
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:08,544
ITunes

1857
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,848
In your area support a bail fund support

1858
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,384
Something along those lines were people doing

1859
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,272
Ice Cube

1860
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,392
Alex

1861
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,416
Birthstone colors
