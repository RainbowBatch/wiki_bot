1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
A little bit about

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,120
Drones

6
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:13,984
Have you ever been to a lively

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Have you ever

8
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
No

9
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,568
No Irene

10
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Have to say I don't like reggae at all

11
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
Nothing

12
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
I respect

13
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,904
Today's good music to South people

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
Alright not because

15
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,744
Way to relax

16
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,816
It's relax

17
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,400
I do not care for hot chili

18
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,728
You don't like any of that makes me really nervous

19
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
That makes

20
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
Perfect

21
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
It's perfect sense position that was kind of

22
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,016
Anti with a lot of people I know and people around me just like

23
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
Reggae mix me

24
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
Like just kind of anxious because of the music the music so laid-back

25
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
Around you

26
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
October

27
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
2in to reggae I also

28
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,640
That's larger personality issues

29
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
PennDOT

30
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,504
I I I can I can

31
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Appreciate it

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,624
I'm not using it as an art show

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
For the way my head processes

34
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,840
It's just to chill man could not make more sense that the chili the music

35
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,936
That is a perfect encapsulation of why we all

36
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,496
Should you be worried about something Bob Marley

37
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,384
Flhtk

38
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:04,576
No it is not sorry about so this if I guess right do not process reggae well but

39
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
Do know a lot about Alex Jones

40
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
And I don't know much

41
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:12,256
Too bad either special episode

42
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,816
It said it seemed to required

43
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,376
Because of the events going on in the world

44
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
We had to

45
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
You know there was a killing of qassamsoleimani

46
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
January

47
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
Aaron shots of missiles

48
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,016
Targets in Iraq

49
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,856
Not knowing exactly what was going to happen was Trump going to

50
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
I wanted to check back in because

51
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
I thought it would be pretty important

52
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
The cover of the January 8th

53
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
Episode where Alex

54
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,168
Who's responding to denied priors

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,496
Rocking to The

56
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,080
But I knew that by Monday probably something else was going to happen

57
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,176
And this is going to be sort of filtered and processed out so I felt like

58
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,248
Exactly the reason we leave these Fridays open

59
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
In this way this is exactly what it

60
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
So

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
So today we got a little special Friday episode for you before we get out of business on this

62
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
The folks who make

63
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
Episodes like this possible

64
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Weird

65
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
Alright here we go 2020 also because this is a special episode they're putting out Oscar

66
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
Additional to the end of the episode to try and help us

67
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,319
A little bit closer to current absolute

68
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623

Text Jake ice I think

77
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
Very close to Jay geils who had a band

78
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,487
The centerfold

79
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,935
Are you not a game

80
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:36,127
Thank you too

81
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,687
You are now

82
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,247
And radically

83
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Yes yes

84
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
And write a clue thank you so much

85
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
You are now attacking

86
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703
Money off that heroin

87
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
Are you pimp so good

88
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
Freakishly large

89
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,967
Thank you so much.

90
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,647
Score with these gents website

91
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
DeBary

92
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Jordan

93
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,023
I do not know what exactly I was going to

94
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
Encounter looking in on the 8th

95
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Alex's

96
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
Coverage has been all over

97
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
The place

98
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
It's been very bizarre

99
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Sort of

100
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,383
Holocaust denial aside

101
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Absolutely

102
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:47,039
He had Alex being a kiss is a bold move and then

103
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,671
Waffling around a little bit on the 7th he's trying to blame Mike Pompeo for everyone

104
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:57,279
I didn't know what his angle was going to be after 1

105
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,631
Retaliate

106
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Tubidy respond

107
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,751
Sure Alex is on Trump

108
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Gave his speech

109
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
Sort of

110
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
Ramblin slurring

111
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,247
Some have described it that way

112
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,319
So Alex discusses

113
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
This speech

114
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
At the beginning of the show

115
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
The president just about

116
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
5 minutes ago

117
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
Completed a lengthy

118
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
About 45 minutes

119
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,215
Where he attempted to deescalate the situation with Iran

120
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,847
Stop playing large excerpts of that speech today

121
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,663
So Alex thinks it was a 40-minute speech

122
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,527
How long was it was like 10 minutes or so

123
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,927
Alex

124
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,743
Situation he just thinks it was a super long speech

125
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,095
Good to know he prepares sure sure

126
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
That's just a good

127
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,679
Indication of how much he gives a f***

128
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,495
About what's going on in the past

129
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,359
Years I've heard Trump speak for the longest concurrent length

130
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
The time was two-and-a-half minutes

131
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
And that felt like 45 tonight

132
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
I will give him that shirt

133
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,295
It does time dilates a little bit

134
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Breaks down

135
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
It's okay for you to not listen

136
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,463
To that much or Trump because you're not a guy with an audience

137
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,303
Screams about how great Trump is and how everybody should bring back

138
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
America in all this

139
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
Alex is kind of an obligation to listen to

140
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
They have nbnm

141
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
So does know what

142
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,287
He's actually saying sure he's cheerleading the guy

143
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
Bear butt

144
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
Oh well

145
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,407
Alex

146
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,991
The speech he brings up something the Trump says in the speech

147
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
Should be in favor of

148
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
But he does

149
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
Seem to be a little bit weird

150
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
Hey you did you get a lot of money

151
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
Are in Europe

152
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
You're a lot closer to this problem you need to come in and you need to pay for it and you need to stabilize the Strait of Hormuz

153
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
Weed should be there paying for it

154
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Where energy

155
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
Independently an out-of-state

156
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,759
So Alex is saying that it's a good thing for Trump to call it for NATO to take care of the situation

157
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,159
He should be staunchly opposed to International bodies resolving these

158
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,047
Make no sense you believe that NATO is the right to intercede at all

159
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
What are the International Community has a responsibility towards each and every one of us in order

160
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
He doesn't believe he doesn't know he's kind of countries to the unelected

161
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,919
International border globalist coming in and battling

162
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Because it's somehow

163
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,599
Extricate strup from some nonsense user is all in favor of

164
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
And all of those people control you probably lateral

165
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,351
So we sang the Builder grouper group should take over Iran that's what he say

166
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,959
NATO to get much more involved in the Middle East process

167
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
His ankle is pretty much exactly the same as Alex's

168
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,871
Like we're only interested in the Middle East because of energy-related concerns

169
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,455
And we don't really care too much now they were supposedly energy

170
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,039
And that's some sick s*** that gives a glimpse into how these people think

171
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,599
Let's sing the loud

172
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,927
You couldn't even get away with being dad albeit

173
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
It's absolutely not a surprise to learn his deposition Trump

174
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,815
But Alex would probably think a little more about the Opera

175
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,655
Sexier he made a large part of his career by screaming about out bushing

176
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,983
His cronies were evil to carry out these wars in the Middle East for oil

177
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
Now he's totally fine with Trump basically saying

178
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,223
I kind of see a whole lot of face-saving going on here it's all pretty thin and full of s***

179
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
But honestly it's probably the best thing

180
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
To do

181
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
Attorney for Trump or

182
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,559
The two of them like rattling Sabers or militarily respond

183
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
I kind of prefer the idea of them just talkin dumb s*** yeah might be the least damaging

184
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
Of the options that people like them or

185
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Capable

186
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,919
They're they're kind of acting right now like the guy who

187
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
Is is like

188
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,783
Really grabbing his friends going I called me back hold me back

189
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
And they're not there like

190
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
You are f****** crazy man

191
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,695
Yeah it does whatever it is

192
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
The fields

193
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Today in the news

194
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Black

195
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
Silex likes what he perceives

196
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
To be a joke

197
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
I don't know if

198
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Did Mike

199
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,031
Let's Make a Deal our missiles are bigger than yours he actually said that

200
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,711
He's really smart

201
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
Nordschleife

202
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:16,255
I'm pretty sure that this is exactly the same sort of s*** Trump was doing with Kim Jeong hoon and we see how fruitful that was

203
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Yeah

204
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
I don't know what to think here

205
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,191
Like in the case of a very tense World situation out seems thrilled that the president of his country is making

206
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Make jokes

207
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,359
Baffling that is analysis is taken series by anyone in the situation that were in

208
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,919
Guess so everybody wanted a president

209
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271
Got a big old dog

210
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Fiddling as the world burn

211
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,415
Just baked a picture take a picture of the world Birds

212
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
That's my job dammit

213
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,071
Trump speech and I don't think he was making a picture

214
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,959
I think it was more of a

215
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
Threat than anything else

216
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,335
Also Trump announced quote punishing economic sanction

217
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
In addition to the sanctions that are already there

218
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
This will largely Alex knows that

219
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,343
I know that he knows that because he's yelled about sanctions killing the Rockies

220
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
These many many times in the past

221
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
When doing so is healthy

222
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
Tumatak Madeleine Albright

223
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,999
Alex knows damn well what Trump is doing

224
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,559
Engaging an economic Warfare that'll tend to hurt

225
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
And killed civilians in Iraq

226
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
But he doesn't care

227
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
You'd rather

228
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
Focus on an imaginary picture

229
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
I

230
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
Really f***** up by that

231
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
If a economic Williamson thing

232
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Because of the way that the world works

233
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,967
And I'm not some sort of expert and I don't know

234
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,295
But it seems really obviously f***** up

235
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
To me that

236
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Everybody goes

237
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
A******

238
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
If

239
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
We if Trump murders a guy

240
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:55,071
But everybody's like well it's the safe option if he imposes economic sanctions that are going to murder rig

241
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Like

242
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Fox me up

243
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,935
If that's the case

244
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,335
There's that distance that people can take who's like the idea of the sanctions to punish the people in power

245
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
Maybe there'd be a stronger argument for it but it doesn't

246
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
Seems like that's the way it works track

247
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Yeah

248
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,599
So I think all Alex's done is read a drudge headline

249
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
About

250
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
The speech because he

251
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
That's the only thing

252
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
You can really say

253
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
Well I'd say drudgereport.com is the best of the minute

254
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,679
Global newspaper headlines

255
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,615
Trump speech about 12 minutes of them

256
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,175
Live feed of the White House collector nearly up

257
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Way to say everybody

258
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Winter White House

259
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,087
So In that clip Alex revealed he has no idea how long Trump speech

260
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,415
B12

261
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,767
It was much shorter so try to save things by saying there's a half-hour static shot of the podium

262
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
I guess

263
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,959
Is he implying that he watched the podium for 30 minutes and considered it a part of the speech

264
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,031
Is a clear indication that he just seen these headlines on

265
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,335
We got on Aaron was making things up

266
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Also

267
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
Even though Alex is making a correction here he's also make

268
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
A new error

269
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
He sang the Trump was speaking for the winter White House

270
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
Which is Mar-A-Lago

271
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Cows

272
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Alex should be ashamed of himself

273
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
Calling one jumps

274
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Properties of winter white

275
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
What would Thomas Jefferson think about something like that

276
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
What would they write in

277
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:36,447
The Federalist Papers about an aristocratic sending to the presidency has properties

278
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
The US government

279
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
I'd suspect

280
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,127
He would not be able to Intuit and I would love to make up a quote

281
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:49,759
Then come on everybody knows that when they were writing those papers and then the Constitution and all that's

282
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,063
They were really just sad

283
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
Nope I got it they f****** hate

284
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,487
Trump all of them except for like Madison he was weirdly into that s***

285
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,887
Adams John Adams

286
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,935
Monica some of those guys were

287
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
Samba cryptominer

288
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Yeah but

289
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Jefferson would have been very again

290
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,103
I assume that anybody who

291
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,455
You've never heard of before get cited by Oath Keepers like

292
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
Tench coxe

293
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,063
He would be into it

294
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
The weirdos from the Revolutionary War

295
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,207
So this is all been kind of Prelude

296
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
This is all Alex responding

297
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
The Trump speech

298
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
Kind of

299
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
Talk about news stuff

300
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
It's not really what's important

301
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,007
Is as Alex gets into the second segment of his show

302
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
He launches into

303
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
A profoundly islamophobic

304
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Forno

305
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
He dives into

306
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
I hate you

307
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
VIP spirals out of

308
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Control and will

309
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,135
Come back up later in the episode

310
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,743
And leads me down a bit of a road that will

311
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
From volcanoes

312
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:09,375
There is some stuff that I think is interesting and and worth noting

313
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,983
But as this goes along I ended up going down a couple of Road

314
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
That will lead us to some very interesting

315
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,359
Information but before we get there

316
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,919
We just got here Alex be a bigot

317
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,479
And the left that's always telling us that

318
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,783
America's bad Christianity's bad

319
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
We oppress women sick of it

320
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,951
Anticlea worshiping something that basically put garbage bags over

321
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
Fundamentally

322
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Scares me

323
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
Pisses me off it makes me

324
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Revile

325
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,959
So you get a sense here that Alex is starting off this Ranch

326
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,543
I am scared of Islam

327
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,335
Rizzial

328
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
Right I hate it

329
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,431
That is mainly because of wardrobe

330
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
That is that is a big part of it

331
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Yeah

332
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
I was wondering why is

333
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:06,207
Is he going off into this why is he starting this up I understand that there's a conflict in the Middle East that is a hot-button issue

334
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,023
But if you went to that pool supply store again didn't they

335
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,863
You did not just point it but you're very close

336
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
I live in Austin

337
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
I went last night after I got off air

338
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
At 9

339
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
And

340
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Gregory sand

341
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
Took over

342
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,199
Pulled into a mom-and-pop hamburger place

343
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Unreal

344
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,295
There wasn't one group of Muslims in there

345
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,111
There were two groups on separate sides

346
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
And a place I've been eating hamburgers

347
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Since I was

348
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
5 years old

349
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,583
To Dan's Hamburgers

350
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,167
Ben White and Manchaca

351
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
I hate those people

352
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Yes it is

353
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,103
It's that anywhere Islam become 10% of the population

354
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
They began pushing

355
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
Everyone else out

356
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
Not if they began conquering that

357
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:04,575
So Alex is a complete intolerance toward seeing Muslims in public

358
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
As you mentioned

359
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
We've trimmed

360
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,719
Discussing Muslim women in pool supply shop

361
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,839
2015 children I think it was teams

362
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:20,191
I'm not I don't remember if you was very specific about the age of the people but

363
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
Whatever the case now easy that he hates

364
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,543
Sissy Muslims at a hamburger place that he likes

365
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
He doesn't want to live in a world where groups

366
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
He doesn't like

367
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
2xist in public spaces

368
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
It's just that simple with them

369
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:38,623
This 10% thing seems to track back to a book written by a missionary named Peter Hammond called slavery terrorism

370
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,999
The point of the book appears to be the country's need to keep their Muslim population under 2%

371
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,351
Because if that number gets any higher the Muslim start to act in predictable.

372
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
Disruptive ways

373
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,727
I read a breakdown of the book and it's not even an idea worth engaged

374
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,543
Mostly because it makes no sense on its face

375
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,919
Hammond is arguing their various levels at which Muslim populations will begin acting differently

376
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,991
Like at 2% they start to make Street in prison gang

377
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551
Or it's 5% they push for supermarkets

378
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
Stauffer Halal option

379
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
Event list countries Ani

380
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
Each level

381
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,207
And it makes his point make no sense at all

382
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,815
It is break down the US is listed as 70.6% Muslim population

383
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
A really big halal food

384
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:26,751
In this country

385
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
That not be happening yet

386
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
I'd like the

387
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,015
I don't know when it was written by don't think it was

388
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
It wasn't long enough

389
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087
It wasn't like

390
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,927
It cuz it sounds to me like he's trying to be the islamophobic

391
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:51,327
Harry Seldon from Isaac asimov's Foundation I'm not positive that this is where this idea

392
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,655
Yeah but it's definitely something that's reference

393
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,727
On a lot of these blogs you can find

394
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,543
Cover this this 10% idea

395
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
Still linked back to his bookcase

396
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,151
As a source I assume he has really

397
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
Quality

398
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
Sourcing and all of his

399
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,551
If you follow up on him

400
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,879
I'm sure they all make sense these distinctions

401
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
Between the categories of 2% percent tip

402
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
It's all meaningless stuff

403
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
Because the bigger issue is due at Hammond is doing is taking

404
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
Very like

405
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Very comfy

406
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,400
Located situations in different countries and different regions

407
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,216
He's boiling it down to a single variable

408
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
It is

409
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
How many Muslims are there

410
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:37,152
It's the sort of argument that plays really well in like white nationalist in Christian identity extremist circles

411
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,760
Serious person would even consider that theory is having the second

412
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Thought

413
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,576
What you see here Alex is except

414
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
Accepted that is true

415
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,464
It's just a reality to him that if your country goes to a 10% Muslim population there

416
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
Start taking over and putting in Sharia law

417
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,144
This is gross rhetoric and the end result of this kind of thinking has to either lead to extermination

418
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Dislocation

419
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Or eugenics

420
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
It's program

421
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:06,080
Alex isn't stupid enough not to realize that he's just fine with those things being directed towards people

422
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
He doesn't want to see what he's trying to get a hamburger

423
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
I mean yeah sure

424
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
You can look

425
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:18,368
Directly at the interconnectedness of all of these different countries in their individual context

426
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:24,512
Histories and all of that stuff and consider on a Nuance level what it is that it means and how it really is

427
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
The different spaces

428
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
Or dad

429
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,608
You could

430
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,472
Estimate how many Muslims there are in a place and make long and stupid pronouncements about

431
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,520
You could which is easier

432
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Right

433
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,408
The problem for Alex's that Islam is expansionist

434
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Or something

435
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,760
He cites a reference for that.

436
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Expanding

437
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,136
Thousand Years

438
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
Almost lost Europe to it

439
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,768
Holy Roman Empire

440
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,096
Taking over the men killed one and put on slave ships

441
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,632
And sold all of the world

442
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
It's a group conference

443
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,800
Does Alex not realize what he's saying here

444
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:15,456
Why do they think that turkey was part of the Holy Roman Empire it before you answer let's focus on that word empire

445
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,016
I understand what was it before

446
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
So

447
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,880
So turkey used to be part of the Holy Roman Emperor

448
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,976
While still maintaining its status as a sovereign state

449
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:32,096
She's good

450
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
You know

451
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
There weren't any more worlds

452
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,752
To conquer and it turned out there were so Alexander wasn't that great in the first

453
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
This is

454
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,872
If this is your argument this is what it goes back to you need to

455
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
Stop

456
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:52,576
250,000 years ago in the mitochondrial eve are birds from whatever

457
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:58,976
Play she's coming from that was when she was taken over by his evil

458
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
F*** off

459
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
Just f*** off

460
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
Oh these are so

461
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
Such thin arguments

462
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472
Is we could go case-by-case

463
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,008
All of these places

464
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,544
Trace it back to

465
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,616
Love it where do we want to go

466
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,176
That would literally take us all day

467
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
Between the Tigers

468
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:24,576
Euphrates there was a part of me that was like looking at that dude's book

469
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:30,976
10% number

470
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
Complexity

471
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,120
Now I will just end up having to explain literally all of world history

472
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
We got him

473
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
So

474
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
Here we go

475
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Alex

476
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
Even know how to

477
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
Describe this this is

478
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
Beyond

479
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
The pale kind of

480
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Bulshit

481
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
It's a group conquering people

482
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
And they're very

483
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
Alright The Roommate

484
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,000
I was against the Warriors going in the Middle East

485
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,072
Removing people that

486
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
A lot better than what the global for putting in

487
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:14,240
Wanted to destabilize Islam to break it for Radicals in

488
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
Have been used as a weapon against the West

489
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,128
This is a very sophisticated problem we face

490
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
But

491
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Give me like

492
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
If I would say

493
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
Jewish

494
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
This is going to go well

495
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,768
Germany was 1939 Germany and I was another country

496
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
Here-we-go Parish in Oneonta

497
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,376
Restaurant that there's a couple Nazis in there

498
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:49,056
I would argue it's not similar at all and days before the Steve pieczenik on tonight

499
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
Thought so calm down this b*******

500
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,944
This isn't same levels of

501
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,016
Say you get afraid of people who

502
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,808
Don't look and act like you

503
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:06,208
I don't even hear any of this poor thing he said I'm scared of

504
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:13,632
Justify it with this b******* justify it and he's also trying to rationalize why him being afraid

505
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
Hey doesn't make him weak

506
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:21,312
It's going on giant cowardin you're afraid of engaging with people different than you

507
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:27,200
So you go on this weird wild nonsense and you makeup b******* right order to justify the fact that you

508
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,040
You alone with white people

509
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
In a nation of them

510
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
Jesus

511
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,464
But the thing is that Alex is recognizing some differences

512
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
In the world

513
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,816
And that is it now he goes to hamburger shop

514
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Macy's Muslim

515
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
Where is in the past

516
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,936
He didn't I mean it at McDonald's

517
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
Dan

518
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:53,312
I cannot my hamburgers yet

519
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,432
Mall

520
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,040
Sometimes it'll be at night

521
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,088
Lemon in full Marcus

522
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,184
Restaurants on Route

523
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,096
My daughters in the Muslims are looking at my daughter's cuz they're not wearing the jibs and their women have

524
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Cool

525
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Face mask

526
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,776
Darien Halloween costumes

527
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Will f*** you

528
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
I don't like it

529
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,664
You don't like

530
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,248
Do you think there's a possibility that

531
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Alex

532
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Is

533
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:40,160
So singularly focused and bigoted towards Muslims now in a way that he wasn't before

534
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,976
So now he notices them in public

535
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
Then he did before

536
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,048
Do you think it's possible that

537
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:51,168
Maybe there maybe there are more Muslims around maybe that's possible

538
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,824
But maybe they didn't anger him in the same way 10 years ago

539
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,664
Mattress stores every around here but when I got them at the store

540
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,760
I don't even know where mattresses anymore even better example

541
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,832
I didn't notice how many mattress stores there were until someone

542
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:15,232
Made a joke around me about how many mattress stores they were that I started noticing everyone with Plex

543
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Hanging around with a bunch of

544
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:21,120
Goddamn aggressively islamophobic

545
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Certainly gone

546
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
Much farther down that pathway

547
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
10 years ago

548
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,520
Who is every single

549
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:31,360
Time he sees a Muslim it's a threat to him where is before it wasn't

550
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
This is not

551
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
Good thinking on your part

552
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
No

553
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,736
So cute

554
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,832
And the thing that bugs me out is that maybe there's no better example

555
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,624
Or

556
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,440
Like representation of

557
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,512
A culture assimilating into America

558
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,304
Then going and hanging out at all

559
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,632
Ifucking ball America's

560
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,960
Shittiest export and if you're there you're in

561
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,520
That's an important here in a second

562
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
And one salad

563
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
Talks

564
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
This is just

565
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,688
I mean it's

566
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
I can't really

567
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
Introduce these clips

568
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
In any other way than

569
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Colon

570
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
The next clip

571
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
Preemptive like just harsh

572
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
Condemnation

573
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
No.

574
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,280
Here's what Alex has to say

575
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,352
We don't wear Halloween costumes in America

576
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
Halloween

577
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
We don't make women wear bags over their heads

578
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,104
Promoting it

579
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,712
Face mask

580
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
None

581
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
How do you feel about none

582
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:59,936
Is that the real threat is the oldest border and Trump's been trying to shut the mass of Islam

583
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:12,736
Were they live in the Stone Age

584
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:19,648
It's important to remember that would spark this rant is Alex talk about seeing two groups of people he assumed

585
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,416
We're Muslims

586
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,464
Hamburger place the night before

587
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,768
He's talked about how these people need to go back

588
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
To their countries

589
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,120
And more important to Alex stay out of his country

590
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,448
He's not talking about anyone is guilty the sort of behaviors he's describing

591
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
Killing women or pedophilia

592
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,824
This is the response that he has two people he assumes are Muslims

593
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
Being in a restaurant

594
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
This is he

595
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,712
Deep level of bigotry and I want to say

596
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
From my assessment

597
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
From everything that I

598
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
No from listening to so much Alex

599
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,648
This is the real Alex Jones

600
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,952
Weak scared and hateful

601
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
Yep he's unable to

602
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:59,328
Enjoy his food because he's around people who are members of a he doesn't like

603
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
He's terrified to see

604
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,448
The people who don't look like a live a different way than he does allowed to eat

605
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,728
Existing Society

606
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,776
It's a childish seething rage

607
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,824
And you should be embarrassed by heart rate

608
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
Apparently pathetic

609
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,272
You always wondered

610
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
Like

611
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
How is it

612
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,368
That somebody could be

613
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
In the 19

614
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
And

615
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
So

616
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Urea

617
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,536
That a black person just wants to eat at a restaurant

618
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Weird

619
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,608
How is that possible

620
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
Alex

621
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:37,216
So crazy to me and then it's 2019 and Alex's doing it

622
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
I'm like

623
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
Oh it's just cuz you're a f******

624
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
Coward your age

625
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
F******

626
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
Pathetic

627
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,200
Weak Health worthless human being

628
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:54,368
Is that your Civil Rights era probably would have been able to make very similar arguments that that Alex is making

629
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:58,720
Of course

630
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:04,864
We don't do that to our women.

631
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,424
We can't allow that to happen

632
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
None of this stuff isn't

633
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,032
Did you get the thing I do I do think

634
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
Doesn't real

635
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,616
That somebody is feeding and poison into your spitting

636
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Get back up at us but

637
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:20,224
But he's feeding it to himself as friends are free to go

638
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,808
Then you added his supplements

639
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
What is an olive

640
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,952
So when Alex gets back from that break

641
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,512
Picky recognizes I want a little bit hard

642
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:39,168
That was a little bit of Thanksgiving

643
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,752
Spy trying to address for Saturday just went on a islamophobic

644
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:49,408
I needed to go to beginning of Trumps

645
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,480
About the islamification of the last

646
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,040
Thanks just are not compatible

647
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,320
And now they're not

648
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,184
Our ways are trying to make us about their ways and it's a fact

649
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,744
I completely reject Alex's argument

650
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,608
About these Muslims just making whatever he thinks our ways are

651
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
And your

652
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,240
Totally right exactly that's the reason

653
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
That's the reason

654
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,080
Because when he gets the most mad at specific Muslim

655
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,152
It's generally a situation situation where he sees Muslim

656
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
Integrated

657
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,736
He yells abstractly about Muslims and Islam

658
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,784
In general quite a bit

659
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,368
But there's something different and more intense about these rent that he goes on

660
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
What do you seize

661
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,208
Like Muslim women at the pool supply shop

662
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,744
Them at the hamburger store

663
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
This is the thing

664
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,864
Alex wants a holy war between Islam and Christianity

665
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:45,472
He wants a new Crusade but he knows that in the modern civilized world

666
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
Create

667
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,824
Constant narratives about Islam begin

668
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,848
Compatible with the West

669
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,152
A picture that they're already

670
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
In a holy war against

671
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
Him

672
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:59,040
This is why Muslims in a pool supply shop or a hamburger stand

673
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
Completely fuk him up

674
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
It's because there proof that Muslims are

675
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,416
Perfectly compatible with our way of life

676
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:11,072
When Alex sees Muslims engaging in the exact same behaviors as he himself is engaging in a strong indication that

677
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,120
Distance is not only possible but it's

678
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Happening

679
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:18,496
And that's threatening to his believe in and desire for civilizational level

680
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:22,592
Alex isn't really mad when he sees news of his Islamic

681
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,128
Extremist carrying out like

682
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
What's a knife attack in the UK

683
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
That can

684
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:32,576
They are that conform to this world

685
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
He can use that

686
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,904
What infuriates him is things like this

687
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
Muslims getting a

688
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,208
Hamburger

689
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
He's a pathetic

690
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,048
Sack of s*** this is disgusting

691
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Where is the heart

692
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
White nationalism

693
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:51,264
Railing against it's not possible for them to assimilate and then when they do they're like

694
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Bien

695
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
But Sir Alex

696
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,344
Onaga

697
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
That would be racist

698
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
Just for you to say that hehe

699
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
I would bake

700
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
To differ with his assassin

701
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
Except for part of it

702
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
Like

703
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
The first part

704
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
I disagree

705
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
Second part of the statement

706
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Completely gray

707
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Concur

708
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,592
Well I don't agree with the last part but I do agree that he's scared

709
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
He's very scared

710
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
He also hates

711
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,944
Oh yeah

712
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,504
Muslims are really bad

713
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Alex

714
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
Right but there's some people worse

715
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
And I think I might

716
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:48,096
Ideology and political Islam it's expensive it's a lot better

717
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,912
Then the left hey

718
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,240
Islam is better than

719
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
Call te Clapton

720
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,432
The Americas well if you're watching Hollywood

721
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Over there

722
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
Culture

723
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,904
Suggested Monday talk about that

724
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,256
Stuff they're not talking about movies they're talking about foreign policy

725
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Not is

726
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,120
Petty and stupid as him like Alex

727
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,680
Gets bogged down and cultural issues

728
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:28,288
Petty grievances about women in lead roles in movies and Shay

729
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
That's not

730
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,152
I think they're operating off of its

731
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,968
What we have done to the Middle East in the past

732
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,760
20 years

733
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,064
But have you seen Oblivion

734
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
So Alex is

735
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,952
Sing a bit about how Islam hasn't

736
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
Evil spirit

737
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,256
Right that's kind of

738
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Jerk something

739
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
Ideas

740
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
Have spirits

741
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,912
Places

742
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
Spirit are we getting

743
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:01,056
But plate or what are we doing

744
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
Places have energy

745
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Example

746
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Francisco

747
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,736
Terrible spirit

748
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
There's place

749
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,552
Where the spirit was pretty good too

750
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
Dan's

751
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
Nope

752
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,648
Francisco has a hellish energy

753
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
La has a hellish energy

754
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,000
Hillary Clinton she has Ellis energy

755
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,072
Reno has Alice energy energy

756
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,496
Psychotically powerful at Stonehenge without it was a placebo I like

757
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
Granger's a battery goes yeah but

758
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,456
30% of people have

759
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
Have that effect

760
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
El Dorado energy

761
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
And you don't

762
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
Seduce

763
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,888
This is just a ridiculous show I don't even

764
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:05,312
I'm I'm the professor of walking across imaginary line

765
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,432
I would love to been there on that trip

766
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:15,296
Stone heads

767
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,672
Download Adams by connected to my druidic road

768
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,744
Might be a calendar I don't know

769
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:29,376
Alex

770
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
His

771
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,104
Belief system is not compatible with America

772
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
That is not true

773
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,504
I don't know I had to get away from Stonehenge because you're that feeling was wow like and I don't want to

774
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,576
I want to get away from this

775
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,648
Did baby feel violin

776
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096

779

Great

780
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,872
It should be pointed up at Stonehenge in Wiltshire England

781
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,968
It's not a site where experts believe human sacrifice was scary down

782
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
However there is another similar site

783
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
Germinate

784
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
Which is closer to italics

785
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
Just talkin about

786
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,648
An article in the Smithsonian include this line

787
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Quote

788
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,976
It's your similarities with its Fame cousin in Britain

789
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
Perform many of the same ritual

790
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
So they added a new twist

791
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
Human psyche

792
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
The words new twist

793
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,544
Certainly to get the message across to people who study people who studies Stonehenge don't believe it was used as a human sacrifice

794
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:45,664
Even in the case of the German site the only human sacrifice

795
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,200
A likely scenario

796
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,808
Well pointing out that the trauma of the bodies found their could have alternative explanation

797
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
Like inner conflict

798
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,624
Intergroup

799
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
Conflict

Raves

801
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,256
There's one skeleton that was found around the year 2000

802
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
From Stonehenge

803
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,120
Theorize could be the Vic

804
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
Sacrifice

805
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
But other believe that the evidence

806
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Good point

807
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
And plenty of other directions

808
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,312
And also the person that this skeleton is up

809
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,360
They would have died in around 6

810
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,640
600 AD

811
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,920
Which is way too late

812
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
4 Stonehenge

813
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:26,368
Given that this is like one of the only real pieces of evidence that tends towards the conclusion of human sacrifice taking place at Stonehenge

814
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,160
You be pretty irresponsible jump to the

815
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,976
The glitch just from that without any supporting evidence

816
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:37,120
A lot of the beliefs that dumb people like Alex said about Stonehenge come from 17th century historians

817
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,424
Whose theories about Stonehenge being a druidic

818
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
Temple

819
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
I've been thoroughly debunked

820
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,800
These ideas are really popular for a while

821
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:49,408
There's one stone there that was nicknamed the slaughtering Stone because rainwater would pool in

822
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
Turn red

823
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,296
The imagination I was you know that is proof of long lingering blood

824
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,576
It's really just a result

825
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
Does algae and iron

826
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
They figured that out

827
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
But it is

828
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,744
It was really popular

829
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,304
And it gets into people's imagination

830
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,168
Giant Stone hanging around in a circle from the past what are you talking about

831
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:15,520
Surrounding Stonehenge

832
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:20,128
Able to whip himself into a frenzy just by being near it and I should stress

833
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,408

Messiah

837
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,976
I'm certain Israel declare itself the Messiah

838
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:40,352
God somebody somebody GoFundMe to just get him out of

839
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,448
So there's the spirits and energies of

840
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
Absurd

841
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,752
Islam is bad

842
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,544
Christ is good

843
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,568
Sure

844
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,336

846
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
It's around it

847
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,599
Energy of Christ is pure

848
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
Clean

849
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,183
When is good and is peaceful and is the choir

850
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,207
Play some most high

851
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
Tom talked about

852
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,303
That's the place we want to go so I'm glad that

853
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
From the escalating

854
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,935
Islam's been set up and

855
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,727
We need a wallet off at home

856
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,543
Text themselves

857
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,127
But it's not going to be all the Muslims must conform to them

858
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
You're going to fight it

859
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,991
And Islam will not Prevail against

860
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,367
Stop reaching

861
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,903
Cuz this is

862
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,975
Knock this is not good I mean. Nothing you saying

863
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
Makes any sense

864
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Wallet off

865
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
B talking about

866
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,887
Here's the problem

867
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,703
Alex is operating off like a really dumb assumption

868
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
And that is

869
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Expressed in this

870
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,311
I don't want to be an enemy of Islam but

871
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
Christian converting

872
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
And I know you want to conquer me

873
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
Not in your country that you took

874
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
Christians

875
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
And then others

876
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,831
What

877
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
Defending myself

878
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
But I'm done

879
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,975
That's it I don't want

880
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
I don't think

881
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,351
Islam

882
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:23,007
I don't I don't think I ate any Keys operating off of false assumptions

883
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,055
I don't think so

884
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,847
I think that is just

885
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,895
Weird paranoid

886
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
I don't think Islam has recruiters

887
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,087
Just do not like not army base recruiters leg

888
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,975
Like the guys you'd Senior High School lunchroom I don't know I don't know enough but I have been to

889
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,023
Before and I have not felt they were trying

890
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
To convert

891
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:50,911
Make a say no no no I don't I don't know how Alex is doing

892
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:55,263
Occupied Texas Fortified Compound all the Muslims trying to get him

893
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:00,127
Morning prayer

894
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,687
The energy is really good

895
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,479
According to Alex

896
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
It's really good

897
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:11,135
So he gets off this islamophobic chunk here and starts talking about the night before

898
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,439
And how the media was covering

899
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,791
Please rethink sza gotcha clip

900
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:22,655
From I believe MSNBC of possible fatalities

901
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959

Pictures of gacha

904
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
But it's not

905
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,103
Play this clip because

906
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,175
Last night I'm up here and I noticed

907
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,735
MSNBC

908
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,551
Shane 20 dad 30 dad

909
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,855
I just said listen

910
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
I say that

911
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,463
Surrounded messy population we're not hearing those report

912
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:51,071
Sure enough it turned out those

913
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,911
Which is a normal but just saying we don't believe

914
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,447
Thank God it wasn't true

915
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,799
12 MSNBC Amplified fake news Iranian attack

916
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,359
U.s. soldiers here it is

917
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:10,271
We're just getting reports

918
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:13,087
Irgc

919
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,951
Ayatollah Khamenei the supreme leader of this country was in the control center

920
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:24,351
Coordinating Addy's attacks this is I'm not sure about that

921
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,447
Tyronn State media is claiming the Searcy US soldiers have been

922
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:33,823
You killed in this attack and outs this is not confirmed this is just coming from Iranian media

923
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,127
We have just left that part out

924
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:40,735
We have entered a very unpredictable time we have to see

925
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:44,319
What the response is going to be from the United States

926
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,135
But we cannot step over the precipice

927
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:52,511
Could mean any number of things

928
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,303
Something necessarily specific

929
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,703
You're right you should have cut that part out because a guy's clearly saying is it a grain of salt

930
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,007
Yeah we are not clear on this

931
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,287
Might not be true

932
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,079
Responsible reporting

933
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
Alex is saying

934
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:11,967
MSNBC f*** this up in there a lying fake news where is he did not

935
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,807
And this is what I realize Alex probably did a live stream tonight

936
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:19,391
Before any almost certainly absolutely

937
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,183
I thought I would check in

938
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:24,511
So now we're going to do a little bit of Alex's livestream

939
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:28,607
Here is Alex speculating that an all-out war is starting

940
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,167
And are they playing for portly were launched

941
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,703
About an hour ago

942
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
And

943
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,335
Obviously Iranians know those are coming I'm not giving out any cigarettes or like a roller Rivera

944
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Midlothian

945
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,895
Second Iraq War

946
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,967
This is a big bold move

947
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,271
And all hell is breaking loose

948
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,855
Anacortes yummy bombers and stuff wash my other areas that she have

949
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
I am the shepherd

950
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,975
But tonight is one where there's a very good chance all that working Breakout

951
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
We pray that is not the

952
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:00,607
But the shorts on Thursday we're going to call her about 10 minutes to get on

953
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,423
I said it's going tonight if they're about to head there any leadership

954
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
Japanese says

955
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,263
Sleeper cells are activated whole nine yards he was just in Iraq

956
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
Imma leave it at that

957
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:14,943
So Alex has a source that's telling him it's about to go Connecticut sleeper cells or episodes

958
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
Chance

959
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:22,111
Is breaking out tonight responsible

960
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:28,767
Amplify fake news from around State his is really

961
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,583
Solid reported

962
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,631
Call The Source

963
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,423
To figure out what's going on

964
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,959
Start speculate

965
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
About things

966
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,007
The Narrative is

967
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,823
Soleimani killed

968
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
Some people

969
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,639
It's good some people

970
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
Think it's bad

971
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
Welded wire going in

972
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,711
In Iran or Iraq

973
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,271
Now you feel that you have to retaliate

974
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
You do

975
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,831
You strike are

976
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,367
Us bases

977
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
Is in Iraq

978
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,159
I've been

979
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
I've read reports up to

980
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,487
20 or more dead US citizens

981
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,327
And so now what will now what is Trump have to do I mean

982
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,863
Looks like one option

983
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
Not responding to this

984
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
And then

985
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,055
You really

986
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,591
Cross your fingers and Hope

987
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895
I mean

988
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
Say it folks

989
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
We know how old

990
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,319
Really really

991
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:28,159
The whole country of Iran

992
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,463
Yes Man

993
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,279
That was a good plan speculation

994
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,583
Yeah you know here's a little bit more

995
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,191
Here's where things get really interesting in the livestream from the night at 7

996
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:44,799
Alex is talking about this you know some people are saying that there is 20 dead

997
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,871
But he has a more important narratives that he wants to pitch

998
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,663
Which is his way of making

999
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
Himself

1000
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,711
A major part of the story

1001
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:56,319
Now we're going to go over all of this is his unfold but they're all over the news saying

1002
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,367
Look for Counter-Strike look for attacks

1003
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
Reportedly

1004
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,719
Did you said something 15 something 18 something 20

1005
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,767
We hope nine people just type in

1006
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,583
US troops killed US servicemen killed we're not sure

1007
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:11,167
We're going to continue and there I can go up there again to go search

1008
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
Myself

1009
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,519
Pull all that up tonight as we're alive but I know this

1010
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,359
As all this was about to break we got a giant denial

1011
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,383
Of service attack

1012
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,735
That was definitely institutional for the establishment

1013
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,807
Is Iran launching this does not want us on air

1014
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,111
Cuz Dana will try to figure out what's going on

1015
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:35,999
Hey we're we're we're victims in this too big Target

1016
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,303
Cuz we're going to tell the truth in the man doesn't want

1017
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,071
What's 2

1018
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:43,167
Alex is speculating about the the death

1019
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,983
But at the same time he's not saying

1020
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,311
He is giving it a little bit of a we don't know I guess

1021
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:54,431
That's your speculation that's going on a responsible specific

1022
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
It's not

1023
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,015
He's not handling

1024
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,807
Exactly what MSN

1025
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,743
Yes that's true

1026
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,023
We hope it's

1027
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,583
Not which suggests you do that

1028
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,607
Could be

1029
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:16,191
And Alex goes to a live feed of Fox News because

1030
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,471
He gets kind of

1031
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:21,567
Like I don't have the information let's go to live feed I'll look into

1032
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
A little bit

1033
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
And then

1034
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:26,175
Wow the MSN Fox News

1035
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
Part is playing

1036
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Alex

1037
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,503
Caught on hot mic

1038
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,063
Let's go ahead and go to Ally foxy right now

1039
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,623
Given the intelligence

1040
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,903
Starting to come out

1041
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,975
Tonight I'm at a top-level meeting where

1042
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,535
The gang of eight was given some information about

1043
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,327
What that intelligent Township

1044
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,607
I'm going to learn more about that

1045
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,631
Potentially tomorrow

1046
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,703
You can hear him say I'm not going to do the show until I get numb

1047
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,007
Because I think he knows

1048
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,311
I got to have this

1049
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
Yeah

1050
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
B

1051
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
That's interested

1052
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
Why would

1053
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
Why was Mike

1054
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,199
Silat

1055
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,503
Are there amateurs working the book

1056
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,551
Does he have a diminished staff

1057
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,343
Is this going to be a problem later

1058
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,391
We'll see

1059
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,975
So Alex alright comes back

1060
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,023
I'm starting to think those were rhetorical

1061
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,631
Does Alex comes back from the Fox News Feed

1062
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,191
And I think I actually can

1063
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,519
Looking into initially why I jumped through the livestream

1064
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:27,359
Was to see if you was being unfair about his own coverage about the death

1065
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,663
Right and I think he's not I think he's

1066
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,943
When he comes back

1067
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,991
Here's what he says I think it's totally fair

1068
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,271
We are alive

1069
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
And there's been a bun

1070
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
We're glad to tell you

1071
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Enotfound

1072
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,231
What is documenting

1073
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
We're just glad

1074
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:47,839
What has bacon for

1075
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
Credit

1076
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,263
Talk about this we can't find confirmation of it

1077
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
You know Alex

1078
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,431
Yes Zack

1079
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
You bet

1080
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:09,343
Zach is back I knew it was coming I was going to make a return Journey absolutely

1081
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,903
Livestream Alex did this evening on the 7th

1082
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,463
In response to the missile attack he had Zack.

1083
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:21,631
For those of you new to the show Zack was Alex's fake intelligent Source who was an attempt to take over the Internet space is occupied by Cuban

1084
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,423
Also the star of Saved by the Bell

1085
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:29,823
I mean when Zack was on the show back on January 5th 2018 Alex literally called him quote

1086
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,871
Are Weedle qanon absolutely

1087
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:37,503
Alex

1088
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,087
I think he's controlled opposition so there's really nothing you can do to win them over

1089
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:45,439
Strangely enough Mark-Paul Gosselaar is q

1090
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:51,071
It's a really weird working with Screech Screech is doing the attack stuff

1091
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,095
Maybe

1092
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:56,447
I haven't heard Zach on for a while but interesting Lee whereas in the past

1093
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,495
Alex has been hiding his identity

1094
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,775
His name is public now

1095
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,335
His name is Zachary Lee klawonn

1096
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:06,431
And credit is official title that's given on the Chiron

1097
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,479
16th engineer which I think is

1098
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,783
Mysterious I don't know I don't care

1099
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:14,367
One thing I noticed is that Zack doesn't really sound the same time

1100
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:19,231
His voice itself is close enough that doesn't make me suspicious that it's a different person

1101
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,279
But the way you speaking is totally

1102
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,071
Back reviews anonymous

1103
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,351
He spoke with authority

1104
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,375
But now it's

1105
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,911
What's more suggestive

1106
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
Hinton

1107
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:32,543
He's making the argument on this episode that Obama sending money to Iran

1108
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,615
Which was a Ron's money

1109
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,895
Finance this attack

1110
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,687
But he's not saying that

1111
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,711
He's hinting at

1112
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,735
Which seems weird

1113
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,527
If he's a high-level intelligence

1114
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,855
Guy and all that you shouldn't use the same dumb rhetorical tricks

1115
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
Alex.

1116
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,487
Also he called the irgc the Irani and revolutionary guard corpse

1117
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:55,839
Which seems weird I feel like every military person in the world knows how to pronounce Corps

1118
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,911
In the interview he says the word problematic

1119
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,703
About a thousand times

1120
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:05,311
Also he just keeps saying things are problematic

1121
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,359
Like a dump sounds very problematic

1122
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,127
Anyway

1123
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:12,223
Now that I have Zach's name I can tell you a little bit more about it let's hear about that

1124
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,527
Before there really wasn't anything to go on

1125
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,599
To look at you who he was like I just had the name Zach and

1126
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,391
What time is it in Morocco

1127
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,927
That's not allowed to go on

1128
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,719
But now I can introduce

1129
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Duzak

1130
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,767
Klawock

1131
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:31,423
Zach went to high school at Braden River High School in Bradenton Florida

1132
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,983
It's the childhood home though

1133
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,055
Great Carlton Fisk he's a real piece

1134
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,359
You also have a great name

1135
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,639
And there's a rapper

1136
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:47,039
No Limit Records

1137
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
Funny that this guy

1138
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,367
Choosing a rap name just chose

1139
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,415
Carlton bucket baseball

1140
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
Zack and I

1141
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
Common

1142
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,791
And that we both didn't finish High School

1143
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
I dropped out

1144
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:03,167
But Zack was actually expelled from school for having a gun on school

1145
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,495
As reported in a 2008 article in The Herald Tribune

1146
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:12,127
The article was about how 10 students were barred from graduation ceremonies because of explicit and

1147
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,407
Threatening rap songs

1148
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:17,759
They performed and posted online I believe as they are closing on MySpace

1149
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:22,879
Apparently they were pretty antagonistic to their rival High School Lakewood Ranch

1150
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,159
In the song

1151
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,439
Included lyrics like

1152
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,487
Lakewood boys is going to bleed

1153
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:31,071
Zach even kicked out of school for having a gun the year

1154
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,399
Pryor was still one of the rappers on this track

1155
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,447
Threatening his old schools rival

1156
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,727
So that tells me he's

1157
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
Very cool

1158
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
To be clear

1159
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,591
I must concerned with the rap song

1160
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:47,199
Do whatever people do dumb stuff

1161
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:47,967
Done

1162
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,503
Rap song YouTube videos

1163
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,831
I'm just more interested in the fact that he had a gun it's

1164
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,391
To me is much bigger of a deal

1165
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,695
I just think that this rap song is a big dork

1166
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,511
If it was reversed

1167
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,071
I would assume you were Rush Limbaugh from the

1168
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,143
I'm more angry about this

1169
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,167
Rap music

1170
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,447
But I am about to

1171
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,751
You be you should have guns on school campus

1172
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,775
What does

1173
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,799
Rap music

1174
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,615
So after this listed in the army

1175
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,431
What's the rank of specialist by 2010

1176
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
Which is the rank

1177
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,247
Just directly above private first class

1178
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:26,367
That Year's Akron public with allegations that he been harassed in the service because he's a Muslim

1179
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:33,023
Any an article in ABC news story being the subject of abuse as soon as basic training started

1180
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:38,399
With his drill instructor singling him out in mocking the idea of attending Islamic religious service

1181
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:43,007
He was specifically selected to portray a terrorist in training exercises

1182
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,103
A fellow Soldier desecrated is Quran by tearing out pages in Tulsa

1183
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Sometime around

1184
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:50,431
They would call him quote ragheads sand monkey

1185
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,967
And Zachary bin Laden

1186
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,295
One day 3 weeks into his time at Fort Hood

1187
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:58,111
Zach found a piece of paper in the windshield wiper of his truck

1188
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,927
It's a quote hate carpet jockey go back where you came

1189
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,695
From

1190
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,231
After the Fort Hood shooting

1191
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,279
It got so bad that he had to be moved off

1192
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,559
The base for his own safe

1193
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,423
In 2010 there were memos written I could I found these memos

1194
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,263
That were written by the office of the under Secretary of Defense

1195
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,311
Regarding Zach's allegations of harassment

1196
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,359
In the Bible does it says quote

1197
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:25,247
The attached letter address to the Secretary of Defense concerns alleged harassment of a Muslim Soldier assigned to Fort Hood

1198
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:30,367
The letter is from the Council on american-islamic relations on behalf of army specialist

1199
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,391
Zachary klawonn

1200
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,951
Alex has repeatedly and consist

1201
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,255
Italy called care a terrorist organization

1202
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,327
Was dealing with a very serious situation

1203
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,399
He was they were who he went to for help sure

1204
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:49,055
After this Zack went on CNN aljazeera.net

1205
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,383
And how there's a serious problem with islamophobia in the military

1206
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,967
I found some blogs talking about him having a lawsuit against the army

1207
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,759
But I don't fully trust those sites

1208
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:02,623
And I wasn't able to find concrete evidence except it's probably true

1209
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,903
He probably did

1210
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,927
Have this lawsuit

1211
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:09,535
I don't care to come through Zack social media posts or anything like that but a couple of them

1212
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,583
Think things do come up if you Google his name

1213
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,631
One is his LinkedIn page

1214
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,935
Which says that he's retired from the Army

1215
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,263
I'm not positive when you left but I would not be surprised

1216
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:23,615
It wasn't too long after he started going red domestic and foreign news programs

1217
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,151
Talk about how the army training

1218
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,199
Includes propaganda against Islam

1219
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,479
They usually

1220
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,247
His word

1221
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,271
Yeah well I mean

1222
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,831
I like I like it does

1223
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,623
Like I don't believe that right

1224
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:39,231
Another thing you can find is a profile for Zachry klawonn on Explore Talent

1225
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,535
A website for people

1226
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
To book Act

1227
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
Gigs

1228
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,423
Very active and honestly I can't even really be sure that it was

1229
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,215
Made by someone else

1230
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
Trying to make it look like

1231
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
He's an actor

1232
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,287
I have no fun

1233
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Idea

1234
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,359
But it does come up and who knows what that mean

1235
00:58:56,383 --> 00:59:01,247
I can find no indication that Zach has any relation to the military at this point in his life other than that he used

1236
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,527
To be a specialist in the army

1237
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,135
I can find no evidence that he was in the intelligence field and honestly a lot of that stuff just

1238
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
To be made up

1239
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:12,511
My heart goes out to him for the harassment he said he had to endure while he was enlisted

1240
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,047
But I can't help but wonder how he could

1241
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,583
To possibly be the type of person

1242
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,167
Would go on the news and do interviews about anti-muslim bigotry in the army

1243
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:25,055
Meathead also the type of person who Bok associating with Alex Jones extreme anti-muslim

1244
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,871
I could speculate on that

1245
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:32,991
As it stands now I just don't think there's any reason to take anything he's saying to Alex

1246
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
Seriously

1247
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,319
He was formerly in the military but so what

1248
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,903
So was the dude who lived next door to me when I was 19 or smoked weed

1249
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Yeah

1250
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
B

1251
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:44,511
Ideas

1252
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,119
I did too

1253
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,935
The last time I was in Columbia I did go find him

1254
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,007
Yeah it was nice to hang out again

1255
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:58,335
Yeah it was just a situation was 19

1256
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,127
What's up what's the news for wasn't

1257
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,151
He got clean

1258
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
Which is actually pretty good

1259
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,479
Nono from drugs

1260
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,527
I was happy for him

1261
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,367
It was a situation where I had a lot of weed

1262
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:13,183
You're living on a controlled in common

1263
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,463
Cherokee word

1264
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,279
I would love to come over bring a joint with smoke and Heat

1265
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,815
You just tell me stories as like

1266
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,887
His life after coming back from Vietnam

1267
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,935
Handsome

1268
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,471
Pretty interesting

1269
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,495
Bi-Rite

1270
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,799
As seriously as I'm going to

1271
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:32,127
Take anything that Zac said

1272
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,175
So

1273
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,455
Zac is on

1274
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:39,039
And really it's an interesting portrait because

1275
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,063
I think the fact

1276
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,367
Front bun to school and got expelled

1277
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,135
Is

1278
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
Relevant

1279
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,695
But also like

1280
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,231
Not the biggest

1281
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,511
The world

1282
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:53,887
I don't know if there's any indication that he brought it in a threatening way I still think it's

1283
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,911
Way out of line

1284
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,727
It getting expelled for that is

1285
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,751
A hundred percent

1286
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,799
Worth

1287
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
Get the f*** out

1288
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,127
A good response

1289
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:07,967
It was a situation where anybody could

1290
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:11,551
I mean I think it's entirely possible that maybe it had gone

1291
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
In his car

1292
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
Still

1293
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:16,927
Sure not the same as bring it to school to threaten

1294
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:19,999
I think the most

1295
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,535
Important thing is this

1296
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,839
There's a lot of Trail

1297
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,863
In his life

1298
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,911
That is speaking out against

1299
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,191
Anti-muslim bigotry

1300
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:28,959
Tree in the army

1301
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,751
It makes no sense

1302
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,031
For him to be on Infowars

1303
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,311
There's something up

1304
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,359
I don't know what it is

1305
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,407
It could be a situation where he lost

1306
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,199
He completely

1307
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,295
Also you could see a situation where

1308
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,063
Because of his

1309
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,087
Experiences

1310
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,647
Because of the inaction on the part of the army

1311
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,671
He could have a

1312
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,463
Really serious resentment

1313
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,999
Against the United States

1314
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,303
Government

1315
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,327
Sure you could see

1316
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,119
Gravitating towards Alex

1317
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,423
It's because of some sort of an anti-government

1318
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,215
Fascination that he is

1319
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,519
Built because of his experience could they

1320
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,055
Or could you be something yet

1321
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,335
Entirely Craven

1322
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,871
Like I don't know

1323
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
Eileen I mean

1324
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:15,551
Eileen immediately to if you are on Alex's show today

1325
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,879
There is some scam activity in your path

1326
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:22,719
I don't know what it is I'm not going to say that

1327
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:30,143
And is going to I'm not going to say that his harassment stuff was fabricated or any of that nonsense

1328
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,191
I don't know but

1329
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,471
Everything is suspect

1330
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,007
Everything Is Us

1331
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
I don't

1332
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,055
I don't trust

1333
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,103
Any part of what you say has

1334
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,663
I have no reason to not

1335
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,223
Trust his experience in the army

1336
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,783
Like I don't I don't have any reason

1337
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,087
To distrust that other than he's on

1338
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:49,855
Boatworkstoday

1339
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,647
That's my that's my reason

1340
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
It is tough

1341
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,463
Stop that's where that's where I come from

1342
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,487
Sure

1343
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:58,559
Zach is on most of it is just this

1344
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,863
She's trying to imply that the Iran deal

1345
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,143
Obama giving

1346
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,191
Itsfunneh back

1347
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,471
Is funding these attacks

1348
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,007
It's really basically his

1349
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:07,775
Big boy

1350
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,335
In 2000

1351
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:13,151
The Obama Administration allowed one

1352
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,943
7 billion dollars

1353
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,671
Verified by the treasury

1354
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,815
And now we

1355
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:36,703
So he's just spouting a fairly popular conspiracy theory among the right and that is that

1356
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,727
Obama is

1357
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,263
But his funded this

1358
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,287
It's it's

1359
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,079
This ridiculous

1360
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
What

1361
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,919
What idiot says 1.7 billion dollars

1362
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
Flooded

1363
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:51,807
How did it flood in tiran

1364
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:54,879
Oh okay then the money the money wave

1365
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,927
Took over

1366
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,279
Here is where I think everything gets

1367
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
Incredibly

1368
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,327
Suspicious and all

1369
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,607
The pieces sort of come to

1370
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:10,495
Alex is earlier said there was this denial-of-service attack going on on Infowars

1371
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,311
Alex earlier got caught on a hot

1372
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
Zach

1373
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,639
Is a suspicious character

1374
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,943
All of that merges

1375
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,479
Into play

1376
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,503
In this next clip

1377
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,783
Put your mic down for this

1378
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,551
Just because

1379
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,087
This is

1380
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,111
So f***** up

1381
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,303
Talk about

1382
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,375
Country around the world

1383
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
Is 2

1384
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
Pictures of America

1385
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
Platform

1386
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,919
Political figure

1387
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,199
Eventually

1388
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,551
To hear that

1389
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,599
I think I heard a burp

1390
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,135
No hear listen

1391
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:05,535
Just that part where you got caught on the hop by earlier in the clip

1392
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,583
Table animated

1393
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:11,167
I know when but I hear listen to

1394
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,983
He saying brain-dead

1395
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,263
This is pretty good

1396
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,031
This is pretty

1397
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,335
Good yeah I heard this is Brandon

1398
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,175
Is pretty good it is pretty good

1399
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:27,039
Severe problems with his mic is on during this livestream

1400
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:31,135
It's because you can't afford to pay the whole crew to be there for an office hours impromptu live stream

1401
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:37,279
Whatever the case he has that prattling on about how social media influencers and Defenders of America are the real targets

1402
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,303
According to his Intel

1403
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,583
And wouldn't you know it

1404
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,423
I was just pretending that he was having a DDOS attack earlier in the Stream

1405
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,215
It's almost like this is all planned out

1406
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,263
It's almost like they're all working on

1407
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:53,663
Some kind of a narrative building things you all of these things put together

1408
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,943
Would suggest

1409
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:01,343
The conclusion that they want you to draw that I don't get why I would strongly suspect

1410
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:06,975
I would strongly suspected I was being paranoid and making things up and clip you can hear Alex

1411
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,767
Thinking he's off Mike's a 20-inch

1412
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,583
This is pretty good

1413
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
What's pretty good

1414
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,703
The idea that Iranians are going to attack social media influencers and Patriots

1415
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,239
Because if that were true

1416
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,775
That's absolutely knock

1417
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
That would be bad

1418
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:25,151
Especially for a patriot self-identified social media influencer like Alex

1419
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:30,783
It's super good however if you know that it's b******* and you're trying to run a pageant

1420
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,831
It does seem like a very

1421
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,367
There's no fear of act

1422
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,023
Alex is saying this is pretty good because he knows it

1423
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,327
The angle is pretty good one

1424
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,375
To make the story about himself

1425
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,447
Hopefully boost traffic to Infowars and make some money

1426
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,239
Exact is clearly a participant

1427
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,847
But I'm not sure how much of that is based on like collaboration between him and Alex are how much

1428
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,919
It's just him knowing what it's like suneet

1429
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,711
Don't know what's going on here precisely

1430
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,783
Whatever it is falls directly under the headline of

1431
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,343
Manipulation

1432
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,415
How to talk about the DDOS attack earlier

1433
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,975
It's possible that Zack was listening to him looking

1434
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:15,839
4 clues of ways to build on the narrative and he's operating completely on his own

1435
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,887
It's also possible that when Alex

1436
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,167
Called him earlier

1437
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,703
Before having him on

1438
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,495
He was saying like all right look

1439
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:26,335
Angle we're going with is that Ronnie and they're going to be attacking me

1440
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:29,151
Right and so Zachary is presenting his until like that

1441
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,199
It's possible that it's a collaborative effort

1442
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,479
Possible that Zack is

1443
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,783
Is just intuitive enough to understand

1444
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,063
The fact that Alex

1445
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,343
Thinks his mic is off

1446
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
Pretty good

1447
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Is

1448
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,207
Now I will posit

1449
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,743
One alternative

1450
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,279
To you

1451
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,071
And I will admit that it is

1452
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
Unlikely

1453
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,143
It certainly makes

1454
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
Less narratives

1455
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,191
Since then what you've got

1456
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:52,959
Got going on

1457
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,007
But it's more likely than zero

1458
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
And that is

1459
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
That Alec

1460
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,335
Text did Burr Parlier

1461
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,871
And he's telling Owen the

1462
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,663
The sandwiches eating

1463
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
Is delicious

1464
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:08,831
Camera is not on him when this is happening I can't say that but

1465
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:15,231
The camera does come back there's no food or drinks

1466
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:22,399
It's possible and I will always I will always entertain the possibility that he is eating or turkey tips

1467
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,935
It's important not to jump

1468
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,471
To conclusions and so like

1469
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:29,823
Yes there is other possible explanation for why you would say this is pretty good

1470
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,871
Owen wow

1471
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,431
In the middle of his

1472
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:38,783
Fake intelligence or saying that you guys are the real Target

1473
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,623
Possible other explanation

1474
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,439
To eat while he's are there

1475
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:51,839
What I know cuz he went to Dan's Hamburgers after this

1476
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,375
Dangerous yeah absolutely

1477
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,191
I mean look

1478
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:00,799
He's actually eating some Halal strangely enough

1479
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,103
Whatever's going on here is depleted

1480
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,455
Suspicious

1481
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:09,503
I wasn't good

1482
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,271
Just thought like

1483
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,551
Let me first of all attention

1484
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,831
Now we know who Zach is

1485
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
Is get a picture of him

1486
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,623
Is he healthy

1487
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,671
Incongruous what he's doing now is

1488
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,695
With what he was doing

1489
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:21,791
Let's say eight years ago you got to wonder what is the reason for that

1490
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:23,327
Why why is that going on

1491
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
Obviously

1492
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,631
F******

1493
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,399
Codes for

1494
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:32,799
Attacking Alex really not as interested with social media influencers

1495
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:39,199
Zach would have you believe or dumb radio shows Alex's using Zac his hi-pro

1496
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,479
Profile intelligence

1497
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,015
Fake qanon guy

1498
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,831
Push forth

1499
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,135
The narratives that he's intellisource

1500
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,439
Are going to be the target

1501
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,743
It's just all very suspicious

1502
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:56,863
It was weird whenever I looked up anti Alex Jones podcast and there was ours and

1503
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,679
The cuts there they have their own knowledge fight

1504
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,983
I don't know I don't know how to say it in

1505
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,543
So Alex

1506
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,823
Say we not jump back

1507
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,615
Create because the rest of that

1508
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,383
3 visit

1509
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,175
Disaster you take some calls

1510
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,199
And then leaves

1511
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:15,807
Greg Reese one of his employees and Owen Shroyer takes more phone calls and then

1512
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,111
Oh and leaves and gets replaced by Harris

1513
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:18,879
Smith Wright

1514
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,439
Who cares it goes on forever and they just take much.

1515
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:27,839
Trump calls people who were Muslim in

1516
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,607
Later

1517
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,631
Later

1518
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,935
That's the headline

1519
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:34,751
Alex kind of just leaves after detox

1520
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:37,823
Zach cuz I think he's gotten what he needs out of weave

1521
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,895
Tomorrow we're going to run

1522
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,943
I don't think he's running with it then

1523
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,991
Next day though I don't see him

1524
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,551
They're going to attack Infowars

1525
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:54,719
Because that would be too smart to run with the narrative that you establish the night before I don't I think it's more

1526
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,743
Like this is going

1527
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:58,559
To work for the immediate and allow people

1528
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:02,143
Or it'll lead people to keep their eyes glued to this

1529
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,007
I think it's more of that and then fundraise

1530
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,799
This is best to cannibalize stream

1531
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,383
I get the sense if that's okay because the next day he's just

1532
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
Hedonism

1533
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,967
Brian

1534
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,015
Hamburglar

1535
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,575
So he comes

1536
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,623
Who's back on the 8th

1537
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:25,183
Can calls from Finland

1538
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,463
Who said some really f*****

1539
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,279
What is the world is doing is

1540
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,559
Like a church mission

1541
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,631
Find

1542
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,935
Get Revelations from God

1543
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:41,311
Trying to get Revelation and then you get emissions based on. And you go out and you act

1544
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,103
And that is in my opinion

1545
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,919
What's a Buddha doing and I

1546
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,199
I really do believe

1547
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,735
Is important.

1548
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,503
Tithing

1549
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
So we got to church

1550
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:58,719
It is very strange

1551
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,279
I I don't like it's disturbing

1552
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,839
If you are from Finland

1553
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,119
You're not allowed

1554
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,959
I would specifically Finley

1555
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,239
I don't know why

1556
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,567
Finland Optical some strange lights

1557
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:16,639
So that calls great Alex Azar

1558
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:23,295
Another call from guy named Scotty in Virginia who's calling in to tell Alex that he star

1559
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,087
Because of the gun grab

1560
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
Call

1561
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:36,351
The 20th consecutive year of being a nerd

1562
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:39,935
Virginia Beach

1563
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:45,055
The extreme-right is very paranoid about this

1564
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,335
Appropriate measure

1565
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,127
Which of these guys calling in

1566
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,431
And he's going to start a militia

1567
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,455
And Alex's

1568
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,735
Something really dumb

1569
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,759
Last time I checked

1570
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:56,831
It's only a couple counties that are Northern Virginia

1571
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,623
Democrat

1572
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,887
Hundreds County Commission meeting

1573
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:15,519
Local government saying we don't agree to the king of England taking our guns

1574
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,079
Pictures of king of Virginia

1575
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,895
Northam

1576
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,551
Start a fight

1577
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,647
Was it going to be like

1578
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:36,511
We're sending in the Army's little black girls to go to school everybody

1579
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,815
You didn't or wouldn't have

1580
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,959
Alex is sadly not too far off

1581
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,495
There are a lot of counties

1582
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:49,823
In Virginia that have passed these gun sanctuary resolution

1583
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,103
Is not sure

1584
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:54,431
Granted this is completely symbolic gesture and means nothing

1585
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,223
Legal perspective

1586
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,039
I would say it's a pretty good indication of the mood

1587
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:05,951
Mary McCord the legal director for the Georgetown University Law Center Institute for constitutional advocacy and protection

1588
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:08,255
Recently wrote a piece in the Washington

1589
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:11,839
You can post that have interesting take on this gun sanctuary Trend that's going on

1590
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,887
You moron

1591
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:21,567
Virginia state law prohibits local governments from enacting ordinances and resolutions that are inconsistent with state laws

1592
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,871
More directly specifically prohibits

1593
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,175
Local governments from regulating firearm

1594
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,735
That's going to be a problem for Alex

1595
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:33,343
So I wonder why that's not a federal law that is a state law

1596
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:39,743
So unless he's going to amend his position that the constitution

1597
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,535
About the County's or something

1598
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:47,423
You got to recognize that these County resolutions are meaningless now there's there's only one thing that these guys

1599
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,239
Believe which is that democracy is great

1600
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,799
So long as everybody agrees with what I say

1601
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,567
And if

1602
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,383
By some evil of circumstance.

1603
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,431
Evil Democrats who disagree with me

1604
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:03,039
Steal their way into office ignore them completely because democracy

1605
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,343
Isn't democracy unless everybody agrees

1606
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,135
States rights

1607
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,415
Except except

1608
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:12,255
So the article goes on to mention that

1609
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:17,375
86 Supreme Court ruling pressure versus Illinois

1610
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,399
Does not prevent

1611
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,959
The prohibition of private paramilitary organization

1612
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:24,799
Which it's noted are actually illegal according to the Constitution

1613
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:25,823
The 48 states

1614
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,103
Including Virginia

1615
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,383
This is a problem

1616
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:34,783
Because at this point episode like I said Alex was on the phone with this guy who's literally talking about how he's organizing a private

1617
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,551
Russia

1618
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:38,111
This is a public discussion of an explicit crime

1619
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,415
Violation of Virginia Constitution

1620
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:44,511
People like Alex and The Oath Keepers are whipping Gunn weirdos into

1621
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,303
Complete frenzy they could lead to dangerous

1622
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,071
Results

1623
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,351
Their argument is bad

1624
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,935
Local governments can't do anything close to what they're pretending they can

1625
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,983
And if a local government is in opposition

1626
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,007
The laws of the state

1627
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,543
Their only recourse is to

1628
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,615
The challenge the state law in court which would likely not work

1629
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
This case

1630
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,687
They kind of know that path wouldn't work

1631
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,503
It looks like you're committed to angling for some kind of a standoff

1632
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,039
Which is a really bad sign

1633
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
It also

1634
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
Alex

1635
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:13,951
Himself pretty much everyone supported Eisenhower sending in the National Guard

1636
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,743
Protect the black students in Little Rock

1637
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
When the schools were

1638
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:22,911
Desegregated bulshit

1639
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:27,519
Watching Coronavirus

1640
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:33,151
Newspaper articles after newspaper articles decrying how evil and

1641
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,967
Your real high was that Eisenhower would have

1642
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,991
The Gulf

1643
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,527
Call to

1644
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:42,623
The Constitution they loved so much and I would ask this

1645
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,903
Question right off the bat

1646
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:49,791
It pretty much everyone is for it why was it necessary to send in the National Guard

1647
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,143
Single School

1648
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,727
Maybe it's because the whole lot of people are super racist and not in favor of integration

1649
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:03,871
I don't want to send too deeply into this issue but you know who was super not into Eisenhower sending the National Guard

1650
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,639
AP students

1651
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,711
John Birch Society

1652
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:13,599
Six years after Eisenhower sent in the guard then governor of Alabama George Wallace held his

1653
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,647
The schoolhouse door event

1654
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:20,511
We're racist tried to keep School segregated by physically blocking black students from entering

1655
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:23,583
This was part of his philosophy which if you were called was

1656
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:26,655
Segregation segregation tomorrow segregation

1657
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:31,007
Can forever you can't prove he said that unless there's audio

1658
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:36,127
I bring this up because Wallace physically tried to stop black kids from go to school in 1960

1659
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,687
Which brought him a bunch of attend

1660
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:44,831
It also required jfk2 federalized the Alabama National Guard to get Wallace to stop being an a******

1661
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:48,159
What was being a national star among races

1662
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,463
After this point

1663
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,487
Ascendancy

1664
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,767
Any parlayed that into

1665
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:55,071
Presidential runs in 1964 and 9

1666
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,095
1968

1667
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:59,423
So many of Alex's spiritual ancestors

1668
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,215
Where George Wallace supporters

1669
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:05,567
Gary Allan the guy who wrote Alex Jones's favorite book none dare call it

1670
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:08,383
Conspiracy served as Wallace's speechwriter during

1671
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:14,783
Both of his presidential campaign so agree with Eisenhower

1672
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
George Wallace

1673
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
This campaign deployed rhetoric.

1674
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,391
Mirror that the John Birch

1675
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:24,255
Society and he actually said I have no problem

1676
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,279
Full of Bircher

1677
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:28,607
Any almost chosen notorious Furniture as written

1678
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,375
Benson

1679
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,399
As his running mate

1680
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,703
Benson as a prominent Mormon

1681
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,239
And anti-communist

1682
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,799
Provide the link to W Cleon skousen

1683
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,591
Did George Wallace campaigns

1684
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,687
A president or inexorable from the swap from which Alex's worldview emerged

1685
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,247
It takes some brass balls for him to pretend

1686
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:49,855
That pretty much everyone was for Eisenhower calling in the National Guard

1687
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,135
Everyone admires in

1688
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:54,207
Considers a hero of modern history actively fought against

1689
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,791
The man who wanted to do the opposite

1690
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,839
Which again I should remind you is

1691
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,399
Keeping black kids out of school

1692
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,703
Yes well if they are

1693
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,751
And the argument continued

1694
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,335
It's little

1695
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,359
Ludacris for him to

1696
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:16,223
To get on a store that quickly they do that

1697
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,759
It's so amazing how it only

1698
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:20,575
Takes one generation of separation for everybody to be like

1699
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,623
Well obviously I would have

1700
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,159
Supported Martin Luther King jr.

1701
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,207
You're of course I would have no I voted

1702
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:31,327
And I really do love the build the wall to keep out the brown people rhetoric

1703
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,119
But I love Martin Luther

1704
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
Love it

1705
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,447
It's even worse

1706
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:41,823
Even worse than that say that you would have been against Martin Luther King Jr already everybody knows

1707
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:44,127
Everybody who shaped Alex's

1708
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,919
Worldview his

1709
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,223
His narrative

1710
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,759
State formative

1711
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,807
Writers and thinkers

1712
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,599
Of his his upbringing

1713
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,135
Like his parents were

1714
01:19:55,391 --> 01:20:00,767
Clearly inundated with John Birch Society material if they weren't actually members a very much

1715
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,535
Support at Eisenhower

1716
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,559
Sending message

1717
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,863
He believes everything about global

1718
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,143
Conspiracy and all this ship

1719
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:09,471
Because of the writings of Gary Allen & W Cleon skousen

1720
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,239
There is

1721
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
No

1722
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,031
Part of what

1723
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,824
He believes about the world that isn't

1724
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,104
In some way

1725
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,640
Very closely related

1726
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,688
To George Wallace's campaign

1727
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,736
That also is connected to

1728
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
Kinds of other

1729
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,552
Portable shed

1730
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,856
In favor of Eisenhower doing all that stuff pretty

1731
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:32,512
I'm sure he was when you got arrested at rally he was also protesting

1732
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:33,792
Eisenhower Disturbed

1733
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,072
Shirt

1734
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,352
So

1735
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,144
Go fuc yourself

1736
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,936
Now Alex gets

1737
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,472
The talking about

1738
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,752
Is legal trouble

1739
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,032
His court case

1740
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:49,152
That these legal sanctions that there are applying

1741
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:51,200
Or just because they know they can't win

1742
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:51,968
McKay's

1743
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,504
So they're trying to destroy him

1744
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:54,528
That way

1745
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,088
Just like I wasn't behave differently that and they can

1746
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,136
I don't understand

1747
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,696
He's also being sued

1748
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,744
Gilmore

1749
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,792
Who is a guy who Alex

1750
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:07,840
Defamed after the unite the right

1751
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,376
In Charlottesville

1752
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,400
And

1753
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,424
I believe

1754
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,704
Based on this

1755
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,800
That there might be some news coming out about that

1756
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,080
I think

1757
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:23,968
I think Alex is where there's going to be some bad news and this may be pre-emptive control

1758
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,552
The system knows they can't shut us down these lawsuits because they're based

1759
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:30,112
Indian in Bologna show they want the

1760
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,904
Process to shut us down

1761
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,184
Climbing knots

1762
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,280
Virginia

1763
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,328
Sandy Hook

1764
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:46,496
Oops banana in in the process of discovery saying we're criminals

1765
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:52,896
Battleborn found embedded on emails we never opened sent to us about Sandy Hook since the suit

1766
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,016
Hidden code

1767
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,064
Course they got

1768
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,624
Put on the news

1769
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:05,696
Alex Jones said child born to the Sandy Hook families

1770
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,232
That's the type of stuff

1771
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,328
Law enforcement out-of-pocket lawyers

1772
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,888
Now there's no doubt the Democratic operative

1773
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:20,544
They're the crooks are the bad people

1774
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,360
We got to go defeat

1775
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,408
No weapon formed against us shall prosper but

1776
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,968
And I've already tried to plant c********* on a slope

1777
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:34,112
I got a call from DC yesterday if that's was run out of and I said yeah this is the word

1778
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,416
Mixed up next week out of the

1779
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
Virginia cash show

1780
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,256
Be ready for some really nasty stuff next week

1781
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,792
Because they are

1782
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,328
Shift

1783
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,120
Very pissed

1784
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:51,776
So look forward to Monday product headlines

1785
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,544
That's great

1786
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:56,128
What are you doing are we going to get another do position

1787
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
That'll be great

1788
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,456
Agency like

1789
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,736
Such

1790
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:05,600
Side spinner that's not good

1791
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:06,368
Because there

1792
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,720
Bright

1793
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:14,048
Alex starts rambling about various news headline

1794
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,864
And this one caught my fancy

1795
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,632
Cuz it's

1796
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,656
Very dumb

1797
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,264
Juveniles can't be arrested in California if they commit crimes

1798
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,360
It's crazy

1799
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:31,968
Is California mountain lions eating everybody children can't be arrested

1800
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:36,832
It's a state you never go to shut up about something

1801
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,368
But you desperately want to do

1802
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,416
No it you don't care just don't

1803
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:44,000
In September 2018 Governor Jerry Brown signed two bills

1804
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:46,816
Adjusting how children were treated by the courts

1805
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:50,656
One of them Senate Bill 439 made it so except

1806
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,960
Cases of murder or rape

1807
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:55,008
12 cannot be prosecuted in court

1808
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,824
There's still obviously subject to some kind of

1809
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,896
Psychiatric

1810
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:06,784
It's just at the state recognizes that it's probably not cool to treat an eleven-year-old like they're old enough to be exposed to a criminal Jeff

1811
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,600
No I think it's a good idea to expose

1812
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,904
Children under the age of 12

1813
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,672
What's 2

1814
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,000
Lawyers in the system that is

1815
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,024
Cruel

1816
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,048
Yes

1817
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:22,656
I like it the second bill Senate Bill 1391

1818
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:25,472
Try somewhat younger than 16 as an adult

1819
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,264
Still be tried for the crime

1820
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,336
Central Juvenile Facility instead of an adult prison

1821
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
If convicted

1822
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,408
Justice system already at mechanism

1823
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,688
Someplace to hold someone

1824
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,480
After they turn 18 for circumstances

1825
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
Require it

1826
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,528
So it's not like these offenders

1827
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:40,576
We'll just be getting free pass if they could a crime

1828
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,600
What's 17 / number

1829
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:46,464
This is what Alex has turned into a narrative that you can't arrest minors in California

1830
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,256
I think it might be fair

1831
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:50,048
To say that in addition to lying

1832
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,840
Alex is also being kind of a racist

1833
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:59,264
According to an article in the Sacramento Bee Jerry Brown said it was a hard choice to sign this bill but you was swayed to sign the bill

1834
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:05,920
Disparity

1835
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:12,832
Part of what these bills aim to do is to work against a trend of criminalizing behaviors and young and on white people

1836
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,856
Directions to Mike call

1837
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:16,160
Precocious

1838
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:16,928
Were they

1839
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,744
This is part of the conversation surrounding these bills

1840
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,048
Assuming Alex knows anything about this

1841
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,840
You should know that

1842
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,376
Any stops we opposed

1843
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,424
The Bells

1844
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,728
I hate the bills

1845
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:34,080
What I'm saying is ultimately he either has no idea what he's talking about or he does

1846
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,640
And he's lying about bills meant to make the Juvenile Justice

1847
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,176
The system more fair and equitable

1848
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,456
Neither is

1849
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,784
He's an a****** people really don't want

1850
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,552
To admit

1851
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,368
White people

1852
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,416
Really don't want to admit that

1853
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,208
Most problems have a massive

1854
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Racial element

1855
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,792
In the country there are very few problems

1856
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,864
The don't have a massive racial inequality

1857
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,192
Particularly legal and criminal justice

1858
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:06,336
Something they just do not watch it at all white people but people like Alex

1859
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,128
Do not want

1860
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:08,896
Fats Domino

1861
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,664
And it's

1862
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,944
Because if you start

1863
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,760
Pulling that thread then you go all the way back

1864
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,320
I can do like the very beginning of the Criminal Just

1865
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:20,672
The system is purely discriminate

1866
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:24,256
Back you have to admit once again.

1867
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,560
The United States is a fundamentally

1868
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,840
Racist country

1869
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,656
So Alex dial starts

1870
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,936
Talkin about

1871
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,216
How

1872
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,776
I don't quite know how to set this up

1873
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:38,592
He believes that there was a source

1874
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,384
That

1875
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,176
Was aware already knows about

1876
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:45,504
Billion people in the world are suffering

1877
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,600
Sure now he can only find

1878
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:50,880
If you can't find that source

1879
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:53,696
I don't even think he can find somebody who has an ID

1880
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,000
He starts freaking out about this

1881
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,280
It's kind of funny

1882
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:03,936
I told shoveled earlier I was going from memory I don't think three billion people but un says have

1883
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:06,240
Deficiency

1884
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,288
I have mental disabilities from it

1885
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,336
The latest numbers I've got

1886
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,896
National Institute of Health

1887
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:18,784
Really

1888
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:19,808
3 million

1889
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,832
First of all

1890
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,880
It was from Wikipedia

1891
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,648
So that's

1892
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,928
Number one

1893
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,744
The idd

1894
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,536
Sharda Public Health

1895
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,632
Children am I

1896
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,936
Are the most vulnerable categories

1897
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,520
Global scale

1898
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,408
Resent the clinical manifestations

1899
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,688
Daily food intake

1900
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:50,784
I'm going to go to the Wikipedia entries and see who remove that

1901
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,320
Lynx

1902
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,624
Government reports

1903
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,648
2 billion

1904
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,952
And I know we even did shows on that

1905
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,744
About a month ago

1906
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,048
Wikipedia

1907
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:09,984
Do-it-all pause

1908
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,360
Oroville Wikipedia to stab

1909
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,152
Megaton bomb

1910
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:22,528
Billions get brain damage

1911
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,720
Found it

1912
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:33,024
Zach to the boom operator found it

1913
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,816
National Institutes

1914
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,656
What is Tiana's phone

1915
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
So

1916
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:51,200
Again that's a big deal and it's a bigger deal who's going into Wikipedia and removing the entry that said 3 million

1917
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,992
First I love the idea

1918
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:56,320
Sherlock Holmes pipe and playing Detective

1919
01:28:56,576 --> 01:29:00,160
Wikipedia

1920
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:07,584
I have no idea what he's talking about and honestly it's totally possible he's just missed misremembering something he read on with the

1921
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,632
Wikipedia or these embellished the number two

1922
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,400
To begin with

1923
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,680
It's an

1924
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,728
Out-of-date Source or something

1925
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,264
Cuz there's a lot of progress It's

1926
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,824
But made globally in terms of

1927
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:18,848
Iodine fish

1928
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:22,944
Correct there are serious problems that come from

1929
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:25,760
Including physical and mental disabilities

1930
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,552
According to a recent

1931
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,576
Report from UNICEF

1932
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,856
The number of people suffering

1933
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:32,672
From us do the iodine related

1934
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:35,488
It is probably close to about 2 billion worldwide

1935
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,512
However

1936
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,792
It's important to understand

1937
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,840
Where these two billion people are

1938
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,656
People suffering from iodine deficiency are almost

1939
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:44,448
Exclusively in the developing world

1940
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:49,568
Countries that practice salt eliminate almost

1941
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,128
In between 1990 and 2000

1942
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:56,992
34 countries achieve the elimination of iodine deficiency through Universal salt

1943
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:57,760
Ionization

1944
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,808
This is a very fact

1945
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:00,832
Solution to the problem

1946
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:07,232
And generally the countries where this is the biggest issue or countries that have economic barriers to importing iodized salt

1947
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:09,280
Or I with producing a domestically

1948
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,584
Or there's another issue like their war-torn

1949
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,632
To the point where implementing these sorts of programs

1950
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,656
Enviable

1951
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:20,544
Possible to have like a large disconnected rural areas where

1952
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,336
It's somewhat infeasible

1953
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,360
I'm sure there are

1954
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:27,968
Several parts of India that ends serious iodine

1955
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:31,808
It's a difficulty but it's many

1956
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,832
People

1957
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,624
GYN or working towards solving

1958
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:38,720
Vast numbers of people with iodine deficiency

1959
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:41,280
Increase risk for it are in India Pakistan

1960
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,816
Sudan and Afghanistan

1961
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,400
According to the CDC quote iodine deficiency disorders

1962
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:49,728
Cretinism stillbirth spontaneous abortion

1963
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:52,288
And retarded physical and intellectual development

1964
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,080
Have been virtually eliminated

1965
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:00,736
This is important because Alex is only talked about any of this cuz he's trying to sell his iodine

1966
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:01,504
Compelled

1967
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,528
And the way you

1968
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,320
Pretender

1969
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,344
Is Visalia

1970
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,112
Statistics

1971
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,672
Two billion people worldwide

1972
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,208
But the thing is

1973
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:12,256
The people who are iodine deficient or almost

1974
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:15,072
Entirely not a part of the market that Alex is selling to

1975
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,608
He's trying to take a

1976
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:19,936
Very serious issue that people in developing countries are struggling with

1977
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,984
And that the UN is working to resolve

1978
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,520
And he's using it as a prop

1979
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,056
To try and convince his audience

1980
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,872
The baby there something wrong with them that iodine pills

1981
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,640
Consult

1982
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,432
This is super abusive marketing

1983
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:35,808
There is a slight decrease in iodine intake in the United States population that experts

1984
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,344
Some people who look into the stuff

1985
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:41,696
But that's kind of a part probably due to the sea salt

1986
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:42,464
Trent

1987
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:47,072
Seasalt doesn't generally contain iodine using mostly sea salt

1988
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:49,888
Taking in as much iodine

1989
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,680
Use table salt should be doing

1990
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:56,032
Also certain diets of increased in popularity recently like veganism

1991
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:59,616
And those also increase your risk for decreased iodine in

1992
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
Take based on

1993
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,920
The things that would be part of your diet

1994
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:04,480
I find it unlikely that there many vegans

1995
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,504
And Alex's audience

1996
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:12,672
Said the solution to the problem is not Alex's pills

1997
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,952
Assault

1998
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:18,560
I halfway expected the decrease in America experts are like

1999
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:22,656
And it's all anti-vaxxers again those guys are f****** everything up

2000
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,192
It's yourself

2001
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:27,264
So Alex talks about some articles here about

2002
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,800
And

2003
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,592
I have the responses to both of them

2004
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:33,408
This is such sloppy amateurs Bowl

2005
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:36,736
I was kind of running around here all aggressive during the break I pretty

2006
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,528
This makes me angry

2007
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,672
By my old folders on iodine and Actuarial Wikipedia

2008
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:47,232
They removed it because there's a lot of

2009
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:51,584
Jonathan Perez retardation a million sufficient nighteye New York Times

2010
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,888
Anymore

2011
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:58,240
Mothers

2012
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,032
1016

2013
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:03,104
Stop raining

2014
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,152
So angry

2015
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,712
Controlled and yes

2016
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,272
Because the call or talk about the

2017
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:13,344
Text to exterior both axles horses I-90

2018
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,184
This is all sales that's all this is man

2019
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:20,512
The first article is talking about China for 1996

2020
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:28,192
The Chinese government only introduced in 1995

2021
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,728
High risk of deficient

2022
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:34,848
Since that point iodine deficiency is becoming much smaller

2023
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,664
World population

2024
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:43,040
Also when you talk about you it's a gigantic country with the huge population that they all live in

2025
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,576
A lot of different locale

2026
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,904
China's learned that the different provinces have different

2027
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:51,488
Requirements so in 2018 China announced that they were going to enact

2028
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:54,048
Iodine standard Pentagon local needs

2029
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,072
Princeton

2030
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,424
Some coastal areas have diets that are higher in iodine rich foods

2031
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:03,264
So their requirements for supplementation would be lower than people in one

2032
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:06,336
And you can end up with like

2033
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:11,200
Some Studies have shown that some of the populations actually getting too much iodine also is

2034
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:13,760
Isn't healthy

2035
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,808
Tweaks to the program based on results

2036
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:18,368
Either way I'll dare they

2037
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,392
Alex's referring to a

2038
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:24,000
Twenty-four-year-old article

2039
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:26,048
This one's from 1996

2040
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,840
Little talk about it

2041
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:28,608
Alex

2042
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:35,008
You know why they do talk about evolving Scituate

2043
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:38,080
Balancing out the iodine diet

2044
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,360
That's the Scituate

2045
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:42,688
Address for the article that pregnancies that also makes total sense

2046
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,504
When someone is pregnant their dietary needs change

2047
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,040
What with another person growing

2048
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:47,808
Inside them

2049
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:51,904
Some estimates are that other iodine intake should increase around 50%

2050
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:58,304
And the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that people take iodine supplements while pregnant and nursing just

2051
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,072
Be safe

2052
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:03,168
It's not a surprise at all that Alex could find an article that iodine and Pregnant

2053
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,704
Just doesn't say what used for

2054
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
Pretending it says

2055
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:06,752
Again

2056
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,056
This is all about

2057
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,360
Nothing you saying two pics reality

2058
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:14,688
He's trying to create a sense of his listeners that they themselves

2059
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,224
Might be iodine deficiency

2060
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,272
And it's a grand plot by the globalist

2061
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,552
Saddam everyone down

2062
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,600
This narrative only exists

2063
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,648
To get them to buy his pills

2064
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,952
This is deeply abusive marketing

2065
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,744
Creating a feeling of lack

2066
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:32,096
Something's wrong with you when it's not

2067
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:32,864
It's just

2068
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,632
Gross

2069
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,192
Yeah I mean it's it's just mark

2070
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:39,776
That's what it's super abusive

2071
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:41,056
Yeah but that's how we got

2072
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:42,848
Mouthwash

2073
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:43,872
Sure

2074
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,664
They invented

2075
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:49,504
And then use floor cleaner but it feels minty

2076
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,272
It does

2077
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,344
Back

2078
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,368
He starts taking

2079
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,672
And he decides

2080
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,440
To go to

2081
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,720
Take call from liver

2082
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:05,632
If you work all we heard liberal call

2083
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:08,192
Love it he called in and had some

2084
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,472
Pics of Alex

2085
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,520
It is a position about a rod

2086
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,288
Rebel days

2087
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:15,872
Now liberal calls back in does he have his own show yet

2088
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:19,200
And I don't think he's going to get one after this

2089
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:23,040
So he calls in and I don't know exactly what point he

2090
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,064
Was trying to be

2091
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,344
But

2092
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,624
Alex

2093
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,696
Think what happened is that he forgot that

2094
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:31,232
Who Heat this caller was

2095
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,048
I think you forgot that you called in and it's

2096
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,584
Judgmental words for Alex

2097
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,376
Air Penny hears The Voice

2098
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,400
Any remembers

2099
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:43,264
And Alex starts screaming on here and it turns into a

2100
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,568
Hensley islamophobic Ranch

2101
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:47,104
Who's Ronaldo longest

2102
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:51,456
New York liberal what is your view on the situation

2103
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:53,760
Alex

2104
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,112
I wanted to speak on the run at 2 but then I heard the level of

2105
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:05,792
Nothing I hide nothing I admitted on a friend

2106
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:12,960
I'm scared of people

2107
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:34,208
But the reason why

2108
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:38,304
Good morning Christian why am I bothering

2109
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,352
Okay

2110
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,408
Brock Lesnar

2111
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:56,224
Tell me I have to figure out

2112
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:21,824
Give me the efficacy of galavant

2113
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:29,248
No I understand Alexa

2114
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:31,296
Can I get a word in edgewise I just wanted to

2115
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:34,368
The answer that

2116
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,928
But in any event Alex

2117
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:39,744
Efficacy of

2118
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,536
Pagando

2119
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:48,448
Timer for 5 minutes

2120
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:50,240
And I apologize to you

2121
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:54,848
Disgraceful Western man that needs to be given

2122
01:38:55,872 --> 01:39:02,016
Salvation and completion by you

2123
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:08,160
I'm going to let you take over

2124
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,512
I apologize

2125
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,632
Imma stop right now

2126
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,984
Man it feels good to go crazy

2127
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,544
This is not a person who's okay

2128
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,640
That's one of the most stunningly racist things I think I've heard

2129
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,712
Yeah

2130
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:33,504
It's big and it's not

2131
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,856
To uncommon for Alex you notes it certainly like

2132
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:41,184
But I think what happened is he heard liberals voice

2133
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,464
Remember Dosha.

2134
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:47,584
This guy took me to the woodshed

2135
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,656
He has to scream over him because he knows he can't let him talk

2136
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:55,520
Then Alex assumes that liberalism Muslim because he's criticizing Alex's

2137
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:58,336
Terrific anti-islam

2138
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:01,664
There's no reason

2139
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,712
Like based on the things that

2140
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:08,576
Liberal has said on the show

2141
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,112
This is just a performance

2142
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:11,648
Alex is doing this intentionally

2143
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,696
Not because he's so overcome by Passion

2144
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:17,280
He's he's you're able to rein it in once time to get to the brakes

2145
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,072
It's not so crazy that he starts

2146
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,352
Swearing on air

2147
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,632
Like this is just disgusting

2148
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,424
Piece of s*** person putting on an act

2149
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:29,568
Yeah he might as well put his hands over his ears and wet lalalalalalalalalala

2150
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,384
So he comes back

2151
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:35,200
Alex comes back from the break and he does allow liberal to talk

2152
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,016
Color eleison his point which I think

2153
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:42,624
It could be summed up as saying there's a there's a reason that there's a tension between Muslims and Christians

2154
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:44,416
When is propaganda

2155
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,720
And Alex has a responsibility to his audience

2156
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,512
Do a better job covering the topic

2157
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,816
Alex admits there are good

2158
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,352
Muslims but there's also

2159
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,144
Political Islam that's evil

2160
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:57,472
Sou decides what he's going to do is he's going to get up from the desk

2161
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,264
Map

2162
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,312
He's going to show the spread of Islam on the map

2163
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:04,896
And that's where this are we going to get the Warner Brothers

2164
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,432
Song is this

2165
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,480
This slip

2166
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,760
Is

2167
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,296
It entails

2168
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,320
Intense

2169
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:15,392
Insane freak out that Alex has that really

2170
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
Startled

2171
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:18,464
Why was my place

2172
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,744
Walk over here

2173
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,792
Who is shell people

2174
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,584
Animal shelter map of the whole world

2175
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:31,264
About where we were 14

2176
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,800
100 years ago

2177
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,688
Wealth

2178
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:41,504
I appreciate that sir you weren't still on Wikipedia

2179
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:06,592
Whatever your opinion on Trump

2180
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:11,200
We can all agree that the most

2181
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,224
Was the Avalon

2182
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:15,552
Free memes

2183
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:18,624
The most crazy thing is what Alex

2184
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,928
He just stopped off

2185
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:24,000
He did and I couldn't

2186
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,304
See from the camera angle

2187
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:28,608
Just like

2188
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,936
He is such a f****** rage-filled a******

2189
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:36,544
This is so unacceptable if I were working in that studio

2190
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,568
No

2191
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:42,176
Be subjected to a boss acting that childishly and frightening Lee in a workspace

2192
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,992
Would be terrible

2193
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,576
Alex

2194
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,600
November

2195
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,136
March of

2196
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:56,768
When the Alex gets back he tries to claim that liberals point was that Alex's pretending that Islam is expansion

2197
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,072
But it's really Christianity that's expanding

2198
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,120
Thanks which wasn't liberal the saying at all

2199
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:06,752
I suspect this is one part Alex just trying to save face but that blow up when you just listen to

2200
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:10,080
And another part of him having no ability to synthesize information

2201
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:13,408
The people are given to a man either way that's some scary s***

2202
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:15,712
Like that that's a that behavior is

2203
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:17,760
He's

2204
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,040
On the job

2205
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:19,808
Yeah

2206
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:23,136
I don't know who this new like this boom operator is who doesn't have a name

2207
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:26,208
And I wasn't

2208
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:30,304
Boomer Esiason to not have to deal with it

2209
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,888
Unionized

2210
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:39,520
Philosophically I'm against unions

2211
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,056
I'm starting to see why

2212
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,920
Boom operators 435 local

2213
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:48,480
You know I do

2214
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,760
I do

2215
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,040
Feelso

2216
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:55,392
F****** broken down by the show any other show if the host walked off

2217
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,672
Holy

2218
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,768
What is Matt walked off in a huff

2219
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,048
Giselle pissed off

2220
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,840
Hope you like holyshit

2221
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:09,216
Alex ending in shower

2222
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,008
He's barging offset

2223
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:17,920
Ostensibly because no one gave him a handy walk around by

2224
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,712
Get so Furious

2225
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:23,808
It's also in the middle of trying to explain how Islam taking over the world

2226
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,344
Yeah

2227
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:26,624
Right

2228
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,416
You never stop talking

2229
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,184
Canceled

2230
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,768
Not canceled like in the social medias

2231
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:36,096
It is funny

2232
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:38,656
Bet he exemplifies why

2233
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,240
White American men

2234
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:46,848
Should be allowed to do something while at the same time telling people

2235
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,640
Islamic date

2236
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:49,664
Should be allowed to do

2237
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,224
He also exemplifies why I like

2238
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:52,992
Standards

2239
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,528
In media res

2240
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:58,880
Like and why it's good to have a boss because someone should be

2241
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:01,440
Chastising him for that up solution consequence

2242
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:04,000
For this kind of behavior cuz it's not okay

2243
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:08,864
I don't think so according to him

2244
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,960
And what's interesting to me is like Alex comes back

2245
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:14,496
He doesn't leave

2246
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:17,312
The show

2247
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,080
You're done for

2248
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:28,320
We'll play some do whatever cannot be on the air

2249
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:30,624
Until you called out you have shown yourself

2250
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:38,048
Two gigantic islamophobic rant and this blow-up offset like you car not

2251
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,584
In a place whatever

2252
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,864
Whatever's going on

2253
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,144
Whatever it is

2254
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,424
Maybe you're mad about this

2255
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:47,008
Wikipedia iodine she knows maybe you took too many yourself

2256
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:48,544
No one knows

2257
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,568
No one cares

2258
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,848
For your own sake

2259
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:51,872
You can't be on a

2260
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,920
No one does that cuz no one

2261
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:59,552
Conair is really fascinating is he takes

2262
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,320
Calls

2263
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,600
And no one is like

2264
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,624
Are you okay

2265
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,416
No one

2266
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:06,720
Treats what just happened on the show

2267
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:08,000
As if it's something

2268
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:11,840
To be concerned about I think they know what I just did

2269
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,608
Crazy

2270
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,656
That's the appeal

2271
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,424
Yeah

2272
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:19,008
So Alex before he gets back to Carl's starts

2273
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:19,776
Nationalized

2274
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:20,800
You know like hey man

2275
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:23,104
I'm just mad about Islam expanding

2276
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:28,480
I really got to emphasize that this is all just

2277
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:32,576
Because he saw two Muslim family families in a hamburger

2278
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:36,160
She gets back to that so everything comes.

2279
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,720
Islamism

2280
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,256
Basically a male

2281
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:44,608
Offended

2282
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:45,376
My

2283
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:48,448
That little restaurant

2284
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:53,312
Eating food

2285
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,360
Anime man

2286
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,528
I believe Western Civilization Superior

2287
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:12,256
You know it my wife and daughters didn't do what I said

2288
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:16,096
Says Western Civilization

2289
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:20,448
Women are happy with that either

2290
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,728
You know how you don't do that

2291
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,776
Like a man

2292
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,848
But it doesn't mean

2293
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:31,200
Weird line to draw the left loves that

2294
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:41,440
Watch this in Austin restaurant literally this guy

2295
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:43,232
It's not literally that

2296
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,536
It's people eating hamburger

2297
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,328
You dumbass hole

2298
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,096
Like

2299
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:51,680
He's he's responding as if he just saw a stolen

2300
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:52,960
It dams hamburger

2301
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:55,264
You didn't see it you didn't see anything

2302
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,800
You saw people having hamburgers

2303
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,616
This is so important

2304
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,384
Because

2305
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,432
He can pretend all he wants

2306
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,224
Betty just has a problem with

2307
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,248
These

2308
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:06,528
These critiques

2309
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:07,808
That he has of Islam

2310
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,832
But he doesn't

2311
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,184
He sees every single person that he identifies as a Muslim

2312
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,000
Indicative of the worst

2313
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,280
Thing of Islam

2314
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:19,072
Is all Universal

2315
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,352
It is

2316
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,936
I don't know I don't know what to say it's

2317
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,752
It's awful he's an awful awful person

2318
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:28,288
Oh yeah and even then

2319
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,080
He revealed his big

2320
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:34,176
Like oh they dominate their women and they make them wear hoods

2321
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,712
His criticism is

2322
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,504
A sense of scale

2323
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:41,600
Not philosophy of course you need to dominate women

2324
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,392
You need to make sure that you can

2325
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,416
Control their behaviors

2326
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:49,792
But you don't put a hood on them that's my biggest issue with Islam

2327
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:50,816
Wow

2328
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,352
I should tell you

2329
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,656
Alex has Steve pieczenik on again

2330
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:56,960
And it's worth

2331
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:01,312
It's just you saying that it was a surgical strike

2332
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:05,408
Everything is fine

2333
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:08,736
It's very Bland and dry

2334
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:11,296
But the thing I think it's notable is it at no point

2335
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,576
Everything even talked about

2336
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:14,880
Him being on a couple days ago and it nope

2337
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:18,976
Steve real quick

2338
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:22,048
I understand your feelings on a run

2339
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:24,608
Question you want to talk about

2340
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,376
Do you know

2341
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:28,192
Alex Alex doesn't care

2342
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:30,752
Or doesn't even realize

2343
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:31,520
That was

2344
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:34,080
Some of the content that Steve brought to the show

2345
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:37,152
I'm flabbergasted

2346
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,688
I have no idea

2347
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:42,784
He did just storm off of the show with no consequence

2348
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,064
On Stroop

2349
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:47,136
It's Alex

2350
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:48,928
You know talking about how he's

2351
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:49,952
That's blow ups

2352
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:50,720
Call Michelle

2353
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:57,632
Yeah you would describe it as having Riley still did the show

2354
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:59,680
Alex describes it is

2355
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,704
Fun

2356
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,752
Don't like going crazy

2357
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,848
And if you watched

2358
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:08,896
Actor or that's

2359
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:09,920
Really

2360
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:10,944
Blowing up on

2361
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:14,016
Something I feel like

2362
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:15,808
That was real

2363
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:20,672
That's insane baby

2364
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,256
But I do want the dog

2365
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:27,584
Fun because it felt good to run

2366
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,376
Yesterday I

2367
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,192
Hummingbird

2368
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:33,984
Handsome

2369
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:36,288
Jump around the house and I did it on Ellen Show

2370
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:40,896
Serious subjects

2371
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:44,480
The collars calling thanking me all your great your great know you're great

2372
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:45,760

2373
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:47,296
Yeah

2374
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,320
Where's the majority

2375
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:49,856
Let's come together let's do it

2376
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,720
People on TV that take themselves so seriously they don't have some funds

2377
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,280
What are you talkin about

2378
01:50:57,536 --> 01:51:03,680
You stormed off your f****** now because you're now

2379
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,704
Seriously

2380
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,984
I'm f******

2381
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:10,080
Real that is behavior

2382
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:12,640
Such a horrible rationalization for his

2383
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,920
Petulant outburst

2384
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,712
Implicit

2385
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:20,064
I just let myself off the chain just having a little bit of f*** that's what you just cried will then like

2386
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,880
No restfully islamophobic ramps

2387
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:23,648
That's how you

2388
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:26,208
Is that how you have fun

2389
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,232
I mean

2390
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,792
Vegetable

2391
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,840
You know what that says about you yeah

2392
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:33,376
Yeah

2393
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:36,448
I mean the place that I

2394
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,728
The

2395
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:40,544
The owner of the company was also the boss and he was a giant

2396
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:41,824
At the same way

2397
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,848
But even then

2398
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:43,616
That's

2399
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:44,896
That's like

2400
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:47,968
At least you know when to be ashamed of

2401
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:49,504
Did you know

2402
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:53,344
Yeah you can be a petulant child and you can be a f******

2403
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,368
Shity person

2404
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:57,440
You own your own business so you get to avoid

2405
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:58,720
Consequences for your actions

2406
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:01,536
But at least be ashamed

2407
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,584
Alex is kind of expressing like

2408
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,888
Like a little bit of

2409
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,424
But he's trying to

2410
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,192
Co-op

2411
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:08,960
Anna just

2412
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:10,496
Howie Mandel

2413
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:12,800
How do you trying to rationalize like

2414
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:19,968
So I wanted to do this episode because I wanted to check in on

2415
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,992
Evolving

2416
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,808
Situation analysis response

2417
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:24,832
Is really just

2418
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,880
Aggressive islamophobia

2419
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:29,184
Like it now this is transition

2420
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,720
The show is

2421
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:31,488
Is just

2422
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,280
Alex freaking out in

2423
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:35,072
And screaming about how bad Islam is

2424
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,352
And I don't

2425
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:39,680
No in tireli if that alone would have been worth

2426
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:40,704
Episode

2427
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:42,496
But Alex

2428
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:43,776
Having Zach on

2429
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:46,080
The livestream I think certainly

2430
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:48,640
Makes it

2431
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:51,200
Every time you dropped your

2432
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:56,064
That definitely

2433
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:58,112
That definitely is like

2434
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:00,160
I say go support Dan's Hamburgers

2435
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:03,744
These these are the things to that like really are important

2436
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:04,512
Don't understand

2437
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:05,280
Like

2438
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:07,584
When Alex screams about Islam

2439
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:13,984
Grooming gangs in the UK

2440
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,264
And that's important

2441
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,800
But I think more

2442
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:18,336
Is understanding that

2443
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:20,128
Him seeing Muslims in public

2444
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,664
In places

2445
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,712
That are indicative of integration

2446
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:25,248
And like you said being at the mall

2447
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:28,832
The pool supply shop enjoying a nice hamburger meal

2448
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:32,160
Those are the sorts of things that drive him crazy

2449
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:34,464
And lead to disorder that outburst

2450
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,256
It's the proof of integrate

2451
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,048
If the proof of coexist

2452
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,584
Infuriate him

2453
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:40,352
Because

2454
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:41,632
Maybe

2455
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:44,192
Those are indications that we can get along

2456
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:47,264
But everybody can just be fine with each other

2457
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,544
We can't handle

2458
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,336
Because he wants a holy war

2459
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:56,992
Book of Revelations is never going to happen Dan if we all just like each other all the time

2460
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,576
How are we going to get the

2461
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:01,600
Rapture

2462
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:02,880
If everybody just fine

2463
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:09,280
Stop them

2464
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:10,816
Angry bull fight

2465
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:17,472

I've definitely never watch Laguna Beach Four Seasons get new trade made hats

2481
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:15,584
He was pretty cool

2482
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:19,936
Trey was like having to take points away from his social conscience

2483
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:26,336
I think we have to give back trays don't know you made hack I'm sorry also had a guy

2485
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:30,176
He also had a friend named Polster

2486
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,528
Holster holster

2487
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:35,552
Works for us

2488
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:40,416
There was a bit of a joke running jokes every time poster was on

2489
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:43,488
Naked name would come up on screen would be a different

2490
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:48,608
Busiest excitable guy

2491
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:52,960

01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,864
Do you want to have a problem

2500
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:26,752
Thank you very much, and finally

2501
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:27,520

Get back to

2508
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:55,936
But I think if we did much more

2509
01:56:57,984 --> 01:56:58,752
Exhaust

2510
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:03,360
There's a balance between exhausting everybody who didn't

2511
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:05,664
To celebrate the people who did

2512
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:11,040
And not celebrating the people who donated and I appreciate everyone's patience

2513
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:11,808
We will get that

2514
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,344
We do love
