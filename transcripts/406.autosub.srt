Mbbr Dan Jordan

7
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,168
Have you ever been late

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
Because of daylight savings

9
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,056
Yeah I'm sure I have but I

10
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Absolutely doesn't stick out of my head because you're late all the time

11
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
Various employment but I had

12
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,160
Not super out of the arresting me this because texting before the show

13
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,488
I told you I had no idea

14
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
Exactly

15
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
11 and I thought it was 9:30 in the morning and it was actually 10:30

16
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,712
You were like let's do 11:00 News 10:17 and I haven't even showered yet

17
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
No we're not doing

18
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,832
No I don't know I don't know I guess like

19
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:07,232
I was obviously so much more aware of it cuz nobody talks about going around

20
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
And then in the past like this is

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
Probably the first time I've been caught

22
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
Completely unaware

23
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
Like

24
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168
All these other daylight

25
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
Saving Time instituted iJustine

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
Tons of dumb jokes on Twitter

27
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:24,384
This is the first time I didn't see anything going on

28
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
Forward

29
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,856
I've been really busy too with preparation for this episode to so it's been pretty crunch

30
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:39,232
Time kind of stuff time to dick around her

31
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,792
I don't know but anyway I'm on

32
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,096
I'm still on Old daylight savings time

33
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:50,496
On your checks

34
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,592
So Jordan doesn't because why do much about that being late because of daylight savings

35
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,408
They doing a lot about Alex Jones

36
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,248

Money off that heroin

70
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
Why you pimp so good

71
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,335

78
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
Based on Alex's

79
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,431
Emotional support Liberals are crazy

80
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,831
I did actually in the form of a cartoon and I sent it your way and you have turned it into a

81
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,231
Over on others

82
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
If you just go there and I'll direct you

83
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
GTV

84
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
The store where you can buy and there's that there's

85
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
Purple Penguin

86
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,799
Incredible thank you very much

87
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,127
Very oblique

88
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
They got crossover appeal.

89
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Go away

90
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
Enjoy it's a great cranky looking

91
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
It is it is Ty's

92
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
Haunting

93
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
So Jordan

94
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
Lot of meat on the play lot of stuff to get into but

95
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
Before we get down to business

96
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
We got a

97
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Take a little moment

98
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Here

99
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Another contact dropped

100
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,591
From Today Show

101
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,063
That's the best decision I think he's ever made I would suck around and listen

102
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:55,231
March 1st is when Alex gets back from his vacation to seapac where of course we covered

103
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
Right but at least you didn't get Coronavirus

104
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
Remains to be seen

105
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,007
According to Stats still developing story

106
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
There's still

107
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:14,175
See you around any kind of exposure that might happen should be one person at CPAC racetrack

108
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
For Coronavirus

109
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,783
I would like to speculate because

110
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
Oh yeah I know not not going to bother with that

111
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
But Alex was very dumb rally

112
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
She did some other dumb

113
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
And stuff and he's back

114
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,279
In studio

115
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,559
Sunday episode

116
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,095
He is returned

117
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,935
And I was hoping that he would talk about the route

118
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,263
It was a disaster

119
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
It does not come up

120
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,639
At all know when he talks about going to see

121
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
C-pack he claims that he was going

122
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
Repack in order to gauge

123
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,807
How strong the neocon

124
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,623
Project MC2

125
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
It's pretty

126
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,511
Secret investigation

127
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:05,119
So we're starting on the 1st I will get through the 4th and the reason that I cut it off there

128
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
Instead of going home

129
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Second

130
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
On the 5th

131
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
On Thursday

132
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Alex shaved his head

133
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,199
So I thought I was unable to avoid that information right

134
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,271
Alex shaved his goddamn head on the Shelf

135
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
But he has a bald ass head

136
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
So from the 5th onward

137
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
It's a new era of Alex

138
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,743
True

139
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
So in essence this episode is the last

140
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,959
Last few days left of Harry Alex

141
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,847
Bcadc going through the last years of bees

142
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Ain't nobody

143
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,759
So we start here on the 1st and Alex

144
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
I guess he had some premonition

145
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
About something

146
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
Well my advice.

147
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
President Trump is this

148
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Where

149
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
The Ides

150
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
March

151
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
Yesterday afternoon

152
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
I was looking up

153
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Leap year

154
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,519
Day here we go or a 29th and I and I went

155
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
Beware the Ides of March

156
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Delete

157
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
I didn't watch Saturday Night Live last night

158
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
In fact I went to bed pretty early

159
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
My friends

160
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
His birthday party for my children

161
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Happy birthday

162
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
Play Dar bad I thought

163
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,487
Beware the Ides of March and I got up this morning

164
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
Videos up on Saturday Night Live

165
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,167
And they're making threats about Julius Caesar and the Ides of March

166
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,239
Okay alright

167
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
Literally every year Alex ominously talks about the Ides of March

168
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,551
The few literate references he has it makes him sound smart research to dumpy

169
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
T-shirts

170
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Either that

171
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
Or you super in

172
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
Late 70s Hard Rock

173
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,303
Oh yeah I'm your vehicle baby I'll get out of here you want to go out of here

174
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,607
Wendy's overdrive songs

175
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Karaoke numbers

176
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
I think Alex wants you to think

177
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,799
Thank you psychic and he's in touch with some larger thing in the universe because he thought about the Ides of March and then the next morning

178
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
Easy something reasonably close to that on SNL

179
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
So he must be reading the zeitgeist

180
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,455
I have a suspicion that Alex did watch

181
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,551
Because he's really mirroring things really close

182
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,879
Okay he's upset about a joke and John mulaney's intro

183
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,023
Mullaney's B he talks about he sets up a joke by establishing that Caesar is where leap year started

184
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,583
What's the leap year apart is even

185
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
Was the lady host

186
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Last week

187
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,751
Now I remember where we are

188
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:56,639
Mullaney's whole joke is it leap year started under Caesar and another thing they did back then was all the Senators stabbed

189
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Because he was power

190
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
The tiger that joke is him saying that he called his lawyer to see if he could say that joke and his lawyer called another lawyer who said it was cool

191
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
So there's there's a layer to the joke

192
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
All right so what was the first lawyer thing

193
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,791
I don't know

194
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,375
That's not good you slice it Alex's interpretation of things is really on

195
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
To characterize mulaney's bitters

196
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
Is a fret that they're coming after Trump Caesar Style

197
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
I was just

198
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
I'm not sure if that joke is

199
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,639
Great and I bet it'd probably could be approved with a couple more rounds of edits

200
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
Clearly a joke

201
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,575
Like if Nick DiPaolo got onstage at SNL and started talking about how all the black people in the country need to go and started throwing

202
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
Alex would get on hair the next day to defend that is free speed 100% complaining about how if depalo faces any

203
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:48,863
Why does it's proof of the authoritarian left absolute Sterling Americana

204
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
But a joke at the dear Leader's

205
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
Expense that's no longer a joke that's a

206
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
Ignore the fact that has all the characteristics structure of a joke

207
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,871
He was sat on a comedy program and that people laugh

208
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
Apollo to the tag

209
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
That's no joke

210
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,015
My point is that Alex does not give a f*** about any Notions

211
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,367
If you have the ability he would probably try and put Mulaney in jail

212
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,439
At to Mulaney

213
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:19,839
What are the primary preoccupations on this Sunday show is obviously a Coronavirus

214
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,399
Studio heaven

215
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,983
Not been able to cover it while Mike Adams Alan Keyes

216
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
We're hosting Wiley

217
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Right

218
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
Situation is Alex season is there

219
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Two camps in the world

220
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
And what is saying that the virus is a hoax and it's not real

221
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
Saying that it's the end of humanity

222
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Right and

223
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
I think there's a middle ground

224
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Sure

225
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
Track record

226
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
My Northstar is telling

227
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Is it

228
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,543
I really think it's a right concern

229
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,151
What about that homeless guy was out there and there shouldn't

230
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
Saying the virus is a total of

231
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Big deal

232
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
That is a total fraud

233
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
There's a camp saying it's the end of the world Armageddon

234
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
No that's your guy

235
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,191
Call me that's literally arnesen.

236
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
Like Adam said it's over dramatic Lone Survivor so he's communist Chinese

237
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,663
Is globalist now like Adam

238
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
That's weird here's my problem with the toucan

239
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,807
He is in both of them cycle

240
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,647
That is something that's going to make things very confused

241
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Right

242
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
Stream on the like everyone's going to die

243
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
At least

244
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,375
Times you've been very much indeed.

245
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,727
You got to get my silver if you want to survive

246
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,775
He's been really extreme on that note but

247
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
He's trying to walk that back now

248
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,663
There is a real sense that he's trying to make this a more

249
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,527
Real-world propaganda narrative okay that is by Focus

250
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,111
Sing almost entirely on the idea of the supply chain disruption

251
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Okay will be

252
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
Because by the

253
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Coronavirus in China

254
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Right

255
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,279
I said I don't know how deadly this virus really is

256
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,119
I don't know how communicable

257
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
But I said

258
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
This is going to attack the world economy

259
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
This is an attack on President Trump

260
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Is an attack on America

261
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Sure

262
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
The

263
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
Supply chain attack

264
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
How did the virus is deadly or not

265
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,231
You can leave but the response

266
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
And the Hysteria

267
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
And the way the media unify

268
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,215
Except the United States we did it first

269
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
I'm sorry it's just true

270
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
Scary Ashley

271
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,407
Check mr. president not sure what's going on but

272
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
To this is classic Alex right here this is what we call in there and narrative pivot trying to be engaged

273
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Is it in real time

274
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,071
After this point he's had tons of interviews with Mike Francis Boyle and Mike Adams

275
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,631
Almost every show has been on

276
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
Talking about definitive proof is viruses bio-weapon

277
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
It's probably race Pacifica

278
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:43,615
Chinese either intentionally used by themselves or they accidentally released it while planning to use it on us

279
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
It's been a

280
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
Ceramic the idea that there are 10

281
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
10000 more dead than China has said

282
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
It's already loose in the United States

283
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
I'm coming for you

284
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
Like it's B that's been

285
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,671
Largely the the the

286
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
The editorial well you are the

287
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,559
Your part Alex

288
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,143
That's different

289
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:14,591
Since you're in denial that Alex has brought up about how the virus will throw off the economy and it's all intact

290
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:19,199
Driver of the Tonto

291
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
That has been something you said but now it's

292
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
The main effect

293
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
And that to me it is indicative of a

294
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
I feel

295
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
I agree

296
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
So Alex talks about the sea

297
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
CDC and how they're eating Annika

298
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Conspiracy or so

299
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,143
Look at the CDC telling him it's no big deal and not a problem

300
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
I went

301
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
But it's bigger than that

302
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
When it becomes a problem

303
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,639
Then they're going to say you didn't respond properly to

304
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Ladies and gentlemen

305
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
Three days ago it's like they flipped the light

306
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Switch

307
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,599
Every radio show that's National that's

308
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,695
Establishment and newspapers on MSNBC

309
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
All the usual set

310
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,535
I've got dozens of reports right here

311
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,351
President Trump cause this present

312
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
Trump trying to cover it up

313
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
I mean yeah

314
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,591
I don't believe seeing an

315
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
I don't believe in MSNBC

316
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
It must be a hoax

317
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,135
Because you're saying it's serious yes I'm saying it's serious

318
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Because

319
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
How the whole media is Unified

320
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,279
How they use it for martial law in Italy and

321
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,607
World Switzerland oven

322
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Clearly this is a big Global move

323
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
People

324
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
Get ready

325
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
The narrative

326
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,151
The plan that he's describing is that the CDC

327
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,783
He came out and they said no big deal

328
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,111
Trump into not doing any

329
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
And then when it's

330
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Bad Trump looks

331
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
What's the food

332
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
I don't care

333
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
I hate

334
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
Describe an air tube out the the idea that CNN is writing articles about how Trump's response has been

335
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
Flawed or is there been things that

336
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,567
Could have been done that weren't done

337
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,711
You know experts saying what the heck what the hell and then

338
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Dum Dums

339
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:35,391
Who think that every article that's negative about Trump is an attack on him just must not be true

340
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
Just describing it an ecosystem

341
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,279
Badfinger

342
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Absolutely

343
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
So

344
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Alex

345
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
Has this going on

346
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
All

347
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Disruption

348
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
Of the supply chain in order to

349
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Attack Trump

350
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,079
And there's a second

351
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Back to this

352
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,895
And that is what the virus in China

353
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
Itself

354
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,247
Was used by China so they could

355
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
Shut down there,

356
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Right

357
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
It makes no siren fuse

358
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,183
Results that would piss their employees

359
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
Their workers

360
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
And the stockholders off

361
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,559
Enchilada right now

362
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
I love enchiladas

363
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,847
China just shut their economy now they just lost a big trade war with America

364
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,919
What's happening

365
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
The Bible has sold us out

366
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Okay

367
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,087
But if they then released a virus I bought from Obama

368
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,415
Thanos not super lethal but does kill some people in

369
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
Spredfast

370
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,767
As well

371
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
And then

372
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
Out of that they can shut down there

373
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,983
We can order the city shut down

374
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Kills

375
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
Global Supply Chain

376
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,175
They just checkmated Trump in America and you know that

377
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
What they did

378
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
With the Deep state

379
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,319
Weather ungu

380
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,695
When down the economy worldwide

381
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
And then say

382
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
President-trump

383
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,791
And America

384
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
Obviously overblown

385
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Okay

386
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,007
I'm not even sure Alex really even cares what he's

387
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,103
Saying like he's just kind of happy he was able to get to the end of the scent

388
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,663
Start running out of air

389
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:39,551
This entire conspiracy selling sounds great needs this virus in order to

390
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,647
The cover for just shutting down their economy and lower

391
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
Problems that he has considering his

392
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,743
Years long-established rhetoric

393
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
So as Alex's selling it

394
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
China wants to shut down its economy

395
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Disrupt the supply chain which

396
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,959
Embarrass Trump give the Nationalist a black eye or whatever

397
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,055
Checkmate so in order to achieve his goal they purchased a virus from Obama

398
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
Of course I sit on their own count

399
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,991
The reason we needed to go this route is that if they were just a slow down the economy or shut

400
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Factories it would

401
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,696
Which Chinese traditional character a lot about Alex gets into trouble seeing as every single time

402
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,768
We talked about China he mentions forced abortions

403
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
Factories

404
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,912
Every single characterization of China is. One that really cares too much of the workers are pissed off

405
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,448
Conception

406
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,056
Exist in the Infowars universe is not a government that we need a virus

407
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,152
Do use a some kind of subterfuge to get away with doing something to workers don't like

408
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
Authoritarian

409
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
If there's dissent

410
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,480
They cracked down on it

411
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
They ran it

412
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
They rent they ran a tank over a

413
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,880
That's really where this narrative has a problem

414
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
And the fact there's no reason

415
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
We're trying to do this thing to its

416
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,512
Be the goal Alex's is claiming they're seeking

417
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
Their motive doesn't

418
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:58,400
Makes sense especially given the fact that if the goal is hurting Trump on an economic basis

419
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,472
Plenty of other moves China could make that would hurt them a bit

420
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
Waymore's

421
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Oh yeah

422
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
Another problem is the China has been

423
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
Consistently closing down manufacturer

424
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
Flights for years

425
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:16,320
In 2018 Reuters reported on 1000 manufacturing plants being scheduled be shuttered by 2020 in Beijing

426
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,184
As part of a program aimed at curbing Smog and boosting income in neighboring regions

427
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:26,560
There's even president for China shutting down industry temporarily to deal with any cute

428
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Problem

429
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,608
Which is basically the situation

430
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,888
Can we find ourselves in with

431
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
Coronavirus

432
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
Back in October 27th

433
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,776
19 MPR reported on how China's Ministry of environment

434
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,312
It sent out inspectors across

435
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,896
Country as factories are following environmental laws

436
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,760
It was estimated that a full 40% of China's factories were shut down temporarily

437
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,552
In an attempt to address

438
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
It's being done

439
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,856
Buy filthy manufacturer

440
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,904
That's tens of thousands of fact

441
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:59,072
Beside the predicted effect of disrupting the supply chain with some companies shifting some manufacturing to India and Bangladesh

442
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,608
And others just not being able to

443
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
Reproduce at full capacity

444
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,728
Once the work of the ministry of environment had been done

445
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,776
Things began to get back to normal

446
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,872
Angela Alex and most of the people in the world probably don't even remember that this happened

447
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:14,432
The China shut down almost half of its factories lessons

448
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,712
3 years ago

449
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
No

450
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,784
I'm February 27th

451
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,624
CNBC reported that the national retail Federation

452
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
Veo was announcing that quote

453
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,512
Some of the coronavirus driven supply chain disruption in China is subsiding

454
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,376
Zeo went on to add a number of the larger companies has started to indicate that the

455
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,192
At the signs they're getting for the Chinese market

456
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
Some of the products

457
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
Coming back online

458
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
Timer Porta Dunbar

459
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Starbucks

460
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
Who's announcing that after taking a huge hit

461
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,128
The clothes most

462
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
Hibbett stores in China things are returning to normal

463
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
The vast majority of their shops have reopened

464
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:53,344
Early signs of recovery are emerging as the coffee giant is sinks

465
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
Sequential Improvement in weekly sales

466
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,256
On March 7th at 9 Ikea locations reopening

467
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
China

468
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,680
DIY the South China Morning Post reported on March 4th that over 90% of firms in the Guam

469
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,752
Province have resumed operation

470
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,848
They're still very serious issues to deal with in terms of smaller and

471
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,152
Medium-sized businesses returning to operation

472
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,456
But a lot of the reason that's been slow.

473
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,736
Come back is because of Trance

474
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,760
Deportation related is

475
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,904
As the financial times reported what are the main issues is that a lot of workers are from rural areas

476
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,000
And they're stranded there with no easy way to commute back to areas like Beijing

477
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
Get back to work

478
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:38,144
This gets into a complicated Dynamic rail service is not back online throughout the country

479
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,472
And also World Authority and smaller Villages are

480
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
It's raised there.

481
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
Downtown people entering or leaving the village

482
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,152
These local authorities are worried that they'll be held responsible if they're raised

483
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Is infection

484
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,456
So they're not acting without the

485
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,248
Explicit direction to the central government

486
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
According to an article in the financial

487
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,344
Showtimes citing a scholar from

488
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
The point is that we're not looking at a complete

489
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,208
Perpetual shutdown of China's

490
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,072
Decent signs that things are starting to return to a more normal pot

491
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,984
I just to be perfectly clear I'm not trying to pretend that there won't be rippleffect so there won't be difficulties check cuz even if child

492
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,032
Who's back to 100% capacity today

493
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,616
It would still take awhile for that disruption to work its way through this

494
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Supply chain

495
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
They're going to be some hiccup

496
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
But it doesn't look like the

497
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
Doomsday that Alex wants to

498
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Portrayed to be

499
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
And they're also

500
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
Obviously things

501
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
There are unforeseen

502
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
We have no idea

503
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,976
How things are going to develop a week from naps

504
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,768
So there could be

505
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
Something else that is a wrench in the

506
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,632
But based on the information that's available now

507
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
Not to say that China is out of the woods

508
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
Do not say everything is resolved

509
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,544
There are indications

510
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,360
Is that there is some resuming coming back

511
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
The normal witch

512
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,944
Is something that I would never want you to know

513
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
Yeah that's

514
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,552
You can find a lot of business folk Racine what's going on

515
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,856
And their responses to suggest that we need to divert

516
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
Fire supply chain

517
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,976
To limit the impact of something happening in China has on the larger economy

518
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,816
You would think that this would be the number one most obvious

519
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
Predictable response

520
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
The business would have

521
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Scale Market disruption

522
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,984
So if China were trying to do this whole stunt to embarrass

523
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,288
Trump they would have to be doing it knowing

524
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Fully welded

525
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,872
The odds are that business will flee the country in the aftermath

526
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
That seems dumb

527
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:29,504
And honestly my larger point is that Alex's conspiracy really makes no sense

528
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
Unless you're working backwards

529
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
You need to make a way to

530
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,648
Make this look like an attack on Trump

531
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:39,488
You just kind of right the rest as you see fit

532
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,072
That's the only way that this makes any kind of sense

533
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
Here's the conclusion

534
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
I'm trying to reach

535
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,520
I know I need to make not even a series of plausible steps to get there but any steps at all

536
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,408
Because it's so much about the supply chain.

537
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
Alex is trying to like

538
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,296
Hey man I don't know I don't know if I said it was super deadly

539
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
It's over for Humanity

540
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,928
That's a problem so I'm not going to sit here

541
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,976
Mister racks or Diss track

542
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,000
From what we said

543
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,840
That old Joan says the virus is super deadly

544
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
Limbaugh says it's no problem

545
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,240
And sold the stock market start spanking what you had

546
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,824
We said get ready because

547
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
In the lab

548
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
Obama transferred

549
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
ITube

550
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,480
China on record mainstream news 2015

551
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
The big debate about it

552
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
It's now been released

553
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:40,672
And the media doesn't want to debate about how it's man-made and who released it and who

554
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
Promise

555
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
Tesla mean

556
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,096
What's the weather

557
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,264
Tim shut their people down and treat them like slave and prop up their stock markets are totally rigged

558
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
China

559
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,592
So this is kind of gaslighter

560
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
I think that Alex is realize that he's come

561
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,200
Completely out of step with the right-wing media

562
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Trump

563
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,576
And not only that kind of out of step with the new information that's coming out about the virus so

564
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
Now he's pretending

565
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,928
You know I wasn't mostly talking about this being super deadly

566
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
Really weird thing to claim

567
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,792
Because I listen to his show and because of that

568
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,608
I can play you this Supercut of times that he and his friends

569
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
Said it was super deadly

570
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,496
So what we think they're doing is they're just putting the number of dad is a number of infected

571
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,544
All the dead bodies in body bags

572
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,336
Clearly this is much bigger

573
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,664
From your sources at the UN from your own research how bad is this

574
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,296
You have this also called

575
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,088
Computer game at

576
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
John's

577
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
Hopkinsville

578
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
The only figure I have seen

579
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
Seems to be

580
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,144
Paml videre

581
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
BJ's

582
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,216
Angel

583
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:02,336
Bonjo Hayes time to get up and let's get to work folks not like you got a lot of money

584
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
About to be at 20%

585
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Mortality rate

586
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,248
Official numbers now show it has a much higher

587
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Death Race

588
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:16,672
Chinese government says 15%

589
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,256
Coronavirus development

590
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,584
Multiple kruschev people are dying that means it isn't hide

591
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
Fast

592
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,728
Coming out we know that it is indeed

593
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,568
Killing healthy young people that is killing a high number of those

594
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
That are infected

595
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,504
Jesse's viruses deadly it's not like stars and things that were just too hype up and scare people only killed a few hundred

596
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,808
This is already killed thousands and thousands

597
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,368
The videos are pouring out the Tchaikovsky

598
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,720
And it does have a high kill rate

599
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:55,072
5% is devastating

600
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:01,472
I treated a patient a month ago

601
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:06,848
Reported

602
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,504
And was treated with high doses of antibiotics

603
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
For Humanity

604
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
It will only be lone survivors

605
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:25,792
I'm not saying any of this to pump up and claims the guy of elevated wisdom or anyting but I knew a pivot was

606
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,144
That's part of why I keep playing that drop-in my God I'm saying it's over for

607
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,544
Humanity because I know from watching Infowars for as long as I have that they would eventually change the entire story to something

608
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,592
They pretend they didn't play this game

609
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
This is working

610
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Food buckets

611
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,712
I'm not going to sit here and pretend that Alex didn't

612
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,528
Occasionally mentioned the trade war is background motivation

613
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,832
Regina having false Flags itself

614
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,904
But the economic stuff was absolutely not front-and-center in these can

615
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Conspiracies

616
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:58,048
The primary driver of a lot of his coverage with surrounding how deadly this virus was and how it wasn't a hoax

617
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,864
Like you decided zika and SARS and Ebola were

618
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
All the stuff Alex said In that clip

619
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
Isn't true

620
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,032
It's not true that he didn't Focus strongly on how deadly the virus

621
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,336
It's not true that Obama sold the Viber

622
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
Vagina

623
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,152
It's not true there's proof that the viruses

624
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
Does man-made

625
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
Those are all just

626
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
Salvageable narrative pieces

627
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,296
He fell while he was trying to support his argument that Millions were gone

628
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
How to die

629
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,368
I need to buy a silver gargle in food buckets

630
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Want to survive

631
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,720
Much like viruses themselves propaganda narratives mutate

632
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,512
In order to accommodate the propagandists

633
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Meads

634
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,328
We saw the center breakdown of the Boston Bomber

635
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,424
Child was constantly shifting things around based on where you wanted it to go

636
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,984
He's doing that now and I kind of suspect there's Turi

637
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
Reasons why

638
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,288
The first is that he

639
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
Baby keeps going with his death

640
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,872
You put himself squarely at all.

641
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
With Trump

642
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,968
If you're screaming about how the virus is going to kill everyone in your hero present

643
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,760
Just calling it's a you know a

644
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,832
No big deal that's where all super prepared everything

645
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,136
It's good it's hard to maintain positive coverage

646
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,512
The second is the Jim Bakker f*****-up Alex's silver gargle sales plant

647
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
Which is really the main monetary reason for Alex.

648
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,608
Spread the medical side of the panel

649
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,680
Baker tried to sell his silver the same way Alex

650
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,472
By lying about it being proven to cure

651
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Your Coronavirus

652
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,824
In response the New York attorney general sent a cease-and-desist

653
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Baker went to public with

654
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:22,016
Damn and now there's a very explicit order from a state attorney general threatening to take action on someone selling his s***

655
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
That way

656
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,624
Alex obviously knows that and probably doesn't want to pay millions and fees

657
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
The food buckets sales

658
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
Are compatible

659
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
With a generalized Financial

660
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
However

661
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,608
So make some sense that you'd be able to play I Know Places narratives there and do

662
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
We can land

663
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,728
If that Anderson had to head

664
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,032
The state of Minnesota strip him of his gold sales lights

665
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:50,176
Bob Chapman weren't dead you could guarantee that this would be a long prophesied summer of rain

666
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
Selling gold

667
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:56,576
So damn hard you can guarantee of Trumps old trump-branded food bucket

668
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
This would be the biggest

669
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,904
Catastrophe in the history of the world

670
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Yeah

671
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
So there's another part there

672
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
That I think we should

673
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Pay attention

674
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:09,120
To the end of Alex's initial clip

675
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,400
For that Supercut

676
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
Earlier

677
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:17,824
His argument was the China would need to fake this virus outbreak in order to shut down their economy without angering the workers

678
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:22,432
But in that last clip you heard Alex use his standard line on

679
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
Economies completely faking

680
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,040
Control their workers are slaves in the state does whatever you want

681
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
He has these things

682
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
So down pat

683
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,160
It's like cruise control for him to spout the mop

684
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,976
She doesn't realize that if these things he's saying or true

685
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,536
He takes her legs out of this new conspiracies yeah

686
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,864
You just doesn't think things through very much and he's totally fine with internally

687
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,448
Consistency I think he's also probably feeling

688
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
Betrayal of

689
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:52,896
Man I've been out on the front here trying to do this and I turned and looked behind me and all of you guys are in the opposite direction

690
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
Motherfukers I've been trying

691
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,760
I've been fighting for you and I'm not getting the lines anymore

692
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,552
Now I want to be clear

693
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,440
This is how this show female this is how Sunday feel

694
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
This

695
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
Feeling

696
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,280
May not last

697
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Odell

698
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Jesus

699
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,912
Christ so anyway Alex believes that this

700
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,472
Viruses attack on Trump

701
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,312
Mostly what's going on but it's a primary thing

702
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,360
But not just Trump

703
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,920
A global problem needs a global solution

704
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,480
This is their answer

705
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,296
To follow sorrow in Brazil

706
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:36,160
Trump here into the brexit in the UK was having Europe this is yet

707
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
So I know it probably seems

708
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:44,096
Petty of me to keep playing these clips or Alex doesn't know bolsonaro's name there wasn't a bigger reason

709
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,912
It's been months and months that Alex has been boost

710
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,240
Bolsonaro for the first stretch was just calling in Brazil

711
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,032
Trump

712
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,336
You started mispronouncing it pretty wildly

713
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,896
At no point is anyone it enforced corrected

714
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,968
At no point is he realized he was f****** that up

715
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
It just seems like

716
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,784
He may not have a good grass

717
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
On the subject he's covering

718
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
And to make matters worse

719
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,184
Alex interviewed bolsonaro son at CPAC

720
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,512
Mere days before this episode that we're listening to here

721
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,536
Get me

722
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,840
If you listen to that

723
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:22,240
It seems like Alex is aware that he doesn't know this guy's dad's name he keeps referring to him as your father

724
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,056
Introduction to that interview

725
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,152
Here we are with the start of the Brazilian president who the real Maverick

726
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,480
Can't say his name

727
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,784
I definitely won't say at 2

728
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,552
His son

729
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,600
Space

730
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:46,048
Bolsonaro son pronounces it very Brazilian

731
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,800
So Alex is convinced one of the reasons

732
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
He's correct

733
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
What about this

734
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,688
The virus is just to attack Trump

735
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
Is because

736
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
The media

737
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,576
Media can't stop attacking Trump

738
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
You please one click

739
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:15,744
I don't know if I heard him play any others this is the only one I remember him playing

740
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,792
The demonstrates his claim

741
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,192
Elevator

742
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,760
And now that uses to the Health Emergency to attack the president

743
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:44,672
Well I think they're actually in for the president

744
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:50,304
At the CDC and the National Institutes of Health

745
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,120
Responsible

746
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,656
Donald Trump

747
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,824
Actually happened in China where you act like it's not a problem and then you respond

748
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:08,992
Vice president Pence and charges not a medical doctor

749
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:12,320
Pictures of total setup were proven right again

750
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:18,208
That's not the media salivating over the possibility of attacking Trump I did not hear us elevation

751
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,608
That's a very measured conversation about whether or not it's a good idea to point the finger at route for the administration is now

752
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Sample of Public Health

753
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
Situation

754
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
Obviously there's a

755
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,728
Ton of issues surrounding Trump's response

756
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,288
Man you look pretty well laid out by that anchor

757
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,592
But I'm not really going to get into that water right now

758
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
I'm not really well-versed enough

759
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,944
Be able to really assess a lot of that stuff while this

760
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,224
Situation is ongoing

761
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,040
And there are a lot of other sources people can get information

762
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,368
Trump I will address that the sorts of things

763
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:50,208
If Alex makes a specific Claim about something I don't mind getting into it

764
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:55,840
Risk making it seem like my discussion of this virus situation comes from a desire to score points

765
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,912
Against Trump so I'm going to I'm going to err on the side of

766
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,216
Not dwelling on that too much

767
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
I'm going to go with

768
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,288
It's bad but I don't know how bad

769
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
Haha

770
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,384
So that clip is important for one major Reed

771
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,456
This is not the media salivating to attack Trump

772
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:16,320
It's a restrained articulated series of points about what appeared to be bad signs about the governor

773
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,648
Response to a Public Health crisis

774
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Sure

775
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,512
But refrain does a rabbit attempt to smear Trump

776
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,864
Because Alex has predicted that would be what the globalist media does

777
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,192
On some level I'm convinced that Alex made to the prediction

778
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,984
But the globalist media would attack him for.

779
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,568
Because he knew that

780
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,872
I did never to believe the media would cover that

781
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,664
Derby stories about the

782
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,808
VC funding Garba voices of concern about putting pants in charge there be a lot of questions being asked about why

783
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,344
Certain things weren't done sooner

784
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,928
In order to inoculate the audience from hearing those questions as reporting

785
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,768
How much is established in advance that this sort of coverage is

786
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
Actually proof that the whole thing is a globalist plot to begin with

787
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
And the coverage is

788
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,656
Actually the payoff of that plan

789
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:08,032
They released the virus to synthesize doc Market to a tech Trump and now they get to attack him for not respond

790
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
The thing that

791
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:16,224
Kind of hilarious but Alex is underlying argument is that even his narrative include admission to Trump didn't handle the virus

792
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
Situation

793
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
Even he's not trying to deny that

794
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
He's just loudly yelling and pointing

795
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,624
Sing Somewhere Else

796
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,952
Only didn't respond well because the sea

797
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,744
CDC

798
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
Or something

799
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,352
It is weird I find the reality fascinating beds

800
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,656
As Long As Trump is doing an

801
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,680
Awful job

802
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,240
The media will criticize him for it

803
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,776
Which then makes

804
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,592
The white aggrievement conservative narrative

805
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,384
Function it's always an attack on

806
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,968
So that he can either do a really terrible

807
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
And the media

808
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,784
Call Somerset president

809
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
Or we can do a good job

810
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
And get praised

811
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
But if he gets praised by the media

812
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,976
Then that a grievance narrative doesn't really work

813
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
No

814
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,816
It's almost like the conservative

815
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:09,216
Propaganda machine is relying on Trump to be a shity president continued their Dairy

816
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
The long-standing pigs is talking about how like

817
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,128
Mikey would tell people in the media that if they wanted to destroy my grandpa

818
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,944
What they need to do is endorse him

819
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,784
Rite Aid in order for them to endorse him he'd have to not be a crazy wings

820
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,880
So it is kind of the same

821
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:31,488
Did you have to be not yourself in order for the media exactly

822
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,584
It's not a good way to to look at

823
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,912
No it's your ax

824
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,984
So we know that Alex is a humorless boob

825
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,288
And a weirdo

826
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,080
Yeah even though the right is getting better at

827
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Who robbed

828
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,456
I've always thought that just because he's not funny

829
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,992
And is a dork

830
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,040
Turns out there's another

831
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,880
I tell you this

832
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,672
So he's about to Brazosport

833
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,952
Dialect

834
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
Bragging

835
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
Play seen the difference

836
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
They're going to do

837
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
They call that

838
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
Third-dimensional 4th dimensional chess

839
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
That's bragging

840
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,032
Not seeing things straight on one-dimensional

841
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
Tell me a joke

842
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
I just don't even get it

843
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
Because I'm in a mode of not

844
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Being in the comedy

845
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
Literally

846
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
I'm taking in all the data

847
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
It's cuz you're not funny

848
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
No it's

849
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
It's mainly that

850
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:36,512
Jokes

851
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,096
Sister jobs you could almost say that they're three-dimensional.

852
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,400
So this is all synthetic

853
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:48,800
The virus situation naturally season dialectic

854
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,848
He's always knows what's going to happen next

855
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,616
Corsica

856
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
It's all totally

857
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
Concern

858
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,223
Australia

859
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,527
Tunisia the US

860
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,063
The globalist

861
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,111
It's all scripted

862
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:08,767
Attack

863
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
But

864
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:16,447
But my clock off

865
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,495
Get out of here in Austin

866
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,055
Or dead on folks I keep saying that we're done on

867
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:27,455
My spirit is not authorized to make out of here that is that is the like o you can verify what I'm saying

868
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:33,855
But the only guy you could verify with it is dead so unfortunately I just you just got to have to trust me on this one

869
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,415
Can we follow your spirit

870
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:41,791
Not authorized to release it by my

871
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,559
Spirit

872
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:50,495
I wonder what that means real people talk to you

873
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,775
I got nothing

874
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
So Alex

875
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:58,431
Realizes the Trump has been put in for the posture of like he's not really

876
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,967
Concerned right right right

877
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,015
About things a guy no big deal gofucker

878
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,831
Go fuc yourself

879
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,415
Alex is rationalization for this ends up being the Trump wants

880
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,975
To create confidence of the stock market is

881
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
Protected

882
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,279
And that kind of thing

883
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,327
Answer you rationalizes this

884
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
And

885
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,399
Advocates any responsibility

886
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,423
To tell the truth

887
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,055
Why Trump wants to play this town he sees the you and he sees a globalist

888
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,383
PCS I want to take down our economy you know Channel awesome

889
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,199
They launched against her own people lock stuff down and reset

890
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,087
It will show us that you do our economy they believe is fragile

891
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,903
Maybe the president tried to play it down

892
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
We shouldn't get caught up in that

893
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,511
Our job is the oracle

894
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
Infowars

895
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,167
Real Townsquare the brain

896
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:04,991
Unfiltered globulus academic giving his answers down off Mountain

897

Yeah I mean like it

899

It's really important

900
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
When you have people

901
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,743
People calling in to be like don't pop bubbles

902
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,791

00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
Is just how bad

00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,223
Right right I just mean from like Google

You know that whole like

914
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,719
Perfect

915
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,023
Where it doesn't even matter what you're saying he's

916
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
Talkin musically their cigar

917
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Going to hear that

918
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,887
And then if then at the second half is just like

919
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,727
Like he can't sustain

920
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,055
Well yeah he's cardio's not what it once was.

921
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,847
He's going to need to shave his head

922
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:08,479
Streamline aerodynamics

923
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,295
So throughout this it

924
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:15,903
It's been pretty clear that this episode at least Alex is putting forth

925
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,695
The idea that this is all about this

926
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Supply chain

927
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
Disruption

928
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,559
And that intersects B2 makes it fairly clear that he

929
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
He thinks that maybe this is Eve

930
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,191
Soon as I saw China lockdown whole cities

931
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,031
Knowing it would devastate their economy

932
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
I said it was real

933
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,615
You could see the fee

934
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,711
People being builded the hospital for sake

935
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,015
The way they did it the cameras and all of it

936
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:47,135
What they were exacerbating at the order had gone out if create Global Hysteria

937
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,695
So that's a really interesting angle Alex's take

938
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,607
He's saying that immediately when he saw China lockdown cities he knew it was a fake of that than the global is ordered gone out

939
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,887
To try to create his theory

940
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:03,007
Please remember the China put Wuhan under lockdown on January 23rd

941
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
And for some context

942
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,871
Alex at Mike Adams is a guest to announce that it was over

943
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,407
Humanity on Hulu

944
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
Me check my notes

945
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
Phir January 24th

946
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:16,575
So I guess Alex is good buddy Mike Adams just spouted globalist line

947
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,927
You must be getting the globalist talking point that it was time to cause Hysteria

948
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,975
Innkeeper Alex facilitate

949
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:26,303
And that haven't like on his show every day and letting him guest host

950
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,583
What do you want to see pack

951
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,911
It's tiresome at this point for me to stress that all Alex has been doing this

952
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,727
Who's playing at the hysteria since late January at least

953
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,055
We don't need to believe her that point but there's another big lie here

954
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,335
And that is Alex

955
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,895
Claiming that he immediately knew this was all a charade

956
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:44,223
If it was real they would cover it up trying to cover it up

957
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,759
This is not true

958
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:49,855
In the early stages of Alex's coverage he was pitching a whole lot of theories

959
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,879
Like when you were saying

960
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,183
It's possible the trumpet release a bio-weapon on

961
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,231
Back for fentanyl

962
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:59,071
Or the entire it was stolen from a lab and Winnipeg narrative

963
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,863
But he would later call disinformation

964
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,655
He was all over the place

965
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,983
But his initial reaction was actually that this was a real thing

966
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,519
Unlike the outbreaks

967
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,335
Zika virus and Ebola which were all fake

968
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,151
It is January 24th interview with Mike Adams

969
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:18,015
This idea was laid out pretty explicitly and you something Alex signed off on and mirror.

970
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
In his later cover

971
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,599
One way that I believe that you know that this

972
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,671
She is a real pandemic is because the who

973
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,207
Is trying to downplay it

974
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,535
Whatever the whot

975
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
If the opposite of reality

976
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
When the bird

977
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,167
Flu virus was a non

978
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,727
They declared it a stage six pack

979
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,031
So the other ones in the past were fake

980
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,103
This one's real

981
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,199
He's not screaming and setting buildings on fire or something

982
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
I am sick

983
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,015
Proof being what they don't

984
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:54,623
Do well course that actually I think towards the end of this will get it clear that actually fully demonstrated

985
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,647
It's why they behaved

986
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
Really why Alex

987
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,719
And it almost broke my

988
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Lays out his

989
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Conspiracy

990
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
I bet and it's very sweet

991
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,191
I'm not even concerned or scared now because this is so real

992
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,287
She going through the bullies waiting for you you don't want to get in the fight

993
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,431
You're like you know what

994
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,735
McGraw

995
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:29,951
Email metaphysically no fear or no concern anymore

996
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
That tells me

997
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:42,751
My spiritual radar says this is the big moment shall we better start debating what the President should do

998
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:49,151
Speculating we know it's a weapon transfer to Obama to China in the future

999
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,479
As a martial law takeover of China to reset the global economy

1000
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:57,343
Mobile crisis for the global solution Western open government

1001
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:02,719
Open is a problem closed societies that run by the UN

1002
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,511
What

1003
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,303
Is the permutation analysis

1004
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,607
At the end of Matt that guy

1005
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,591
The guy on Blow

1006
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,639
That's a bit much

1007
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,431
We're all going to be closed

1008
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
Nation

1009
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,759
Run by the United Nations

1010
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,783
Dad

1011
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,551
Perfect

1012
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:34,975
About the only thing I really find super interesting is is braggadocious bulshit there at the beginning of that how like I'm not scared

1013
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:41,375
Heard anymore and I'm now my spirit knows this is the big one

1014
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:46,239
Once again I'm a coward that's all I hear him say once again

1015
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,311
I'm saying these things so you take me seriously

1016
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
Yeah it's

1017
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,639
It's it's repetitious to a point of

1018
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:56,223
Offensive it reminds me to beware the earliest of March

1019
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
Sure

1020
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
What are the odds

1021
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,295
50

1022
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,855
So

1023
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,647
Is downplaying this virus

1024
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
Where is right and that's bad

1025
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,719
Because the globalist Jose

1026
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
That

1027
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,535
Covering it up

1028
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:11,839
Here

1029
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:16,191
I really know how to setup his Club B convoluted a little bit in the beginning

1030
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
Send

1031
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,519
Alex says something

1032
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,543
Deeply f*****-up

1033
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,103
Answer for this

1034
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
To try and understand the clip

1035
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,943
But then also so you don't talk over

1036
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,247
Accidentally Alex saying something

1037
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
You should never say

1038
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
My first

1039
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,855
Breakin repeat this every segment is the

1040
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,927
Summer

1041
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,023
Any angle you look at this virus

1042
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
Any angle you look at

1043
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,727
When you watch China lockdown almost a billion people

1044
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,799
You know that's going to kill the bubble top

1045
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,175
Godzilla's in a movie

1046
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,503
This is Godzilla all over the planet

1047
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,415
Is in a Godzilla

1048
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Here he just wants to

1049
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,279
Play it down and I understand that but see that's the Trap

1050
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,143
When he plays it down the media is going to say covered up

1051
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:23,007
Their only fear is he plays it up and uses it for control

1052
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Like GG

1053
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,847
That's why Bill Maher said I

1054
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,151
Declare martial law

1055
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,967
Because that's what they want to do when Trump doesn't act

1056
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,527
They're afraid Trump Maga rap

1057
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
Plasma

1058
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
And by the way

1059
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,159
I don't want martial law

1060
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,695
With all the bureaucrats

1061
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,679
This is the world we Menard's do you want Nancy Pelosi

1062
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,239
Martial law

1063
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
Or do you want

1064
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
Prompto

1065
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,335
Because

1066
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,919
The Wheelhouse

1067
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,735
So the world that Alex is put in for this like

1068
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:09,855
The situation that we find ourselves is Nancy Pelosi martial law

1069
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:14,975
Aren't you the guy who claims you see-through dichotomy is a dialectic

1070
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,791
What are you doing to your audience

1071
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,071
You trying to make them

1072
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:26,239
There's no other option than Trump martial law going to get martial law would you rather have Nancy Pelosi

1073
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,519
Marshall Marshall

1074
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
I mean

1075
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
You know

1076
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
Before I've been fighting

1077
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,919
Non-stop against martial law

1078
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,455
Obviously going to happen

1079
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,735
There's only one choice

1080
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,527
This would be like me

1081
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:44,927
In a couple years on this show talking about a great w Cleon skousen is

1082
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:49,023
I think Ted Anderson should get his gold lights

1083
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
Ethan's back I think

1084
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,631
Rob do is the best corporate representative

1085
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,935
This country is ever see the definition

1086
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:01,311
It's just like he's mr. anti martial law guy

1087
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:05,407
Because of this crisis that he believes is a globalist manufactured crisis

1088
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,735
We either need to have Trump martial law or

1089
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:12,319
Losi martial law choose option

1090
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:18,719
This is no fighting against both this could not be more like straight out of the girdle pants

1091
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,255
Agnes is bad like

1092
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,791
But here's the thing

1093
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:28,447
I'm just going to take the worst option and get rid of all other possibilities so my ridiculous

1094
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
Followers will of course

1095
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:38,943
So Alex has Mike Adams on the show on Sunday and Mike has got a new theory about what this virus

1096
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,735
This is really about

1097
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
No

1098
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:48,671
I have noticed he hasn't hasn't been going that far anymore scale does Great Heights

1099
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,463
January 24th

1100
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,511
What a bore

1101
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,535
He's been a little bit like

1102
00:53:54,047 --> 00:54:00,191
I might have really over shot that one

1103
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,847
So you have a new Theory and its various

1104
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,383
Clearly

1105
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,711
The media hype that the EU hype

1106
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:16,575
They have done they're planning something big will this what do you think it is

1107
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
What is a second

1108
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
Trap

1109
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,671
That they can initiate an all this

1110
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:24,511
First trap was to allow the virus to spread deliberately

1111
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,887
And the narrative has already been launched the second

1112
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,031
They know that they're going to be quarantines of communities and perhaps cities across

1113
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
America

1114
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:40,383
Will most likely be liberal cities

1115
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,199
You have the most filth the most homelessness

1116
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
And the highest

1117
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,247
Elation density

1118
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:49,087
It will be the Democrat with the last one being

1119
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,391
For suspending the election

1120
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
In November

1121
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,999
Democrats will be able to participate

1122
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,303
Smart

1123
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,095
Suspend the elections

1124
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
Then

1125
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
The Democrat

1126
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,471
Is able to I mean you might have to have a lot of other

1127
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,751
People going along with it

1128
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,287
Supreme Court perhaps

1129
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,079
But he's able to achieve that

1130
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
Then the Democrats will say

1131
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,407
Oh my gosh

1132
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:16,991
He's a dictator now he's just a clear himself a dictator and they will use that to Launch

1133
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:20,575
The violent revolution

1134
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,111
And here is when we learn

1135
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,951
Mike is a health Ranger. A political science ranking

1136
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:29,279
If you follow his theory the real trap of the Coronavirus

1137
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:34,655
Verses about making Democratic areas unable to vote which will prompt the Democrats to call for suspending the election

1138
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,959
If Trump goes along with it'll be called the

1139
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:41,055
Dictator all the violent leftist to take to the street and enact their violent revolution

1140
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:45,407
Write this is a dumb theory for one major reason and that is absentee ballot

1141
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:49,247
In 33 of the states in the country any registered voter

1142
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,039
Request a mail-in ballot without

1143
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:54,111
Even given a reason for their need for an absentee ballot

1144
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:57,183
The other 17 states allow voters who meet certain qualify

1145
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:03,583
Locations to vote remotely which I would assume Coronavirus

1146
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,191
We're under quarantine well if you can't make it although that is what Georgia would do

1147
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:11,775
Five states automatically send out ballots to everyone

1148
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,335
But if if they prefer they can still go though

1149
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:21,503
On the occasion that the coronavirus situation does escalate the United States there's literally no reason why we shouldn't have the infrastructure

1150
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,551
Make sure that we needed to still carry out the elect

1151
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,599
It would just require some slight tweak

1152
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,135
And some coherent messaging

1153
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,415
Participate

1154
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
Absentee voting

1155
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,719
For this reason

1156
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:37,119
Even if Democratic areas are hit harder by an outbreak probably never hear Democrats calling for a suspension of the elect

1157
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,167
They would call for sending out at

1158
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:46,591
And given the fact that we're not even through the primaries yet there's every reason to believe that there is enough time to get that done

1159
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,151
Should they have the political will

1160
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,431
And like I said

1161
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,479
The coherent messaging would really be the most

1162
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,783
The only way the Democrats would call for

1163
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,807
For suspending the election

1164
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,343
Birdiebee

1165
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,159
I don't think Adam case of you

1166
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,279
I'm just making it a hyperbolic

1167
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,303
Fair enough

1168
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:10,143
People who would ever call for the suspension of intellect

1169
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,703
Can our Trump authoritarian boosters like Alex

1170
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,727
100

1171
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:19,359
This sort of conversation Mike is having served the purpose of preemptively making it the Democrats fault

1172
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,455
If Trump has decided to suspend the election do you want Pelosi or Trump

1173
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:28,831
That's what you got it won't be a sign of authoritarianism and dictators leanings coming to the surface

1174
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:29,855
It'll be just

1175
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
Your response

1176
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,415
Do an evil left-wing plot

1177
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,207
I just wish the left-wing wouldn't

1178
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:39,839
Make me punch them in the face all the time for standing there you stand there they're planning something

1179
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,887
It's not my fault I have to

1180
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
Punch them in the face

1181
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:47,007
Yeah I'm just standing there

1182
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,799
Like I said

1183
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,919
Stress this because it is very

1184
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,711
Key to understanding

1185
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,015
Things are going

1186
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:01,087
I'm trying to stress

1187
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,111
A lot of

1188
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
The talking point

1189
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,183
A lot of the things that are brought up

1190
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
AR

1191
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,999
Intrinsically about the

1192
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,279
Supply chain disruption

1193
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,839
That is the primary narrative

1194
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,119
Surrounding Coronavirus

1195
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
March 1st

1196
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,215
And that's why Alex will bring up things like this

1197
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,079
Reuters guys

1198
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,103
We can

1199
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,663
German Auto industry Mike

1200
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,759
Have 50% reduction in sales over Wuhan virus

1201
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,575
Breakpoint

1202
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,391
So this is a minor point but I wanted to call a tent

1203
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:38,207
Demonstrate how little care Alex has represented

1204
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:38,975
Information Act

1205
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,535
You just grasping at straws to pull out

1206
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,351
Some headlines here at a while back in order to reinforce

1207
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,631
Mike Adams who's making

1208
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,191
Complaints about the disruption of the global economy the viruses

1209
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,031
Alex says there's a story and writers about the virus causing

1210
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
The German Auto

1211
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,335
To drop 50%

1212
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:59,711
In reality this story is about how the virus might cut in half German automobile sales

1213
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,503
Specifically in China

1214
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,039
During the month of February

1215
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,367
The German automobile industry is already in top shape

1216
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:10,463
They've been hit hard by emission standards people transitioning to electric cars

1217
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:15,071
And is caused by us China

1218
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Ozark

1219
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,167
Tariff

1220
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,215
Smart

1221
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,031
The conversation that Mike and Alex are having it's about the

1222
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,311
Disruption of supply chain

1223
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:29,407
Companies are losing profits cuz they can't get the parts they need to make their Prada

1224
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,455
The German car situation is

1225
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,479
Completely different thing

1226
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,247
It's all about the

1227
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,039
Sales in the Asian market

1228
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:40,415
BMW Daimler Volkswagen don't even have any factories in the affected areas of China

1229
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,999
This is Adam and disruption not supply

1230
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,303
But Alex and Michael care about that distinction

1231
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:51,935
Also Alex is just spouting off s*** about German auto companies dropping 50% when it's a much more precise

1232
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
Statistically

1233
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,495
He doesn't care because it helps serve

1234
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,287
The Narrative it's being pushed

1235
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,359
That's annoying it is annoyed

1236
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,639
I'm very annoyed

1237
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,919
Alex

1238
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,455
Still pushing the food pretty hard

1239
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,759
Okay score still going hard on the food

1240
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
Because I run out of

1241
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
Exactly exactly

1242
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,975
So you can use that

1243
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,863
No I don't think so

1244
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,679
I think you said in the past that none of this stuff comes

1245
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,471
I don't know I don't know

1246
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,007
I would be OD interest

1247
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:27,775
Did you find out

1248
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:31,103
I would bet that my Patriot Supply whether or not they do source

1249
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
They do not I would imagine so

1250
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,967
So they do that for a bit

1251
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,527
It's not worth listening to. All the standard s*** chair

1252
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,319
I found this really interests

1253
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,111
Got the health Ranger on here

1254
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,927
Ask how we can win

1255
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,719
How can we protect ourselves

1256
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,767
From any possible infection

1257
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,327
How do we snatch Victory from the jaws of defeat

1258
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,399
Outlook America can survive this but it

1259
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,191
Requires people turning to

1260
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,263
Antiviral molecules that exist right now

1261
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,591
And they're only two sources where to get that number one there are some

1262
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,359
Prescription

1263
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,663
Medications that have antiviral

1264
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:08,223
None of them are yet proven against the Coronavirus

1265
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
The 2nd

1266
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
And understand

1267
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:18,463
Switch is a food superfoods herbs even just regular things like garlic and ginger and onions

1268
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,255
Conspicuous sanitabs

1269
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:24,351
Nano silver

1270
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:28,447
Alex doesn't even bring it up after Mike's products

1271
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,727
He says

1272
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,007
When he gets sick

1273
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,823
He eats a ton of onion

1274
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,359
That's the trick

1275
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,895
In the in the past

1276
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
Couple weeks

1277
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:42,271
The past month or so these sorts of conversations always be accompanied by

1278
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:48,671
A plug for the oil in the gargle nothing is more antiviral than what the Pentagon has

1279
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:52,511
Proven to be antiviral against this very virus

1280
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,839
It is very weird it almost seems like somebody might have

1281
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,863
Send him a letter

1282
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:02,495
It seems like he might have got to warn it could be I don't know that to be the case and I would be

1283
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:08,127
It's possible to speculate looks like I think he did

1284
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:11,199
He's not he's not selling the gargle like used

1285
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:17,599
Well get it ghetto Baker getting a letter is might as well be a baker getting a very public letter yet

1286
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,951
It's definitely putting people on notice

1287
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,511
Play Moana lose millions of dollars

1288
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,559
Potentially advice

1289
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,583
His behavior Whitney

1290
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,423
Need to change it would be a smart idea

1291
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:37,823
Out to I don't I don't know exactly their other possibilities but it is behavior is

1292
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,359
Noticeably

1293
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,407
So Mike

1294
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,455
Start complaining about how the youth are lazy

1295
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:48,831
How these Millennials and blood and drinking it yet

1296
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,111
LOL that's good

1297
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:50,879
We're lazy right now

1298
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,415
The ocean

1299
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,231
Does not allow you to do that to your employees

1300
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,303
You complaining about how

1301
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,583
This new generation

1302
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
Just sucks they don't work hard

1303
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,191
Ignore that

1304
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,007
To Alex screaming about his account

1305
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:12,127
I thought that was really funny mad about taxis

1306
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,711
Younger Millennials and an even younger people in America today

1307
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,015
They do not have a work ethic

1308
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:25,695
There's this laziness it's real it's in the Youth of America today

1309
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,791
Factory I buy brand names

1310
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,839
Consumers

1311
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
Producers

1312
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:39,263
And this this is

1313
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,799
Really

1314
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,359
People then also just seen number that go

1315
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,663
Even if CPA they go

1316
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,967
Well there's this money in your bank account

1317
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,063
That what you didn't change

1318
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,903
We got to pay the vendors and I know you're right sorry

1319
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:09,215
Colonic

1320
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:13,311
Epa's man

1321
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:21,759
Itsy bitsy me a man that is behind it all

1322
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,551
Is this related

1323
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,831
Don't understand

1324
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,135
I just thought that was really funny Alex

1325
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:32,511
How dare you my sister-in-law's a CPA you come at me when you come

1326
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,583
What's CPA

1327
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,911
I was an accountant for a little while but certified

1328
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:42,239
How do I cook beer from the Sunday show

1329
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:47,615
And it's Alex if you wants to scare the audience about the possibility of this quarantine

1330
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,151
You coming to the United States

1331
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,687
Answer yes to bike

1332
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,967
To help

1333
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,039
Will this pandemic is going to be the ultimate wake-up call

1334
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,343
Global environment over for Humanity

1335
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,695
A few minutes here

1336
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,511
It is really deadly and everything locked down

1337
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:08,351
The old lawn quarantine what will the average left us do you talk about

1338
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,399
A group of psychotic piranhas

1339
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,287
I suppose there will be no enforcement liberal city in America

1340
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,335
Because the people that you would try to

1341
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
To isolate

1342
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,127
But not comply

1343
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
Not at all

1344
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:25,247
They will go insane normal day in many cases

1345
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:30,367
I have no idea people in the last to be more or less likely than your average person to go along with a quarantine

1346
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:36,255
Whatever Mike is f****** if he thinks his militia Patriot buddies. Don't tread on me type sore

1347
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,047
Any any more likely to accept

1348
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,351
The government mandated quarantine

1349
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:45,727
These are people who threaten Insurrection over military training exercises in the landgrave

1350
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
Fees

1351
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,799
Do you think for one second that these same people

1352
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:53,663
Standoff at the Wildlife Preserve

1353
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,223
Tell them to stay indoors or whatever you got it

1354
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,503
Farcical

1355
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,319
Alex's said that like half the police in the country

1356
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,367
Killed if background checks for gun

1357
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,391
What does Works Bandit

1358
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,951
How do you think the Sovereign citizens react

1359
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,791
They don't think they need drivers license isn't a few quarts is invalid

1360
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:15,167
They legitimately don't think the state has any Authority so they're not going to acquiesce to a quarantine

1361
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,703
So really stupid

1362
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,519
You can hear now it's his voice that he's rushing to the end of the show

1363
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,335
He wants to scare the audience before he wraps up

1364
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,639
I don't know why that's the

1365
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,687
Believer

1366
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
Scary

1367
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,503
So we get to the SEC

1368
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,527
Monday

1369
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,807
Now to show open

1370
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
Opens up

1371
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,343
Very serious

1372
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,623
Very

1373
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
Very soon

1374
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:42,559
Up-to-date

1375
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:47,679
Broadcast I've ever done

1376
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,983
You've said there's so many damn times

1377
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,823
Do I need to open my car window and start screaming into block traffic

1378
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:57,407
Yeah I need to this going to change the games

1379
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,455
So it turns out

1380
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,759
All of that stuff about

1381
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,295
What I was talking about

1382
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:07,647
At the coronavirus narrative shifting Supply

1383
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,695
Throw that out

1384
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,719
Get out of here

1385
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,767
Fresh Start

1386
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,351
Fresh start throwing out the f****** window cuz now we're back

1387
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,167
F****** everyone's going to die

1388
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,287
So turns out

1389
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,359
Turn on a day-to-day basis it turns up

1390
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,639
Alex has a couple of

1391
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,431
Sources about this

1392
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:33,247
Annie gets into it in this just next

1393
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,063
Coming up here today

1394
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,367
Bottom of the hour

1395
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,839
Multiple experts one of these

1396
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,631
Lieutenant colonel

1397
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,935
Did Army Special Operations

1398
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,727
That back

1399
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
Who said the Pentagon

1400
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,567
Believe

1401
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,871
With the numbers they have

1402
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:03,455
That they can have up to 3 million dead people

1403
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,783
In the next 6 months here in the United States from the Coronavirus

1404
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,087
Spell I learned this

1405
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,135
A couple days ago

1406
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
And then

1407
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,023
There was a retired lieutenant

1408
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,071
Colonel

1409
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,423
And I had to go

1410
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,007
Totally separate issue

1411
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,335
And I watching the drinking coffee with him

1412
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,615
He just retired like

1413
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
A year ago

1414
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,479
The word and he was with army Special Operations just so happened

1415
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:43,135
Yeah the word is from the numbers is there looking at 3 million dead

1416
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:49,791
Oh man you know what is really weird it's really weird at this 3 million dead figure that Alex is pretending that he has

1417
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:56,447
Exactly the same estimate that Mike Adams made on Alex's show on Sunday

1418
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:00,543
Wait oh my God I can't believe this I completely forgot to play you that clip

1419
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:05,919
You mentioned rasulallah bring this up 2% mortality rate

1420
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:09,503
Which is pretty typical for a flu

1421
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:13,599
2% comes out roughly 3.3 million dead

1422
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:19,999
Americans essentially just admitted there could be millions of deaths in America

1423
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:20,767
Larger than the flu

1424
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,071
Let's be clear we don't want that to happen it's terrible

1425
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,887
So this is an offshoot of repeated

1426
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,727
Sunday show referring to Rush Limbaugh is an expert on these

1427
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:36,383
And Rush said on his show that there's a 98% recovery rate there for 2% mortality rate

1428
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:40,735
The two percent fatality rate is an estimated by bike to be about 3 million.

1429
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,015
It was really

1430
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,295
Really remarkable 2

1431
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:47,135
Show me how Monday Alex has multiple high-level sources telling him

1432
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,927
They're preparing for 3 million dead

1433
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:52,511
And yet when he's discussing this very topic on his show on Sunday

1434
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:57,631
Didn't come up it is strange because he heard from the lieutenant colonel's

1435
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,703
Write a couple days ago

1436
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:07,103
He knows a lot of lieutenant colonel

1437
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:13,503
Same thing as Mike clear day doesn't seem to know anyway Brigadier generals he doesn't really have much much

1438
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,527
Other rankings to go by

1439
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:17,087
There's another

1440
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,391
Weird cork here and that is that

1441
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,439
That clip of Mike making

1442
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,463
Is 2%

1443
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:26,047
And 3 million dead

1444
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
That

1445
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,375
He's talking about

1446
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:33,727
He's responding to clip of Rush Limbaugh commentary

1447
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:34,751
Now

1448
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,287
Here is Alec

1449
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,311
Explain Rush

1450
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,847
Talking about the Coronavirus

1451
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,127
On his Sunday show

1452
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,455
The coronavirus is

1453
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:46,527
Common cold by media

1454
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,319
Type of this thing

1455
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:55,743
Pandemic as The Andromeda Strain as all my God if you get it

1456
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,559
I think the the

1457
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:06,751
Survival rate is 98% 98% of people get the Coronavirus

1458
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,055
Picture respiratory system virus

1459
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:14,431
It's probably it is probably is a chai, laboratory experiments

1460
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:17,759
That that is in the process of being weaponized

1461
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:24,415
At a secret hearing last week when you cover it they know what it is

1462
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:31,583
So here we see the 2% number being established which Alex and Mike Adams or later used as tomato 3 million

1463
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,863
More interesting

1464
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,703
Rush says that this virus created a Chinese

1465
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,471
Strengthen that

1466
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,799
Alex says that there were secret meetings in Congress and Rush knows about

1467
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:46,431
This has the effect of implying that what Russia's saying is actually secret high-level information

1468
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
Supposed to

1469
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,735
Rush Limbaugh doing what you always do

1470
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
Talk s***

1471
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
Over the course of

1472
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,831
Situation strength

1473
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,647
By the next time Alex brings up Russia's comments

1474
01:11:55,903 --> 01:12:01,279
He's not very very strongly implying that Rush saying the virus might have been made in a lab in China

1475
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,559
Raheem reporting on things

1476
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,095
Trump and Pence tool

1477
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,215
Everyday I mean

1478
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:11,263
Limos totally hooked up

1479
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,799
Media

1480
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,871
Bio weapon got other lab it's not big

1481
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,991
Fluted even kill wanted the 1% first

1482
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,807
Limbaugh's getting it ready

1483
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,415
And now let's Jump Ahead to the next time rush comes up on this Sunday show

1484
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:33,023
Alex is talking about how he's been saying the coronavirus is man-made for a long time

1485
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,071
You would think you would just brag about a Russian

1486
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:35,839
Picking up

1487
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,375
But Alex doesn't

1488
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,911
Alex's actively can

1489
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,447
Inflating Rush making stupid

1490
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,239
Comment on his radio show

1491
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,263
With information

1492
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,287
It's coming from

1493
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:48,383
It was Man made out of the Wuhan bioweapons lab

1494
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:52,991
Intelligence committee meetings last week that's not Rush Limbaugh

1495
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,783
He talked the president daily

1496
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,063
Perfect bodies

1497
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:00,671
Alex has absolutely no information about any real or imagined Senate intelligence

1498
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:06,303
He's making that up because he believes for absolutely no reason that Rush was reporting on Senate intelligence

1499
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,327
Materials

1500
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,399
And stuff that comes from Trump when he was just talkingshit

1501
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:15,263
This is one of the more clear-cut cases I've seen of Alex just blatantly laundering a source

1502
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,543
Yeah but it's not

1503
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,823
Fully laundered yet

1504
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,639
Alex is still mentioning Rush when he's making

1505
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,663
Disclaim in that last

1506
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,711
This is technically still Justin

1507
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,247
Embellishing Russia's s*** talk

1508
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,783
However you don't have to look

1509
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,831
Look too far to find this claim fully

1510
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,855
Completely launder

1511
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,903
It is something that is now

1512
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,671
Levi's

1513
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,975
I'm all set for over a month it's man-made

1514
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,279
Major Indian universities other

1515
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,047
Scientific

1516
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,887
Facilities

1517
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:43,679
Chicken vaccine

1518
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:53,663
Within the span of his two-hour show Alex took a stray piece of b******* that Rush Limbaugh said on his show

1519
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:57,759
Congratulate escalated into being super high-level inside information

1520
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,295
It rushes report

1521
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,623
Once Alex elevated that s*** talk to that level

1522
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,671
He doesn't we rushed getting in the way

1523
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,255
A brush is getting this from high-level Pentagon sources

1524
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,279
Trump

1525
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,559
As the commander-in-chief

1526
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,327
And the Senate

1527
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,351
Intelligence people

1528
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:16,191
Alex can just cut out the middleman and report on the information that rust Rush

1529
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,471
Must be reported

1530
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,823
You can see these Fingerprints of the way Alex uses information if you pay attention

1531
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,847
And honestly this

1532
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,663
Scariest part for me is I don't even think that's a conscious process

1533
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:32,575
I think Alex just started talking about Russia's comment and instinctually wanted to reinforce the parts of it that are most in line with

1534
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
With his own narrative

1535
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,647
Namely that the virus is man-made

1536
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,719
So he started tying rush to Trump and secrets

1537
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,487
Senate hearings

1538
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,023
And as he's going

1539
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,327
I have a feeling that he's lost track of where the starting

1540
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,095
Point was

1541
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,423
There is no secret information there's no Pentagon confirmation

1542
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:52,031
There's nothing except a blowhard right-wing hack that Alex used to hate talkingshit

1543
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,079
Add to loop back around Monday

1544
01:14:55,103 --> 01:15:00,223
Alex has three million estimate matches up mysteriously while with Mike Adams estimate that he was taken from Rush

1545
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,295
I don't believe that Alex has any of these sources

1546
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,831
I think this is all him working out

1547
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,855
Branching paths

1548
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:08,671
They're all traceback 3/32 clip

1549
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,439
From Rush Limbaugh

1550
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,719
Yeah I would accept

1551
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,487
That this is just

1552
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:14,047
Snowball situation where

1553
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,863
Like even if you was taking it directly from Rush

1554
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,191
He's just automatically going to say that there's a

1555
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:23,775
Lieutenant V there's just always a lieutenant

1556
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:30,687
He loves that rank so then it just kind of snowballed from there a lieutenant colonel goes to the Pentagon goes to the Presidents or

1557
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,711
Right back to rush

1558
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,479
There we go

1559
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,503
I think it's very

1560
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,783
Clear to me

1561
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,551
Looking at

1562
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,855
Looking at these little fingerprints

1563
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,159
Looking at like why didn't you

1564
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,463
Bring up any of these the first lieutenant

1565
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,487
Colonel when you were talking

1566
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,255
Mike

1567
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,559
None of this makes sense at all but it does make

1568
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,095
Make sense if you see it as

1569
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,119
Alex losing

1570
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,655
Tracker of his own

1571
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,215
Escalating b******* about Rush Limbaugh

1572
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,239
And now he's

1573
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,031
Chosen to turn it into an

1574
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,311
Active life

1575
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,847
What was Justice

1576
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,615
Conscious

1577
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,407
Raising the stakes

1578
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,199
On Sunday is now is

1579
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
He gets in on Monday like

1580
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,015
A very conscious

1581
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,319
Decision to make up source

1582
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
Absolutely

1583
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,647
So Alex doesn't want to get into business

1584
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,927
On the show

1585
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,719
Working is deaf

1586
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,999
He's just like

1587
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,559
F******

1588
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,863
Serendipity

1589
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,519
Ridiculous things this morning I had to go to the bank

1590
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:32,895
Double

1591
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,479
Whataburger cheeseburger is my breakfast I'm going to be bad today

1592
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,527
I don't know where there any good job there

1593
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,623
Yoshino

1594
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,159
Stressed out today

1595
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,743
I already called ahead as we pull into the office

1596
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,279
Pat Riley's waiting

1597
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,839
At the office door with the double cheeseburger

1598
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,143
Take

1599
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,679
Serendipity

1600
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,263
What do you call that

1601
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,823
Gross

1602
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,151
I'd I got to assume

1603
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:11,551
There's something that the other people would know that I was in a bad mood first of all and then second

1604
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:14,111
That the way to deal with that is giving cheeseburger

1605
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:21,535
Yep both very weird personality keeps a little little baby quiet will give you will give you cheese

1606
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,583
Put that in your mouth so you don't yell

1607
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,119
These are very strange

1608
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,399
Personality quirks

1609
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,423
But I would find

1610
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,447
Interesting

1611
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:33,567
In like a screenplay but as Alex Jones

1612
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,591
Features

1613
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:37,919
In a bad place

1614
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,199
Let's give him a GG

1615
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:45,599
Cheeseburger for breakfast it is unfortunate when you're like oh a lot of places they bring in Donuts

1616
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,623
And we all get to

1617
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,647
The cherem

1618
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,695
Here we just get the boss at

1619
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:52,511
Cheeseburger

1620
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,535
Appreciate

1621
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,303
Eden Prairie

1622
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,583
So Alex

1623
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,119
Has these sources

1624
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,655
And he wants you to know that

1625
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,423
She's not waking up

1626
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,727
Which makes me think he's making

1627
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,007
And the way he

1628
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:06,847
Acura this next clip made me very convinced this isn't true

1629
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,383
That's a true story

1630
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,407
I just told you

1631
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,687
About to

1632
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,991
One retired one currently serving

1633
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:15,807
Specific

1634
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:18,367
Sensitive area of the military

1635
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,391
Not

1636
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,415
I need to tell me this

1637
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,463
Telling me this

1638
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,279
You need to talk about

1639
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,327
So obviously I am

1640
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:31,423
At the bottom of the hour

1641
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,959
Right now though

1642
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:36,543
I got to talk about.

1643
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:42,175
The cheeseburger in the belly really important to remember based on how this narrative starts the first

1644
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,967
Is that a couple days ago you talked

1645
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,247
The first lieutenant colonel

1646
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,295
I meant Monday morning you talked to the second

1647
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,319
Right

1648
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,087
And in that clip

1649
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:51,391
He says explicitly they weren't

1650
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:52,927
To tell him

1651
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,951
Rite Aid

1652
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,719
Just told him

1653
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,999
Those two things

1654
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:59,839
Will be very important later I'm stressing this very hard

1655
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,863
So these two

1656
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,447
Independently of each other and their commanding officer

1657
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:10,847
They both gave him the same information within a couple days of this Monday

1658
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:17,247
This is this is two depositions this is a slam-dunk eyewitness case we're going to close it out everybody knows

1659
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:23,647
So we get to this next clip and I honestly think that this is one of the points where I'm at

1660
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,671
Close to like

1661
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,951
Alright Alex FairPoint

1662
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
Is we're going to

1663
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,767
Trump comes out

1664
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,327
When the stock market drops 15%

1665
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,375
954

1666
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,655
The media's

1667
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,983
Asteria is a hoax

1668
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,543
The super in the world

1669
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,871
Is a hoax which which is true

1670
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,175
Economy

1671
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,711
I'm not saying I agree with Alex

1672
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:53,599
Bye-bye I'd like to know if

1673
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,159
Trump is saying that the media hysteria is a hoax

1674
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,951
Where does

1675
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:02,815
Calling it over for Humanity fall on that Spectrum

1676
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:09,983
Trump

1677
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:10,751
As far as Trump

1678
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:14,592
Comment goes this was something that he said at a rally in South Carolina

1679
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:17,920
When talking about the virus

1680
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:20,224
That was on a fake conversation

1681
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,248
They tried anything

1682
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,528
I tried it over and over

1683
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:25,856
Turning

1684
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:34,560
His language was intentionally kind of unclear because he's an a****** dum dum who lectures

1685
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,328
Talk s***

1686
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,168
He was forced to clarify would met the next day because the first US citizen

1687
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:41,984
Some died from the virus

1688
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,568
Saying that he's not doing a good job by the hopes he's referring to

1689
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,592
Quartz so cool

1690
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:51,456
Critiquing his actions of the head of state are engaged

1691
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,992
If what they say is not flattering

1692
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:56,064
Could not be clear what point we're at as a site

1693
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:02,976
Frustrated by the fact that it does seem like everybody in America has just decided to like

1694
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,792
Skip over shut the Trump says

1695
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:07,072
Like I'd like we just

1696
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:11,936
You just like Zonk out whenever you said she'd cuz of any president said this out loud

1697
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:16,544
The rest like we we'd all be like this is f****** insane

1698
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:21,664
This is absolutely crazy obviously Biden's going to be doing this next year

1699
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:27,296
Part that I sent like introducing clip I said it's close to being like a fair point to Alex

1700
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,576
And that's because

1701
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:31,648
There are bunch of people who took this comment that Trump made

1702
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,440
And said that he was saying a virus it's a

1703
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,464
Self was a hoax

1704
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,768
And I think those people are doing terrible job

1705
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,608
Like Joe Biden said quote the president of the United States says it's a hoax

1706
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,168
It's hard to believe even for him it's hard to believe

1707
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:49,056
Bloomberg said I find it incomprehensible that the president would do something as a name is calling it a hoax

1708
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:54,176
Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe said the Trump quote said the coronavirus was a hoax

1709
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,736
Politico's headline reads

1710
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,016
Trump rallies his base

1711
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,064
You Coronavirus

1712
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,600
Which is really on the

1713
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,136
Cusp of being off base

1714
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
The article makes

1715
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,440
Contacts

1716
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:09,280
This day era

1717
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,560
Do not be making

1718
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,840
It's super appealing

1719
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,888
Fun to jump on everything Trump says and dunk

1720
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,680
If you act like this

1721
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,960
He just creates ammunition

1722
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:20,800
People like Alex to further insulate their size and kind of outside information

1723
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,592
Yeah it would be hard to

1724
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:25,152
Pace to the media with fake news if they weren't soci

1725
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:31,296
But there are

1726
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,344
Destructive

1727
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,392
Absolutely and for people who are running

1728
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,952
For president on the Democratic side to

1729
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,512
Not be more precise with their language

1730
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,048
I'm not saying it's the worst thing

1731
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,376
That Alex is making

1732
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:48,192
I can't really refuse if people did say

1733
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:51,008
Vicki said the virus itself wasn't Rex

1734
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,544
And that's a problem

1735
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,336
On the other hand you know

1736
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:58,688
It wouldn't be so believable if it weren't something that

1737
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,456
You would

1738
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:03,040
You could have said like Billy easily rehab

1739
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,064
He's not paying attention

1740
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,112
Attention to what he says ever so he might have

1741
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,696
One word change any problems you know he would have

1742
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,720
Nuggets

1743
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,256
Yeah

1744
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,560
Because Alex has

1745
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,352
These things that he can point

1746
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,632
As

1747
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,656
Like examples

1748
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,264
Right

1749
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,800
Use that

1750
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,336
To make other criticism

1751
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:32,224
Media that are absurd

1752
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:32,992
Making it

1753
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,416
Between 0

1754
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,232
Coronavirus

1755
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,584
It's the end of the world

1756
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,864
Mainstream Media Shack

1757
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,656
This is cockamamie bulshit

1758
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:55,264
Yep the media is not split into thing where you to believe that is a hoax or you think it's the end of the world

1759
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,800
I want to just make that up

1760
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:00,896
Because it works into his dum-dum Universal beware the globalist rank rate

1761
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,944
Two opposing sides and control both

1762
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,016
The dialectic that Alec mysteriously sees everything at

1763
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,808
Alex sees the world like

1764
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,440
The economy even work doesn't exist

1765
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,768
Also it's good to know the people who say it is the end of the world

1766
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,048
Considered mainstream media

1767
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,096
Did not know that Mike Adams

1768
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:25,472
What was the mainstream media but you learn something new everyday is a globalist

1769
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:31,872
Mainstream media confirm now that Mike Adams is a globally

1770
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:36,992
I think so every time he is on Alex's show

1771
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:37,760
Perform

1772
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,808
A globulin

1773
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,088
You are everything

1774
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:41,856
You have come to her

1775
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:49,792
There is definitely Alex's fake sources saying that 3 million Americans are going to be dead

1776
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,816
From this their projection

1777
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:58,496
Camping this backup it is now like really deadly where is on Sunday it was so much about the supply chain

1778
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,520
But

1779
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,568
He is also still retaining

1780
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,336
A lot of vets

1781
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,104
Supply chain

1782
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,128
Economy fear

1783
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:08,992
So he gets into that and it's both and neither and everything all at the same

1784
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,784
It's very convoluted

1785
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:17,184
So now he has an argument that he's making that is that the Democrats admit that they want the economy

1786
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:20,256
To fail in order for Trump to go out of course we

1787
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,536
And I talked about

1788
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,840
The globalist are Unified

1789
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,888
Are making their move on the economy

1790
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,424
To bring down Trump

1791
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,472
And now the Democrats last week were admitting it

1792
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,264
I hope this brings down from

1793
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,104
And they're rooting for to bring down the economy that should bring them down

1794
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:41,504
Interesting cuz I don't know if I've heard Democrats in office or major political commentators hoping for the economy to fail be

1795
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,528
Because it would hurt Trump

1796
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,112
How explain that CNN clip on Sunday but that's just analysis

1797
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
Can use transfer

1798
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,464
Response to the virus to their political advantage

1799
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,488
Wasn't cheering

1800
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:53,024
For the economy to stay or anyting

1801
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,840
If you just heard Alex's show on Monday

1802
01:25:56,352 --> 01:26:00,192
Say the Democrats have admitted they want the economy to collapse because it'll take down

1803
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:02,752
Trump and you'd assume he's talking about

1804
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:05,568
Some pretty major figures maybe something he played

1805
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,616
Previously the Mist

1806
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:14,272
Because I listened to his show way more than anyone should I can tell you exactly who the Democrats are that Alex is referring to

1807
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,064
It's one person

1808
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,344
It's Bill Maher

1809
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:23,488
Great here's a question not a Democrat by the way

1810
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:31,680
Are you on my list you also on MSNBC CNN on this is great will finally getting

1811
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,728
Play son of a

1812
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:38,080
Bill Maher when he talks

1813
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,104
Text Satan

1814
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,896
Results it on lap

1815
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,176
Little

1816
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,480
What are those things been

1817
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:50,880
This may come as a surprise to you but Alex never does play any other clips of Democrats salivating and cheering for the

1818
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,416
Steak-Out

1819
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:57,536
Because they're always lame is that Sienna

1820
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,328
Bill Maher clip

1821
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:01,120
Definitely Maura saying he wants a recession

1822
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,656
Because it'll get rid of trump

1823
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,704
Fairplay to Alex for not liking that

1824
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,520
It's probably dishonest to call Mara Democrat

1825
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,848
Carrying the past

1826
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:14,688
Anybody for Bob Dole in 1996 and Nader in 2000

1827
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,528
Also billboard also Bill Maher sucks

1828
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:21,088
Stanley critique from the left for very valid reasons

1829
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,672
It is it is funny

1830
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,696
It's like that's how it

1831
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:28,000
Internal consistency makes you immune to

1832
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:33,120
Certain attacks because I like you criticize somebody and I like

1833
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:35,680
Fire him into the sun to don't care

1834
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,240
I've noticed a bit of a

1835
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:43,616
Trend on Alex's show a claim that the whole liberal media saying something outrageous

1836
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:47,968
The only evidence will end up resenting is a clip of Bill Maher talkingshit

1837
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,576
How to use Bill Maher to be the Avatar the entirety of the media he's up again

1838
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:55,392
I think the reason is you know because

1839
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,928
Alex's show

1840
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:00,768
F****** stupid if you just screaming bloody murder about what Bill Maher said on a

1841
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,536
HBO

1842
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:05,888
It makes Alex look like he's actually doing something if he pretends that Bill Maher really speak

1843
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,192
For all the Democrats and all the globalist

1844
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,032
And that's exactly why you see him expressing at the end of that

1845
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,312
At what he does

1846
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:16,128
Doumar's the ventriloquist doll for the global

1847
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:18,688
Enough whenever Belmar says anyting

1848
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:21,760
Alex is free to claim that the globalist and Democrats

1849
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,552
Actually the one sing

1850
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,856
Bill Barr may as well be the official corporate

1851
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:28,672
Spokesman for globalist LLC

1852
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:33,280
This is the same behavior we saw earlier earlier with Alex laundering source

1853
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:38,912
He'll be totally fine for him to just yell his thick neck off about something Bill Barr said and how it

1854
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,192
But how it made him angry

1855
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:42,752
Dubious

1856
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:45,824
Where becomes fundamentally dishonest is when he takes

1857
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,128
Belmar himself has said

1858
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,432
And that applies them to some other nebula Center

1859
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:53,504
50 in response to the comments as if that other entity

1860
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,296
Like the Democrats are the globalist

1861
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,320
That actually said it

1862
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,392
By assuming that Bill Maher speaks for the globalist

1863
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:02,464
I meant to taking Bill Maher out of the equation stating the globalists

1864
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,256
Save this thing that Bill Maher said

1865
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,280
You're being a dick

1866
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:09,632
Ultimately Alex has multiple high-level sources are predict 3 billion dead from

1867
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:15,008
The coronavirus in the Pentagon said was in reality just heard a little bit of Russia's show the other day

1868
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:21,152
The Democratic countries economy to collapse in order her truck but in reality I was just mad at

1869
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,968
It shows very stupid when you pay attention

1870
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:27,040
And you're able to trace these things to wear their actual profit

1871
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,600
Bill Maher's a Democrat the way Bloomberg

1872
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,160
F*** off

1873
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,184
Fair enough

1874
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:39,072
Navigate to little bit more from those does a lieutenant colonel's that Alex that has it is source

1875
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,352
And all of it

1876
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,888
All of the information

1877
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:42,912
Dresser

1878
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,704
No it's just the same thing

1879
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,544
Okay Mike working off the

1880
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,336
Maryland lighthouse

1881
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:52,128
Once a year or something

1882
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:56,992
Other business that I was doing it taken care of this about a year ago

1883
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,528
He's there at leaving work

1884
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,320
He's not having coffee with my wife

1885
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:03,392
He called because I don't travel anymore he's saying

1886
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,696
The Pentagon

1887
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,000
With a 2% death rate

1888
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,080
Has higher levels

1889
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:24,384
Are saying in Army Special Operations

1890
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,920
Isn't that weird

1891
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:31,296
Hoverboard details Alex gets about this mysterious Lieutenant Colonel told him to prediction is 3 billion

1892
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:37,184
Morrie talks about it the more it's exactly the same s*** that Mike Adams are saying on the show the day before

1893
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,208
So weird

1894
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,512
So f****** strange that coincidence

1895
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:46,400
I was certain that this is just Alex laundry Mike Adams a ship through fake anonymous source

1896
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,192
But now with the projection

1897
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,472
Half the population

1898
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:52,544
She is going to be infected which is exactly what Mike said

1899
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,592
Chemical levels of transparent

1900
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:57,152
There are two types of Lies

1901
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,200
Their subconscious lies

1902
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:01,760
That Alex doesn't even really realize he's engaging in

1903
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:05,600
Which of the escalation of the rush clip turning into some kind of Secret Pentagon

1904
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,136
Then there's this

1905
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,416
Which is an obvious and

1906
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,440
Channel I

1907
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:10,976
I suspect the motive is

1908
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:13,024
The same as for the bill bars

1909
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:17,632
Alex know that I'm saying Mike Adams predicted 3 million. Soon I'm going to move the needle too much

1910
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:24,032
Mike declared Humanity over like a month ago million death is not an escalation of that rhetoric at all in fact

1911
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:24,800
Bike

1912
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:31,200
That is reassuring

1913
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,736
It's really going to happen is like to do

1914
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:38,624
But is Alex presents this is information coming from a mysterious unknown figure was in the know

1915
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,160
You can give it a credibility that he

1916
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:42,208
Even he knows Mike Adams doesn't have

1917
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,488
Mostly because he's

1918
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,536
Humanity

1919
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,608
And because Betty Bowl liqueur thing and pretty much the rest of my cat

1920
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:51,424
These are clear Fingerprints of Ally

1921
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,752
And I can't stress this enough Alex knows exactly what he's doing

1922
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:55,776
That is

1923
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,056
Unbelievable

1924
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,104
Why would you even bother with both

1925
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,640
An active and retired

1926
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,664
Lieutenant colonel

1927
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,968
That's so silly and made-up

1928
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,272
Surely it's childish it's a childish

1929
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:14,208
One of them was a couple days ago

1930
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,256
And in the middle of them with my cat

1931
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:17,280
Sure

1932
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,560
So

1933
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:22,656
I think this is really interesting I've noticed something in the past very reason

1934
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,728
Alex has started to play the good guy

1935
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:32,640
From Star Wars really real now into our number 245 days left of the

1936
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:34,944
Election

1937
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:39,296
He's also he's still playing The Imperial March sometime right but there is

1938
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,832
A seating

1939
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:45,184
Alright alright from Star Wars

1940
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:45,952
He is with me

1941
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:53,376
100% no baby there's no other way that you would do that seems weird and maybe there's a decent chance that maybe

1942
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:57,984
Be at other times in the past he's thrown in the good guy be possible

1943
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:02,336
It's overwhelmed it's stuck out alright if you are listening

1944
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:04,640
Play the theme for Indiana

1945
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,528
So Alex now

1946
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,576
Okay what are the big things

1947
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:16,160
The media at the mainstream media

1948
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:19,232
One of them's a covered about Alex in the past week was that

1949
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,512
He got to go to fight with

1950
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,584
And here is where that begin

1951
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,864
Ken's it turns out it's

1952
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,144
Because of petty reasons

1953
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,680
They ran into

1954
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,472
Gorka

1955
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,544
Tyranny the whale

1956
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,104
Or just Gorka the gay well

1957
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,640
Whoa

1958
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,784
They just like a royal. He's a

1959
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:45,856
The White House policy expert

1960
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,648
He's got stolen valor

1961
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:51,232
And

1962
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:55,840
Or I am God I am

1963
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
Gorka

1964
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:01,728
It's all day but

1965
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:05,056
You don't see Nigel farage coming over here and telling us

1966
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:07,872
Turn on

1967
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,432
Free speech

1968
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:14,784
Really nailed the landing on this side

1969
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,088
So here's our the feud with Gorka begins

1970
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,624
Because I guess he had Owen

1971
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,648
Thrown out of CPAP

1972
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,464
I don't know if and I don't care if that happened

1973
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:26,048
If it did it's an instance of a guy I dislike taking appropriate measures to

1974
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,072
Lisa space

1975
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,096
Which is fine

1976
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:30,400
Owen had no reason to be at Sea back except

1977
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,936
Disruption

1978
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,728
Which has been known to lie about

1979
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:39,872
Weirdly haven't heard much about that Bernie supporter attacking him recently

1980
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:43,968
I thought they pressed charges because it was so obvious that the Bernie supporter at

1981
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:51,136
Might actually be talking about it and I'm unaware of it is not to be

1982
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,672
Central feature of Alex

1983
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,488
It's weird for Alex to call Gorka of Britt

1984
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,304
I mean he was born in the UK

1985
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,072
But I think

1986
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:01,120
Like most people more closely associated with hunger

1987
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,656
Something's Hungarian

1988
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
You live there

1989
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,472
There was an advisor to Viktor Orban

1990
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:10,080
Identifies with the Hungarian not the order of the test okay and supported

1991
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:12,128
Beeper military Hungarian guard

1992
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,408
Sounds like a brick

1993
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:17,248
Because their activity was deemed to be quote

1994
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,040
Based on racial conflict

1995
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:25,440
Between the Hungarian majority and minority that's why brexit happened

1996
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,720
Their fellow come

1997
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:33,376
I think at least in terms of the present-day Sebastian Gorka is far more notable as a Hungarian than as a break even though he does

1998
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,400
Citizenship

1999
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:38,752
I would even go so far as to say he's far more notable just as a Nazi

2000
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:39,776
BND

2001
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:41,824
Got ya

2002
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:46,688
Anyway Alex also called Gorka a gay whale I don't understand

2003
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,224
I don't know

2004
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,576
I've heard of use that it's on the past I'm sure the backstory is disappointing but I'm not

2005
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:56,160
Sure exactly what it is later on he does

2006
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:02,048
Explain that you just think sikorka sashays around

2007
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,328
I don't know it's

2008
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:07,680
Schoolyard homophobia

2009
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,568
Ever since Trump came around with low energy Jeb been Little Marco

2010
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:16,128
Husband tried to make playground insults stick to his enemy

2011
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,664
He's just not very good at it

2012
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,944
I suspect this

2013
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,712
Just one of those

2014
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:25,600
Alex goes on a jump into another topic

2015
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:31,232
He spends a good bit of time on this March 2nd episode talking about Turkish president erdogan

2016
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:33,792
Announcing that he would allow refugees and migrants

2017
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:34,816
Cross the border

2018
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:35,584
From Turkey

2019
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,608
Europe

2020
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:37,888
I would cover this but the

2021
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:41,984
This situation is immensely complicated and I do not trust myself to handle it well

2022
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,288
I wanted to mention it though just because it's

2023
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,336
Huge International situation

2024
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:49,920
It's something that should be paid attention to but I can talk about it too much

2025
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:54,784
Mostly because Alex is only real analysis of it is that Muslims are basically animals

2026
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,832
People in Greece should be able to shoot them

2027
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,600
The Border

2028
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,624
It's horrible stuff

2029
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,672
Standard

2030
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:05,536
Just with everyone's actions being protect for him to his normal anti-islam

2031
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:10,400
Here's a little clip of Alex and his European reporter damn alignment

2032
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,424
Just to give you a little bit of a

2033
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:18,592
Clear the PS4

2034
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,712
People don't know you live there

2035
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:27,040
I mean most of the cities are now logos don't help it

2036
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:30,368
Yes even some of the cities that you would never

2037
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,208
They're starting to turn that way so I mean recommend if you come to

2038
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:39,584
The really safe countries I always say this go to Poland go to Hungry they don't have any coronavirus either

2039
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,400
Hungary the same country

2040
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,680
As you

2041
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:45,984
And is treated as

2042
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,520
The promise

2043
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,080
Especially

2044
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,640
I'm not mistaken so that's that's cool

2045
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:59,296
World population review compiles crime rates by countries for the World by simply divided by the total

2046
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,064
Relation

2047
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:05,952
Switzerland Estonia Austria Croatia Denmark Czech Republic Romanian the Netherlands all have crime rates

2048
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,768
This measure than Poland

2049
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:13,632
Germany is lower than hungry and I was Gales about Germany letting in immigrants all the time

2050
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,680
It's clearly a secondary message

2051
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:17,728
Should you being sad by Wyman's country wreck

2052
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:18,496
Patience

2053
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,800
It's just that Poland is the Arctic

2054
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,592
Type of white nationalists

2055
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:25,664
Yeah

2056
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,224
Public Enemy of George Soros

2057
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,248
So this

2058
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:32,320
Section of The Fringe right-wing of adopted him as kind of a hero

2059
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,112
I wish there was deeper analysis

2060
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:34,880
Commence earbud

2061
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
It's really kind of just

2062
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:38,208
Yeah if I understand

2063
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:40,768
Whatever edit gotten it's a massively complicated

2064
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,560
It's a situation

2065
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:44,096
A large

2066
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:46,400
Part of it is basically Urdu on threatening

2067
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,680
Government leaders

2068
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,448
Stat

2069
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,216
Eagle make

2070
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:50,496
You're racist mad at you

2071
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:56,640
Like that's a certain to a certain extent he's like I'm going to let immigrants into your country and then you're racist

2072
01:38:56,896 --> 01:39:00,480
They're going to be mad if you don't want that I think there is a reading

2073
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:02,528
Situation that falls

2074
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:07,136
Way more complicated than that but that is a big

2075
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:10,720
If I would engage with it more probably

2076
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:12,000
If Alex had more

2077
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:16,608
To do then just be

2078
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,728
You know like Islam's

2079
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,032
Trying to make him bow and he's not going to

2080
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,312
Any kind of losses

2081
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,848
Thought in the middle which is

2082
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,128
Always kind of fun

2083
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,176
I don't want to go to their countries and blow them up

2084
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:36,576
No you

2085
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:45,792
There's a lot of things I can say about the high-quality storable food we sell them for

2086
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,840
Commercial

2087
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,400
Really fumbling

2088
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,192
The ball at the end not good

2089
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:53,728
He's not he's not closing

2090
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,776
Not really

2091
01:39:56,288 --> 01:40:00,384
So you know with this idea that there's a lot of Muslims that are going to be coming into Europe

2092
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,920
Alex gets really

2093
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:02,944
Thinking about the

2094
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,480
Crusades

2095
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:08,320
She starts talking about her first of all

2096
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,344
Christmas had to do

2097
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,624
Ludacris Act

2098
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:16,512
Had to lead the attack with the with the Normans in the French

2099
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,536
Fandango

2100
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:20,352
For 5000 3000 miles in in

2101
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,912
Millions died books

2102
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,680
Holding her up

2103
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,728
Million

2104
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,056
Millions

2105
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,896
Do you know that Wars back then we're almost no men

2106
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:37,760
Has the Muslims enslave kill the men

2107
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:41,600
Bleed with the European women and soldiers

2108
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:44,416
Western Europe

2109
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:48,256
We've talked in the past about how off-base Alex's

2110
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:54,656
The Crusades I don't want to really rehash a lot of that stuff in detail but I wanted to take a moment to talk about the claim me as their about Millions.

2111
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,192
Dying and singles Crusades

2112
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:56,960
Million

2113
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:57,984
It's

2114
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,544
Not estimated that Millions died in individual

2115
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:04,128
There's no real historical consensus for the death toll

2116
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:11,040
Generally speaking the accepted range Hmong Scholars is somewhere between one and three million for the entire span of the Crusades

2117
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:13,600
I should remind you lasted from 1095

2118
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:15,392
To 1291

2119
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,416
That's 109

2120
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,184
96 years

2121
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:21,280
Something that happened over such a long period of time so long ago and

2122
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,816
Such a wide area

2123
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:26,144
Most serious Scholars don't even think it's worthwhile to try and nail down

2124
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:26,912
Precise number

2125
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,192
You're just being pause

2126
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,056
With that being said there's no way out his numbers are even close to Accurate leaving aside the fact

2127
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,592
53 million figure

2128
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,616
Includes combating

2129
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:36,640
Both sides

2130
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:37,664
Not just Alex

2131
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,432
It's beloved

2132
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,456
Crusaders

2133
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:42,784
But let's take that high-end estimated 3 million deaths from

2134
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,808
The Crusades

2135
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,088
Compared to other world

2136
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,624
Then see how it Stacks up

2137
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:52,512
If you look at the list of the most deadly Wars in human history you'll notice that most of them involve

2138
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,792
China in the long-distance

2139
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:57,632
25 million died in the Manchu Conquest

2140
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:00,192
Between 1618 and 1683

2141
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:02,496
Which led to the rise of the key machine Diner

2142
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,312
Deeper in the past the Three Kingdoms

2143
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,360
Conflict between 182 and 2

2144
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,664
Left over 37 Million Dead

2145
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,944
In China

2146
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,712
JoJo fanboy

2147
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:13,760
By the way

2148
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,296
In the in the world

2149
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:17,856
I like playing Dynasty Warriors

2150
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,952
These were both Ariel King guys that would balupu guy

2151
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:26,048
Both internal matters and didn't involve light

2152
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,328
People's Alex into cancer

2153
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,608
About those

2154
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:35,008
So but also for comparison like maybe we should look at how many deaths were caused by the European colonization of the American con

2155
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:35,776
None

2156
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:38,336
A recent study from the University College London

2157
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:40,896
Death toll of approximately 50

2158
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:44,480
6 million people which was just a gigantic

2159
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,576
That in the world it was so big actually did it caused a little icing

2160
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:51,392
No because about 90% of the indigenous

2161
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,160
This population

2162
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,464
Was killed either by conflict or disease

2163
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,488
This left quote

2164
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,256
Vast

2165
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:59,072
Attractive agricultural land being left unattended

2166
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:02,400
Which quote sucked up enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

2167
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,936
To actually cool the planet

2168
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:07,008
The average temperature dropping by 15

2169
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:07,776
Degreaser

2170
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,128
Anyway my larger Point here is not that Europeans are so much worse

2171
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,920
The Muslims or anything like that

2172
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:15,456
I don't think that's a productive way to

2173
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,784
My point is that history is full of atrocity

2174
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:20,320
There's plenty to go round

2175
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:25,952
And it's not good to imagine the people today are exactly the same as people you've decided are there historical analog

2176
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:28,000
Is into the pasture be

2177
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,024
Grappled with

2178
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:29,792
Victims

2179
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,816
Respected unless

2180
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:31,840
Some should be learned

2181
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:36,960
Selective finger-pointing but various things that happened like 800 years ago is not a path forward

2182
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,752
And that seems to be with Alex

2183
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:42,080
Too stuck in the thing that I immediately took away

2184
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:42,848
That was

2185
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,152
This is the beginning of your sentence

2186
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,944
They had to March

2187
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:49,504
Three 4,000 miles to protect their borders

2188
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
And it's like

2189
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:54,368
That's the thought process that is why we have

2190
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,648
So many f*****

2191
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,672
Warriors and

2192
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,720
You is a up

2193
01:43:58,976 --> 01:43:59,744
Thereafter March

2194
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,536
Three or four thousand miles

2195
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,328
To protect the borders

2196
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,632
Three or four thousand miles away from where they are

2197
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,168
That does not

2198
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:09,216
That's insane

2199
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:11,008
That's a very minor

2200
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:17,408
Piece of what's wrong about a lot of this absolutely immediacy of

2201
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,688
Shut the fuk up

2202
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:19,712
You're done

2203
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:21,504
So we're selling food

2204

We Dropship

2209
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,544
Colorado other areas

2210
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,080
Cross the country

2211
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,640
Images of super silver wound gel

2212
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,688
The strongest over-the-counter you can get

2213
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,736
What is the Super Silver

2214
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,040
Toothpaste that

2215
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:55,808
Taking effect

2216
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,576
Your mouth

2217
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,368
Knoxville viruses and bacteria

2218
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:01,440
It's it's close it's

2219
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,208
Closeout

2220
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,232
But it's Vader

2221
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:09,120
Alex is dancing around it a little bit those viruses and bacteria

2222
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:12,192
Well it's a nonspecific

2223
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:16,544
Yep and it's also a kind of thing as opposed to where it be such a direct Focus

2224
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,664
My God helps with

2225
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,968
The food is now five to eight weeks

2226
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:25,248
She's Elizabeth Escalade

2227
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:29,856
Now another thing that's interesting is that Alex has to make a real serious point

2228
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:35,744
Of our other product

2229
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,768
Realize that I

2230
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,120
I think some of his listeners think everything is

2231
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,400
Write that backorder

2232
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,680
I'm getting I'm getting

2233
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:45,216
I'm stuck in a in a

2234
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:49,568
Tulip situation where maybe my entire economy shouldn't be built around 1

2235
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:52,128
Maybe maybe the food

2236
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:52,896
Is

2237
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,664
Is not going

2238
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,688
To be a big seller after

2239
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:55,456
A while so

2240
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:57,760
So Alex take some calls

2241
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:01,344
And I might have honestly

2242
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,624
Ignore

2243
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,392
Some of the

2244
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,928
The stuff like the Crusades

2245
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:05,696
Sure

2246
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:07,232
Eccentric kind of inform

2247
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:09,536
Who's the mindset that these callers

2248
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,304
Appear to be at

2249
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,352
Here is a guy

2250
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,400
Sing something really f***** up

2251
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,752
President Trump needs to do he needs to act like

2252
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,520
Charles

2253
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:20,288
The hammer

2254
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,056
Martell

2255
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:21,824
From France

2256
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:25,152
And just went up whenever the Muslims Justin later

2257
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:28,992
He said no you're not coming into Europe and went and Deuce

2258
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,784
And just brought

2259
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,600
And actually ordered his troops

2260
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,904
Take no prisoners these people

2261
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,464
Idiot

2262
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:39,744
Wipe them out

2263
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:42,304
It's all good well for this collared say to Trump

2264
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,632
Should be like Charles Martel and repel an invasion

2265
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,168
Maybe if you're lucky

2266
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:52,032
Some ancient example of someone

2267
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,848
Prince of the Franks

2268
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:55,616
It's from 7

2269
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:59,456
6:42 41 and reputation

2270
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:02,272
Anybody good military leader with Wars against the Arabs

2271
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,296
As well as the sax

2272
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,088
This is not why

2273
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:05,856
The color is red

2274
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:09,952
History there's been some disagreement among historians

2275
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:12,256
It's about a particular victory in Bartell's career

2276
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:15,584
That is his defeat of an Arab Army advancing on tour

2277
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,864
In 730

2278
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,632
32

2279
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:22,752
One side argues that it was martel's victory that saved the Western World from Muslim rule

2280
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:28,384
The other side points out that the earliest account of the battle which was commissioned by martel's Uncle

2281
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:33,504
Clearly lays out that this Arab Army has been enlisted by a Christian Duke named do you do of

2282
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,528
AquaTech

2283
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,880
To help win back some of that had been taken by Martell

2284
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:45,024
Is a Spanish land that was taken by Martell and he had a partial why would they be mad at me

2285
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,560
Why would

2286
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:51,424
They're making me there's no indication from contemporary sources at that

2287
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:54,752
Time that this was a battle between Islam and christened

2288
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:58,336
That's something it was fabricated later

2289
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:04,736
The Narrative begin a book called Decline and fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon released in 1776

2290
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:09,856
In the book of giving argues that the Roman Empire fell due to embracing Christian

2291
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:10,880
Which is not a position

2292
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:11,904
That most historians

2293
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:18,304
Leaving that Central thesis aside his book also serves as the jumping-off point for the retelling of the Battle of Tours

2294
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,864
It is casting of Martell is a verb

2295
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,400
Leader who stopped Islam

2296
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:24,192
From overtaking the Western world

2297
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,752
This was not a case of given reflect

2298
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:27,776
Eating actual history

2299
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:31,616
It was him using a historical event to craft a narrative

2300
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,640
And it's a narrative

2301
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,432
It's been widely attractive to ascertain

2302
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:35,200
Subset of

2303
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:35,968
The population

2304
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:36,992
Today

2305
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:41,600
In 2001 a multi-millionaire fascist heir to the regnery publishing

2306
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,648
Fortune Williams

2307
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:50,048
Saturday Charles Martel Society

2308
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,864
This is a white nationalist outlet that runs

2309
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,144
At the very races

2310
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,448
Justin anti-semitic Occidental Observer

2311
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:59,520
And was responsible for the founding of the national policy

2312
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,824
Who's President is Richard Spencer

2313
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,920
Through these Outlets are other Ventures regnery funds

2314
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:06,688
With grants

2315
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,992
A message of white nationalism and brutal

2316
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:11,296
Do Muslim rhetoric has been spread quite effectively

2317
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:15,392
He's far from the only spoke in that wheel but William regnery junior is a

2318
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:18,208
The massive source of funding behind some of the early sources

2319
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:18,976
Of what has

2320
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,256
Become the alt right

2321
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,536
In this modern cycle

2322
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,608
This isn't just some kind of intellectual publishing

2323
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:25,632
Though

2324
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,680
You're like a we talk about ideas

2325
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,216
This is real world,

2326
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,032
I've received Argy Christchurch shooting

2327
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:35,616
Where the killer had written the name Charles Martel on the barrel of the gun

2328
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:37,920
Use the burger 51 innocent people

2329
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:42,784
Is Twisted historical narrative about Martell began with given in 1917

2330
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,552
76

2331
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:46,880
Fascist

2332
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:48,416
Using this narrative

2333
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,184
Pantheon

2334
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:51,488
That's why this caller know Sir Charles

2335
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,256
Martellus

2336
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:55,072
Not because he's a scholar of Frankish Dukes

2337
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,144
Because he knows about him from

2338
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,704
Christchurch shooter

2339
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,472
Church shooter

2340
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,752
Was reading about him

2341
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,288
I was really trying not to

2342
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,056
Stereotype

2343
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,104
Cuz listening to The Voice

2344
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:07,872
You're like

2345
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,664
Okay I've heard I've heard

2346
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:11,456
I get that

2347
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,992
You know I'm not trying to be

2348
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:14,272
That guy but when he drops

2349
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,552
Martell in there as well

2350
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:22,464
Something suspicious is going on here. Alright fascist anti-muslim

2351
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:27,328
Blogs

2352
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,352
Because of this

2353
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,656
Distorted Narrative of this battle for

2354
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:32,960
From 17 to 7:32

2355
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:35,520
White Nationals have so many little coated things that

2356
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,312
Yeah that you would

2357
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:39,360
Dismiss immediately if you weren't in there

2358
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,712
Next caller gives another one

2359
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:56,512
He was Austrian Hungarian Empire royalty

2360
01:50:57,024 --> 01:51:00,864
Royals by Europe

2361
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:07,264
When you hear somebody vocal the color keyplan you know absolutely without a doubt that person

2362
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,800
Talking to is a white man

2363
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,360
The clergy plan is a classic

2364
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:13,664
White nationalist conspiracy theory deposit

2365
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:16,224
It's that austro-hungarian intellectual Richard

2366
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,016
Vaughn

2367
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,296
Off-color Gates

2368
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:20,576
Harry's secret plan

2369
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:24,416
To replace the white people in Europe with non Europe non-white immigrants

2370
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:26,464
And that the EU is a final expression

2371
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:30,816
Basically as the theory goes these immigrants would have no intern

2372
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:34,912
Relationship to the countries they were living at and thought they would be less likely to fight back

2373
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:37,216
The formation of a One World Government

2374
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,008
Usurp individual Khan

2375
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:42,080
To support this Theory proponents 10 to pick

2376
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:43,104
Can choose various things

2377
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,176
Crafter white genocide

2378
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:50,528
For instance you believe that the future will be of

2379
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:55,392
This was a belief that he had based on the sense that prejudice will decrease over

2380
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:59,232
Overtime of the people of different races will ultimately

2381
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,256
In the future

2382
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:02,048
This is not him saying that he wants

2383
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:05,120
Does intermarry or that there's anything to fairies

2384
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,144
Behind his beliefs at all

2385
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:09,984
It sincerely just a sentiment that could only really be seen as scandalous

2386
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:12,800
If you are a person who supposed to races intermarry

2387
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:14,080
Like I don't know

2388
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,360
Nick Fuentes

2389
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,384
Miscegenation

2390
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:21,248
The rub comes because clergy was also a big proponent of a United Europe

2391
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:24,320
As he advanced in his work

2392
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,088
Is it work

2393
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:25,856
Tanjiro

2394
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:31,488
It's probably important to recognize that this text was written and published between World War 1 and World War

2395
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,280
So some of the utopian idealism

2396
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,816
Some of a peaceful United Europe

2397
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:35,840
Director

2398
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:37,120
Response the horror

2399
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:38,400
Of the first World War

2400
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,448
The brief version of this

2401
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:42,752
Conspiracy theories basically just white nationalist

2402
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,288
Combining corgis

2403
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:46,336
C4 United Europe with his belief

2404
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,616
The future of man

2405
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:49,664
It is a being mixed race

2406
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:52,224
There are these are combined

2407
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,040
To argue that he wanted to unite Europe in order

2408
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:57,088
To bring in tons of non-white people who

2409
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:59,648
Create this desire teachers

2410
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:00,928
Are there be no more white people

2411
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,464
Also proposing

2412
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,256
This conspiracy believe clergy was doing

2413
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:06,560
Behalf of the Jews

2414
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,328
We got bingo

2415
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:08,864
It is amazing

2416
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,144
To me how bad the

2417
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,168
The plans of the

2418
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:12,192
Masterminds are

2419
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:15,008
And their worldview it's almost like

2420
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,544
They're the dumb

2421
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,848
Making up the plan

2422
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:25,504
Much like evoking Charles Martel this caller bring up the kalergi plan is a

2423
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,552
Extreme

2424
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:29,600
White nationalist being on the

2425
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:30,880
That's what this is

2426
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,208
These are subtle signifiers that people listening B

2427
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:39,328
But indicate that the conversation that's being had he's not about current events

2428
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:42,400
It's about a conspiracy theory that says Jews are trying to force

2429
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:43,424
Integration on wifey

2430
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:44,704
And it seems like Alex

2431
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,008
Not only

2432
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,288
Familiar with it

2433
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,824
He is into it

2434
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:51,616
So

2435
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:53,408
You can see where Alex's heads

2436
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,944
Can remember we

2437
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:59,296
So long ago when we were like oh I'm not sure if I want to call him and out now waiting eyes

2438
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:02,368
Yeah those were

2439
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,744
You live and you learn

2440
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:11,328
So Alex has complained about the the whale

2441
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,376
Earlier in this episode

2442
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,144
And that was

2443
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:14,912
To set up

2444
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:16,960
Towards the end of the Epic

2445
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:20,288
You would have Harrison Smith come in

2446
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:23,616
To talk about their experience being kicked out of Sea-Tac by Barca

2447
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:26,944
We'll get to that in a second but before we do

2448
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:27,712
Chose

2449
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:28,992
He

2450
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,272
The brilliant

2451
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:31,808
It's political my okay

2452
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,088
You makes a prediction

2453
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:37,184
About the Democratic primaries at age well

2454
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:39,232
Bloomberg hasn't dropped out of

2455
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,536
Bloomberg

2456
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,840
It is is the FrontRunner to me he's got

2457
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:44,608
Got the money

2458
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,632
He's not

2459
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,656
Not going to go away

2460
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:48,192
He's got the will

2461
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:50,240
Anyone else has the wheel

2462
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:53,056
Smash cut to Bloomberg.

2463
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,336
Fairies

2464
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:57,152
No matter what was it the next day

2465
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:01,504
So

2466
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,784
Apparently

2467
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,808
Nancy pack

2468
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:04,576
According to Alex

2469
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:05,344
Workforce

2470
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:07,136
Go out to break the short

2471
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:11,488
CLEP I'm compilation replay of who we learned where everybody bags

2472
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:15,072
Police dog

2473
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,888
Remove them remove them

2474
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,168
You think about a villain

2475
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,240
Gorka the Titan

2476
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:24,032
Workout the tighten up hearing

2477
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,848
So the entire story is a Gorka came up

2478
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:30,944
To the Infowars people were filming at CPAC and said they shouldn't be there since their loot

2479
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:31,968
Conspiracy

2480
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:37,088
Maybe you got them thrown out I have no idea but at least

2481
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,624
Displays I don't I don't know if it's

2482
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:39,392
Shows that

2483
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:42,208
Anyway this spirals out of control it to Alex being convinced

2484
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:44,256
Gorka was the neocon watchdog

2485
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:47,584
Roaming the Halls throwing out anyone who dares the Neil

2486
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:49,632
Anise cloves

2487
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:52,448
Included three members of Trumps family SP

2488
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,008
This is just Alex being Alex

2489
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,848
He knows Gorka has a huge radio show that's indicated on Salem

2490
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:01,408
Media in his own way way more stations in Alex

2491
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:04,480
Courtesan who actually did work in the Trump

2492
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,248
Administration

2493
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,552
It is directly connected to power as opposed

2494
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:09,856
Alex who just constantly shunned and kept

2495
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:11,648
Far past an arm's distance

2496
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:14,720
Just like Alex tried to bait Joe Rogan

2497
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:16,256
Giving him Free Press by calling him

2498
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,024
Sneaky Snake

2499
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:20,608
And trying to start a one-sided Feud with him

2500
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:21,632
Same thing with Gorka

2501
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:23,168
Alex knows that if corkatoo

2502
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:23,936
Takes the bait and star

2503
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:29,056
Search respond to Alex on his own show

2504
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:29,824
SS2

2505
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:33,664
This stuff is just pathetically transparent and if you pay attention Alex doesn't

2506
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:36,736
Seemed to start foods with people he doesn't have a possibility of getting

2507
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:37,504
Free Press

2508
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:41,088
Joe Rogan Sebastian Gorka Brian stelter

2509
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:43,136
These are all people have platforms you can hope

2510
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:49,024
This is one of his big strategies and I would tell him to ignore this

2511
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,048
Does.

2512
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,072
Top doesn't matter

2513
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:52,352
I mean in this

2514
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:54,656
Circumstance you giant troll don't

2515
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,192
Yeah yeah

2516
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:57,984
So Alex

2517
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,288
Gorka wanted

2518
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:01,824
To kick Infowars out because

2519
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,848
Cuz they sell supplement

2520
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:07,456
As opposed to them being crazy lunatic

2521
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:10,272
Yeah you shouldn't be here

2522
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:13,344
Did you sell supplements Gorka

2523
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,160
TV

2524
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:16,928
What that bad

2525
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:19,232
Tell

2526
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:22,560
Really supplements

2527
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:23,584
You're making us Wayne

2528
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:27,936
So I went and check gorkas website for his show America first

2529
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:32,032
And the first thing that jumped out at me was the fact that he has ads for my pillow

2530
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:32,800
On his site

2531
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:39,456
Genesis Communications Networks

2532
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:41,760
All right sounds like snake oil pillows

2533
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:46,624
The man died on his site for supplements is for a company called balance of nature

2534
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:49,696
This company legitimately just sells dietary

2535
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:52,000
Like they have a product called fruit

2536
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:55,072
Here's the product ingredient list for fruits

2537
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,096
Apples

2538
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:58,400
Aloe vera apple banana blueberry

2539
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:00,448
Cherry cranberry grape grapefruit

2540
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,984
Lemon mango

2541
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:02,752
Pia

2542
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:04,544
Pineapple raspberry strawberry

2543
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:05,312
Tomato

2544
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:08,896
Sounds like snake oil fruit in a blender

2545
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:10,944
And then turn it into a gummy

2546
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:18,624
There's another one called fiber and spices but honestly

2547
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,672
Unless they're lying on their ingredient list

2548
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:23,744
This is all just natural things ground up into a pill form

2549
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,280
Another making health

2550
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,560
Except the Fiber One

2551
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:27,584
Which says it helps

2552
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:30,400
I think is not an irresponsible thing

2553
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:32,192
To suggest for a fiber pill

2554
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:33,472
Yeah I think everybody knows

2555
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:34,240
Is it fiber helps

2556
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,008
Yeah

2557
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:41,408
Alex's specifically referring here to another ad the Gorka has on his site I think the balance of nature is the one that he's like

2558
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:47,808
It's pretty good that sounds that sounds

2559
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:48,832
Kind of situation

2560
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,112
So this other one

2561
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,928
Is an ad to gorkha has for product

2562
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,976
Which they claim can quote

2563
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:59,072
Help your body reduce pain associated with aging exercise and everyday living

2564
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:05,472
This is mostly attributed to the antioxidant anti-inflammatory properties of its ingredients which are ikran

2565
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:06,240
Turmeric

2566
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:08,032
Resveratrol

2567
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:09,312
Resveratrol

2568
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,920
I decided to check out to Infowars store

2569
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:15,712
And see if Alex old the same thing

2570
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:16,992
And how he sold them

2571
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:20,832
One thing that surprised me is that I knew that Alex oldest up

2572
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:21,856
I called Icarus

2573
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,392
But I went to look at it

2574
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,672
The product doesn't care

2575
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,976
It's spelled

2576
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:32,096
Pickering is spelled icariin in Alex's product is

2577
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:34,400
Misspelled icure

2578
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:37,216
It's very weird

2579
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:41,056
Okay it seems like people think of this product

2580
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:44,896
Which is also sold in gas station bathrooms

2581
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:45,664
I love it

2582
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:49,248
I have no idea what Alex her name is product something so close

2583
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:52,832
Do something that is the name before really well-known supplement

2584
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:57,184
Confuse people but I have no idea product yesterday.

2585
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:00,000
I don't know that's frustrated I assume there's something

2586
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:02,304
Is it did you look up whether or not that was a

2587
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:04,352
I think what

2588
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:07,168
No not the the the one out that Alex

2589
02:00:08,704 --> 02:00:09,984
No it's just a name

2590
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:13,824
It just an old the name is okay

2591
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,128
I thought there was

2592
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:18,688
Ed completely different herb name decorate.

2593
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:21,760
Okay Alex's Bean turmeric product is body

2594
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:24,320
And the write-up for body is it says the product

2595
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:26,112
Contains things that are quote known for their

2596
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:29,440
Anti-inflammatory properties to work synergistically with turmeric

2597
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,720
Full body support

2598
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:33,024
The write-up says it will help boost

2599
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:36,864
Support your flexibility Mobility joint function even more

2600
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:40,192
Honestly sounds pretty similar to the relief Factor marketing

2601
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:41,216
Yeah that's

2602
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:42,496
That's such the

2603
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:45,824
That's a porta-potty copywriter who's like

2604
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,640
What okay give me some specs on what this product does

2605
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:49,664
F****** nothing

2606
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:53,504
Alright I'll put synergistically in there and will nail it

2607
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:54,784
DNA Forest

2608
02:00:55,040 --> 02:01:01,184
Contains Resveratrol support heart function cellular energy production

2609
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,464
System boosting Mental Health

2610
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,000
Promote energy production and more

2611
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,536
They say the product can help

2612
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,560
Fight against things

2613
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:08,352
Causing cellular damage

2614
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:11,936
Which could be painful so this again seems right in the ballpark

2615
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:14,752
We know that Alex sells omega-3 Altima

2616
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:17,056
Fish oil and weed

2617
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:17,824
Because it gives Alex

2618
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:18,592
The burpees

2619
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:20,384
If you read the copy for Alta

2620
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,176
Fish oil this line jumps out at you

2621
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:27,552
Studies have suggested that fish oil and fish oil supplement Tatian can slightly lower blood pressure

2622
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:30,624
Increase triglyceride levels decrease the growth rate of plaque

2623
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:34,464
And provide a soothing reduction and inflammatory responses and joints

2624
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:40,096
Reducing inflammatory responses in joint is the same thing as reducing joint pain

2625
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:41,888
This is all pretty close

2626
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:42,912
What you're getting close to

2627
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:44,704
Snake-oil with a Gorka

2628
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,496
But you know what would really suck for Alex

2629
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,544
Really suck if I had a clip

2630
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:51,872
From him from last Wednesday or tries to sell bodies

2631
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:58,272
Is product by saying that some people think it's better than Advil for pain

2632
02:01:58,528 --> 02:02:01,088
Work as a snake oil salesman for selling things for pain relief

2633
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,880
It's a good thing you don't have that clip

2634
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:04,416
I have only I did

2635
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:08,256
We have the ultimate turmeric formula bodies 95% of humanoid

2636
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:11,072
That's amazing for immune system your whole body people

2637
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,912
Pain see what that's for you personally

2638
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:22,848
30% off go f*** yourself Gorka okay getting into snake-oil territory when you sell things for pain relief

2639
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:26,944
The pot is screaming across the world to the kettle

2640
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:31,808
Alex is really just trying to take swings at Gorka even when

2641
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:35,904
Ends up hitting himself but his audience doesn't

2642
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:40,000
Even though Gorka was in the Trump Administration

2643
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:41,792
And it's been in that orbit

2644
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:42,816
For a while

2645
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:44,096
He's not a trump guy

2646
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,376
You never Trump

2647
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:48,960
Who broke through the criticism the attacks the black ball

2648
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:50,496
What the Democrats

2649
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:58,432
Cheap Alex Jones in the populist movement

2650
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:01,504
Let them take the party completely over

2651
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:05,088
The police dogs

2652
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:10,720
In there hovering around literally spouting and pontificating an arrogant wedding

2653
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:15,072
Gorka became a naturalized US citizen in 2012 so unless Alex

2654
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:17,632
Naturalized citizens are really America

2655
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,192
What are you just at the light

2656
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:21,984
I think he thinks

2657
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:25,824
I think I would go along with you

2658
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:30,176
So we end this March 2nd episode with

2659
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:31,456
UPS de resistance

2660
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:32,992
Which of course is Alex

2661
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,016
Threatening

2662
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:36,576
And challenging Gorka to fight and of course

2663
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:40,672
Everyone knew it was going to happen no matter what yeah we're going to

2664
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:44,512
Do it for charity or whatever it is in the ring with five rounds

2665
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:50,656
Enjoy that and that's always fun to your Alex want to fight somebody

2666
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:55,008
No thing that I think is most notable about this is why

2667
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:57,312
Shroyer's response

2668
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,616
Everyone hates you now

2669
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,664
Will you pose with guns

2670
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,480
Everybody knows you don't know what she and the bullet comes out of

2671
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:14,464
The Habit in Vegas I will get in that ring and I will be

2672
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,744
Beat his brains out

2673
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,024
To sign the form you big

2674
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:32,384
I might go you got your cardiovascular do you want to challenge him

2675
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:37,760
Charity boxing match because he's so big and powerful he wants to get in the ring

2676
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:38,528
Oops

2677
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:45,184
What is Gorka think about

2678
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:47,232
Maybe I'm getting

2679
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:53,632
Like really twisted on my perception about Owen Shroyer he seems to be acting more like an adult

2680
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:55,680
He does I don't know what happened

2681
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:57,216
Something's Happened

2682
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:01,824
Has a confidence about him maybe wasn't there before

2683
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:05,664
If you watch the video this cuz I had to go back and check cuz it sounded like it was an addict

2684
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:07,200
After he says

2685
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:11,808
It sounded like they cut out something

2686
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:16,160
If you watch this you can see Owen kind of like rolling his eyes even a little bit

2687
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:18,976
There is a feeling of elevation above

2688
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:20,256
Alex's b*******

2689
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:23,072
Yeah it's like when a twelve-year-old has to raise himself

2690
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:24,864
As the parents are like

2691
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:30,752
Very absent of the 12 year old

2692
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:34,080
I guess I'm the adult I'm 13 but I guess I have to be an adult now

2693
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:41,760
I don't know I'm it's very possible I'm reading way too much into it but Ellen's response they're impressed

2694
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:43,040
Miata certain level up

2695
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:43,808
Let's get lit

2696
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:45,088
Focus let's get back in

2697
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:46,624
Came to this as opposed to being like

2698
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,928
Yeah it does

2699
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,744
He seems to be making the choices that are

2700
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,048
What are more adult

2701
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:57,632
It used to be that Alex was like that

2702
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:01,984
That playground bully and Owen was that Lackey where the bullied be like hey

2703
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:04,288
You you go fighting

2704
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:06,336
You go fight his own would be like

2705
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:10,176
Is Owens identity was wrapped up in being the Destroyer

2706
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:16,320
Exactly baby it's a situation where he went and yelled at Jerry Nadler interrupted the impeachment thing

2707
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:21,440
And had to go do a hard bid of a couple minutes

2708
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,720
Maybe that woke him up

2709
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:23,488
Maybe then

2710
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:27,328
Maybe he wrote a letter

2711
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:30,400
He's got a

2712
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,424
Maybe that woke

2713
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:33,984
To be like possibilities of

2714
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:36,032
Yeah something I don't know what it is

2715
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:37,824
I'm interested to see where it goes

2716
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:40,128
Daddy's been drunk too many times

2717
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:40,896
Could be

2718
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:46,016
But in the power rankings if I were making them now I think I am almost ready to adjust it

2719
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:48,320
Like Paul Joseph Watson

2720
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:51,136
Down the chart

2721
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:51,904
Clearly in the num

2722
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:53,184
Yeah yeah

2723
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:53,952
He's taking over

2724
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:58,816
Stone has started the war room power

2725
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:01,120
He's ascendant

2726
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:04,192
So we get to

2727
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:05,728
And Alex

2728
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:06,496
Is

2729
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:07,520
No

2730
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:08,288
Announcing

2731
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:13,152
My kids coronavirus narrative is just completely

2732
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:14,432
It ends so it

2733
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:17,248
This is specifically tailored to rip

2734
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:18,016
The argument

2735
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:19,296
Did Trump has not done

2736
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:21,088
And he's poorly prepared

2737
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:27,488
President Trump about four and a half weeks ago

2738
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:33,888
Pentagon and FEMA to emergency

2739
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:35,424
Emergency

2740
02:07:36,704 --> 02:07:37,472
How to Coronavirus

2741
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:42,336
That point and the Democrats taking the bait in saying that

2742
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:44,128
You do not have any response

2743
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:44,896
Launch to it

2744
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:48,992
Measured response

2745
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:50,272
Issa Vegas

2746
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,040
About it

2747
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:52,576
Tricom in the media

2748
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:56,672
I have literally no idea what Alex is talking

2749
02:07:56,928 --> 02:08:01,536
Doesn't cite any sources on their ass and I don't believe is Pentagon ship based on a very strong

2750
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:09,984
But now here Alex is reporting on his show the Trump secretly instituted a National Emergency over a

2751
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,008
Month ago

2752
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:16,384
As always he secretly instituted the thing that we needed just cuz we didn't hear about it doesn't mean he didn't

2753
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:22,016
Do it this is super weird because on March 3rd Voice of America reported on Trump discussing the potential

2754
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:22,784
National Emergency

2755
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:24,832
I don't think you'll need that

2756
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:25,856
Because I really

2757
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:28,416
Think we're in extremely good shape we're prepared for anything

2758
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:30,720
We can always do that at a later date if we need it

2759
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,512
Definitely

2760
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:34,048
Hasn't declared a national emergency

2761
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:37,376
50 publicly or secretly Alex is making this s*** up

2762
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:40,448
He's just working off of headline in the hill

2763
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:43,008
FEMA preparing for Trump emergency

2764
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:44,800
Declaration on Coronavirus

2765
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:45,568
Report

2766
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:49,920
This article is about how and tell the president declares a national emergency

2767
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:51,712
FEMA is not allowed to

2768
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:52,736
To do things like

2769
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:55,040
Quote creating disaster

2770
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:56,832
Medical assistance team

2771
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:59,136
Mobile hospitals in military transport

2772
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:03,744
There's a separate budget for FEMA they have for disaster situations

2773
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,048
It's a full 34 billion dollars right now

2774
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:08,608
And they're not they're literally not allowed to use it

2775
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:09,632
Unless Trump declares an

2776
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:10,400
National Emergency

2777
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:12,192
These things aren't happy

2778
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:15,776
Such as FEMA setting up mobile hospitals and cracking into that 34 Billy

2779
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:19,104
So there's a strong indication that no secret emergency declaration

2780
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:21,664
But Oz read that headline

2781
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:22,688
Not the article

2782
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,224
So he's using to Hadley

2783
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:24,992
Great

2784
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:31,392
Good work as a public health emergency

2785
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:33,952
That was declared by Health and Human

2786
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:37,280
Services secretary Alex Azar back on January 31st

2787
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:41,120
This was primarily to quote give state

2788
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:42,656
Tribal and local health

2789
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:44,192
It's more flexibility to request

2790
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:47,520
Fhhs authorized them to temporarily reassigned state

2791
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:48,800
Local and tribal purse

2792
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:54,176
Personnel to respond to 2019-novel coronavirus if their salaries normally or funded

2793
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:57,504
In whole or in part by Public Health Service Act program

2794
02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:01,344
That's almost certainly with Alex's conflating with this hill ahead

2795
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:02,112
You scammed

2796
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:05,696
And now you turned that into a narrative the Trump secretly declared an emergency

2797
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:07,232
Be back at the end of June

2798
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:09,024
And he's got this whole thing under control

2799
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:10,304
Houses not with you

2800
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,072
Call Aditi

2801
02:10:12,864 --> 02:10:13,888
So now it's really important

2802
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:14,912
Recognize that

2803
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:16,192
This is now

2804
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:16,960
A month ago

2805
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:18,752
Because that'll come into

2806
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,800
I know I'm asking you to

2807
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:25,664
Keep in mind a number various things in a timeline there is a lot going on

2808
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:27,712
Because it'll all come together

2809
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:28,736
Okay

2810
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:31,808
So Alex brings back up his fake lieutenant colonel

2811
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:38,976
Apparently this specific again

2812
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:42,816
A tired

2813
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:47,936
They believe they believe how much

2814
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:49,216
Play CDC Belize

2815
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:51,264
That about half the public will get

2816
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,056
The virus be exposed to it

2817
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:58,944
Want to have 2%

2818
02:10:59,200 --> 02:10:59,712
Butt cheek

2819
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:04,320
Specific well what percentage of America is what you call

2820
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:07,392
So I guess it's very specific again

2821
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:09,440
I thought Alex a drop that narrative

2822
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:12,768
Now

2823
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:13,792
3 million

2824
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,072
Okay

2825
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:21,728
I don't know what you say in response to this I would ask him to explain the 3800 or so cases

2826
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:25,056
Is an Italy are those all Chinese Italian

2827
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:28,128
I would ask about the 4700 or so cases in Iraq

2828
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:34,528
But I'm sure he just make some weird race science argument about first and Chinese G there than similar

2829
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:36,832
There's no there's no reason

2830
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:37,856
This virus is racist

2831
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:40,160
An expression of his

2832
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:41,184
There's nothing

2833
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,232
So Alex

2834
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:45,792
It clearly is using this hill article

2835
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:47,584
That is about how

2836
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:49,120
FEMA has

2837
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:49,888
Funding

2838
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,448
But they can't use until there's an emergency

2839
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:55,264
Declaration

2840
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,312
Trump is already secretly done

2841
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:58,080
Now

2842
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:01,152
You didn't do anything with it you secretly

2843
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,688
He hasn't done that

2844
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:04,736
Okay because these things

2845
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:07,296
Well you would say that

2846
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:09,856
You see what you need to understand is it

2847
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:12,928
It's what people don't do tells you what they are

2848
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:19,328
Pentagon

2849
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:20,864
The White House

2850
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:23,424
They've declared a secret emergency the federal government

2851
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:25,728
Agencies that would need to be deal with that

2852
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:32,896
FEMA preparing for possible coronavirus emergency declaration no

2853
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:33,920
It's already in place

2854
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:35,712
Anyway

2855
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:37,248
Mike Adams comes back in

2856
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:38,016
Hooray

2857
02:12:38,272 --> 02:12:39,808
So I know from listen

2858
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:43,136
The best that this entire narrative about these lieutenant colonel

2859
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:44,672
Is just laundering

2860
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:45,696
Stuff that Mike

2861
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:51,328
I don't know bike is on and they discussed these fakes

2862
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:55,168
It's adorable Rosecrans crazy

2863
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:57,472
The song your show yesterday you

2864
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:00,544
Person

2865
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:02,336
Who told you they are preparing for the pasta

2866
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:06,176
Millions decimal

2867
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:10,016
Lieutenant colonel

2868
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,856
Again over the weekend

2869
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:15,136
Yeah couple days ago

2870
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:17,184
And they're like no

2871
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:21,024
Alright

2872
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:24,352
Uggs the viruses real

2873
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:26,144
We don't want to panic. But

2874
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,448
We need people that obviously know this is real

2875
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:29,984
Cuz I kind of want the hardcore

2876
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:31,520
Patriots

2877
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:43,552
Telephone

2878
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:45,856
Operation

2879
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:48,928
House with some business we were conducting

2880
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:53,792
Mostly with that you were eating

2881
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,072
Yeah right

2882
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:00,192
Kelly saying that they are some people I think 33 million

2883
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:03,264
Really thinks it's 3 million

2884
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:05,824
I don't believe there's a real Alex whatever say was first

2885
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:08,128
This is just a random nonsense

2886
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:11,968
Yeah you see the first contradiction of the original form

2887
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:12,736
This narrative

2888
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:17,600
Now instead of it as being these people of their own volition

2889
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:18,368
I'm telling Alex

2890
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:21,440
They were commanded to because the higher-ups

2891
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:25,280
Want to make sure that the hardcore Patriot people like Alex

2892
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:26,560
Know what's up

2893
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:29,888
Because I when it's coming down they're going to need them prepared or something

2894
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,424
So now it's order

2895
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:33,984
This is official chain of command stuff

2896
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,264
Which is a direct contradiction

2897
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,568
Section of the earlier attack.

2898
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:38,592
I insisted

2899
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:39,872
Keep I keep that in mind

2900
02:14:40,128 --> 02:14:40,896
Cuz it's it's just

2901
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:41,920
The clear-cut case

2902
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:44,224
Of this being b*******

2903
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:46,016
Keep your writers room off

2904
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:48,832
Your writers room shouldn't be the show

2905
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:51,392
You shouldn't be workshopping your b*******

2906
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:52,416
In front of me

2907
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:53,184
It makes me angry

2908
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:56,768
Yeah it makes this really

2909
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,840
As long as you're paying attention over

2910
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:00,864
A couple days

2911
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:02,912
You'll notice the shift starts to happen

2912
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:05,984
He's making all this up

2913
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:07,264
So anyway

2914
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:12,896
Alex is really mad about the media engaging in Hysteria

2915
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:18,528
There's all this hysteria surrounding the virus again I would say that Mike Adam saying it's over

2916
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:22,624
Humanity there's only going to be lone survivors is about as hysterical as you can get

2917
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:25,440
Mike engages in a little more Asteria

2918
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:30,560
Remember to early on I said that China would begin harvesting this and act

2919
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:31,584
Actually trying to deposit

2920
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:33,376
Into cities across America

2921
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:36,448
I think we we've already been under attack

2922
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,264
I think of some of these outbreaks that we're seeing are

2923
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,032
Because

2924
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:40,800
China

2925
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:42,336
Try to export the virus

2926
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,128
So you can say it

2927
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:47,968
So how is that not Hysteria

2928
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:52,576
We've always been under attack viruses are in the United States

2929
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:56,416
Google that's not hysteria that's just that's just

2930
02:15:56,672 --> 02:16:02,304
Clear-eyed political analysis the sterical global political

2931
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:03,072
Yeah

2932
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:04,864
So we see another shift

2933
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:07,168
In the narrative and the timeline

2934
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:09,472
Hear this next clip with Mike and Alex talk

2935
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:15,104
My concerns Alex that there may be so many cities under lockdown and quarantine

2936
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:16,896
Election day

2937
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:19,456
Democrat

2938
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:24,064
To postpone

2939
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,088
3 weeks ago

2940
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:28,672
Now this week that's in the news already going I will this affect

2941
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:32,768
Did he say that three weeks ago did he say that on Sunday

2942
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:33,792
You're right

2943
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:34,816
Okay alright

2944
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:39,168
Three weeks ago you did say it was over for Lone Survivor now

2945
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:42,240
So they get done 300 stupid

2946
02:16:43,264 --> 02:16:44,288
I want talk about this

2947
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:45,312
But I don't want to get

2948
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:47,360
Alex has Tommy Rob

2949
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:50,432
Is it on the show

2950
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:55,040
And we're not going to cover this interview because I'm not going to engage with the story

2951
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,064
All good

2952
02:16:56,320 --> 02:17:00,672
On March 2nd Tommy was arrested for common assault after Witnesses say he punched a guy in

2953
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:01,440
The face of the pub

2954
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:02,208
Blackpool

2955
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:05,792
Tommy claims that the man had assaulted his eight-year-old daughter

2956
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:07,328
And he was restraining them

2957
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:09,376
The reason I won't engage

2958
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:10,144
The story is

2959
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:10,912
Because

2960
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:12,448
Generally speaking

2961
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:14,752
I don't trust Tommy Robinson at all

2962
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:18,592
He's been shown to be a very inconsistent untrustworthy source

2963
02:17:18,848 --> 02:17:19,360
The bad faith

2964
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:20,896
But this is way too

2965
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:21,920
Sensitive of a story

2966
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:24,480
Position on or comment on

2967
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:26,528
And in reality I do not know what have

2968
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:28,832
Yeah and I refused

2969
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:29,856
To be in

2970
02:17:30,624 --> 02:17:31,392
I'm good with that

2971
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:32,672
Their interview

2972
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:33,696
Alex and Tommy

2973
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:34,720
Is disgust

2974
02:17:35,488 --> 02:17:38,560
And honestly it's one of the first times in recent memory today

2975
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:39,840
Literally felt sick to my

2976
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:40,608
My stomach listening

2977
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:43,424
If Tommy is lying that's gross

2978
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:45,472
If he's telling the truth

2979
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:47,520
He's allowing his own child trauma to

2980
02:17:47,776 --> 02:17:52,640
To be used by Alex to attack Muslims and drag queen Story Hour and I can't handle either possible

2981
02:17:53,664 --> 02:17:55,968
No matter what the reality is it's gross exploit

2982
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:57,504
Alex plays

2983
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:00,320
The clip of Tommy interviewing his daughter will get it

2984
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:02,368
8 years old on his show

2985
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:03,648
It's disgusting

2986
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:04,416
These people are

2987
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:06,464
It's supremely a fan

2988
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:08,256
Alex

2989
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:09,280
Using this tutor

2990
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:10,560
Try and sell his product

2991
02:18:11,328 --> 02:18:13,376
But you see why they want planetary control

2992
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:15,424
The carry out their evil desires

2993
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:20,800
It's not just the Muslims that want to do this if she stood level us every level

2994
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:25,152
Evil incarnate on this planet so please remember

2995
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:26,944
You're the only defense of the children

2996
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:28,992
And when you

2997
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:33,856
Supporting for by spreading the word and by praying for is my body products you're making all possible

2998
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:36,160
Get the products we go

2999
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:39,488
It's just unbelievable like it's one of the first time

3000
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,304
A very long time that I have

3001
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:43,072
Legitimate

3002
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:43,840
Whitley Phelps

3003
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:45,888
I feel like I might throw up list

3004
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:46,912
To it it was

3005
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:52,032
It was a level of like no matter what the reality is here this cannot be accepted

3006
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:55,104
How

3007
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:56,384
Does it keep happening

3008
02:18:57,152 --> 02:18:59,200
I tell you that there's nobody

3009
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:02,272
And then this happens and I'm like yeah

3010
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:05,088
The I thought I didn't even think that was a line

3011
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:05,856
To cross

3012
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:06,624
Yeah

3013
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:07,904
There's no bottom no

3014
02:19:08,416 --> 02:19:11,232
So I don't I'm not I'm not

3015
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:13,792
Matt at all out of

3016
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:15,584
I do need to

3017
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,608
Have pulled

3018
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:18,144
You that this happened

3019
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:19,680
Because it puts Alex in a

3020
02:19:19,936 --> 02:19:20,448
F*****-up heads

3021
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:22,752
Because of this conversation

3022
02:19:23,008 --> 02:19:24,032
Buddy's had with Tommy

3023
02:19:24,288 --> 02:19:24,800
He is

3024
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:25,824
This just in

3025
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:27,616
A f****** mode where

3026
02:19:27,872 --> 02:19:29,408
He's talking about God

3027
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:30,944
Yeah yeah

3028
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,480
Deeply Disturbed

3029
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:33,504
For a little bit

3030
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:34,272
Episode

3031
02:19:34,528 --> 02:19:35,808
And he starts off that

3032
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:38,368
Stretch by talking about how

3033
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:39,392
Beloved

3034
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:40,672
How attacked

3035
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:42,720
I was thinking this morning

3036
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:47,584
Thought right after I worked out took a shower

3037
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:57,824
How much its baby stronger

3038
02:19:59,360 --> 02:19:59,872
Cow

3039
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:01,920
Thank God for allowing that to happen

3040
02:20:09,344 --> 02:20:11,904
Will that make them persecute me even more

3041
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:17,792
And I think the only way to tell the story is used to tell the story about the thought I don't know

3042
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:22,656
But I haven't enjoyed the things that have happened but then I

3043
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:23,680
I do enjoy the lighter

3044
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:26,752
If your only way of feeling like

3045
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:29,568
Validated or like you're doing a good job is

3046
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:30,592
Buy attack

3047
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:31,616
That happen against

3048
02:20:31,872 --> 02:20:34,176
Do you create a negative

3049
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:39,040
Yeah you incentivize

3050
02:20:39,296 --> 02:20:41,088
Yourself to do things that will elicit

3051
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:42,112
Negative responses

3052
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:43,648
Some people because you look

3053
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:45,696
Experience those negative responses

3054
02:20:45,952 --> 02:20:48,512
As if you're doing a good job you're on the right track

3055
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:50,304
If you only way I get to open

3056
02:20:51,584 --> 02:20:53,120
Yeah it's a it's a real

3057
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:57,984
F***** up childish system there people can get

3058
02:20:58,496 --> 02:21:01,056
I understand it sometimes.

3059
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:03,360
Like a trapped in that without knowing

3060
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:10,016
What is the feedback loop and often times it takes therapy to be able to recognize

3061
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:12,320
And transcend them

3062
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:14,880
I have a lot of empathy for people who

3063
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:15,648
Maybe

3064
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:16,672
Well-meaning

3065
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:18,464
And in that mode

3066
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:19,488
He is

3067
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,512
Anita

3068
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:22,816
Anyway Alex starts crying

3069
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:25,376
Talk about God

3070
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:27,168
As long as you

3071
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,704
Crosman God

3072
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,240
Center your Souls guide

3073
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:31,776
There is no power

3074
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:33,568
The enemy has

3075
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:36,128
Chance

3076
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:40,224
Well your thought you must

3077
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:41,760
Totally trusting God

3078
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:43,808
All I can say is

3079
02:21:44,576 --> 02:21:45,344
I've never asked

3080
02:21:46,624 --> 02:21:48,416
Presence of God

3081
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:53,024
I've heard you ask God for things

3082
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:57,376
You told God what to

3083
02:21:58,656 --> 02:21:59,680
On your shoulder

3084
02:22:00,448 --> 02:22:01,984
Comfort Shield so strong

3085
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:04,544
Play God says

3086
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:08,640
I really don't want to see heart

3087
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:11,968
You see what they're doing other people

3088
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:15,296
Are you ready to really get hurt bad

3089
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:20,928
Dcra to be hurt

3090
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:22,976
Alex Sims

3091
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,816
Get a new God bro he's sitting there

3092
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:28,864
On the verge of open

3093
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,144
Tears on

3094
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:30,912
Here

3095
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:34,496
Talking about how God wants to hurt him for the greater good

3096
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:37,056
This is f***** up hey man there's a look

3097
02:22:37,568 --> 02:22:38,336
I I know

3098
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:43,968
Flagellation went out of went out of style a long time ago but he's leading the charge to bring him back

3099
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:50,368
Get a f****** cata Ninetales and start whipping writing well exactly

3100
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:51,648
Absolutely

3101
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:53,696
These people

3102
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:55,232
So it's not only Alex

3103
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:56,512
It's really into Jesus.

3104
02:22:56,768 --> 02:22:57,536
You can break up

3105
02:22:58,048 --> 02:23:00,096
Did you know that it's true it's not hard

3106
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:06,496
It's not just Alex though even if Alex broke up with God they would still be one person in the Infowars feared

3107
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,520
Super into Jesus

3108
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:08,544
And that

3109
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:09,312
Is Rodger Stone

3110
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:17,248
Sorry

3111
02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:21,856
I'm sorry I don't know if you know this but Alex actually converted Rogers

3112
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:25,696
Give me more

3113
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:27,744
Years ago

3114
02:23:28,256 --> 02:23:30,560
I pray the Rodger Stone in my office

3115
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:34,400
I said give me your hand let's pray to Jesus for protecting a drink

3116
02:23:35,424 --> 02:23:37,216
Call please

3117
02:23:37,472 --> 02:23:37,984
From that

3118
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:44,128
And he said it's just amazing you know I see the religious establishment of corruption and I don't think it's all Bs but

3119
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:51,808
He saw the drag queen story times in the pedophile

3120
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:57,440
Delia and just the email the Democrats he's like Gidget really real people

3121
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:06,912
Rapture is like he watches it for they like

3122
02:24:09,984 --> 02:24:11,264
Man that is

3123
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:14,080
Daddy I want inject that into my veins

3124
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:16,384
You believe that then you can believe

3125
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:22,784
She probably like me and you and anyone who thinks

3126
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:27,136
I would say Rodger is flushed

3127
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:30,464
Even if he is a religion

3128
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,000
His older age or these

3129
02:24:32,256 --> 02:24:33,280
Crisis that he's in

3130
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:36,096
Whatever I don't care I'm not going to judge

3131
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:40,192
The notion that would Alex is fun

3132
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:49,408
That it's just nonsense now that Rogers saw drag queen story time I was like

3133
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:52,480
I got to get God I hope yeah that's

3134
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:54,272
That's banana.

3135
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:57,344
That's absolute bananas

3136
02:24:59,136 --> 02:25:02,464
People said oh it is Rodger Stone really taking Jesus's just

3137
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:03,232
Personal savior

3138
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:04,000
No

3139
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:08,608
Bragging as I'd like to say we were at

3140
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:10,656
I pray that

3141
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:24,480
He wasn't manipulating ADP

3142
02:25:25,504 --> 02:25:27,552
Understand that nothing good thing

3143
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:29,856
Celebrate that

3144
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:31,392
You should accept Rodger

3145
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:36,000
Would never hypocrite about going to Gay Pride parades

3146
02:25:36,512 --> 02:25:37,280
Wow.

3147
02:25:39,328 --> 02:25:39,840
But his wife

3148
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:43,424
I've been wild nobody is judging anybody here

3149
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:44,704
God judges the heart

3150
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:48,288
So I got just welcomed Rodger publicly

3151
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:51,360
Proclaiming his faith in Jesus Christ to that

3152
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:53,152
We should all welcome him

3153
02:25:53,664 --> 02:25:55,200
Because there are no atheists in foxholes

3154
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:58,272
Panic attack

3155
02:25:58,528 --> 02:26:00,064
Buddy you get Jesus

3156
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:01,600
Are you bow to Satan

3157
02:26:02,112 --> 02:26:02,624
Stripe

3158
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:07,232
There's nothing like having the devil on your ass to front get you to get over Jesus

3159
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:14,656
They're doing all their evil stuff to you in person give you the minute you just call on Jesus in the middle of the night

3160
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:19,264
I don't just tell Jesus what to do or don't I just take Jesus I need your help

3161
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:21,312
Jesus

3162
02:26:21,568 --> 02:26:23,872
I'm not up here like some preacher man let me tell you

3163
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:29,504
I mean I never bragged about it

3164
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:31,296
People to death and things like that

3165
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:32,832
I mean I missed her worldly

3166
02:26:33,088 --> 02:26:34,112
But I'm telling you

3167
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:35,136
Jesus

3168
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:37,184
Is the only thing that's going to fix

3169
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:43,840
I think that being worldly is more like I like a cigar and I drink champagne.

3170
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:47,424
I say it high-end hotels people to death

3171
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:53,824
I've traveled the world that's so to Alex's point

3172
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:55,872
Or not he has

3173
02:26:56,128 --> 02:26:58,688
About beating people to death or

3174
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:02,272
F****** a lot somebody's got a Supercut

3175
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:03,552
Heather Hills

3176
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:08,928
Irresponsible

3177
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:13,280
Not that I'll ever stop

3178
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:14,816
Everybody's got shot

3179
02:27:15,328 --> 02:27:17,632
I tried a couple times not too nice

3180
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:21,216
People long time to die if you start the guts up

3181
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:24,288
I could have sex with the most beautiful women Hollywood

3182
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,080
I never did it you know why

3183
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:28,640
Every time they didn't have a soul

3184
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:30,688
When I was 16

3185
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:36,064
Games anymore

3186
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:37,088
I grew up

3187
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:40,160
The fights all the big rituals

3188
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:52,960
Okay I mean he brags about f****** incitement killing all the time

3189
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:54,752
A lot of people sent that

3190
02:27:55,008 --> 02:27:57,568
The Media Matters

3191
02:27:57,824 --> 02:27:59,104
I was just sitting there like

3192
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:00,128
I'm

3193
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:00,896
Good good

3194
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:01,920
Jokers

3195
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:04,992
I'm glad

3196
02:28:05,248 --> 02:28:05,760
I'm glad

3197
02:28:06,272 --> 02:28:07,296
Yeah I'm not

3198
02:28:07,552 --> 02:28:08,832
Talked about this

3199
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:11,136
The last episode even like

3200
02:28:11,392 --> 02:28:12,416
It would be

3201
02:28:12,672 --> 02:28:14,464
Good it'll be a fuller coverage

3202
02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:15,232
If like

3203
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:16,768
Once again Alex Bragg's

3204
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:20,096
Danzig

3205
02:28:23,168 --> 02:28:24,448
Alex gets off this

3206
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:26,240
Sort of weird God

3207
02:28:26,496 --> 02:28:27,520
The Jag he's been in

3208
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:30,592
And he has a guest on

3209
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:33,152
And I think it's the last time we will ever see her

3210
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:36,224
I appreciate her holding

3211
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:39,296
Well I got it at 1 to break a few minutes it's super Tuesday

3212
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:43,136
Deanna Lorraine is amazing super smart and very beautiful woman

3213
02:28:44,672 --> 02:28:47,488
Sing I guess was beautiful

3214
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:49,024
Creation

3215
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:55,168
So I can't can't bring Indiana Lorraine's I'm talking about how she is

3216
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:59,264
This'll likely be gentle rains last appearance on Infowars

3217
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:05,408
Because she's only really well is it because you was trying to meme her way into running gives Nancy Pelosi for a seat in the house

3218
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:06,432
And I didn't work

3219
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:07,456
I didn't happen

3220
02:29:07,712 --> 02:29:12,576
Primary for California's 12th District was held on March 3rd

3221
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:14,368
2653 votes

3222
02:29:15,392 --> 02:29:16,416
This was just

3223
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:17,952
Pelosi's 89,000

3224
02:29:18,208 --> 02:29:19,488
460 South

3225
02:29:19,744 --> 02:29:21,024
So doesn't look too good for Deanna

3226
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:27,424
All right that was that was the percentage of people who are going to die the coronavirus apparently she

3227
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:33,824
It's also be by Republicans 1387 votes in democratic

3228
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,872
1645

3229
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:36,896
Yeah I was rooting for

3230
02:29:37,664 --> 02:29:40,736
California is a very weird primary set of rules

3231
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:42,016
It's an open primaries

3232
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:44,576
The top two vote-getters end up in the general election

3233
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:46,112
Even if they're from the same party

3234
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:46,880
So do you want

3235
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:47,648
Is out

3236
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:49,952
The general election will be Nancy Pelosi being

3237
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:50,976
Destin from

3238
02:29:51,232 --> 02:29:55,840
Five-star challenge

3239
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:00,448
This episode is on the day of the primary so I guess Alex

3240
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:01,984
This is some kind of a last pushed

3241
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:03,008
Lorraine

3242
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:05,568
That last mile that you needs to clinch the election

3243
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:06,592
But it was not to be

3244
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:09,152
I really don't want to make fun of her

3245
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:12,480
We're getting involved in the political system since I would encourage anyone

3246
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:15,040
Get involved if they feel like they can make a difference but

3247
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:17,088
Chris on the way to Randall campaign

3248
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:18,368
Feel too bad about it

3249
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:24,256
Anybody who flies a plane around trying to make jokes about liberal tears deserved

3250
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:25,280
Depressingly

3251
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:29,632
She lost liberal tears we're getting those little girl tears for you

3252
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:32,704
So anyway this might be the last time she was on his a guest

3253
02:30:33,728 --> 02:30:38,592
But

3254
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:51,648
Which he's never done before she loses

3255
02:30:51,904 --> 02:30:58,048
She's offering her a job she lost so I guess

3256
02:30:58,304 --> 02:31:01,120
People CNN MSNBC

3257
02:31:01,376 --> 02:31:03,168
Infowars with a v

3258
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:04,960
Get of the year

3259
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:05,984
Yeah this is going to be

3260
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:06,752
2

3261
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:09,568
No

3262
02:31:09,824 --> 02:31:10,848
So Alex

3263
02:31:11,104 --> 02:31:13,408
Is there interference very stupid

3264
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:18,016
Alex has something going on

3265
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:21,856
They're using the crisis that is come with it

3266
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:24,672
To take over and have power and control

3267
02:31:26,208 --> 02:31:27,232
He's not trying to do that

3268
02:31:29,792 --> 02:31:30,816
There's no doubt that

3269
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:32,352
Everyone I talk to

3270
02:31:33,376 --> 02:31:37,216
I'm not trying to Coffee Ron are like Illustrated I can't stop

3271
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:39,776
Lawyer

3272
02:31:41,824 --> 02:31:44,128
As ammonia is super sick right now

3273
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:45,664
Back from d.c.

3274
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:47,712
I know that's flown

3275
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:48,992
Supersac

3276
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:54,368
This is absolutely a performance thing like Alex's at a dry throat I imagined from Rambling too much

3277
02:31:54,624 --> 02:31:55,648
Well maybe it's not

3278
02:31:55,904 --> 02:32:01,024
On March 7th it was reported that attempt Coronavirus

3279
02:32:02,304 --> 02:32:04,096
The entire Infowars crew being a

3280
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:04,864
Exposed to it

3281
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:06,144
I pray that this isn't the

3282
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:08,960
Since I don't wish illness on people even that I hate

3283
02:32:09,472 --> 02:32:12,288
And because I can't imagine the horrible effect this would have on Alex's

3284
02:32:12,544 --> 02:32:13,056
Is rhetoric

3285
02:32:13,312 --> 02:32:15,616
I can't imagine that making about you better but

3286
02:32:15,872 --> 02:32:16,896
Playing up this go off

3287
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:20,480
I don't know man

3288
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:24,320
Yeah I can call Steve pieczenik he can cure it

3289
02:32:24,832 --> 02:32:29,440
So we're running out of time on this March 3rd episode and Alex I think realized

3290
02:32:29,696 --> 02:32:30,720
But he hasn't done much

3291
02:32:30,976 --> 02:32:32,512
Touch

3292
02:32:32,768 --> 02:32:38,912
There's a lot of Alfred Lee Robinson there's a lot of rambling about God has

3293
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:40,704
Interviewing Deanna Lorraine

3294
02:32:41,216 --> 02:32:42,496
Now it's time to get to work

3295
02:32:43,008 --> 02:32:47,616
Let me just tell you headlines

3296
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:49,920
Don't

3297
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:51,200
Hanover

3298
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:52,992
Let me just do this without

3299
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:57,600
Probably the best thing I can do here

3300
02:32:59,136 --> 02:33:05,280
No it's it's like doing nothing that's the best thing that he can do a ton of headlines

3301
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:07,072
10% of these articles

3302
02:33:07,328 --> 02:33:07,840
Fully

3303
02:33:08,608 --> 02:33:10,144
Maybe 90% he's

3304
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:12,960
Come over but he does read all those

3305
02:33:13,472 --> 02:33:13,984
Except

3306
02:33:14,496 --> 02:33:16,032
He doesn't know what reading mean

3307
02:33:17,312 --> 02:33:18,336
So he reads

3308
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:21,920
He reads one article and it's

3309
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:22,944
It's about how

3310
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:23,712
The last

3311
02:33:25,504 --> 02:33:27,040
This is really depressing

3312
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:28,064
I forgot to get this clip

3313
02:33:28,576 --> 02:33:32,672
What is the headline is that Liberals are having less male babies

3314
02:33:32,928 --> 02:33:34,208
And Alex says that it's on purpose

3315
02:33:34,464 --> 02:33:34,976
Of course

3316
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:37,536
Party on purpose part is not in the

3317
02:33:37,792 --> 02:33:38,816
The headline is just making that up

3318
02:33:39,584 --> 02:33:41,376
This is about a study that was done

3319
02:33:41,632 --> 02:33:42,656
Specifically Ontario

3320
02:33:43,168 --> 02:33:43,936
They found it

3321
02:33:44,192 --> 02:33:44,704
Possible

3322
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:47,776
Trump's election is thrown off normal sex ratios of newborn

3323
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:53,920
There's a wired article that explains this really well and what it comes down to is that there's a documented relations

3324
02:33:54,176 --> 02:33:55,200
Between stressful event

3325
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:56,992
And the sex ratio of babies

3326
02:33:57,248 --> 02:34:00,576
Which actually happened after 9/11 and the London bombings

3327
02:34:00,832 --> 02:34:01,856
In 2005

3328
02:34:02,624 --> 02:34:04,672
No one knows exactly why this is the case

3329
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:06,464
It's still something that scientist trying to

3330
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:07,488
Explore and understand

3331
02:34:07,744 --> 02:34:08,256
But there's

3332
02:34:08,512 --> 02:34:09,536
The pattern b b

3333
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:14,144
Observe where highly stressful geopolitical event have a tendency to skew births

3334
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:15,424
Tubing

3335
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:16,448
More female

3336
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:19,008
In this case specific to Ontario

3337
02:34:19,264 --> 02:34:23,872
They found a ratio of 1.0 to 17

3338
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:26,944
Down from the normal figure of 1.06

3339
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:27,712
05

3340
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:29,760
This is certainly really into

3341
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:32,064
And the more data points researchers have about the

3342
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:33,088
This phenomenon

3343
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:35,136
Because I'm a better chance of figuring out what's going on

3344
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:36,160
However

3345
02:34:36,672 --> 02:34:37,952
This is not an instance of liberals

3346
02:34:38,208 --> 02:34:39,488
Choosing not to have boys

3347
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:44,352
We can assume that this was not in the 10% of the articles that Alex

3348
02:34:45,376 --> 02:34:48,704
Yeah I would like chromosome is weaker to stress whatever

3349
02:34:49,216 --> 02:34:52,544
Just has been floated

3350
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:54,336
Right now I'm just saying like

3351
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:55,872
He doesn't give a s***

3352
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:58,432
No he didn't read the article

3353
02:34:59,456 --> 02:35:00,224
Maybe that's why

3354
02:35:00,992 --> 02:35:01,760
So here's another one

3355
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:04,320
Vegan

3356
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:08,928
Cuz they smell bad

3357
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,720
You stinking scum

3358
02:35:11,232 --> 02:35:14,816
Cool stories about an anonymous person in Berkeley California request

3359
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:19,680
Another neighbor's not cook meat with the windows open because the smell is overpowering to them when they went jog

3360
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:24,544
Even the worst interpretation of the story this is a neighborhood issue

3361
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:27,616
Is literally no reason for Alex be wasting his time for taking

3362
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:31,200
The politeness or lack thereof in a random neighborhood he's never been to

3363
02:35:31,712 --> 02:35:34,016
There's a decent chance this isn't even a real story

3364
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:39,648
It's all based on someone posting an anonymous note they got making this request which could easily be faked

3365
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:44,512
No matter what it doesn't married Alex calling anyone's, or even talking about the story at all

3366
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:45,792
Definition of trivial

3367
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,072
Also

3368
02:35:47,328 --> 02:35:48,864
That story has nothing to do with the government

3369
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:50,656
The vegan did not demand any

3370
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:51,680
It was a request

3371
02:35:51,936 --> 02:35:52,704
Any requests

3372
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:53,728
We're not for them

3373
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:54,752
To stop cooking

3374
02:35:55,008 --> 02:35:56,288
It was to close the windows

3375
02:35:56,544 --> 02:35:57,056
The dead South

3376
02:35:57,824 --> 02:36:01,152
Looks like that story was also not in The Temper set Alex red

3377
02:36:01,408 --> 02:36:03,456
I saw that story

3378
02:36:03,968 --> 02:36:08,832
I was so Furious that anybody like so many outlets picked up on that

3379
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:09,600
And it just

3380
02:36:09,856 --> 02:36:10,624
Romantic

3381
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:12,416
Neighbors

3382
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:13,440
Hate each other

3383
02:36:13,696 --> 02:36:14,208
That's

3384
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:15,488
It's so stupid

3385
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:17,024
Just just stop it

3386
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:21,632
Set beginning it was like this is going to be a trend

3387
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:22,912
F*** off

3388
02:36:23,424 --> 02:36:24,448
Who complained about

3389
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:27,008
Dogs next door is that okay

3390
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:28,800
I hate that

3391
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:33,920
Watch homeowner Propel Steve with motion-activated water sprinkler

3392
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:36,224
Time to get to

3393
02:36:36,736 --> 02:36:38,272
How is this relevant to the show

3394
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:42,112
This is just one of those fun videos you see someone from your office post

3395
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:48,256
It's a sort of thing you see on the local news and they run it as a story when they need to fill 20 seconds if you have a show

3396
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:49,024
Village

3397
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,328
Buscemi's reading is Facebook

3398
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:52,864
That is what

3399
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:55,424
He's doing and he's like oh look at all my Facebook friends

3400
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:58,496
Sharing articles I'm reading the f****** head lice

3401
02:36:59,264 --> 02:37:00,032
Okay coffee

3402
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:02,848
And I'm sure that he's you've never found

3403
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:09,504
I couldn't read the whole.

3404
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:14,880
That's in the 10% he has not really a reader like I'm a visual learner

3405
02:37:15,392 --> 02:37:16,160
Very depressed

3406
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:17,440
Very sad

3407
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:19,232
So we get to the 4th

3408
02:37:19,488 --> 02:37:20,000
And

3409
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:22,560
A lot of the beginning of

3410
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:23,328
This episode

3411
02:37:23,584 --> 02:37:25,632
Is about Mike Bloomberg

3412
02:37:26,144 --> 02:37:27,424
A lot of it is

3413
02:37:28,192 --> 02:37:28,960
Are we still doing

3414
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:30,496
What would

3415
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:31,520
Bluebird

3416
02:37:31,776 --> 02:37:33,312
Can't we just not talk about him ever

3417
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:39,456
It's it's I got really

3418
02:37:39,968 --> 02:37:43,808
Yeah cuz he I don't I didn't understand why you were spending so much time on Bloomberg

3419
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:46,112
He was just a little little Tay

3420
02:37:46,368 --> 02:37:47,648
Taste of Abyss

3421
02:37:47,904 --> 02:37:49,440
Beginning

3422
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:51,232
Body looks at that

3423
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:53,792
Isle of dog Banner

3424
02:37:54,304 --> 02:37:55,072
And nose

3425
02:37:55,328 --> 02:37:56,096
But he will

3426
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:58,912
Cloud Financial

3427
02:37:59,168 --> 02:38:00,192
Which makes me feel great

3428
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:04,288
When a pile of dog feces like that doesn't like me

3429
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:07,360
It means I'm doing really good

3430
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:09,408
Bring It On

3431
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:15,296
People have I not that Braden stature

3432
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:19,136
But I mean hitting ships he thinks he's so big and so powerful

3433
02:38:19,392 --> 02:38:21,184
He definitely has a Napoleonic

3434
02:38:21,696 --> 02:38:26,048
Russian Roulette

3435
02:38:26,816 --> 02:38:29,376
And boy let me tell you that really sold the public all that

3436
02:38:29,632 --> 02:38:31,424
Sashay around

3437
02:38:31,936 --> 02:38:33,472
Well I say Mike Bloomberg

3438
02:38:33,728 --> 02:38:34,752
I'm just saying

3439
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:36,800
Wagner cat somebody for a

3440
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:38,336
Gay g******* video

3441
02:38:38,848 --> 02:38:44,736
He definitely be the main subject of lead deposits be made

3442
02:38:45,504 --> 02:38:51,648
So anyway that Bloomberg is funding the lawsuits against him and until he does I don't believe that's true

3443
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:58,816
I guess Alex took the news the Bloomberg one that one primary pretty hard because he spends most of his first half-hour the show

3444
02:38:59,328 --> 02:38:59,840
Complaining

3445
02:39:00,096 --> 02:39:05,472
It's mostly about that video that came out of Bloomberg eating food with his hands pretty grossly

3446
02:39:05,728 --> 02:39:07,008
It's mostly just that

3447
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,032
Hint

3448
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:12,640
Always personal always physical

3449
02:39:12,896 --> 02:39:13,664
Appearance-based

3450
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:14,688
Bulshit

3451
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:16,224
There's so many reasons

3452
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:19,296
To Hattiesburg there's so many

3453
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:24,672
He can't make those critiques billions of real

3454
02:39:25,696 --> 02:39:27,744
Soda tax baby I don't know

3455
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:32,352
Read that article

3456
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:34,144
Offensively

3457
02:39:34,656 --> 02:39:35,424
Politically

3458
02:39:35,936 --> 02:39:36,960
Fuk fuk

3459
02:39:37,216 --> 02:39:40,032
It's very strange because Alex is definitely playing this

3460
02:39:40,288 --> 02:39:40,800
For comedy

3461
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:44,640
But it comes off as Alex being really mad about a guys eating attic

3462
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:51,040
Yeah like I think what happened is that like Carpe donktum made a meme and Alex really doesn't want to do any work so he just plays

3463
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:52,064
Clip lick

3464
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:54,112
Three times in the first half hour

3465
02:39:54,624 --> 02:39:57,184
And that was why I was not surprised to hear him say that

3466
02:39:57,696 --> 02:39:58,976
And I am really just

3467
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:01,536
On my wheels apart

3468
02:40:03,328 --> 02:40:05,376
47 minutes

3469
02:40:06,400 --> 02:40:12,544
Do your job actually going to have to this part isn't in the show we're going to cut this part we're going to restart the show your f******

3470
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:17,152
Job 37

3471
02:40:17,408 --> 02:40:22,528
We're supposed to be all the super important news always weirdly don't have time to get to

3472
02:40:22,784 --> 02:40:28,672
How do you spend over 1/6 of your broadcast day playing joyless memes and why is already dropped out of the race

3473
02:40:28,928 --> 02:40:35,072
Yep how he eats food he's

3474
02:40:35,328 --> 02:40:36,096
Are you this fight

3475
02:40:36,352 --> 02:40:37,376
Do your job

3476
02:40:37,632 --> 02:40:41,728
Grocery store cuz his daughter wanted some

3477
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:44,800
Okay and people were not nice to him

3478
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:46,592
And Alex didn't take that very well

3479
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:49,152
Vogue's

3480
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:53,248
Well I'm going to try to achieve this day was a wall of

3481
02:40:57,344 --> 02:40:58,624
Their souls aren't gone

3482
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,488
Suspended animation are in carbonite

3483
02:41:04,768 --> 02:41:05,280
They

3484
02:41:06,048 --> 02:41:07,584
They've been putting a trans

3485
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:08,864
But nowhere place and they

3486
02:41:09,888 --> 02:41:12,960
Don't have any power and they think they're desperate and they don't have a reason to live

3487
02:41:13,728 --> 02:41:15,776
And so they're just stewing

3488
02:41:16,544 --> 02:41:18,592
And self-loathing instead of a connection to God

3489
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:20,896
Directions to Beauty Avenue just recognize Beauty

3490
02:41:23,968 --> 02:41:29,856
The painting knitting or power helping somebody or gardening then they would connect to the Earth because

3491
02:41:30,112 --> 02:41:36,256
They're all smartphones everything else they're just dying it's scary when I saw there's what I seen

3492
02:41:42,912 --> 02:41:48,032
Doing something

3493
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:49,568
Whoa

3494
02:41:50,336 --> 02:41:51,104
Whoa

3495
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:57,248
Alright so we're not nice to him at the grocery store el-mel modern civilization is

3496
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:58,272
Killing us

3497
02:41:58,528 --> 02:42:03,136
That is a bit of an Escalade shallow Unabomber yes

3498
02:42:03,392 --> 02:42:05,184
Great although you should count yourself lucky

3499
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:08,000
You should be spat upon every time you go outside your door

3500
02:42:08,256 --> 02:42:12,352
Most likely getting bad looks

3501
02:42:12,608 --> 02:42:15,680
Yeah so Alex plays a clip of a video

3502
02:42:15,936 --> 02:42:16,704
That's

3503
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:17,472
Supposed

3504
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:18,496
To be out of a rock

3505
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:22,336
And it's all four number of body bags in the hospital

3506
02:42:22,592 --> 02:42:23,616
And I

3507
02:42:23,872 --> 02:42:25,408
I want to play this clip I want to discuss

3508
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:26,432
That's because I

3509
02:42:26,944 --> 02:42:27,712
What it does

3510
02:42:27,968 --> 02:42:29,504
Is really demonstrate

3511
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:31,808
How there is a disconnect

3512
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:33,856
Between what Alex does

3513
02:42:34,112 --> 02:42:34,624
And what's a proper

3514
02:42:35,392 --> 02:42:41,536
Hourly

3515
02:42:49,728 --> 02:42:51,520
If you just see it

3516
02:42:51,776 --> 02:42:54,080
I will tell you that I have no idea is that videos

3517
02:42:54,592 --> 02:42:58,432
Make maybe it's an old video that someone's reusing claiming it's for Risa

3518
02:42:58,688 --> 02:43:02,272
It happens all the time you do not know just immediate

3519
02:43:02,528 --> 02:43:03,296
Viewing of the video

3520
02:43:03,552 --> 02:43:04,320
I don't know any

3521
02:43:04,832 --> 02:43:05,600
Indeed

3522
02:43:06,368 --> 02:43:09,696
I'm less interested in that though because this Cliff clip offers a paper

3523
02:43:09,952 --> 02:43:12,512
Perfect opportunity to explain one of my main problems

3524
02:43:12,768 --> 02:43:13,536
With Alex Jones

3525
02:43:14,304 --> 02:43:18,144
It's very difficult to engage in his ideas a lot of the time because he and I have a very

3526
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:19,168
Basic

3527
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:20,448
Epistemological disc

3528
02:43:20,704 --> 02:43:21,216
Agreement

3529
02:43:21,472 --> 02:43:23,264
Fundamentally we don't agree on what it

3530
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:24,288
Means to know some

3531
02:43:24,544 --> 02:43:26,592
How knowing something is achieved

3532
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:28,640
Let's use this video isn't it

3533
02:43:29,664 --> 02:43:30,432
Hear something my prop

3534
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:32,480
It starts with a question

3535
02:43:32,736 --> 02:43:34,528
In this case is this video

3536
02:43:35,296 --> 02:43:37,856
I can't possibly know that from the presentation on Alex's

3537
02:43:38,112 --> 02:43:39,648
There's just not enough information

3538
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:42,720
So in order to reach that conclusion I need to seek out information

3539
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:49,632
Through a little poking around I can find out that this video is said to have been published by BBC Persia and it's allegedly

3540
02:43:49,888 --> 02:43:51,936
All the number body bags in a hospital and calm

3541
02:43:53,984 --> 02:43:56,288
Then article in the New York Post says that it was a rich

3542
02:43:56,544 --> 02:43:59,104
Only shared on social media by a journalist named Bahamut

3543
02:44:00,384 --> 02:44:01,408
And.

3544
02:44:01,664 --> 02:44:04,736
Official account of fatalities

3545
02:44:04,992 --> 02:44:09,856
Seven opponents of the Ayatollah have claimed that they believe that his regime is covering up a real scope

3546
02:44:10,112 --> 02:44:10,624
The situation

3547
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:11,904
There could be many more deaths

3548
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:14,720
Short this video has been used as

3549
02:44:14,976 --> 02:44:15,488
Proof of that

3550
02:44:15,744 --> 02:44:18,816
An argument that there are way more deaths than 107

3551
02:44:19,584 --> 02:44:24,704
With this information I can entertain the possibility that this video is definitely real for a couple of reasons

3552
02:44:25,472 --> 02:44:27,520
The government of Iran is not the most open and train

3553
02:44:28,032 --> 02:44:30,336
Governments of the possibility that they've not been for

3554
02:44:30,592 --> 02:44:31,872
Coming is in the realm of

3555
02:44:32,128 --> 02:44:32,640
Possibility

3556
02:44:32,896 --> 02:44:33,920
But even if it doesn't

3557
02:44:34,432 --> 02:44:36,736
There aren't more than 100 body bags in that video

3558
02:44:36,992 --> 02:44:39,808
And the outbreak in Iran has been largely centered in

3559
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:42,368
So it's also possible that this video to pick

3560
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:43,648
People who have died

3561
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:48,256
Which is very sad but not necessarily proof of any cover-up video

3562
02:44:48,512 --> 02:44:52,352
Has been used by some entirely possible

3563
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:54,912
No matter what

3564
02:44:55,936 --> 02:44:56,704
Certainly can't

3565
02:44:57,472 --> 02:45:00,288
Jump to interpretation results

3566
02:45:00,544 --> 02:45:01,056
Conclusive

3567
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:07,712
It's entirely possible and maybe even probable that this video is real and I feel okay with that because I've tried to figure out the

3568
02:45:07,968 --> 02:45:08,736
Source of the video

3569
02:45:08,992 --> 02:45:10,272
And nothing seems too suspicious

3570
02:45:10,528 --> 02:45:13,856
And places that generally engage in

3571
02:45:14,112 --> 02:45:16,416
Some form of editorial process

3572
02:45:16,672 --> 02:45:18,976
Have posted it

3573
02:45:19,488 --> 02:45:21,024
Some of them do say

3574
02:45:26,656 --> 02:45:27,168
For Alex

3575
02:45:27,424 --> 02:45:30,752
Even if he's correct I take issue with how he arrives it information

3576
02:45:31,264 --> 02:45:36,640
He sees this video and decides it is brain is a supercomputer and you just automatically knows when something is real

3577
02:45:37,152 --> 02:45:38,176
That obviously isn't

3578
02:45:38,432 --> 02:45:40,736
True documentation on the Shelf

3579
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:42,016
That is his process

3580
02:45:42,528 --> 02:45:48,672
When I tell you my process is seeking out information about where this video came from who posted it initially what is

3581
02:45:49,184 --> 02:45:50,720
Report to show

3582
02:45:50,976 --> 02:45:51,744
That's a process

3583
02:45:52,256 --> 02:45:53,280
His process is

3584
02:45:53,536 --> 02:45:55,584
That's real I know it's real

3585
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:57,120
Beyond this is dumb

3586
02:45:57,888 --> 02:45:59,424
If that's an acceptable way for him to

3587
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:00,704
Come to his reporting

3588
02:46:01,216 --> 02:46:05,055
And he's just really talking about his feelings on his show like you said under that deposition

3589
02:46:05,311 --> 02:46:06,847
Information and actual knowledge

3590
02:46:07,103 --> 02:46:07,871
Mean nothing

3591
02:46:08,383 --> 02:46:09,151
I want that

3592
02:46:09,919 --> 02:46:10,687
Because

3593
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:11,967
Helps me if they

3594
02:46:12,223 --> 02:46:12,735
That's true

3595
02:46:12,991 --> 02:46:14,015
Guess what

3596
02:46:14,783 --> 02:46:15,295
True

3597
02:46:15,551 --> 02:46:16,063
Beyond

3598
02:46:16,319 --> 02:46:18,111
Right and this is this is a very

3599
02:46:18,623 --> 02:46:19,391
Important

3600
02:46:19,903 --> 02:46:23,487
And that is whether or not the conclusion that this video is real

3601
02:46:23,743 --> 02:46:25,023
Whether or not he's right about

3602
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:25,791
About that

3603
02:46:26,047 --> 02:46:26,815
Process

3604
02:46:28,351 --> 02:46:28,863
Nothing for

3605
02:46:29,119 --> 02:46:30,911
You need to be process-oriented

3606
02:46:31,167 --> 02:46:31,935
Not result Orion

3607
02:46:32,447 --> 02:46:34,495
As baseball just figured out in like

3608
02:46:34,751 --> 02:46:40,895
Five-year sure sure if you have a sound process you will generally Arise at the

3609
02:46:41,151 --> 02:46:42,175
Appropriate

3610
02:46:42,431 --> 02:46:45,503
Inclusion Auto auto automotive

3611
02:46:45,759 --> 02:46:49,087
Bassist whatever

3612
02:46:49,343 --> 02:46:55,487
You randomly be okay or close to write in some cases and then people

3613
02:46:55,743 --> 02:47:01,375
Biloxi intuition is so and I got there faster than all those number-crunching

3614
02:47:01,887 --> 02:47:02,911
All that s***

3615
02:47:03,167 --> 02:47:03,935
Now unfortunately

3616
02:47:04,191 --> 02:47:05,471
Nightly if you do engage in

3617
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:07,775
This process and you have no standards

3618
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:11,103
You'll end up doing some really f***** up things

3619
02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:11,871
Dislike

3620
02:47:12,127 --> 02:47:13,151
I don't know

3621
02:47:13,663 --> 02:47:14,943
Having Stewart Roads

3622
02:47:15,199 --> 02:47:15,967
The head of the oath

3623
02:47:16,223 --> 02:47:16,735
Keepers

3624
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:18,015
Come on your show and

3625
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:20,063
Like a coronavirus expert

3626
02:47:20,575 --> 02:47:21,343
Which does

3627
02:47:21,599 --> 02:47:22,111
No

3628
02:47:22,367 --> 02:47:23,391
No

3629
02:47:23,647 --> 02:47:27,487
You come roof you your come Stewart Road noted

3630
02:47:27,743 --> 02:47:28,255
Doctor

3631
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:31,583
Militia guy

3632
02:47:31,839 --> 02:47:34,655
You bet

3633
02:47:34,911 --> 02:47:36,703
Domestic flights are now spreading it around

3634
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:37,727
Cuz it is Airborne

3635
02:47:38,239 --> 02:47:41,823
It's not just that you get it when when someone coughs through you

3636
02:47:42,335 --> 02:47:43,871
Booker six feet away or safe

3637
02:47:44,383 --> 02:47:50,527
Relating to the air conditioning

3638
02:47:50,783 --> 02:47:53,087
And you're going to breathe it in just like smallpox

3639
02:47:53,343 --> 02:47:54,367
Or just like measles

3640
02:47:54,623 --> 02:47:57,439
What's what's different about this it's not the same as the flu

3641
02:47:57,695 --> 02:47:58,719
The house transmitted

3642
02:47:58,975 --> 02:48:00,255
It's also an aerosol

3643
02:48:00,767 --> 02:48:01,535
It could be airborne

3644
02:48:01,791 --> 02:48:07,935
See this is why it's a bad idea to have your militia leader gun weirdo buddy on your show to talk as if he's an expert in public

3645
02:48:08,447 --> 02:48:09,727
Because it'll say things like that

3646
02:48:10,495 --> 02:48:14,079
Currently no evidence that the coronavirus is transmittable in Airborne fast

3647
02:48:14,591 --> 02:48:17,151
It's been shown to transmit by human-to-human contact

3648
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:20,479
Buy contact with some surfaces where the virus may have ended up on

3649
02:48:20,735 --> 02:48:23,807
And by respiratory droplets caused by coughs and sneezes

3650
02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:26,879
It's easy to say that if a sneeze can transmit the virus

3651
02:48:28,415 --> 02:48:28,927
It's not the same

3652
02:48:29,183 --> 02:48:29,695
Nothing

3653
02:48:30,207 --> 02:48:32,767
Diseases like measles can live in the air for long.

3654
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:35,071
Hours after someone sneezes or coughs or

3655
02:48:36,095 --> 02:48:37,119
Which is not the

3656
02:48:37,375 --> 02:48:40,191
This case with the coronavirus as far as the current information on

3657
02:48:40,447 --> 02:48:40,959
Subject

3658
02:48:42,751 --> 02:48:43,263
This matter

3659
02:48:44,031 --> 02:48:47,103
Because the difference between being airborne and not is massive

3660
02:48:47,359 --> 02:48:48,639
In terms of the spread of the virus

3661
02:48:49,407 --> 02:48:51,199
Hwinstore roads what are you doing

3662
02:48:51,711 --> 02:48:52,991
Is line

3663
02:48:53,247 --> 02:48:54,271
To make them more scared

3664
02:48:55,551 --> 02:48:57,855
Which is why you shouldn't be speaking on these subjects

3665
02:48:58,623 --> 02:48:59,647
You have no idea what he's talking

3666
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:03,743
Honestly Stuart should stick to whining about guns

3667
02:49:03,999 --> 02:49:05,279
Violent revolution

3668
02:49:05,535 --> 02:49:06,303
He's much better at that

3669
02:49:07,071 --> 02:49:09,119
I was thinking I was thinking maybe I f***** up

3670
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:10,143
At the beginning of that

3671
02:49:11,167 --> 02:49:14,239
It's not a baba baba it's Airborne I was like

3672
02:49:14,495 --> 02:49:16,031
Oh he's going to he's going to Twisted

3673
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:18,079
It's carried on playing

3674
02:49:18,335 --> 02:49:20,895
Get it is Airborne that's how it's getting around the world

3675
02:49:21,151 --> 02:49:23,967
And then he was like nope legit is in the f******

3676
02:49:24,479 --> 02:49:26,783
AC great Where Art Thou

3677
02:49:27,039 --> 02:49:27,551
Wow

3678
02:49:27,807 --> 02:49:29,343
Distinctions

3679
02:49:29,599 --> 02:49:32,671
That's f***** up talking about his lieutenant-colonel sources

3680
02:49:32,927 --> 02:49:34,719
This will be one of the reason

3681
02:49:34,975 --> 02:49:35,999
Why I made you

3682
02:49:36,255 --> 02:49:39,327
I really bring into sharp Focus that it was over the weekend

3683
02:49:39,839 --> 02:49:40,863
That the first one talked

3684
02:49:41,119 --> 02:49:47,263
Give us your expertise eating a lot of sources inside the female has all the answers the military has all the answer the loudest

3685
02:49:48,543 --> 02:49:54,687
We believe it kills about 2% of people and we're already having

3686
02:49:54,943 --> 02:49:56,991
Emergency going on

3687
02:49:57,247 --> 02:50:03,391
Because now Alex's added the secret emergency declaration that he's building from the hill have

3688
02:50:03,647 --> 02:50:07,743
Inflating the Azar announcement from the end of January

3689
02:50:07,999 --> 02:50:10,815
Now he needs one of his sources to have been among

3690
02:50:11,071 --> 02:50:15,935
So he's taking the first lieutenant colonel to talk to him over the weekend and moved it back

3691
02:50:16,191 --> 02:50:17,727
Month before because it's more

3692
02:50:17,983 --> 02:50:19,007
Convenient for the narrative

3693
02:50:19,263 --> 02:50:20,031
Nothing matters

3694
02:50:20,287 --> 02:50:21,055
Everything shifts

3695
02:50:21,567 --> 02:50:23,615
This is all bulshit you are missing one possibility

3696
02:50:24,895 --> 02:50:26,687
Alex controls time

3697
02:50:26,943 --> 02:50:28,223
Oh he's a Time Lord

3698
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:28,991
Exactly

3699
02:50:29,247 --> 02:50:34,623
Artist took the lieutenant colonel they both went back to a month ago that Lieutenant Colonel told him

3700
02:50:34,879 --> 02:50:38,463
Against so technically he is correct when he says that a month ago

3701
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:39,743
The lieutenant colonel told him

3702
02:50:39,999 --> 02:50:40,511
They were tired

3703
02:50:41,023 --> 02:50:41,791
Okay then

3704
02:50:43,071 --> 02:50:44,607
Okay if that's the case

3705
02:50:44,863 --> 02:50:46,143
Can't backtrack.

3706
02:50:47,167 --> 02:50:48,703
So you could

3707
02:50:48,959 --> 02:50:49,727
Matt Smith

3708
02:50:49,983 --> 02:50:51,007
So Alex

3709
02:50:51,263 --> 02:50:52,543
Has allowed Stewart

3710
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:54,847
Denial say that is Airborne

3711
02:50:55,103 --> 02:50:55,871
Great

3712
02:50:56,127 --> 02:50:58,943
That's very good student no business talk about

3713
02:51:00,991 --> 02:51:02,271
Makes a claim hear that

3714
02:51:02,527 --> 02:51:03,807
Really kind of interesting

3715
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:05,087
And I think also

3716
02:51:05,599 --> 02:51:06,367
Very response

3717
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:08,671
Gut-level you really think this is a big

3718
02:51:13,023 --> 02:51:14,559
I think I think this is a serious threat

3719
02:51:21,215 --> 02:51:27,359
We had two more dangerous

3720
02:51:31,199 --> 02:51:34,783
You guys know what viruses are

3721
02:51:35,295 --> 02:51:41,439
So there was an article about people who had recovered from coronavirus testing positive afterwards was published in the New York Times

3722
02:51:41,695 --> 02:51:42,463
Times on March 6th

3723
02:51:42,719 --> 02:51:44,511
After this episode

3724
02:51:44,767 --> 02:51:50,655
If they don't know about that article in the patent less the time lord thing

3725
02:51:50,911 --> 02:51:51,423
Boston Store to Taco

3726
02:51:52,447 --> 02:51:54,239
There are not many cases of reinfect

3727
02:51:55,775 --> 02:52:00,383
Photo of looked into it already there are a couple explanations that are the most like

3728
02:52:01,407 --> 02:52:05,247
The first is that these people

3729
02:52:05,503 --> 02:52:07,551
Who got false negatives in the test

3730
02:52:08,063 --> 02:52:09,087
Redeem them recover

3731
02:52:09,343 --> 02:52:14,463
So it's not actually a reinfection as much as it is them still being sick but haven't gotten an accurate - 2

3732
02:52:14,719 --> 02:52:15,999
That doesn't sound possible

3733
02:52:17,279 --> 02:52:18,047
Possible but it's

3734
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:19,327
Probably unlikely

3735
02:52:19,839 --> 02:52:23,935
Since to be discharged from these hospitals people have to test negative in two consecutive test

3736
02:52:24,191 --> 02:52:25,471
One day apart

3737
02:52:25,727 --> 02:52:28,799
It is unlikely but it's also not impossible since

3738
02:52:29,055 --> 02:52:30,335
False negatives are more common than

3739
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:31,103
False positive

3740
02:52:31,615 --> 02:52:33,663
Possible that's one explanation

3741
02:52:34,175 --> 02:52:40,319
Well considering the kit rollout that we've seen like there's old there's all kinds of possibility of absolute absolute

3742
02:52:40,575 --> 02:52:43,391
And the other possibility is that they often bring up is that

3743
02:52:43,647 --> 02:52:44,415
The PCR test

3744
02:52:44,671 --> 02:52:47,231
It's being done that found them positive after recovering

3745
02:52:47,487 --> 02:52:49,535
Could be picking up remnants of the virus

3746
02:52:49,791 --> 02:52:51,327
It's because it's a super-sensitive test

3747
02:52:52,095 --> 02:52:55,167
Is New York Times article points out that PCR test still quote

3748
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:57,215
The tech remnants of the measles virus

3749
02:52:57,471 --> 02:52:59,007
Months after people are no longer

3750
02:53:00,287 --> 02:53:02,079
So there are those possibilities

3751
02:53:02,335 --> 02:53:04,383
Other explanations than this

3752
02:53:04,639 --> 02:53:05,151
Virus

3753
02:53:05,407 --> 02:53:07,711
Keeps coming back

3754
02:53:08,223 --> 02:53:11,039
Journal of the American Medical Association found for patients in

3755
02:53:11,295 --> 02:53:14,879
China tested negative been discharged and then tested positive

3756
02:53:15,135 --> 02:53:15,647
5230

3757
02:53:15,903 --> 02:53:16,415
18 days later

3758
02:53:17,183 --> 02:53:21,535
Do they tested positive later they were asymptomatic and none of the family members who live with them where

3759
02:53:21,791 --> 02:53:23,839
Indicate that they weren't contagious

3760
02:53:24,607 --> 02:53:27,423
Their study was inconclusive as to the cause of this phenomenon but sad

3761
02:53:27,935 --> 02:53:28,703
Further examination

3762
02:53:29,727 --> 02:53:31,519
It was recently

3763
02:53:31,775 --> 02:53:33,567
In China who died after discharge

3764
02:53:33,823 --> 02:53:34,335
From hospital

3765
02:53:34,591 --> 02:53:35,615
Presumably because he was

3766
02:53:35,871 --> 02:53:36,383
Clear the virus

3767
02:53:37,151 --> 02:53:38,943
Is it doesn't match what they're talking about

3768
02:53:39,455 --> 02:53:40,479
Since he died of respiratory

3769
02:53:40,735 --> 02:53:41,247
Failure

3770
02:53:41,503 --> 02:53:43,295
So it's more likely case where he was wrongly

3771
02:53:44,575 --> 02:53:46,111
He was one of the number of readmitted

3772
02:53:46,367 --> 02:53:48,671
Define Kang Hospital one of the new Leaf

3773
02:53:48,927 --> 02:53:50,207
Constructed facilities they put up

3774
02:53:50,463 --> 02:53:53,791
So odds are this was a hospital problem where they discharge page

3775
02:53:54,303 --> 02:53:55,071
To capricious

3776
02:53:56,351 --> 02:53:57,119
There was one case

3777
02:53:57,631 --> 02:54:02,751
Japan recovered then days later returned to the hospital with a sore throat

3778
02:54:03,007 --> 02:54:03,519
Chest pains

3779
02:54:04,031 --> 02:54:05,055
And tested positive again

3780
02:54:06,335 --> 02:54:08,383
So I kind of feeds into the

3781
02:54:09,151 --> 02:54:09,663
The heart stuff

3782
02:54:10,687 --> 02:54:11,455
Stewart was talking about

3783
02:54:11,967 --> 02:54:15,295
Some early indications that doctors are seeing

3784
02:54:16,319 --> 02:54:17,087
The body creates

3785
02:54:17,343 --> 02:54:18,623
In response to the Coronavirus

3786
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:20,671
Do not persist for very long

3787
02:54:21,183 --> 02:54:21,951
I like chicken

3788
02:54:22,207 --> 02:54:24,511
Box where you get it you're immune to it afterwards

3789
02:54:25,023 --> 02:54:26,559
People may only have a very

3790
02:54:26,815 --> 02:54:27,583
Temporary immunity

3791
02:54:28,095 --> 02:54:28,863
And I am cases

3792
02:54:30,143 --> 02:54:30,655
Which is why we need

3793
02:54:31,167 --> 02:54:31,679
Vaccine for it

3794
02:54:32,447 --> 02:54:32,959
It's just

3795
02:54:33,215 --> 02:54:34,495
Survive it or like

3796
02:54:34,751 --> 02:54:35,519
Take your kids to f******

3797
02:54:35,775 --> 02:54:37,311
Chicken coronavirus party

3798
02:54:38,335 --> 02:54:41,663
Another cases in these but there are too few twice

3799
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:44,479
Positive cases to conduct a study or Draw.

3800
02:54:44,735 --> 02:54:45,247
Conclusion

3801
02:54:45,503 --> 02:54:47,807
Ed Sheeran Lewis the director of the Peter Doherty

3802
02:54:48,063 --> 02:54:48,831
Institute for infection

3803
02:54:49,087 --> 02:54:50,111
Immunity in Melbourne

3804
02:54:50,367 --> 02:54:50,879
Before

3805
02:54:51,903 --> 02:54:54,207
I was able to find an article in Taiwan news.

3806
02:54:54,463 --> 02:54:56,511
It seems to match up a little closer was Alex

3807
02:54:56,767 --> 02:54:57,279
Stewardess

3808
02:54:58,047 --> 02:55:03,679
This article is about Taiwan news a message

3809
02:55:03,935 --> 02:55:04,447
Increased

3810
02:55:04,703 --> 02:55:05,471
I am peoples

3811
02:55:05,727 --> 02:55:09,311
At that leave instead the deadliness of the infection

3812
02:55:09,823 --> 02:55:11,871
D-sub headline of this article reads quote

3813
02:55:12,127 --> 02:55:17,503
Instead of creating immunity the virus can reportedly reinfect an individual in Hastings fatal heart attack

3814
02:55:18,271 --> 02:55:20,063
So if you just skim the headlines you might have

3815
02:55:20,319 --> 02:55:21,855
Doctor was telling Taiwan

3816
02:55:22,111 --> 02:55:23,391
Reinfection of Coronavirus

3817
02:55:26,463 --> 02:55:27,487
Stewardess

3818
02:55:29,023 --> 02:55:30,047
If you read the actual art

3819
02:55:30,303 --> 02:55:31,071
Here's what the doctor

3820
02:55:32,095 --> 02:55:33,887
A few people recovered

3821
02:55:34,143 --> 02:55:36,191
From the first time by their own immune system

3822
02:55:37,727 --> 02:55:38,751
Damaging their heart tissue

3823
02:55:39,519 --> 02:55:41,823
And when they get it a second time the antibody dozen

3824
02:55:42,079 --> 02:55:43,103
Help but makes it worse

3825
02:55:43,615 --> 02:55:44,895
And they died a sudden death

3826
02:55:45,151 --> 02:55:45,663
From heart failure

3827
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:49,759
I can't find any data backing up this Anonymous claim but if you

3828
02:55:50,015 --> 02:55:51,551
You take it at face value is accurate

3829
02:55:51,807 --> 02:55:56,415
Even this is just saying that the meds that were being used to treat the virus are damaging people's hearts

3830
02:55:56,927 --> 02:55:58,463
That's not indicative of the virus

3831
02:55:58,719 --> 02:55:59,487
Attacking people's heart

3832
02:56:00,255 --> 02:56:03,839
This is an article from February 14th so it's not exactly breaking news

3833
02:56:04,095 --> 02:56:05,887
But I could see this possibly

3834
02:56:06,143 --> 02:56:07,679
It's possible there's something here

3835
02:56:08,191 --> 02:56:13,311
If it's true that the meds that were being used compromised patients fart it would put them at far greater risk

3836
02:56:13,567 --> 02:56:14,079
From the virus

3837
02:56:14,591 --> 02:56:16,127
But the infection has nothing to do with that

3838
02:56:16,383 --> 02:56:18,175
That's strictly a problem with these

3839
02:56:19,199 --> 02:56:22,271
Anyway the point is is this is the source that Stewart now it's are using

3840
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:23,295
We're completely miss you

3841
02:56:23,807 --> 02:56:24,831
I wouldn't be surprised

3842
02:56:25,087 --> 02:56:27,135
Neither of them had actually even read the article

3843
02:56:27,391 --> 02:56:28,415
Just read the headline

3844
02:56:28,671 --> 02:56:34,815
Headline is in line in line with the narrative that they're putting for the article

3845
02:56:35,071 --> 02:56:35,583
Is not

3846
02:56:36,351 --> 02:56:41,727
At this stage even experts can't definitively say whether the relatively small phenomenon of people testing

3847
02:56:41,983 --> 02:56:43,263
Positive negative positive

3848
02:56:43,519 --> 02:56:44,031
Is the result

3849
02:56:44,287 --> 02:56:45,055
Human error fault

3850
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:48,639
The test Horsham feature of this virus that is not yet understood

3851
02:56:50,687 --> 02:56:52,223
And I had The Oath Keepers

3852
02:56:52,479 --> 02:56:53,503
Playlist of the Expo

3853
02:56:56,319 --> 02:56:57,087
Possible

3854
02:56:58,623 --> 02:57:00,159
I'm still recovering from the

3855
02:57:00,671 --> 02:57:03,231
Oh it's Airborne now it's in your AC run run

3856
02:57:03,487 --> 02:57:05,279
Get outside

3857
02:57:05,535 --> 02:57:06,559
Go underground

3858
02:57:07,583 --> 02:57:12,191
It's probably underground it's in the ground now you're going to get sick again

3859
02:57:12,447 --> 02:57:15,519
And now your heart attack but God damn it we're all dead

3860
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:18,591
So

3861
02:57:18,847 --> 02:57:20,895
Stewart Rhodes Alex Jones having a great

3862
02:57:21,663 --> 02:57:25,247
Yes got a hit that does seem like there and how do you make this even better

3863
02:57:25,759 --> 02:57:27,551
0ad Rochester

3864
02:57:27,807 --> 02:57:28,319
Close

3865
02:57:28,831 --> 02:57:29,855
Steeplechase

3866
02:57:31,135 --> 02:57:32,671
God dammit

3867
02:57:32,927 --> 02:57:38,303
Okay and

3868
02:57:39,071 --> 02:57:42,655
He does want to talk with the Democratic primary and I sense a little

3869
02:57:42,911 --> 02:57:43,679
December 10th

3870
02:57:44,447 --> 02:57:46,495
She was seeing right now

3871
02:57:47,775 --> 02:57:48,287
The end of the day

3872
02:57:50,847 --> 02:57:55,967
When you have a blunt

3873
02:57:56,223 --> 02:58:02,367
That's a hard day buddy

3874
02:58:02,623 --> 02:58:03,391
For the Democrats

3875
02:58:03,903 --> 02:58:09,279
Steve's whole point about Trump being a great person to happy presidents getting super rich

3876
02:58:10,303 --> 02:58:12,863
Why does it matter the Bloomberg Jewish

3877
02:58:13,375 --> 02:58:14,143
Steve

3878
02:58:14,655 --> 02:58:16,959
I do I do think that that is

3879
02:58:17,215 --> 02:58:18,239
One thing that I

3880
02:58:18,495 --> 02:58:21,055
Cuz I remember I've gotten a few people

3881
02:58:21,567 --> 02:58:22,079
Sing me a message

3882
02:58:23,103 --> 02:58:24,895
When Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the race

3883
02:58:25,407 --> 02:58:25,919
Disappointed because

3884
02:58:26,431 --> 02:58:26,943
Now we're back

3885
02:58:27,199 --> 02:58:28,479
The two white dude all over again

3886
02:58:29,247 --> 02:58:33,343
And that Nazi flag really should put into sharp relief that we are not back

3887
02:58:33,599 --> 02:58:34,111
Acta2 White

3888
02:58:34,367 --> 02:58:40,511
Well some people view it that way

3889
02:58:40,767 --> 02:58:42,303
Homicidal

3890
02:58:42,815 --> 02:58:43,583
No

3891
02:58:44,351 --> 02:58:44,863
Nope

3892
02:58:45,119 --> 02:58:50,239
Alex is very convinced the shifting Sands of his Coronavirus

3893
02:58:50,495 --> 02:58:51,007
Narrative

3894
02:58:51,263 --> 02:58:53,311
Easter but it's man-made

3895
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:55,359
This isn't even Up For Debate

3896
02:58:56,895 --> 02:58:57,407
Unfortunately

3897
02:58:57,663 --> 02:59:00,479
Steve pieczenik doesn't buy that b*******

3898
02:59:01,247 --> 02:59:02,527
I don't think so and I'll tell you why

3899
02:59:02,783 --> 02:59:04,319
1

3900
02:59:08,415 --> 02:59:11,999
If you want to create a virus

3901
02:59:12,511 --> 02:59:15,583
Create a Coronavirus

3902
02:59:18,143 --> 02:59:19,423
They don't work

3903
02:59:22,239 --> 02:59:28,127
So I don't know what the Lysol part is about but I know that there was a conspiracy going around about like

3904
02:59:28,383 --> 02:59:30,687
I saw that somebody took a picture and it was like

3905
02:59:30,943 --> 02:59:37,087
All helps kill 9899 Coronavirus

3906
02:59:37,343 --> 02:59:38,623
What's Diva saying but it isn't

3907
02:59:38,879 --> 02:59:39,647
Thing that he's like knives

3908
02:59:40,159 --> 02:59:40,927
Yeah

3909
02:59:41,183 --> 02:59:41,951
Tough time with that

3910
02:59:42,463 --> 02:59:42,975
Now

3911
02:59:45,535 --> 02:59:46,559
I mean there's advice

3912
02:59:47,071 --> 02:59:49,631
Oh there's bad advice

3913
02:59:49,887 --> 02:59:52,191
And then there's pieczenik

3914
02:59:52,703 --> 02:59:54,751
Has category

3915
02:59:55,007 --> 02:59:57,823
He has a plan

3916
02:59:58,591 --> 03:00:04,735
I want to hear this blithering

3917
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:08,831
Used

3918
03:00:09,087 --> 03:00:12,415
The CDC was way behind didn't have the proper test

3919
03:00:12,671 --> 03:00:15,743
Or funding

3920
03:00:16,767 --> 03:00:20,863
So is advice is get rid of it

3921
03:00:21,119 --> 03:00:22,399
Tony fauci

3922
03:00:24,703 --> 03:00:25,215
Alright

3923
03:00:25,471 --> 03:00:27,263
I'm going to here's my plan

3924
03:00:28,287 --> 03:00:31,359
Now a lot of people in a lot of movies evolved in about

3925
03:00:31,615 --> 03:00:32,895
Fighting the Zambian

3926
03:00:33,151 --> 03:00:33,663
Apocalypse

3927
03:00:34,175 --> 03:00:36,223
My plan is what if instead

3928
03:00:36,479 --> 03:00:37,247
We don't

3929
03:00:37,503 --> 03:00:43,647
What if we lead in what if we do not become a zombie you don't know if it's not better

3930
03:00:43,903 --> 03:00:46,463
Maybe they're having a great time it seems like there is it there

3931
03:00:46,719 --> 03:00:51,071
Right there populating more than white people are now that's your great replacement Theory

3932
03:00:51,583 --> 03:00:55,935
Jesus Christ I would say that advice is

3933
03:01:02,079 --> 03:01:03,359
C'mon man

3934
03:01:03,615 --> 03:01:05,151
We should only be treated by midwife

3935
03:01:05,663 --> 03:01:06,943
I think it's indicates two things

3936
03:01:07,199 --> 03:01:13,343
Steve is really committed to the terms of everybody in the government

3937
03:01:13,599 --> 03:01:17,183
And the second thing I hear from that is that Steve really doesn't

3938
03:01:17,439 --> 03:01:18,207
View this as

3939
03:01:19,487 --> 03:01:19,999
Concerned

3940
03:01:20,511 --> 03:01:26,655
The Coronavirus

3941
03:01:26,911 --> 03:01:27,679
No big deal

3942
03:01:29,471 --> 03:01:30,495
Which is run

3943
03:01:30,751 --> 03:01:32,543
Counter to every element of Alec

3944
03:01:33,311 --> 03:01:34,079
Except on Tuesday

3945
03:01:34,591 --> 03:01:35,359
Nowhere Monday

3946
03:01:35,871 --> 03:01:40,991
Which state was not a big deal

3947
03:01:41,759 --> 03:01:43,295
It'll all work out it's all fine

3948
03:01:44,063 --> 03:01:44,575
Okay

3949
03:01:45,599 --> 03:01:46,111
Stewart

3950
03:01:46,367 --> 03:01:47,391
Are not stupid still there

3951
03:01:47,903 --> 03:01:49,951
You still hanging out of court and Steve

3952
03:01:50,207 --> 03:01:53,535
There he knows that malicious very active in Montana

3953
03:01:54,047 --> 03:01:56,863
Research rambling about Montana

3954
03:01:57,119 --> 03:01:57,631
Okay

3955
03:01:57,887 --> 03:01:58,911
This has nothing to do with anything

3956
03:01:59,167 --> 03:02:01,471
Okay I'm definitely biketown in for this

3957
03:02:01,727 --> 03:02:03,007
It has nothing to do with any

3958
03:02:03,263 --> 03:02:04,543
I think they were talking about before this

3959
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:06,079
It's very weird

3960
03:02:08,639 --> 03:02:09,407
Montana

3961
03:02:11,199 --> 03:02:12,223
And I had a lawyer

3962
03:02:15,039 --> 03:02:18,111
And came down a Florida is Montana a problem

3963
03:02:18,367 --> 03:02:20,159
Tana in and of itself

3964
03:02:20,415 --> 03:02:22,719
Who's really a democratic state

3965
03:02:25,023 --> 03:02:26,559
Because I can

3966
03:02:36,799 --> 03:02:38,335
We're back in 2 minutes

3967
03:02:39,871 --> 03:02:41,407
Number three with Stewart Roseanne

3968
03:02:41,919 --> 03:02:43,967
On Montana

3969
03:02:44,223 --> 03:02:48,319
Straight ahead stay weather

3970
03:02:48,831 --> 03:02:52,159
Steve what are you talkin about or did you even have

3971
03:02:52,415 --> 03:02:52,927
Time

3972
03:02:53,183 --> 03:02:53,951
Yeah

3973
03:02:54,207 --> 03:02:55,487
Give me the timeline

3974
03:02:55,743 --> 03:02:59,583
Let me know when you are in Montana I want to look that up and cross-reference that with Whitney

3975
03:02:59,839 --> 03:03:01,119
Whether or not you were in Korea

3976
03:03:03,167 --> 03:03:08,543
I do love that anytime anybody brings up anything Steve is like I absolutely we are

3977
03:03:08,799 --> 03:03:13,919
Together all this time from Montana

3978
03:03:15,199 --> 03:03:15,711
What

3979
03:03:16,735 --> 03:03:18,527
Alright thanks

3980
03:03:18,783 --> 03:03:20,319
Globetrotter

3981
03:03:20,575 --> 03:03:21,087
Forrest Gump

3982
03:03:21,343 --> 03:03:22,367
Sure

3983
03:03:22,623 --> 03:03:28,511
Talking about how like yeah he wants to get rid of all these government agencies and everything because he can't get integrated Intel

3984
03:03:28,767 --> 03:03:29,279
Absolutely

3985
03:03:30,559 --> 03:03:31,583
Alex is like

3986
03:03:31,839 --> 03:03:36,703
Well Papa Steve haven't I given you integrate

3987
03:03:37,727 --> 03:03:39,007
This is very f*****-up

3988
03:03:39,775 --> 03:03:42,591
16 inch

3989
03:03:45,919 --> 03:03:48,223
When I need an integrated intelligence predict

3990
03:03:50,015 --> 03:03:56,159
The CIA doesn't work

3991
03:04:01,791 --> 03:04:07,935
Hi I said that for the 18 years you've been ahead of the curve when it honestly little eyes

3992
03:04:08,191 --> 03:04:09,471
Scary

3993
03:04:09,983 --> 03:04:12,031
We saw Trump was going to win two years before he did

3994
03:04:13,311 --> 03:04:15,871
Is the globalist

3995
03:04:17,663 --> 03:04:18,943
Man

3996
03:04:19,199 --> 03:04:23,039
F*** out of here out of here

3997
03:04:23,295 --> 03:04:24,063
Bulshit

3998
03:04:24,319 --> 03:04:26,111
Six months before his elected you work

3999
03:04:26,367 --> 03:04:27,647
Calling of a goddamn Bob

4000
03:04:27,903 --> 03:04:29,183
That's not true

4001
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:30,207
But it was less than a year

4002
03:04:30,463 --> 03:04:32,255
Started supporting Trump

4003
03:04:32,511 --> 03:04:38,143
December 2015

4004
03:04:38,399 --> 03:04:41,215
Trump wasn't even running two years before the election

4005
03:04:41,471 --> 03:04:43,519
Announce tonight was July

4006
03:04:44,031 --> 03:04:44,543
Pennywise

4007
03:04:44,799 --> 03:04:45,311
Stupid

4008
03:04:45,567 --> 03:04:46,335
So

4009
03:04:47,103 --> 03:04:52,223
They talked about another thing that Steve has been like consistent on for a long time is it the Democratic Party

4010
03:04:52,991 --> 03:04:53,759
Yeah they're all dying

4011
03:04:54,527 --> 03:04:57,599
And you talk about that a little bit is okay

4012
03:04:57,855 --> 03:04:58,623
You know whatever

4013
03:04:59,903 --> 03:05:01,439
Talking about that

4014
03:05:01,695 --> 03:05:02,975
50 indicates that he was

4015
03:05:03,231 --> 03:05:05,023
Not a good practicing therapist

4016
03:05:05,535 --> 03:05:06,815
Okay back when he was

4017
03:05:07,583 --> 03:05:09,375
This party and the

4018
03:05:09,631 --> 03:05:11,167
Cast of A system that really

4019
03:05:11,679 --> 03:05:13,215
It's no longer in the car

4020
03:05:13,727 --> 03:05:18,591
Constitutional system down

4021
03:05:18,847 --> 03:05:22,687
The balrog falls off the cliff against me with his whip

4022
03:05:22,943 --> 03:05:24,991
How do we stop them from taking us out with him

4023
03:05:25,759 --> 03:05:29,343
And I'll comes back buddy

4024
03:05:29,599 --> 03:05:32,415
A patient committing suicide

4025
03:05:44,959 --> 03:05:49,311
I will not become a psychiatrist

4026
03:05:49,567 --> 03:05:50,591
Listen

4027
03:05:50,847 --> 03:05:52,639
I am going to go out a limb here

4028
03:05:52,895 --> 03:05:55,455
And I'm going to say because it's your f****** job

4029
03:05:55,711 --> 03:06:00,575
I'm not sure that's best practices watch people cut their wrists

4030
03:06:00,831 --> 03:06:03,647
I I go to a psychiatrist and I have an appointment

4031
03:06:03,903 --> 03:06:06,207
This week and I'll tell you something

4032
03:06:07,231 --> 03:06:07,743
Not

4033
03:06:08,255 --> 03:06:10,303
Her she is not going to watch

4034
03:06:10,815 --> 03:06:16,447
Yeah if I were to go to my therapist did you like a what you think about this call the police

4035
03:06:16,703 --> 03:06:18,495
I would think he was the worst

4036
03:06:18,751 --> 03:06:20,287
Therapist in the world

4037
03:06:20,543 --> 03:06:26,687
He actually have a responsibility by law to call the police if they are self-harming in his office

4038
03:06:26,943 --> 03:06:31,039
Some sort of a guidance on that issue

4039
03:06:31,295 --> 03:06:34,879
Stunning Steve just indicated he's a f******

4040
03:06:35,135 --> 03:06:39,487
You have to call the police if you were planning to commit violence to others or yourself

4041
03:06:39,743 --> 03:06:42,303
I don't know yeah I don't I don't know what the line is on viola

4042
03:06:42,559 --> 03:06:44,095
But yeah I said I should have looked in

4043
03:06:44,351 --> 03:06:44,863
And that but I didn't

4044
03:06:45,119 --> 03:06:45,887
Anyway

4045
03:06:46,143 --> 03:06:47,679
Saigon he's been

4046
03:06:48,191 --> 03:06:52,287
Complete nut bag

4047
03:06:52,543 --> 03:06:53,311
I don't think it's Braxton

4048
03:06:55,615 --> 03:06:56,639
So Alex

4049
03:06:56,895 --> 03:06:58,431
Gets into like this idea of it

4050
03:06:58,687 --> 03:06:59,967
These people who are

4051
03:07:00,223 --> 03:07:01,247
Clearly contradicting

4052
03:07:01,503 --> 03:07:02,527
Each other on his show

4053
03:07:05,087 --> 03:07:06,623
People accused me of that

4054
03:07:07,647 --> 03:07:11,487
All the towels and emails and Thomas

4055
03:07:14,815 --> 03:07:20,959
How do you say one another and I'm always for the family in Jesus Christ

4056
03:07:21,215 --> 03:07:23,775
America but you're not always

4057
03:07:26,591 --> 03:07:29,151
Detectives on the different angles to challenge my mind

4058
03:07:29,663 --> 03:07:32,479
Alex wants to challenge his mind he should take up Sudoku

4059
03:07:32,991 --> 03:07:37,343
If you wants to get the perspectives of people he thinks are interesting that he should probably learn how to conduct

4060
03:07:37,599 --> 03:07:38,111
Interview

4061
03:07:38,879 --> 03:07:42,975
Problem with Alex's show is not that he has different people on with different ideas

4062
03:07:43,487 --> 03:07:47,071
The problem is that he doesn't engage with those ideas from a consistent position

4063
03:07:47,583 --> 03:07:49,119
He agrees with just about everything

4064
03:07:49,375 --> 03:07:52,191
John friends

4065
03:07:52,703 --> 03:07:53,983
You can see earlier how we

4066
03:07:54,239 --> 03:07:58,591
Turn something like Adam said about a Rush Limbaugh clip into two high-level sources telling him

4067
03:07:58,847 --> 03:08:01,151
The half the US was going to get coronavirus at 3

4068
03:08:02,431 --> 03:08:06,527
There really is only one responsible way to do a show like what Alex is trying to do

4069
03:08:06,783 --> 03:08:08,063
And that's for him to stay neutral

4070
03:08:08,575 --> 03:08:10,879
Teva consistent northward facing bearing

4071
03:08:11,135 --> 03:08:11,903
Which would be hard

4072
03:08:13,439 --> 03:08:13,951
Pair

4073
03:08:14,207 --> 03:08:17,023
You need to hear Stewart Road say the coronavirus is Airborne

4074
03:08:17,279 --> 03:08:18,303
And be able to correct

4075
03:08:18,559 --> 03:08:19,583
Which Alex would never do

4076
03:08:19,839 --> 03:08:21,887
For one who doesn't want to offend his gun buddy

4077
03:08:22,143 --> 03:08:22,655
Into

4078
03:08:22,911 --> 03:08:26,239
He's more than happy to say it so he can say it himself later

4079
03:08:27,007 --> 03:08:32,127
Because Alex refuses to do any work that he can't stop himself from believing basically anything is stupid friends tell him

4080
03:08:32,383 --> 03:08:35,455
You end up in a situation where the show ends up being super disorienting

4081
03:08:35,711 --> 03:08:36,479
Kind of abusive

4082
03:08:37,247 --> 03:08:39,807
For this episode of listen to Sunday through Wednesday of last week

4083
03:08:40,319 --> 03:08:42,111
And I don't know what Alex's real position

4084
03:08:42,367 --> 03:08:42,879
Not Coronavirus

4085
03:08:43,903 --> 03:08:46,463
On Sunday the virus isn't a big deal on the real issues.

4086
03:08:46,719 --> 03:08:47,231
The supply chain.

4087
03:08:48,255 --> 03:08:52,095
I even suggest that the whole thing is fake because of his real china would have covered it up

4088
03:08:53,375 --> 03:08:55,679
The whole thing as a plot to disrupt the economy

4089
03:08:55,935 --> 03:08:56,447
An attack Trump

4090
03:08:56,959 --> 03:09:00,543
But then on Monday Alex mysteriously has to fake high-level sources you predict

4091
03:09:00,799 --> 03:09:01,567
3 billion dead

4092
03:09:02,079 --> 03:09:03,871
One over the weekend and one that morning

4093
03:09:04,127 --> 03:09:04,895
Singing all of a sudden

4094
03:09:05,151 --> 03:09:06,687
This is a severe medical Panic again

4095
03:09:06,943 --> 03:09:10,015
And even though it's a major crisis he still has time to try and bake Gorka

4096
03:09:10,271 --> 03:09:10,783
Into a fight

4097
03:09:11,295 --> 03:09:12,319
Then on Tuesday

4098
03:09:12,575 --> 03:09:18,207
It's still the three billion Beth dire situation but it's cool cuz secretly declared a National Emergency a month ago

4099
03:09:18,463 --> 03:09:21,791
And unpreparedness you see all around you was actually just globalist

4100
03:09:22,047 --> 03:09:24,351
In the bureaucracy trying to f*** Trump over

4101
03:09:25,119 --> 03:09:27,935
Of course even though he's still in a gigantic pandemic mode

4102
03:09:28,191 --> 03:09:30,239
Alex still has time to spend it

4103
03:09:30,495 --> 03:09:31,519
Interviewing Tommy Robinson

4104
03:09:31,775 --> 03:09:32,799
Crying about God

4105
03:09:33,311 --> 03:09:37,919
Been on Wednesday one of these fake sources actually told Alex this stuff about the 2%

4106
03:09:38,175 --> 03:09:39,455
Even though I'm about to go out

4107
03:09:39,711 --> 03:09:42,015
How to speculate on this is a race specific

4108
03:09:42,271 --> 03:09:44,575
That maybe trumpet launched on China's pay back or front

4109
03:09:45,087 --> 03:09:50,463
And then he has super credible always right expert Steve pieczenik on to say that this isn't man-made

4110
03:09:50,975 --> 03:09:51,743
No big deal because

4111
03:09:51,999 --> 03:09:53,535
Yeah we got it and enjoyed himself

4112
03:09:54,303 --> 03:09:57,375
Get rid of the CDC in the 80s

4113
03:09:58,399 --> 03:09:59,679
I can't put it more simply than this

4114
03:10:00,447 --> 03:10:02,751
I pay attention to Alex and listen to his show Act

4115
03:10:03,519 --> 03:10:04,799
And I have no idea what is actual

4116
03:10:05,823 --> 03:10:07,615
He goes along with the whims of these gas

4117
03:10:07,871 --> 03:10:11,199
Contradictory things they say become part of his narratives in a way that creates

4118
03:10:11,455 --> 03:10:11,967
Generalized

4119
03:10:12,223 --> 03:10:12,735
Incoherent

4120
03:10:12,991 --> 03:10:13,759
This is really hard

4121
03:10:14,015 --> 03:10:14,527
To penetrate

4122
03:10:15,039 --> 03:10:16,319
I suspect that this is intense

4123
03:10:17,343 --> 03:10:20,927
Review operates this way Alex will have endorsed and played around

4124
03:10:21,183 --> 03:10:23,487
100 nonsense theories it is got to brought up

4125
03:10:23,743 --> 03:10:29,887
Turn on the off chance that one of them ends up being close to Accurate he can pretend those other 99 we're just wargaming things

4126
03:10:30,143 --> 03:10:31,423
Not really his position

4127
03:10:32,703 --> 03:10:33,727
Was the one that closed

4128
03:10:34,495 --> 03:10:36,799
I'm fairly convinced that this is a strategy consciously

4129
03:10:37,055 --> 03:10:37,567
You're not

4130
03:10:37,823 --> 03:10:40,639
Where is case it makes the show very hard to understand

4131
03:10:41,151 --> 03:10:42,687
If you're just passively listening to this and

4132
03:10:42,943 --> 03:10:46,015
You actually believe that Alex knows anything about what he's talking about

4133
03:10:46,271 --> 03:10:48,575
I can't imagine what you have to go through on a weekly basis

4134
03:10:49,343 --> 03:10:50,367
Everything Changes

4135
03:10:50,623 --> 03:10:51,135
Because nothing

4136
03:10:51,391 --> 03:10:51,903
Real

4137
03:10:52,159 --> 03:10:55,487
On Monday Alex A source told him the 2% figure that past weekend

4138
03:10:55,743 --> 03:10:56,767
Then on Wednesday was

4139
03:10:58,047 --> 03:11:00,095
Alex tell Steve that he knew Trump was going to get

4140
03:11:00,351 --> 03:11:02,143
Elected two years before the election

4141
03:11:02,399 --> 03:11:04,703
When Trump didn't even announce two years in advance

4142
03:11:04,959 --> 03:11:06,495
Can Alex caulk trumpisms

4143
03:11:06,751 --> 03:11:07,263
Broad

4144
03:11:07,519 --> 03:11:08,543
Until December 2015

4145
03:11:09,055 --> 03:11:09,823
Less than a year before

4146
03:11:11,103 --> 03:11:14,175
In the same way that Alex is not a consistent protagonist for the show

4147
03:11:14,687 --> 03:11:15,711
Past of his positions

4148
03:11:15,967 --> 03:11:16,991
40 States as fact

4149
03:11:17,503 --> 03:11:18,527
Or just a whim

4150
03:11:19,039 --> 03:11:22,879
People who listen to the show were tricked into thinking of what they were getting was researched

4151
03:11:23,135 --> 03:11:24,159
And hidden information

4152
03:11:24,927 --> 03:11:27,487
It's really just the emotional Outburst of a racist idiot

4153
03:11:27,743 --> 03:11:30,047
Can't even be bothered to read articles past headline

4154
03:11:30,815 --> 03:11:32,863
It's sad I mean it really bums me out

4155
03:11:33,375 --> 03:11:33,887
It's

4156
03:11:34,143 --> 03:11:34,655
It's it's

4157
03:11:35,935 --> 03:11:40,287
It's it's difficult for me because I know that a certain amount of Alex's audience didn't know what they were getting in

4158
03:11:42,335 --> 03:11:44,383
Get seduced and with this promise of like

4159
03:11:44,639 --> 03:11:50,783
Entertainment I know the truth behind the arrows

4160
03:11:51,039 --> 03:11:52,319
Who's today kind of b*******

4161
03:11:52,831 --> 03:11:54,367
And then before you know it you could get

4162
03:11:54,623 --> 03:11:57,183
Just load sleep on this idea that he's right

4163
03:11:57,439 --> 03:11:57,951
About everything

4164
03:11:58,719 --> 03:11:59,231
It's just

4165
03:11:59,487 --> 03:12:00,255
If you pay attention

4166
03:12:00,511 --> 03:12:02,047
Extinction

4167
03:12:02,559 --> 03:12:03,071
Yeah

4168
03:12:03,327 --> 03:12:06,143
Those two high-level sources the way that story changes

4169
03:12:06,399 --> 03:12:10,495
In the beginning of it the way it's so clearly based on

4170
03:12:10,751 --> 03:12:13,311
A conversation with Mike Adams about a Rush Limbaugh clip

4171
03:12:13,567 --> 03:12:14,079
Like

4172
03:12:14,335 --> 03:12:14,847
You wouldn't

4173
03:12:15,103 --> 03:12:16,383
Notice that unless you're paying a

4174
03:12:17,663 --> 03:12:19,455
I imagine that they treat

4175
03:12:19,711 --> 03:12:20,735
Him the same way

4176
03:12:22,015 --> 03:12:23,295
The news in Chipley

4177
03:12:23,807 --> 03:12:24,319
Where

4178
03:12:24,575 --> 03:12:27,391
It doesn't matter it really kind of doesn't matter what he says

4179
03:12:27,903 --> 03:12:29,695
What matters is what you choose

4180
03:12:29,951 --> 03:12:30,463
To think that he

4181
03:12:30,719 --> 03:12:31,999
He said you know so

4182
03:12:32,511 --> 03:12:34,559
He gives you a wide range of options

4183
03:12:34,815 --> 03:12:35,839
But if you're listening to him

4184
03:12:36,095 --> 03:12:37,119
You're really only looking

4185
03:12:37,375 --> 03:12:38,143
For what reinforces

4186
03:12:38,655 --> 03:12:39,935
You're already done believe

4187
03:12:40,191 --> 03:12:42,239
Yeah probably don't like easy

4188
03:12:42,495 --> 03:12:44,031
He's not a he's not a source

4189
03:12:44,543 --> 03:12:46,335
Easy A

4190
03:12:47,103 --> 03:12:49,151
You know some of that but whatever it is

4191
03:12:49,919 --> 03:12:50,431
Something like that

4192
03:12:53,759 --> 03:12:54,271
It's still around

4193
03:12:54,783 --> 03:12:57,343
And he has another militia buddy with him

4194
03:12:57,599 --> 03:13:00,927
And I don't really care to even remember the name of that guy

4195
03:13:02,975 --> 03:13:03,487
Virus

4196
03:13:03,743 --> 03:13:04,255
She's going to have

4197
03:13:05,023 --> 03:13:05,535
Other

4198
03:13:06,815 --> 03:13:08,351
Example

4199
03:13:08,607 --> 03:13:09,631
Crisis

4200
03:13:09,887 --> 03:13:12,703
The song I been in for the time of shutting down

4201
03:13:12,959 --> 03:13:15,263
The ability of people in Hong Kong for example

4202
03:13:15,775 --> 03:13:17,823
Protest

4203
03:13:18,335 --> 03:13:20,127
A lockdown in our country

4204
03:13:20,383 --> 03:13:20,895
.

4205
03:13:21,151 --> 03:13:23,711
The rise of these militia units for example in Virginia

4206
03:13:23,967 --> 03:13:30,111
No one's going to want to go to a mass muster of 500 guys that we just had

4207
03:13:30,367 --> 03:13:36,511
Oh no militia turnout will be down

4208
03:13:36,767 --> 03:13:39,327
Yeah we want to keep those 500 people from

4209
03:13:39,839 --> 03:13:40,351
Close to each

4210
03:13:40,607 --> 03:13:44,959
Now they're gone song

4211
03:13:45,215 --> 03:13:45,727
Women who

4212
03:13:45,983 --> 03:13:47,263
Get together and protest

4213
03:13:48,287 --> 03:13:50,079
What the government's really focusing

4214
03:13:50,847 --> 03:13:52,127
Izzo's 500 Gunn weird

4215
03:13:53,151 --> 03:13:53,663
At their big

4216
03:13:54,431 --> 03:13:54,943
So

4217
03:13:55,967 --> 03:13:57,247
Stewart doesn't like Mike

4218
03:13:57,759 --> 03:13:58,527
And you don't

4219
03:13:58,783 --> 03:14:00,575
Trust the idea that he's in charge

4220
03:14:00,831 --> 03:14:01,855
Of this Coronavirus

4221
03:14:02,111 --> 03:14:02,623
Response

4222
03:14:02,879 --> 03:14:03,391
Okay

4223
03:14:03,647 --> 03:14:04,159
Now Alex

4224
03:14:04,415 --> 03:14:05,695
Tries to defend Mike

4225
03:14:06,207 --> 03:14:06,719
That's about

4226
03:14:06,975 --> 03:14:07,999
The disco's weird

4227
03:14:15,167 --> 03:14:16,447
Grounded

4228
03:14:19,519 --> 03:14:21,055
Fully in favor of red flag

4229
03:14:21,311 --> 03:14:23,103
We use wind to send 7

4230
03:14:23,359 --> 03:14:28,479
Oh yeah

4231
03:14:32,575 --> 03:14:34,111
Is the model the whole country should follow

4232
03:14:34,623 --> 03:14:39,231
You remember a couple Clips back before I went on that Rance but I like shows abusively inconsistent

4233
03:14:39,487 --> 03:14:44,863
You were having that clip Alex said the people ask him why it says one thing 1 hour

4234
03:14:45,631 --> 03:14:47,167
Remember how we try to maintain that is

4235
03:14:47,423 --> 03:14:49,727
Consistency was Eddie's pro-gun Second Amendment

4236
03:14:49,983 --> 03:14:53,823
Like 10 minutes later he is trying to push back on Stewart Roads talking s*** about my

4237
03:14:54,079 --> 03:14:54,591
Mike Pence

4238
03:14:54,847 --> 03:14:57,919
When he's informed appearances in favor of red flag laws

4239
03:14:58,687 --> 03:15:00,479
Which two people extort and Alex are they

4240
03:15:02,527 --> 03:15:06,111
On August 28th 2019 pencil to Roundtable discussion

4241
03:15:06,367 --> 03:15:09,183
I held one in response to the Dayton and El Paso shooting

4242
03:15:09,695 --> 03:15:10,207
And Stewart

4243
03:15:10,463 --> 03:15:11,231
Is totally right

4244
03:15:11,999 --> 03:15:13,023
Mike Pence was arguing

4245
03:15:13,279 --> 03:15:13,791
But Indiana's

4246
03:15:14,047 --> 03:15:15,583
Existing red flag laws about guns

4247
03:15:15,839 --> 03:15:18,143
Remodel that the federal government could follow

4248
03:15:18,655 --> 03:15:20,959
This is a big deal in the friend's gun weirdo Circle

4249
03:15:21,471 --> 03:15:26,079
Alex's buddy Larry Pratt's group gunownersofamerica even launch 7th wheat bread

4250
03:15:26,335 --> 03:15:27,359
About the meeting saying

4251
03:15:27,615 --> 03:15:28,895
Mike Pence's again calling

4252
03:15:29,151 --> 03:15:30,687
For red flag gun grab

4253
03:15:31,199 --> 03:15:34,271
Citing that Indiana's gun confiscation law to be a model for the country

4254
03:15:34,527 --> 03:15:36,575
And in all caps

4255
03:15:36,831 --> 03:15:37,855
So they got him

4256
03:15:38,623 --> 03:15:39,647
Alex had no idea about

4257
03:15:40,415 --> 03:15:41,695
The shining example of his

4258
03:15:41,951 --> 03:15:46,047
Consistency is an issue that he knows basically nothing about except that he likes guns

4259
03:15:46,559 --> 03:15:49,119
The f****** vice-president is openly supported week

4260
03:15:49,375 --> 03:15:50,911
Considers a breach of the Second Amendment

4261
03:15:51,167 --> 03:15:52,959
And Alex's surprised to hear about it like

4262
03:15:53,215 --> 03:15:56,543
Six months after the rest of the Gunn weirdos lost their minds about it

4263
03:15:57,055 --> 03:15:58,335
How to sew reverse to work

4264
03:15:58,591 --> 03:16:00,639
Can't even handle his one Marquee issue well

4265
03:16:00,895 --> 03:16:03,967
And it shows when he's sitting here with an actually committed gun weirdo

4266
03:16:04,479 --> 03:16:06,527
What roads did The Real McCoy

4267
03:16:07,039 --> 03:16:10,111
But he actually doesn't insane person

4268
03:16:10,623 --> 03:16:16,255
And then Alex's he's even sort of role playing his gun support

4269
03:16:16,511 --> 03:16:17,279
Mike Pence

4270
03:16:17,535 --> 03:16:18,559
It wasn't

4271
03:16:18,815 --> 03:16:21,119
Look at my ignorance

4272
03:16:21,375 --> 03:16:21,887
Yeah

4273
03:16:22,143 --> 03:16:23,679
Which he is never ignorant

4274
03:16:24,191 --> 03:16:28,287
Never brag but he's never wrong or never an uninformed

4275
03:16:30,591 --> 03:16:31,103
It's fun

4276
03:16:31,359 --> 03:16:33,151
So we've decided that Mike Pence's bad

4277
03:16:33,407 --> 03:16:34,175
Evil Alex

4278
03:16:34,431 --> 03:16:40,575
With other guys

4279
03:16:40,831 --> 03:16:44,159
Now it's time to decide who should take over for pets

4280
03:16:44,671 --> 03:16:45,439
Okay we're fantasy

4281
03:16:47,743 --> 03:16:49,023
It has the feeling of them being like

4282
03:16:49,279 --> 03:16:52,351
All right who are we going to put in his place

4283
03:16:53,375 --> 03:16:57,471
Control Trump

4284
03:16:57,727 --> 03:16:58,751
And set him up

4285
03:16:59,263 --> 03:17:01,055
That's what I truly believe going to happen to him

4286
03:17:01,567 --> 03:17:05,407
He's a global as I don't care how many times you deals on the show who plays pants with

4287
03:17:06,943 --> 03:17:07,455
Question

4288
03:17:08,223 --> 03:17:09,247
We should replace a month

4289
03:17:12,831 --> 03:17:13,599
Congressman scalise

4290
03:17:15,135 --> 03:17:15,903
Jim Jordan

4291
03:17:16,159 --> 03:17:16,671
Rand Paul

4292
03:17:17,439 --> 03:17:19,743
Kansas

4293
03:17:21,535 --> 03:17:22,047
Go back

4294
03:17:22,303 --> 03:17:23,327
No the other one

4295
03:17:24,351 --> 03:17:27,167
He's the one that was attorney general is really good

4296
03:17:27,935 --> 03:17:28,447
Hurley Hurley

4297
03:17:29,983 --> 03:17:30,495
Missouri

4298
03:17:31,775 --> 03:17:32,287
No I wouldn't

4299
03:17:33,311 --> 03:17:34,335
Ohio

4300
03:17:34,591 --> 03:17:35,103
Yep

4301
03:17:35,615 --> 03:17:37,407
Patience gives me a bad feeling

4302
03:17:37,919 --> 03:17:39,455
Jim Jordan food be good

4303
03:17:39,711 --> 03:17:40,479
In my mind

4304
03:17:40,735 --> 03:17:42,527
Grandpa

4305
03:17:43,039 --> 03:17:45,087
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but Jordan is

4306
03:17:45,343 --> 03:17:51,487
Not a good guy Parts about his cover-up of the Doctor Who was sexually assaulting members of the Ohio State

4307
03:17:51,999 --> 03:17:55,327
Going to you when Jordan was the assistant coach

4308
03:17:55,583 --> 03:17:56,607
Oh well there is that

4309
03:17:56,863 --> 03:17:59,935
On February 12th The Daily Beast reported that the former

4310
03:18:00,191 --> 03:18:02,495
Team captain Adam disabato spoke before the

4311
03:18:02,751 --> 03:18:04,031
The house Civil Justice committee

4312
03:18:04,287 --> 03:18:05,311
And testified that quote

4313
03:18:05,567 --> 03:18:06,591
Jordan called him

4314
03:18:06,847 --> 03:18:07,871
Heatedly in 2018

4315
03:18:08,127 --> 03:18:09,407
After his brother Michael.

4316
03:18:09,663 --> 03:18:12,735
Sabato publicly claimed that the sexual abuse of

4317
03:18:12,991 --> 03:18:16,063
18 Doctor Richard Strauss was common knowledge to those in the wrestling

4318
03:18:16,319 --> 03:18:16,831
Program

4319
03:18:17,087 --> 03:18:17,599
Cluding Jordan

4320
03:18:18,367 --> 03:18:19,647
Adam told the committee quote

4321
03:18:19,903 --> 03:18:21,951
Jim Jordan called me crying groveling

4322
03:18:22,207 --> 03:18:23,231
Begging me to go again

4323
03:18:23,487 --> 03:18:23,999
Against my brother

4324
03:18:24,511 --> 03:18:25,535
That's the kind of cover-up

4325
03:18:25,791 --> 03:18:26,303
What's going on there

4326
03:18:27,327 --> 03:18:29,887
Investigation found that his Doctorate abused at least

4327
03:18:30,143 --> 03:18:33,727
177 kids Between 1979 and 1998

4328
03:18:34,239 --> 03:18:35,519
Air Jordan was the assistant coach

4329
03:18:36,031 --> 03:18:39,871
Between 1987 and 1995. Swear this doctor was there

4330
03:18:40,639 --> 03:18:42,943
As if things were already looking bad for Jordan

4331
03:18:43,199 --> 03:18:43,967
On March 6th

4332
03:18:44,223 --> 03:18:48,575
CNN reported are now six former OSU wrestlers who were willing to speak with them

4333
03:18:49,343 --> 03:18:49,855
And that

4334
03:18:50,111 --> 03:18:51,903
Quotes they were present when George

4335
03:18:52,159 --> 03:18:54,463
Heard or responded to sexual misconduct

4336
03:18:54,719 --> 03:18:55,231
Complained

4337
03:18:55,487 --> 03:18:56,511
About the team Doctor Richard

4338
03:18:56,767 --> 03:18:57,279
Strauss

4339
03:18:57,791 --> 03:18:58,815
According to the article 8

4340
03:18:59,071 --> 03:19:01,887
More former wrestler said that the doctors Behavior was

4341
03:19:02,143 --> 03:19:03,423
An Open Secret in the athletic

4342
03:19:04,447 --> 03:19:07,263
All this is really bad for Jim Jordan because his whole position

4343
03:19:07,519 --> 03:19:10,591
His doctor was abusing these students

4344
03:19:10,847 --> 03:19:12,127
Meanwhile

4345
03:19:14,943 --> 03:19:15,711
So cool Alex

4346
03:19:16,479 --> 03:19:19,807
That's who you're going to go to bat for the good guy just feel really good about that

4347
03:19:20,575 --> 03:19:26,463
I wonder if this sort of information is a kind of think Alex will magically become aware of if Jim Jordan ever turns on Trump

4348
03:19:26,719 --> 03:19:27,999
I wonder I wonder about that

4349
03:19:28,255 --> 03:19:29,023
Cuz I think it is

4350
03:19:31,583 --> 03:19:32,095
I just

4351
03:19:32,351 --> 03:19:32,863
Can't

4352
03:19:33,375 --> 03:19:33,887
Imagine

4353
03:19:35,167 --> 03:19:37,215
Especially with how often Alex

4354
03:19:37,471 --> 03:19:40,287
Screams about

4355
03:19:40,543 --> 03:19:44,127
Burger up how I tell her I'm the protector of the children

4356
03:19:44,383 --> 03:19:45,919
And then just all of

4357
03:19:46,431 --> 03:19:46,943
All of this

4358
03:19:47,967 --> 03:19:48,479
II

4359
03:19:49,759 --> 03:19:50,783
Jim Jones a good guy

4360
03:19:51,039 --> 03:19:52,319
Say it say it out loud

4361
03:19:54,879 --> 03:19:56,415
One last clip Year from

4362
03:19:56,671 --> 03:19:59,487
4th and it's talking about

4363
03:19:59,999 --> 03:20:00,511
To do

4364
03:20:00,767 --> 03:20:02,559
I imagined kill

4365
03:20:02,815 --> 03:20:04,351
Good Lord I Hope

4366
03:20:04,607 --> 03:20:05,631
Trump does not do this

4367
03:20:05,887 --> 03:20:09,471
What's a truly when he should stand in as the POTUS in the

4368
03:20:09,727 --> 03:20:10,239
Crisis

4369
03:20:11,007 --> 03:20:12,799
GattiTown said he must now do it

4370
03:20:13,311 --> 03:20:15,103
Almost there

4371
03:20:15,615 --> 03:20:19,711
In a constitutional matter in the way to do that is to call the militia

4372
03:20:21,503 --> 03:20:25,087
Veterans back on the border and lock it down

4373
03:20:25,343 --> 03:20:28,415
And stop all international flights

4374
03:20:28,671 --> 03:20:29,695
Kill the cartels in

4375
03:20:30,463 --> 03:20:31,999
Total exercise the power

4376
03:20:32,511 --> 03:20:34,559
Also stopped the further

4377
03:20:34,815 --> 03:20:35,839
Flying into

4378
03:20:36,095 --> 03:20:41,471
People that are infected with viruses

4379
03:20:41,983 --> 03:20:42,495
What

4380
03:20:43,775 --> 03:20:45,055
You know what he's talking about there

4381
03:20:45,567 --> 03:20:48,127
That goes back to the you can either have pillows

4382
03:20:48,383 --> 03:20:50,175
See martial law or martial law

4383
03:20:51,199 --> 03:20:51,711
I think

4384
03:20:51,967 --> 03:20:56,831
That underneath the underneath this all Alex on some level

4385
03:20:57,087 --> 03:20:57,855
Do not

4386
03:20:58,367 --> 03:20:59,647
Very open about it

4387
03:21:00,159 --> 03:21:00,927
Kind of think

4388
03:21:01,183 --> 03:21:01,951
This is an opera

4389
03:21:02,719 --> 03:21:03,231
Yeah

4390
03:21:03,999 --> 03:21:07,583
For job to enact martial law clean house

4391
03:21:08,095 --> 03:21:10,655
Arrest all this political enemies and all that

4392
03:21:10,911 --> 03:21:16,287
Secure the Republic back on Facebook for God's sake

4393
03:21:16,543 --> 03:21:17,567
So I think

4394
03:21:18,335 --> 03:21:18,847
Underneath

4395
03:21:19,103 --> 03:21:19,615
Some of this

4396
03:21:20,127 --> 03:21:22,687
Like you no matter what the narrative is even though we

4397
03:21:22,943 --> 03:21:24,991
We can see over the course of the span of a few days

4398
03:21:25,247 --> 03:21:26,271
It's shift dramatically

4399
03:21:26,527 --> 03:21:27,295
Play there's there's

4400
03:21:27,807 --> 03:21:28,319
Large

4401
03:21:29,855 --> 03:21:30,367
To what Alex

4402
03:21:30,879 --> 03:21:32,159
Maine driving point is

4403
03:21:34,463 --> 03:21:37,023
Even beneath that there's probably this

4404
03:21:37,279 --> 03:21:40,863
Underlying current of I hope Trump uses this

4405
03:21:41,119 --> 03:21:42,655
To enact martial law

4406
03:21:42,911 --> 03:21:44,959
The Trump martial law that I want

4407
03:21:45,471 --> 03:21:47,263
In order for all liberals

4408
03:21:47,775 --> 03:21:49,567
All the drag queens to BX

4409
03:21:49,823 --> 03:21:51,359
Executed or thrown in prison

4410
03:21:51,871 --> 03:21:52,639
Oh my

4411
03:21:52,895 --> 03:21:54,687
The Democratic party will be outlawed

4412
03:21:54,943 --> 03:21:56,735
All of this authoritarian rule

4413
03:21:57,247 --> 03:21:58,015
Play but it will be

4414
03:21:58,527 --> 03:22:00,575
White Christian straight male

4415
03:22:01,087 --> 03:22:02,367
Active martial law

4416
03:22:02,879 --> 03:22:05,183
I think the lot of that is underneath all of this

4417
03:22:05,439 --> 03:22:06,463
And that's why a lot of it

4418
03:22:06,719 --> 03:22:08,255
To be contradictory and shifting

4419
03:22:08,767 --> 03:22:10,047
It doesn't really matter to me

4420
03:22:10,815 --> 03:22:13,119
Yep he's just hoping the Trump polls

4421
03:22:13,375 --> 03:22:14,143
The trigger on this ship

4422
03:22:14,655 --> 03:22:20,287
Maybe when he says you know like all there's a lot of conflicting information but what I've always been about the same thing I've always been about guns

4423
03:22:20,543 --> 03:22:21,823
Jesus and all that s***

4424
03:22:22,079 --> 03:22:24,895
What we're really finding out is he's always been about whiteness

4425
03:22:25,663 --> 03:22:26,687
Just whiteness

4426
03:22:27,967 --> 03:22:28,735
Just white white face

4427
03:22:29,503 --> 03:22:32,063
So ever let's get the taste of all this out of her mouth

4428
03:22:32,319 --> 03:22:33,855
Another end of the show

4429
03:22:34,879 --> 03:22:35,903
Chimpanzees

4430
03:22:36,159 --> 03:22:36,671
Can whip

4431
03:22:37,183 --> 03:22:38,463
No problem

4432
03:22:39,487 --> 03:22:41,535
What person do you know today

4433
03:22:42,303 --> 03:22:42,815
Fair enough

4434
03:22:46,143 --> 03:22:47,423
Depression

4435
03:22:48,191 --> 03:22:52,031
Okay let's.

4436
03:22:52,287 --> 03:22:54,079
Okay they want to find out who

4437
03:22:54,335 --> 03:22:55,103
Should be vice-president

4438
03:22:55,615 --> 03:22:56,895
I want to find out who

4439
03:22:57,151 --> 03:22:57,663
Spaces

4440
03:22:57,919 --> 03:23:00,223
Do you know anyone who can rip a face

4441
03:23:00,991 --> 03:23:02,527
I mean I saw the movie face off

4442
03:23:03,039 --> 03:23:05,343
That's true

4443
03:23:05,599 --> 03:23:07,391
Although I do believe Nick Nicholas Cage

4444
03:23:07,647 --> 03:23:08,159
Good commitment

4445
03:23:09,183 --> 03:23:10,975
Probably he's a guy who's

4446
03:23:11,487 --> 03:23:15,071
How about Jason Momoa or The Rock The Rock

4447
03:23:15,327 --> 03:23:15,839

Maven kayfabe

4449
03:23:18,911 --> 03:23:21,727

Clarity of thought
