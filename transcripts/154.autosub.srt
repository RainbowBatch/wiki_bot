6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,040
Say you had never seen the show before

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
You were just

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
Walking down the

9
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,928
Mistreat suddenly you will cost

10
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,720
You yourself

11
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:38,656
What about a lot about

12
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
Who's a very nice

13
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,312
He's cool with a good time together nose

14
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
Nothing about Alex is that a positive or negative

15
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,272
And therein we find

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
Fun

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744

00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:16,288
And I'm frustrated without stressing the present

20
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:22,176
Not the show we get to this point over and over and over right now

21
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:27,552
Over and over and over again

22
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,880
Where it's like I just hate him in the present

23
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
And I can't deal with it anymore

24
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
And we are right about there

25
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:40,608
So I don't know what you're on about a three-month cycle I think I'm bipolar in terms of Alex bands is present

26
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,168

Pac-Man

28
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,568

Doubt

46
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Actually don't know if it's true but I assume it is the truth

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Injured reserve

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,384

Nothing makes me happier than

55
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,440
What

56
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
Cody Cody Rhodes wrestler in brother of gold dust

00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:28,031
Stardust

58
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,335
It was not very interesting

59
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
Of his brothers are

60
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919

61
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:40,319

The American Dream Dusty Rhodes

65
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
I don't want to hear any stories about how he

66
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,311
Terrible man because it seems very very

67
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,991
In that era

68
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
Any news about Chris Benoit

69
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391

00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
I've good news to care about his dog

71
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
Maybe I don't know

72
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,959
I might be referencing something I don't even understand

73
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
Jordans

74
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Episode

75
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
I'm sick of this s***

76
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,943
I got no time for him

77
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
Blowing hard

78
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
Forever about his

79
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
Oppression

80
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
You're doing your second tour and mam

81
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:51,999
Smithfield right now you're lost

82
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Turned on Trump

83
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
I thought I was going to get back to my wife stateside

84
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:02,495
They said no circuit back on the road 130 country

85
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
I just

86
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,127
I'm just sick of it cuz now he's doing he's back to the exact same sycophantic

87
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Trump is a great man

88
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,759
Already

89
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
It is

90
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,831
But then beyond

91
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
Issue is just the mat

92
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,439
Let down like I think we would have been a lot

93
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,047
It's it's like it's like we weren't we were at this level of just like it you nothing is

94
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
Going too far in either direction

95
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
You throw that

96
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
Movie that

97
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,215
Tremor in there and all the sudden

98
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,311
For the high we had whenever he was gone there must be an equal and opposite

99
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,223
I think part of it I have to wrestle with my

100
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,807
It's my fault it is because my brain wants a narrative

101
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,623
You know like

102
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
4 storyline

103
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
Reference like a

104
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,327
Heroes Redemption

105
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
I want there to at least be a third Act

106
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,959
You know a repeat of the second act

107
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
You know there is a crisis but not come through

108
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
There's a month there's a coming to Jesus moment

109
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,943
Where he's drunk on are telling us Donald Trump

110
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
Are we think there's going to be certainly No Redemption

111
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
When is available today

112
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
Drives me nuts

113
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,143
Oh and then the other thing is half the goddamn show with him just complaining about getting sued

114
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,239
I know that I complained about this and predicted it

115
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
Months ago where you just going to go with like

116
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
A boring angry Lenny Bruce mode

117
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
It is this like

118
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Late-career Lenny Bruce angry

119
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Talking nonsense

120
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
It's so much

121
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
I'm oppressed

122
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,743
These people are suing me are going to undo the First Amendment

123
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
It's like dude

124
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
You don't understand these are the consequences of your

125
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,007
Misguided or not

126
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
Of like you do probably deserve that

127
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:18,431
Some sort of a consequence

128
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,527
The Cal spiritual you deserve all the worst things that you could bring

129
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
Exactly

130
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
It's like

131
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
It's the stationary version of bang my head

132
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
Against the wall cuz I'm just sitting here watching this shiting like

133
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
I don't care

134
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Yeah I don't care

135
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
I don't care

136
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
I don't care

137
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,751
Ain't even tell for me to get it up for new stuff

138
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
You know like

139
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,103
We're going to get into it here in a minute but like he talks about Kanye West

140
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
I can't get excited about it

141
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,783
Let's jump into some of these clips

142
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,367
This isn't to say that the show is going to suck or anything like that we have some fun

143
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
Talk about but like

144
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Yuma

145
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
You might find me back in

146
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
2008

147
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
2009

148
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,607
For a bit

149
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:13,471
How do I get to take a little break mirroring

150
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,287
You're bitching about how boring

151
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,103
I'm sure he's feeling the same thing you got going off

152
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
On the same boring now.

153
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,479
This is a man who drives

154
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:34,207
Tomorrow's my birthday gift to myself a reminder

155
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
What is a sort of drying.

156
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
I apologize

157
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351

162
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
Decides to start off the show

163
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
Is Renaissance

164
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,015
The Renaissance

165
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,807
So not

166
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
What

167
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
OSHA

168
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,255
Jordan klepper

169
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
The house the Senate

170
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Yeah

171
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
What's a good point

172
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,671
They don't control the college's almost to a college

173
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Are globalist and socialist

174
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
Really

175
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,519
Elon Musk

176
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
Amazon Fire

177
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,871
Masquerading as leftist and neoliberal

178
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
Incontrovertible

179
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:03,551
Neoliberal

180
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
Since becoming first lady

181
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
12

182
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,007
As if Michael Obama wasn't a polarizing

183
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Do you like that

184
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
Just joking

185
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
He realize I did everybody have to

186
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,295
To be mean to me he kicked into one of his old B

187
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
Michelle being a man

188
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Just joking

189
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,207
I wanted another lawsuit

190
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,767
I understand it's the season of the Lost

191
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
And I could probably

192
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
I don't know

193
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
I think that one

194
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,191
Might have more legs than a lot of these other one

195
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,263
That could at least be something

196
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:03,967
Again it's just like Jacqueline

197
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,319
This is like Tim Allen going to an underground shelter hours like

198
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
Reason why Melania isn't on a bunch of covers

199
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
Michelle Obama

200
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,215
And here's a couple of the Reese Michelle Obama ratings Joy

201
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,263
And is it amazing

202
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Configure who is work

203
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
Hard to make the world a better place

204
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
A Milana is a

205
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:36,735
Trapped woman held inside of an ivory Tower waiting to be pushed over in the

206
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:43,135
Then she will fall and crumble before our very eyes that's an interesting Theory I can't prove that one way or the other

207
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
Spiritual truth

208
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:51,071
It turns out I know she used to be a model

209
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Relationships

210
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
Remaining

211
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,423
With a lot of the people who are in the fashion industry

212
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
Gore involved in dressing people

213
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Recovers

214
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
A magazine

215
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,311
Possible if there's some sort of

216
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
Inner workings of the fashion world but I have seen that

217
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
Speculated by

218
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
There's also the issue of

219
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:16,159
Right after the election she was into the cover of Vanity Fair

220
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
And the

221
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,511
Picture that they ended up using was of her with

222
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
The string of diamonds

223
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,119
In her treating it like it was

224
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,519
Some people to f*** off might have a little at that might be a bit of a let them eat cake

225
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
Might not be her pad

226
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,687
But whatever bad will that game

227
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
I certainly still lingers

228
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
Then beyond

229
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
Michelle Obama was

230
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
Incredibly active with a bunch of

231
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,743
Causes that she was in these magazines to help promote so she's on the cover of like women's health

232
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
And and stuff like that because

233
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,863
She is interested in talking about dietary issues

234
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,239
Melania Trump

235
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
His chosen

236
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
Cyberbully

237
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
Really doing anything though

238
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,087
Like I feel like our only goal right now is to not spend any time with Trump

239
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:22,719
At all that she has spoken of like this is an issue I want to I want to work.

240
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:29,887
Is it your doing nothing and your husband is a big old boy

241
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:35,775
If you want to start with

242
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
The big cos

243
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Starting your own

244
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,663
That's all I'm saying if you want to stop cyberbullying

245
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,991
You're getting Cyber Bullied and Bully by your husband

246
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,319
I want it I want a divorce

247
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
August 8th in Fresno

248
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,671
Oops I would love it

249
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:58,559
I think a lot of the president loses half of his divorce

250
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
Love it because of that all those I can

251
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
Public

252
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
Wheeler had none of that headache

253
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
But like I could a lot of the Goodwill in

254
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
Magazine covers

255
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Michelle Obama was on

256
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
It.

257
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Trace back to advocate

258
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,063
In things that people wanted to talk about and I don't really know if Melania is involved in all that much

259
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
The people find that interesting very interesting person to talk to and be around Michelle is

260
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
She's a boy

261
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:33,631
Brilliant woman and that's not to say I don't know you don't know that you don't know her

262
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:41,311
You don't know that I don't know that

263
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:46,943
See the blue paint their own perception

264
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,295
That's what you picked on her with her blank canvas

265
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
Outside

266
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,207
Wheeler nights

267
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
Humanities training

268
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
Teaches me that she is

269
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
Married

270
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
What would you call it

271
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Comfort

272
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,823
Sure perhaps

273
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
I'm guessing

274
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
Since you're a gentleman likes hip-hop

275
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
Yes you've been keeping up with the

276
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,063
Bears in the world of Kanye West

277
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Good God.

278
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
Real life I want his

279
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
I wanted album

280
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:39,935
He's been tweeting a lot of sort of vague pseudo-spiritual self-help

281
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,287
A lot of it is very specifically to the vi

282
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
If you spend any time and sort of like

283
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
Theosophist circles are

284
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,711
Psychology

285
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Human potential

286
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
Typa groups or anything like that you'll recognize a lot of these like these sentences that don't mean anything

287
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,463
What's a pound

288
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
Question everything was one of the

289
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,863
15

290
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,935
Go right right dancing is

291
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,983
Is only

292
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,287
The appeared that is the appearance of depth

293
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
Without doing any

294
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,687
To get there

295
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Candace Owens

296
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,039
How she think

297
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
The border into the number of time

298
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
I don't ever

299
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
Who gives a f***

300
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
I've been saying this

301
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Read a couple of

302
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
These articles that are like

303
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
Kanji

304
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Who cares

305
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,647
Is what his brain does

306
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
Irrelevant

307
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
Don't

308
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:13,375
If you don't want to give you your just supporting him

309
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Beyonce

310
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
Absolutely should have won that

311
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,007
Taylor Swift album all time

312
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
I'm so anyway here's Alexei

313
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,639
Not care about black

314
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
People so he's got two under

315
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
Agree with that

316
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Sensor for forgotten about

317
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,783
About that tho

318
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Newfound feeling

319
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
Coronado 23rd

320
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Kanye West

321
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,791
I don't like him taking those words the Kardashians

322
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Trumpet

323
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
4

324
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Activist

325
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
Braces black

326
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,223
Lewiston

327
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,367
So you just now that I see him doing this

328
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,903
Specific clip you said

329
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,999
All I knew about was the Kardashians I didn't really know anything about him

330
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,287
Intelligent

331
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
To do with the Kardashians I'm out

332
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,639
Guilt

333
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,943
You're supposedly a guy who's like

334
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
Deep into truth

335
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
And you're admitting on Ayers

336
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,575
You engaged in a game of guilt-by-association

337
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
Without knowing anything about

338
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,927
Now what so I guarantee

339
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:46,559
Also a bit like I've lived with music it's free music

340
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
He said was blood on the leaves

341
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
I hear that song

342
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,527
It just comes across like 10 Rugrats or whatever

343
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,391
Zygarde

344
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
Go fuc yourself

345
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
What's your favorite

346
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,839
Favorite album

347
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,143
How many maybe heard Jesus walks

348
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Maybe right

349
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
I don't know

350
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
I would guess probably have a

351
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
Alex only listen

352
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
Who's the music that's on brand

353
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,271
Probably just that

354
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
You could be worse

355
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
Yeah

356
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,695
Call Twitter of post

357
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,231
Like there's an article that Alec

358
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,095
The Illuminati

359
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,215
Consistently said I don't think that's very interesting as a receipt

360
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,031
Here's a clip of Alex talking about Kanye West

361
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Austin June 20th

362
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
16

363
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,639
There's a special place in hell for these people

364
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,247
Kanye West

365
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:17,184
So before we get into what he's actually going to say about Kanye West

366
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
It's really funny

367
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
Cuz right before this he was in a big rant about you too but other album got put on everybody song

368
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,264
He was pretending that everyone got charged for the album

369
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:40,480
Goddamn is Robin a million

370
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,392
Not that it was a free

371
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,928
But they didn't charge everybody

372
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
Charge anybody

373
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
Special place in hell for these people

374
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,360
Send me 25 million

375
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
Pimping

376
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,224
Overland

377
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,328
You stupid

378
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
What

379
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,992
Look into Kanye I was just watching in State University

380
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:51,392
Didn't like him course I did think he was a slave master who is selling out fellow Africans to be

381
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,024
Just because

382
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
Such a f****** idiot

383
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:08,800
This is why it's so frustrating is his Dance all day

384
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,848
But it comes back to all the time is it

385
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
It doesn't matter

386
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:17,504
No one cares Alex wants to even address the fact that

387
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
He's you know

388
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,368
I think the most important piece of it is him I never looked into it and then you say

389
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Extreme

390
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Thing against him

391
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,584
That means that you need to work harder side looking before you talk about them

392
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,144
The part about it like you said negative

393
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,192
The past

394
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,544
Easily get around that by being like the Illuminati

395
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,384
Or something like that

396
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,432
Sign

397
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,968
Fun to see it's like

398
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
The thing about

399
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,856
This and then think about the way that everybody reacts to Kanye is b*******

400
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,440
In terms of celebrity culture

401
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
So many people

402
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,792
Blow In The Wind immediately

403
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Just like

404
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:09,216
I'm like so he's an a****** now forever

405
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,776
Right

406
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
Yeah

407
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
I don't

408
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,456
It's like it's like

409
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,224
Another life

410
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,040
Pablo on me is like Alex

411
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
Complains about people

412
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
I like being involved in

413
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
Celebrity worship

414
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,904
Celebrity culture all the time

415
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,720
Because a guy said he likes

416
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
Trump or something

417
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,912
It behaved in such a way as to make it appear that he likes drops

418
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
Again I agree with you

419
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Who get this

420
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,032
Well then on the other hand I don't necessarily want to

421
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
Supported artist

422
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Two A's

423
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
A black white supremacist

424
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,456
You know if you're supporting Trump as a as I previously

425
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480
Stated at this

426
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,760
Chances are

427
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
Percent wipers

428
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,976
Now we have to our sympathizers at least at least

429
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
I don't know man

430
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
I don't know

431
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,152
Later in the episode

432
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
Listen to the show

433
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
Because

434
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
Why doesn't take anywhere good

435
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
First

436
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,904
Saw him like sort of tiptoeing back to

437
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,976
To Trump like a little scared boy

438
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
What we were

439
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,536
I think my take on it

440
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
Just get back to shiting on Hillary

441
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,656
That's what you do all the time you need to talk about Trump

442
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Just go back to that

443
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,008
He spent a large portion of the show going over speech

444
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,032
Did Hillary gave

445
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
That's going to be important later

446
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,992
But I'm talking about how Penn State

447
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,784
Is a hotbed of demon

448
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,624
Because of Jerry Sandusky

449
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,208
Sure there is a

450
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
For sure

451
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,536
But that does not mean that there is a hotbed of

452
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
They just mean

453
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,608
But there was a institutional problem

454
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
Where they did not address

455
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,680
Things

456
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Appropriately at all

457
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
Because I care too much about the

458
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,544
Football program

459
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,592
Liberal Liberal

460
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,432
If they control the speed

461
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,760
People who are trying to point out that

462
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
You hired a job

463
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,088
If by liberal you mean protecting

464
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
Natural interest

465
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,696
In the form of the football team

466
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,000
Then I would say

467
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
But

468
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:49,472
Thesaurus has multiple sources

469
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,264
Devil worship

470
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:57,408
Penn State is heavy heavy heavy heavy heavy heavy heavy devil worship

471
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
All the ties

472
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
So you so much time

473
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
And linking them to Clanton

474
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
And Hillary Clinton

475
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
Cuz

476
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Speech therapy

477
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,864
The punchline today

478
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
Comes about an hour later

479
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
I just noticed

480
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,312
This morning

481
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,640
Dot-com

482
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:39,648
Wasn't that wasn't

483
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
The final shot

484
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,472
Weather problems

485
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
Not associated with that

486
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
Journal for writers readers

487
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,832
Is an annual return on the features fiction poetry

488
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
Conversation criticism memoir

489
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,208
You stupid a******

490
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,280
You don't ever talk about it

491
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:23,168
I appreciate that at least

492
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:29,568
But that might be again a function of he knows he's getting sued all over the floor correct

493
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,384
Just like

494
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
Don't assume

495
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,504
LeQuint 15-20 minutes of your content

496
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,552
Is going to be linking Hillary

497
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
To the demon

498
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:44,928
That you see I paints date because she's giving a speech at Penn State

499
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,768
America find out what you're talkin about

500
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
It's so true

501
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Iowa

502
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
It's just

503
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,520
I just always get lost

504
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
Did not hyperbole whatever

505
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
Whatever you say

506
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
There in 10

507
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Okay

508
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
How much is that though

509
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,696
What's the lifespan of a white Christmas

510
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:24,096
Where you go to the coven once or twice a year for that

511
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:28,960
Facebook

512
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,240
But having heavy

513
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
What is that

514
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Probably drink

515
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,664
Can blood adrenochrome

516
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,392
Daily Record

517
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,232
Conversate

518
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,632
Everything we're talking about is not real

519
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
You know today

520
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,264
Gets really frustrated

521
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,736
Yeah

522
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:21,440
Let's jump it I want to see what it would be like if this made any sense I want to get in your mind

523
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
You can put all these

524
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
Pieces together

525
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,304
Well the same time ignoring

526
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Plot holes

527
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
Yeah

528
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
With this

529
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,288
I don't have to listen to it all day everyday

530
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:42,944
Melania Trump isn't on magazine covers and that is proof that the Patriots

531
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,272
Don't have any

532
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
That's not real

533
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
That works

534
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,880
Alex loves Kanye West now because you said something

535
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,672
That indicates support of trump

536
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:57,280
That's not that's not 10

537
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,352
In the past history

538
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
Vectren

539
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,592
Alex makers correct

540
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,152
GraceWorks Correctional

541
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,176
America

542
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
Real

543
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
Real

544
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Oh I just got the

545
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
The name wrong

546
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,368
Like what else is Panamera

547
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:29,536
Maybe in the future suing him

548
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,608
Light some incense

549
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
S8 note

550
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:39,520
Now that Alex is being sued about a lot of the stuff that he has been stupid about in the

551
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,568
I think it might be starting

552
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,592
You see a little bit like

553
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,384
I had to cover some of my base

554
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,992
Maybe I've got to at least bring up my narratives about what I did in

555
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
Certain

556
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:55,136
Yeah we know from covering it that he got a letter from James alefantis

557
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
Ping pong Pizza

558
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
Which was the center of

559
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
Pizzagate

560
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,512
Brouhaha

561
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,096
And Alex was threatened with a lawsuit

562
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
Apology

563
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
About it

564
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
On this episode

565
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,104
I want something I want to talk about that a little bit

566
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Pakistan DC

567
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Focus in on

568
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,928
Pizzeria

569
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
What was really going on

570
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,192
That sounds doesn't even make sense

571
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,240
That doesn't track is a like a

572
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Grammar

573
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
But

574
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,640
We've already gone over that John bowne report that Alex did

575
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,712
We already gone over him check it out

576
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,624
No it's not

577
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,208
Even further

578
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
Two more times

579
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,840
Do you think he forgave his real number 2016

580
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,448
We're one of the first troops Bragg

581
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,592
I don't know

582
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
Did I just said what is this

583
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,944
Photos of kids

584
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,552
Images of people

585
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:36,000
It it's

586
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,536
Because in November of 20

587
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
16

588
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,840
He didn't have anything

589
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:44,704
Interfere really about being sued afraid of is the internet being like you.

590
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
Cover this

591
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,752
You missed the boat

592
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,800
Much like we're experiencing

593
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,432
So you didn't want that perception to be out there so he's bracket

594
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
First to cover

595
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
Now I said

596
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,576
I said is this drug stuff but even the way he's saying that he saying

597
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,440
It is about drinking blood

598
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,256
Next Quest from

599
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
At meetings about drugs

600
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
Nah dude

601
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
Turned out blood

602
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,168
Which is worse

603
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
It's be fair Alex thinks

604
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,384
Drinking but Alex is very specifically link

605
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,200
Hbic

606
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Symbols

607
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
Pedophile stuff

608
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
To the logos

609
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
The pizza place

610
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,880
Which is one of the big Cornerstone

611
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
Of the online

612
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,720
Gerber about pizzagate

613
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
I'd like to comment

614
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,792
Pizza

00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
In Washington

616
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
I'm just like

617
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,656
I don't see how you see anything else

618
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,568
Okay that sounds pretty bad when you look at the logos

619
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,104
Law enforcement

620
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,664
Now pedophiles

621
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,224
Traffic

622
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,504

623
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,088
On businesses connect

624
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Well

625
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
You know

626
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:16,096
I don't see how anyone could get

627
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
Symbols

628
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,776
Envy logos for these businesses arbitrarily connected

629
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
John podesta did have

630
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:25,824
My God

631
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,344
Yeah I mean this is very specifically talking about

632
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,648
Pizzagate at being a part of these

633
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,744
These restaurants now. Before you before you get to the guide one more clip

634
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Where Alex

635
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
It's like you can't he

636
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,072
You can't undo this

637
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
But you can't walk

638
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Canvasback

639
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,272
I can't just say something for myself

640
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
There's there's art

641
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,952
Weather shoving

642
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
Children in the women's

643
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,216
You were talking over

644
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,264
Like saying

645
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Stop

646
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Himself

647
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,360
I'm going to go to wash

648
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,176
Did you see to these pizza places in research at like it

649
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
Bohemian Grove

650
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
We already know Bohemian Grove is him

651
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
Just doing the f****** b******* the bus

652
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
Lying about everything

653
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
But like

654
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,976
There's a kind of revelatory looking at that phrase though is

655
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,256
If you say something

656
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,280
Try and see something

657
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,096
Like it's going the wrong way

658
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
Right

659
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
Right that's a good point.

660
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,264
It's Alex Jones School of non journalism

661
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,544
Can't handle

662
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
Fit he is doing a good job

663
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,760
He was just trying to lead us on

664
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,808
What you really said is weird

665
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,856
Easiest to lead on

666
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
In the

667
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:21,792
Remember who his version of what happened with Obama's birth certificate

668
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,864
But you remember what he was like

669
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,168
They put out the version

670
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Kenya

671
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
Because they knew

672
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,312
That we couldn't resist

673
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
The idea of

674
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:40,224
Invalidating the American Miss of a black president putting reality

675
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,784
That Kenyan birth certificate was just

676
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
Cover up

677
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:49,952
Did his dad is Frank Marshall Davis a contract pornography

678
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
Where is weirdo

679
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,816
We get tretinoin are so easy to trick

680
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
Because we want things

681
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:00,960
Real so bad

682
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:07,872
I don't even know what to call this stupid people

683
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:16,832
If somebody says it's true we will believe it up media

684
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,624
Andover Andover Andover

685
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
Over again

686
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
Examples of

687
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
Just getting trick

688
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
Controlled and s***

689
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
You're not supposed to say we got tricked

690
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,840
Cuz then you review

691
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
Was Paul Joseph Watson

692
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,568
DM from a guy who told him

693
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
Bulshit

694
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
Tapes of trump

695
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,784
Come out

696
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,600
Call Joseph

697
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
To print

698
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
I told Alex and Alex

699
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,488
Did special report about how Donald Trump

700
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,024
He likes to have a good time

701
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
Like to see joke

702
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
Sometimes

703
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,632
It might save some dirty words

704
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Respond

705
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:10,080
Do some stranger fake account and then later told the Press

706
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,360
I didn't realize

707
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
Is it they were actually going to

708
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,760
Screenshots and everything

709
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
Trick a lot

710
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,088
Easy to trick their stupid people

711
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,160
Severe is an article just came out the Daily Beast

712
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
About Paul Joseph Watson

713
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,024
Haha headline of it is Paul Joseph Watson

714
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,840
Sun is going to steal Alex Jones's crackpot crown

715
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,680
Pacifica Longos yr

716
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Flout

717
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Here's the thing

718
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,848
Alex's perspective on it is

719
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,408
I think on one level kind of right

720
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Maybe

721
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,016
He's like they're trying to sow dissension in the ranks

722
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:58,208
Possibly giving away giving away your hand there Alex

723
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:02,816
The possibly like someone's motivation of like trying to build up home

724
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,840
Send to make Alex jealous

725
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,752
It's possible I don't know I don't think that the editorial position of The Daily Beast

726
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,104
Daily Beast

727
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,968
I read that article

728
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,760
And it's really interesting because

729
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,088
Daily Beast

730
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,368
Who is called the base

731
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,976
Aleister Crowley

732
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,768
Crowley was a beast on The Daily

733
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
There's no doubt

734
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
So

735
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,496
I read the article at one point

736
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,800
And most of it is very even-handed

737
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:49,152
Barry there's a there's a quotes from Alex's ex-wife

738
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,944
Talking about how Paul Joseph Watson

739
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,504
Paytakht on early on

740
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,088
What time do you think $5,000 a month is a ton

741
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,440
For writing

742
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,512
Yeah $60,000 a year

743
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,096
To get gas

744
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:11,168
He immediately was like

745
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,312
Out to put the rest of the article is like this person went to Sheffield

746
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,152
You want this this reporter went

747
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Sheffield

748
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688
I was trying to

749
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,712
Talk to people who knew him

750
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,016
And most of the actual interviews that they got from

751
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
People were like

752
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,112
Nice guy I don't know

753
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
Really boring

754
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,208
The only things they were able

755
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,744
To like really refute

756
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,584
Is that in an interview Paul Joseph Watson said that he grew up on a council

757
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,144
Allstate which is like share government housing

758
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
Absolutely

759
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,056
Now so that's the only thing that the rapper middle class

760
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,711
Like it's not a hit piece at all

761
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,503
Except for the fact that it's like

762
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
He works without

763
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,183
That's the only part of its negative

764
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:11,583
If he was a nice guy when they were growing up when he started

765
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
Cuz he does say

766
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
He knew that the story was going

767
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,495
Come out and that the reporter was asking people about him

768
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,287
And so he took to Twitter

769
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:25,151
And started revealing stuff that does not come out in the article Twitter

770
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,991
Tell Alex

771
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,551
But David Icke was the one who actually woke me up

772
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,367
As we started watching David videos

773
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,719
Reptilian worldview

774
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
Because he says that he watched

775
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
Some documentary

776
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
About alley

777
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,679
Okay if that's what made him want to get

778
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
In touch with Alex

779
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,007
And the interview Ronson about it and he's like

780
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,359
That because he's like

781
00:42:55,871 --> 00:43:02,015
I don't understand how anybody could watch that documentary and then want to go talk to Alex

782
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,551
Very clearly that he lying

783
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,135
I think he's like I don't understand

784
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
How's the Motorola watch that in

785
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,279
Paul Joseph Watson

786
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
Together

787
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:22,239
Like if you watch that documentary in your life

788
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,823
I don't know I can't

789
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
I can't understand the motivation

790
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
He's probably not a reptile

791
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
Jon Ronson on together

792
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
You ready to talk

793
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,807
Reptilian

794
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,367
Oh no

795
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
Is it Paul Joseph Watson

796
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
Coming out

797
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
He got on Twitter in and out

798
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:52,959
Probably going to come out but I got kicked out of school cuz I was drunk and high all the time

799
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
Alright

800
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,175
It did not come out the article

801
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,199
Reportage

802
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
I like

803
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:12,415
I like it whenever the subject of it is clearly in the universe

804
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,975
Reviewed by

805
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:25,215
She's going to use there's just a weirdo

806
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,199
Because Alex

807
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
Is bad about this

808
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
Daily Beast

809
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
For one thing because

810
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
Bucheli talked

811
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,415
Does not like to meet

812
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,719
Yeah it's true

813
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
The idea that

814
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,791
She was talking about the inner working

815
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:50,815
Infowars

816
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,839
Back one

817
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
She was bald

818
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,399
He's kind of mad about that

819
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,191
Is she still a part-owner though

820
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
Not anymore

821
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,799
The way the shell companies work

822
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,847
It's hard to tell like where the money

823
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,639
Cuz she was

824
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,967
As I recalled last time I was looking into the corporate structure

825
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,759
Owner of

826
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Free Speech test

827
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,063
But then there's

828
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
Branching off from that like

829
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,647
Infowars Infowars Health in

830
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
Infowars life

831
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,207
There's there's a bunch

832
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,231
Two different places

833
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,279
I don't know

834
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,559
I'm not a bit

835
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,351
Attorney I have no idea

836
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,447
Everything divorce for like 3 years

837
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Is because

838
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,775
It seems to me if you are part owner

839
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,871
Forward part owner you didn't get hit with the same and EA

840
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
So who knows

841
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
Alex

842
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,271
Because he literally

843
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,807
Control what it is she

844
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,575
You saying

845
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
She doesn't have the

846
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,647
The same ndaa that so many of his former

847
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,695
Employees have been apart of

848
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,791
The divorce a word spitballing

849
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,119
Constructive for us to

850
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,679
Gas oven

851
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,495
It's possible that like a condition of alimony

852
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
Something like that

853
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
Cuz you don't

854
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823
Reveal inside information

855
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,383
So I don't know

856
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,967
That's what I'm saying I don't know

857
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
I don't know I don't know any

858
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
That's what I'm saying

859
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,343
And I don't want to be like Alex talking about Kanye West

860
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,927
Open 2016 make stuff up

861
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,535
They'll be starting with the Kardashians

862
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,095
The Daily Beast article

863
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,631
Super pissed off

864
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
About it

865
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,959
Crowley but then there's another reason

866
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,543
I'm looking for men better than me

867
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:41,663
I'm looking for women looking for people

868
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,063
Lightbody Craigslist classified ad

869
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
No credit

870
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:56,255
Knuckledraggin

871
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,631
I called his government's listen intelligence agencies

872
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,447
Oratory

873
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Just a fact

874
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,431
Joy

875
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:19,551
Manipulation

876
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,647
You just started

877
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,463
I

878
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,231
You ain't doing that

879
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,023
David after that but it was really boring

880
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,935
The article didn't compliment

881
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
This article about

882
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,287
Someone else right

883
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:46,687
Say great things about you if you are going to do an article about Paul Joseph Watson eventually taking over

884
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Alex Jones

885
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,111
Spend the first I was a 3/4 of it

886
00:47:54,367 --> 00:48:00,511
For discovering the man who was the plaintiff

887
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
Right here

888
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
Story

889
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,423
Man after God's Own Heart discovered

890
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
Probably

891
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,799
Tremendously Patty

892
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,847
Yeah like this is this is next

893
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,919
Level

894
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
Finding Owen

895
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:25,343
We know how we found Owen Shroyer

896
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,975
Hayden's not great

897
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,743
Right

898
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:36,863
The next

899
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,399
In Shroyer

900
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,423
Stupid

901
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
Stupid f******

902
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,215
Compatible

903
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,799
What's going on on this

904
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
How about that

905
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,615
You didn't talk about that

906
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,455
When car drives on the wrong side of the road

907
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:55,807
He's going to cry

908
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
Coco Baby

909
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,415
French

910
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,951
He smells too nice

911
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,279
But at least he is sort of understanding his own impulses

912
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,559
And that is that like

913
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,887
You rightly criticised

914
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,703
The Daily Beast

915
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,519
Alex Jones brain work

916
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,103
Trying to make that happen

917
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
In recognition of

918
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,199
That is what I would think

919
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,439
A+ about supporting

920
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,255
Is negative against me which is

921
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,839
Holyshit

922
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,119
It's not a terrible

923
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,703
Because clearly Alex only hires people who aren't

924
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,079
Shoot for the crown

925
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,359
I don't think he has a choice

926
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
So speaking of income

927
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,247
2B other lunatics

928
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Alex

929
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,575
Speaking of another lunatic

930
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,159
We covered

931
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,695
Zach

932
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,975
Intelligence source

933
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:11,839
I picked him up and then he had to go to Morocco

934
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,863
Right

935
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,495
To the audience

936
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:22,335
Alex Morocco to get out of the states

937
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
Because it was too hot

938
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,455
Interviewed Zach from Morocco he's like

939
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,503
Very weird

940
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,855
A man's accent said about your crazy

941
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,135
Alexa dementia

942
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,439
Crazy b******* about how they were shooting from

943
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,231
Can helicopters in Las Vegas

944
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:45,887
This is a war for Mars between America

945
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:52,287
Ice Cube I believe when Alex was talking about him

946
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:58,687
He thought that HR McMaster ministration though he'd been fired at least a week or two previous right

947
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,711
The bunch of indication

948
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,991
This guy is not

949
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,575
Legit I believe he's actually running a hardware store

950
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,367
Probably not

951
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,927
So on this episode on the 23rd

952
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,743
They do it again

953
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:18,399
I don't know how else to put it they just do it again

954
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:26,335
Now play the audio side-by-side overlay the

955
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:30,943
Go to see if they break and come to much of a character that Alex

956
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,271
Who's playing it out in real time

957
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:37,599
Abu Dhabi

958
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
I am.

959
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:43,231
He already texted me and security

960
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,119
Cell phone

961
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,471
I will try and get them on the phone

962
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,775
Alex says he's based out of Florida

963
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,335
He's Baytown Florida that's doesn't make sense either

964
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,871
No none of it makes sense

965
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,151
Nothing nothing to make

966
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,991
Sense but I believe I believe video of command is in Florida

967
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,831
Colorado Colorado Springs

968
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,415
Get the fuel from Zach that he is in

969
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,439
Very

970
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,487
Very independent

971
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
Improv troupe

972
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,559
He's just trying to get by

973
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,119
For the last time he was on that we listen

974
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,447
He had to finish the the interviews like

975
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:29,311
I got to drop my lunch break

976
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,711
This is been good warm-up fabricate your audience

977
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,063
He's doing vocal exercises on the show

978
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
Might as well be

979
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:47,231
But red leather yellow leather that's red

980
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:51,071
Play any of him

981
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,119
It's not

982
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:58,239
If it's something like really really fun we play it but it's

983
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,287
I'm so much like I'm very very

984
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
Convince

985
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
30 tall

986
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:05,663
And I don't care messy release play boring not real

987
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,687
On the Shelf

988
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,991
So there's no actual clips of him

989
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,271
But the context

990
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,551
David all is really funny

991
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,647
Zach is allegedly being held

992
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:19,231
It's in Francisco Airport

993
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,511
Who want to look through

994
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
His phone

995
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,327
External hard drive

996
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,375
Still able to text Alex Jones

997
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,399
And tell him

998
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,447
Montague

999
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,983
You get one text to get wolf bow

1000
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,055
The premise was that you supposed to be on in the third hour

1001
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,615
He was going to have an interview and called in the third hours

1002
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
Finality

1003
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,199
Detained by

1004
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,991
Insecurities

1005
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,087
He might not be able to make that interview but then he gets out

1006
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:48,927
From my homeland security impound

1007
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
Or whatever

1008
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:52,511
And it's somehow able to call Alex Jones

1009
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
Coup

1010
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,655
Apparently why they held him is because he keeps talking to Alex Jones

1011
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:05,055
Which rice immediately afterwards though he is

1012
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:11,199
Rights calling in the bird

1013
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:13,503
He's now on the phone with Alex

1014
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:17,087
Hey look I got to go I'm going to I got to get on this flight

1015
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,879
You would have been on the flight

1016
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,207
During the third hour interview if you hadn't gotten

1017
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:25,791
What are you talkin about

1018
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,143
No matter what happened

1019
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:34,751
Whether he got stopped by Homeland Security or not

1020
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:40,639
The plane during the third hour when Alex was supposed to be interview again

1021
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,735
Understanding his timeline correctly

1022
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:50,623
Flagged by Homeland Security picture of Most Wanted

1023
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:54,463
Early 1800s Wild West

1024
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,743
Bring in

1025
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,559
We got to take a look at your funk but you sir

1026
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,351
You are a government agent

1027
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,887
You know the law

1028
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
Your phone and we can't get in there

1029
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,471
The FBI

1030
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:09,311
The FBI is only 50 minutes away

1031
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,335
Always always

1032
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,919
Gmail

1033
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,455
50 suits with the fur

1034
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:21,599
They try and unlock the phone they can't hours

1035
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:28,255
Surprisingly enough good thing.

1036
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
Good thing

1037
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,375
Got there 3 hours early the FBI

1038
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:37,983
Recognizes that he is a flat and then says

1039
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,031
And you know what we can't get it

1040
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,335
Get on it back

1041
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,151
I don't know how the inner work

1042
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,431
Intelligence

1043
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,623
We're concerned you were giving privileged information

1044
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,415
Into a blowhard talk show host

1045
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
Right

1046
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,231
They probably wouldn't let you text

1047
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,655
Play Homeland Security and the FBI

1048
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,679
It seems like

1049
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,215
That would only be

1050
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:13,055
Something that occurs to

1051
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
Look

1052
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,687
We hate to do this we under

1053
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,991
Need to bring in the back row

1054
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,807
We got it we got to call the FBI

1055
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
You're clearly a

1056
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,879
You're above our pay grade

1057
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,159
Any likes

1058
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,207
Okay cool can I get my phone to text

1059
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:34,303
Whomever I want with no oversight whatsoever

1060
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,839
Yeah

1061
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
I get the most

1062
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,935
It is pretty incompetent

1063
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,751
This just seems like a fantasy

1064
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,799
Open Audible

1065
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:49,919
Kerry Cassidy this is like a story being played out in real time

1066
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,199
Huh

1067
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,735
Have you ever seen the movie Red

1068
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:57,599
There's one more thing I want to bring up before we get to it one more clip left

1069
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:03,231
And that is it Alex's

1070
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,767
Screaming about an hour

1071
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,583
Mind control everybody

1072
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,375
From

1073
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,399
From

1074
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,423
Black cell phone towers

1075
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,727
I need like

1076
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,007
PopularMMOs

1077
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,895
And so I look for that I look that up I look that up

1078
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,943
Groundbreaking articles

1079
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,479
Popular Mechanics

1080
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,039
For real article from the 19th

1081
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,647
Curtis Bolton

1082
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,951
Is the name of the journalist

1083
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
About likewise

1084
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,255
Supremacist groups

1085
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,791
Federal law enforcement

1086
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
Right

1087
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,351
Either

1088
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
Uncontrolled response

1089
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,423
Accidentally contained

1090
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,447
Zip file

1091
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,239
That was called emfa

1092
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,519
Song the human body

1093
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,335
What

1094
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,895
Attached

1095
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,599
The same time what happened

1096
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:05,695
I have no idea but

1097
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
Images of this

1098
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:10,815
Supposedly

1099
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,095
Depicting

1100
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:12,863
Psycho elect

1101
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:13,887
Weapons

1102
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
These are not can

1103
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
In terms of

1104
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Viability

1105
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,615
Viabill

1106
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,663
Also just

1107
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:29,759
It seems like these are either ideas or they are files

1108
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,551
About someone else's ideas

1109
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,623
Like as a write-up or something like that

1110
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,671
And even this article

1111
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,767
Federal government has absolutely experimented with mine

1112
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,047
Control in a variety of method

1113
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,351
But the documents here do not appear to be official

1114
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:48,703
Even though

1115
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,519
Even the PlayStation Alex's making is like

1116
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,103
It's probably just something we got put on there accidentally

1117
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,383
Could be

1118
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,223
In order to

1119
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:03,807
Limited Hangout

1120
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,343
Seriously

1121
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,671
And of course if you have Mike

1122
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,207
Control you could just make them not take

1123
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,231
Seriously

1124
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
That also

1125
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,559
I feel like the moment you have mine

1126
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,095
Control over cell towers

1127
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,119
It's already over

1128
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,239
Since I can control your mind everybody

1129
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,263
Cell phone

1130
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,103
Oh okay we could go over

1131
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,127
Coverage map

1132
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,199
What are we talkin about if they had Mike

1133
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,479
Control over cell towers

1134
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:37,343
I mean we could go over we could go over some of this stuff that like what they this

1135
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,463
The images claim that UK will do to you literally everything

1136
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
What do you got

1137
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,023
Forced orgasm

1138
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:50,399
On your foot

1139
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,335
This is Cal backpack

1140
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:03,455
Reading and broadcasting thoughts

1141
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,111
Controlled dreams

1142
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,135
Rubber baby buggy

1143
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,695
Artificial

1144
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,511
Not organic

1145
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,559
Artificial tinnitus

1146
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,887
Is there just playing a high-pitched

1147
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:28,543
Without cause I would

1148
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:35,967
What do you mean without cause

1149
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:40,831
I don't know what this means and there's a weird star next to microwave

1150
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,767
There's also this one's and quotes

1151
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,559
Maybe this one's in quotes

1152
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,471
Paradise

1153
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,383
Okay

1154
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
Figure eyes are closed

1155
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,247
Forced caffeine fetal

1156
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,551
I don't know what that means

1157
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
Whatever

1158
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,743
I'm not super charm

1159
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:24,607
I want all of those to be real

1160
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:28,447
Microwave

1161
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:33,311
Is the most terrifying power a government can have

1162
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,591
We've all experienced

1163
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,639
Difficult to reach

1164
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,735
I believe the show

1165
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,527
Throughout I've expressed that I'm sick of Alex

1166
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,295
This is bulshit

1167
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,343
And most of it does have to do with

1168
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,879
You lack of story progression

1169
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,159
And the hard-to-reach a

1170
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,183
That you had for the

1171
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,487
Holidays

1172
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:55,583
Yeah for sure.

1173
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
So probably stop

1174
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,631
The middle here in there

1175
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,191
But his last clip Alex

1176
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,983
Is discussing his blow up

1177
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,775
That Friday

1178
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,591
Last Friday

1179
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,359
He had

1180
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,383
Look up a problem

1181
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,223
Timeline doesn't work out

1182
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,527
He seems to be calling booze food

1183
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,391
It's just your standard Alex Jones

1184
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,415
Cowering out

1185
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,231
About something big

1186
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
Because he knows like

1187
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,791
Through with turning on

1188
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
Maddie

1189
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:33,727
Days ago. Last Friday before last because

1190
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,263
Emotional

1191
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:41,407
Email

1192
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
That's not true

1193
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,087
So I

1194
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,903
6:30

1195
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,559
Watch old movie or something

1196
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:05,215
F*** you

1197
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,007
F*** you

1198
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,847
F*** you so really what this is is a react

1199
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,871
Listen to the death

1200
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
No

1201
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
F*** you

1202
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,991
Not what you were watching

1203
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,111
Seattle

1204
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,951
What's the most wholesome thing I can come up with Old Yeller

1205
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:31,071
Old Yeller

1206
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,607
Old Yeller

1207
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:40,799
I'm a good dad

1208
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,151
My daughters are sitting there in my lap everything

1209
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,991
I don't know bathroom

1210
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,527
And

1211
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,839
Looking at the phone

1212
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:06,143
Already

1213
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,423
Family is

01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,239
Marshall from

1215
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
The 19th

1216
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,567
It's not Alex Jones's family

1217
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
April

1218
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,895
Business

1219
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:23,295
This is ludicrous the only simulator

1220
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,239
Sorry I'm sorry that was a solid move that's

1221
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,055
Jordan Bordeaux

1222
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,455
Cedar Lake

1224
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:07,583
Pittsfield

1225
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:13,983
No problem

1226
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,335
I was in the bathroom taking a look at my phone

1227
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,615
Your phone

1228
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
Use one of these

1229
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,271
Dirty socks

1230
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039

01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,087
Clean the wine off my keyboard

1232
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
Georgia

1233
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:37,023
Repairs to my laptop

1234
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
Paper towels

1235
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,447
I'm sorry I'm sorry I lost it all

1236
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,775
I see Trump

1237
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:58,783
Go to my dad's house

1238
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:05,951
That's his way of like trying to get around

1239
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,255
He wasn't going to

1240
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,815
Studio-x and all of the

1241
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
People to go to this.

1242
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,375
It was on the way

1243
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,959
That's his way of trying to

1244
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,727
To get around

1245
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:22,335
Is ex-wife criticism that he was drunk driving with his son in the

1246
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,615
Yeah I know he was doing

1247
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,223
I got MI

1248
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,015
IDrive

1249
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,751
Before our lives

1250
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,551
Thumbs up

1251
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,599
Venting

1252
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,207
So there's that

Start again in play start it

01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:32,479
Real bad that are bad this looks pretty.

1257
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,783
Interested to know

1258
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,063
Furious man right now

1259
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,647
Fascinated by the idea of being on Rob Deuce basketball team

1260
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,183
Thrice probably kids

1261
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,999
Good 90s

1262
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,047
I don't think I don't know man baby

1263
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
Abdu is probably like

1264
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,631
As a person

1265
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:58,079
Speculative we have speculated that he is perhaps the Puppet Master behind

1266
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,895
Lexus conspiratorial in

1267
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,967
Like a version of Illuminati

1268
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:09,599
Yeah that's not true

1269
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:13,183
Brian just also happens to work 4 a.m.

1270
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,487
Vicious white nationalist propaganda

1271
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:30,079
I forgot to eat better

1272
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,527
This is what we're really doing

1273
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,319
Control most

1274
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,855
The emotion got to me

1275
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,671
Emotional

1276
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,687
If you're talking about

1277
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:10,783
Your presentation what you did

1278
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
Al Green

1279
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,831
Aubrey

1280
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
Is not fake

1281
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,415
Top-level analysis

1282
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:17,951
That is

1283
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,743
Is a moment of insight

1284
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,511
So where you at

1285
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,119

01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,935
This satisfies off Mikey

1288
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
Curiosity

1289
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,775
You got you got the full spectrum everything make sense

1290
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,543
I accept

1291
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,567
This as

1292
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,407
Let's meet up

1293
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:40,991
2 hours before the show I was sitting around with

01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:44,319
My wife and my loving family

1295
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:47,903
Wanted

1296
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:54,303
Syria was a false flag and I took a piss and looked at my phone

1297
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,839
Trump is bombing

1298
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:02,239
Emotional

1299
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:07,103
How about Rob duvi

1300

Then I got on here for three hours and then I just kept eating cuz I kept getting more emotional like I mean

01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:20,159
Food just really hungry have you seen those commercials

That I was really full

1304
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:35,519
The crying on Aaron saying the Trump show

1305
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:39,871
Call Ben

1306
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,175
You know you have a

6 over 71 a salad you have a salad

1310
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:55,231
All the sudden you want to tell people that Isis is the world supposed to end

1311
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,511
Today wasn't that one of those

1312
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,583
Good Times

01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,663
Looking for men.

1316
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:16,991
Oh no

1317
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,319
The show

1318
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:23,391
Has affected my

1319
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:28,511
My laptop is no good

1320
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,815
What happened

1321
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:37,215
Is this not recording anymore

1322
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,007
Doesn't work

1323
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,543
No

1324
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:46,943
So it's still recording but I don't know if I can stop it from recording

1325
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,503
Or if I can say

1326
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:54,879
Because now the iTunes I have control

01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,927
Wow that was weird

1328
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
Itself

1329
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,047
If there's a layer of moisture on top of it sometimes

1330
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:02,815
The signal won't go

1331
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,375
All right so I'm going to jump back to this clip

1332
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,423
Alright

1333
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,503
And Sunday morning

1334
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,647
Live feed cameras

1335
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,399
Understory is Jose taking us

1336
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:42,239
You know what you really want

1337
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,591
Because that wasn't ready to go live

1338
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,927
I just screwed up

1339
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,975
Boardman

1340
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:18,079
F*** your feelings

1341
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,359
F*** your feelings

1342
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:23,711
Correctly

1343
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,783
Main issue

1344
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,319
Trump

1345
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,391
Striking Syria

1346
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,415
With better

1347
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:35,231
Feelings

1348
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,303
Literally nothing about that in that entire four minutes

1349
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:41,631
Nothing about the principle of nothing about like

1350
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,935
I'm still super against this

1351
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:50,591
A piss me off

1352
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
You don't add

1353
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,687
A million details that are not important to the

1354
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:59,039
The story you know how that always works out when you're lying you're always like

1355
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,599
The point in America

1356
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,623
The story across

1357
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,767
And ramble for 4 minutes creating a dollar

1358
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,447
4 minutes

1359
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,727
Is interior

1360
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,311
To shut it off

1361
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,359
Shut off the show

1362
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,407
I'm so sick of this b*******

1363
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:28,223
Just own it that you are mad at Trump about the

1364
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,783
You still should be

1365
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,343
Even if you support him on all of his other

1366
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:36,159
Positions you should still have the balls to be like

1367
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
Perfect

1368
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:41,535
Things that I said because

1369
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,327
Came from a place of me being

1370
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,863
Very anti-war

1371
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,887
I don't want to

1372
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,679
To trigger things and make things even worse

1373
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:52,287
You can spoil you have to stay still giving the good outweighs the bad

1374
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:57,151
You could you could get around V embarrassing stuff

1375
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,711
Crying on air

1376
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,503
I gave up everything for Trump

1377
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:07,135
You could get around that by doing the emotional I mean I still do by the

1378
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,415
I ate a meal

1379
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,207
Argument

1380
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:15,583
Sure

1381
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,887
Custody hearing was he had a big bowl

1382
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:23,775
Chili that'll happen

1383
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:27,103
I just I mean like you could get around the embarrassing

1384
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,895
Stop with your stupid excuses

1385
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,663
You could do that

1386
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,967
But then you wouldn't have to like

1387
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,527
That three-hour presentation

1388
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,319
So stupid

1389
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087
I'm so embarrassed

1390
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,623
But it does

1391
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,647
Have to be now

1392
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,671
For him

1393
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,207
You could still

1394
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,511
This is the third Act

1395
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
Could exist

1396
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,303
That we could

1397
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,327
Still be like

1398
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,143
Maybe engaged with

1399
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,703
He brings nuance

1400
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
To his

1401
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,263
A situation where is like

1402
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,311
I do still have those

1403
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,591
Principles that I believe in

1404
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,615
I don't

1405
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,639
Truss Trump

1406
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,663
Implicitly

1407
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,967
I don't want to just scream buddies great man

1408
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,015
Kanye West

1409
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:10,111
Indicating that he's coming this direction or whatever

1410
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,135
Doesn't

1411
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,671
Not enough for me to

1412
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:16,255
Go back on everything I've said about him over the years

1413
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:18,815
Did there is a version of it that could like

1414
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,863
It could be interesting and

1415
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,143
This is not interesting

1416
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,447
You say the word nuance

1417
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,215
In Alex's

1418
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,495
Presents he starts barking

1419
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,175
YouTube

1420
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,735
Unless he's

1421
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,271
All of his dogs

1422
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
But he's ever meant

1423
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:43,391
I don't know if he's ever seen a healthy dogs

1424
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:46,975
That's probably true

1425
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,791
April 20

1426
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,815
Third

1427
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,631
Absolutely

1428
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,215
We make it through

1429
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,751
Yeah

1430
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:08,223
I literally I enjoy ding

1431
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,503
Full-back these like

1432
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:12,575
Clips of him like we are Kanye's pretty cool I like his music

1433
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,879
The song called

1434
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,439
You shouldn't like that

1435
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,975
Thought you said he was a

1436
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,255
Slave master in 20

1437
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,023
16

1438
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,607
I like being able to point out this pizza

1439
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,631
Stop by

1440
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,655
It's just

1441
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,447
It's not the

1442
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:33,567
Kind of like that is that was all our show was I don't think that would be an echo.

1443
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,103
Chamber

1444
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:39,711
To be more and he's not giving us more in the present

1445
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,759
We talked about this before we got on air

1446
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,039
And this is

1447
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:43,807
Mostly.

1448
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,623
Mostly doing distraction

1449
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,391
S*** right now

1450
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,927
And it's just not

1451
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,207
As much as it

1452
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,231
Attention-grabbing

1453
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,279
Headline-grabbing with

1454
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,559
Send all the b*******

1455
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,119
It doesn't doesn't get my dick hard

1456
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,167
So

1457
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,215
I wish I would have

1458
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,751
Very much appreciated

1459
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,031
Far more

1460
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:04,799
Indep

1461
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:06,847
About you

1462
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,639
Is a variant

1463
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:17,087
I love his version of it I don't have that conversation but I thought

1464
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:21,695
I want him and Owen Shroyer to really get into Kanye's catalog

1465
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,487
Delightful

1466
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:28,351
Just put on that Ludacris Move b****.

1467
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399

Mulatto

How to repost a man I was probably written at least

Tanner 11,000 words about

1489

01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,535
I might

1495
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:07,679
Underscore fight

1496
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:12,287
Yeah

1497
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,336
Where in Austin

1498
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:18,432
We are going to if we do this every show it's going to be a lot

1499
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,456
Between now and

1500
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:28,672
Late May supposed to keep reminding until people until

1501
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,000
Let's see if that works

1502
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,864
I think it's on YouTube

1503
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,448
Have you say Kanye West I will murder

1504
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
I don't care

1505
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
I mean

1506
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,432
Here's what

1507
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,968
This is what I'm talkin about

1508
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,016
I can't get it up for any of it

1509
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,880
You don't know what I mean but like

1510
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,928
Who do we have

1511
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,464
In our periphery from this

1512
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:05,792
We got

1513
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
Alex

1514
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,584
