We work around and talk about Alex Jones

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,688
All the time

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,760
I think we talked about others

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,112
Literally everybody Alex Jones

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,512
The three of us the only thing we all agree on we talk about Alex Jones way too much

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
A really really knowledgeable conversation

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,848
Charlie Rose

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
Do you know very little about

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,184
Yeah that a new wrinkle to it I've studied up on you

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,464
Absolutely

13
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,472
Cuz I'm not I don't have any more Freedom Day

00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Real quick

15
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,336
Weird experience on a Avenue last day in office

16
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
Husband isn't like a real go f*** yourself my life there's been a lot of like you need to

17
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,552
To get out of here kind of last days or last days are unlike

18
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
F*** this

19
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
S***

20
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
The like

21
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,648
It's hard to time

22
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
Leaving

23
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
On your last day

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,864
I leave at 4:30 or do I was going to leave at 3:30 doctor's appointment

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,656
I timed it perfectly

26
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
Like I knew the bus

27
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
I was going to come into play

28
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
And so like I had to figure out

29
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
Alright I got to go I got to say goodbye to

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Just about everybody

31
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,504
Cuz a lot of people would probably feel like I was a dick

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,296
If I didn't

33
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,320
People there

34
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
You're gone you'll never see any of them again now you go in with a respectful handshake has been a pleasure working with you

35
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,608
I'll tell you what I'm not leaked any

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,008
I don't think we can turn that to a verb and it said like

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
The tertiary goodbye

38
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104
People in the warehouse

39
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
Work and then I was like

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Send a group

41
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,808
Email clicked on the bus tracker

42
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Oh no

43
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,720
We got 20 minutes.

44
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,072
I'm sitting in the office just drinking a beer cuz the people

45
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,312
8 to 10 minutes

46
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
Bright and then like I staring off into the middle distance drinking a beer by yourself

47
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,040
Of course I've been what's that time is open

48
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
I get up my

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
Y'all

50
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,512
What by what

51
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,328
That's what I say yours until the bus was coming

52
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
If he'll ever

53
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,960
My goal has been one day I'm there and then the next day people go

54
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
Is somebody missing and that's it

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,896
Irish goodbye

56
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:34,272
About having gone through the right of passage

57
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,600

00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368

62
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,032

71
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:30,591
Maybe it is a para 309

72
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:40,319
Anyway this one is for the

73
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,719

00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
Unspecified on our patreon poke

79
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
They are too generous

80
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Really appreciate it

81
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
Decided to create a new level for them people who fall into this category

82
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,143
And I'd like to give another one to now that we have a

83
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
Specific label for it

84
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,983
I'm excited to hear this I have not heard

85
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
Maria and John Cena

86
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:38,687
We thank you so much you're very generous and we appreciate your help and I keeping the show float I was thinking about it

87
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
A policy wonk

88
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
We've got foreign policy

89
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,855
Protocols of Zion walk

90
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:52,511
But that's just a specific title that he has for himself but I was figuring

91
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
What is

92
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Be like

93
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,351
Supreme title that we could give somebody

94
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
I decided

95
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,959
Maria and Johnson are officially globulin

96
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
Don't get mad until you're brilliant someone sodomites

97
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,927
You went for it on that murderer

98
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
Put something

99
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,679
Foreign policy wonk or globalist

100
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,263
You can do so by going to our website knowledge buy.com

101
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Before the show

102
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,919
It is increasingly important as I now do not have a job and I just realized today we are 65% of the way

103
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
Towards you and I having to do a drunk commentary on The Obama Deception

104
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:57,279
Just a chip in a little bit if we can do our drunk commentary

105
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,583
And see if they would hope that other website

106
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
Get Mike Nelson to come over

107
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679

00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Dial prison

109
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Planets

110
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
State Farm

111
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
Jordan

112
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
Today we are fulfilling a special request

113
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
If one of our very special policy

114
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
Out there

115
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
Insisted

116
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
That we

00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,415

00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439

Twitter

120
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:33,631
I think Alan Thicke would probably hide behind his Robin Thicke

121
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Island

122
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
I don't know names are we don't know name going today

123
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
I won't be here in a minute

124
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,823
No course when you have your research and have your fine

125
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
Now the problem is I started drink

126
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Start a drink

127
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
Coffee again today that's the problem

128
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Coffee

129
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
Yeah there was a

130
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,135
The timer you didn't drink coffee while I worked at a coffee

131
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Distribution Center

132
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
I drink a pot of coffee everyday

133
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
To say that I was on a long

134
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
Energy drink

135
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,935
That's too long now that I'm 33 years old

136
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
Anyway come back

137
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Allen

138
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,943
That's how we go

139
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Yes take a little trip

140
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,783
Time travel episode

141
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,623
He is requested that we go to May 2nd

142
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
2012

143
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,719
City Auto request we do the longest

144
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,279
Preamble we've ever done I think we've done longer

145
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Frankly

146
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Bear so

147
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
I'm sure we've gotten up to the 25-minute mark

148
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
Undoubtedly

149
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
There is a

150
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
The reason that I understand that

151
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Suggested this

152
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Is it time to go back to

153
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
Is that

154
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
It was we wanted to see

155
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
What the spin would be

156
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
Of the

157
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
Osama bin Laden

158
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,903
Burial at Sea

159
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,975
Yes that was me that was

160
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Unequivocal

161
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Play Happy

162
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,095
This is the only good thing Obama's ever done

163
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,143
To make up a different reason for Wyatt have

164
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,447
Right or say didn't happen at all

165
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
2011

166
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
This is actually the anniversary

167
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
Osama bin Laden

168
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,175
And killed year later

169
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,783
He's going to have the same narrative

170
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,695
Just to be sure I went back and listened to the 2011 episode on March 3rd

171
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,791
Sarah mazur excuse me and it's not worth going over

172
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
It's not that interesting

173
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
5

174
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Accidentally

175
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
The 3rd of May

176
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
2012

177
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
Gives us anime

178
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Amazing glimpse

179
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
Into what

180
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
Kind of propaganda Alex Jones

181
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,943
Back in 2012.

182
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
Lakers even in 2015

183
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Thought your investigation

184
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
Henry sound like

185
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Particular

186
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
Style of thing

187
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
There's still all this s***

188
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Really

189
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,703
All that active in 2012 so it's fun to go back because

190
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Basically

191
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Videos of Haley Busch

192
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
Not black enough

193
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:31,295
Ozark

194
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575

196
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463

197
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,607
2012 transmission

198
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Your house

199
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
I'm really trying to get more your call but it always so informative

200
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Sources

201
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
Also spoilers

202
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Does not show up

203
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575

204
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
Alright

205
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Military

206
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,791
Hours for Pacific Lee Afghan

207
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
Because I can't tell you how many emails come in

208
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,423
To be honest with you I don't have any mail

209
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Right

210
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:25,311
Gmail email

211
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
I don't know how to do it

212
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
How does the Drudge Report

213
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,479
Probably get some five times the traffic

214
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
How do they do it

215
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,623
How do they do it

216
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Middle River

217
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
On my phone and I use

218
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,607
I am to the crew

219
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:56,031
So you sound like a weird old man in the woods

220
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
EBay

221
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,151
But I think he's had one for a really long

222
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,735
I think he's I think he's he's really expressing his I don't know how

223
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
I don't really I don't I can't say I know

224
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
But this is an uninspired

225
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
This is

226
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
I want to talk to

227
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:20,095
Two army veterans from a reinforced my narrative but at the same time

228
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,191
I'm just going to tiptoe into this episode I'm not I'm not really feeling it

229
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
We'll see how this change

230
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,799
Over the course of time

231
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,127
A little bit

232
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
Here's what happens immediately after that last

233
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Digressing

234
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
Michelle Goodwin reason is bad

235
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,903
Sending me emails

236
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
Hundreds of emails

237
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:55,167
The night even talkin about troops in Afghanistan

238
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,239
None of the bottom Bin Laden killing

239
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:05,407
Helicopter

240
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,551
The Martin killing

241
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
What is the Easter bunny I don't know why

242
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
Continuing are

243
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,191
Ridiculous

244
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,031
Ridiculous in the Easter Bunny

245
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,919
Easter Bunny and Santa Claus in

246
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,415
No it's the other way around the reservation

247
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
So he's

248
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,255
You are completely off the reservation

249
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
Belated weird discussion of

250
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:00,191
Disbelieve ability regarding

251
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,263
He later is like I'm going to Comedy mood as well

252
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
It's just like

253
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
UA like

254
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
He has no foothold here

255
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Please just

256
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,991
You sort of Meandering like you said you was off the reservation

257
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
He's Rambo

258
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:22,975
Former and current Navy SEAL

259
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,303
Screen Actors Guild

260
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
I never even called the guys number

261
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,263
That's my problem

262
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,359
I'm just going into Maine directions remembered that ball

263
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,199
Now it's got to the point of all I think about it

264
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,807
It's just it now

265
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:54,463
Your son was around all the information

266
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
You are as well

267
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,375
I think this is your children

268
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,775
There's a pretty substantial difference

269
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
Between your kids and working

270
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
Can't access

271
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
Fighting is a globalist

272
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,783
Is there an item on the checklist

273
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Garbage out

274
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
But in a way that fights the globalist

275
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,951
Raise my kids but anyway that fights the globalist

276
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
I just I was too busy taking out the trash and pay my taxes I forgot to call back has very legitimate whistleblower

277
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
Right

278
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:44,895
If you're mean miss you have life you have no due diligence at all you're just like

279
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
Let's imagine a scenario where curtain Mo he's the one of the guys

280
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
Left Infowars and says Alex Jones

281
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Is a huge fraud

282
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,511
He's put that out on Twitter before if if in touch with me I would drop literally

283
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Everything I was doing

284
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
What's going on

285
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,655
We talked to Larry Nichols

286
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
Incomplete

287
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
Yeah it's

288
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,639
Enduring is like I keep pointing that out but it's because

289
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,455
This is the first like 15 minutes of the show

290
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
Nothing

291
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
There's nothing to do no traction

292
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
Other than him saying

293
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,135
No One Believes the Osama bin Laden

294
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
Long story

295
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
No One Believes

296
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Little kids

297
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
Cuz they're dumb and let me tell you something

298
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Nobody believes in

299
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
What is that

300
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
The sad thing

301
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
Well that's the reason we have

302
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,751
Astarte

303
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
Okay

304
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,967
It's not one of the Greek ones I know of Demeter

305
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
Persephone in Greek

306
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,415
Let's not to go down the misology path I think we're engaged

307
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:07,071
I think that we can actually look into

308
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,775
We're going to have open phones for the military

309
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,847
Veterans

310
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:26,271
Broadcast

311
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,135
And of course co-author too many Tom Clancy books

312
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,815
2002

313
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,447
Of course the CIA and the American Hospital

314
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,031
And Dubai all that came out on CBS nose after

315
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Doctor

316
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,919
Walter Cronkite came out and said

317
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,695
I'm going to say he is at the very least

318
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
Willfully misinterpreted

319
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Quite a bit

320
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
Yeah quite a bit

321
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
Cronkite statement

322
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
But he's mad

323
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,447
Actually I think I

324
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,495
Play this just straight from my computer so let's

325
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,823
Here is Walter Cronkite in an interview in 2000

326
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
About bin Laden

327
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
Something that he thinks is a problem

328
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Press freedom

329
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Tell us your thoughts on this

330
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,063
Momentous issue exists

331
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
That there was going to be allies

332
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Seachange

333
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
In the how we practice

334
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Journalism

335
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,071
Until I read a couple days ago if that the

336
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Traditional Networks

337
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
Pedigreed

338
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
That ended indeed the cablenet

339
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
News networks

340
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,287
Agreed with a request

341
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Brian

342
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
Does the government

343
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
That if not carry

344
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Then why

345
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Propaganda broadcasts in this country

346
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,087
He goes on to discuss

347
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
How I

348
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
Other countries

349
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
By Kyle

350
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
BBC another

351
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,767
Now all these other news outlets

352
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
In foreign countries

353
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
Do play them

354
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Are you think so

355
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
Sort of irresponsible

356
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,423
And it's a bad sign for the Press

357
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
The government is telling them

358
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Are these things

359
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,311
I may just roll over like an AI Quia

360
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
It's new

361
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,943
It's not really too much of a surprise now to see so many

362
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
Fred screaming shows

363
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Because

364
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Well that was

365
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
Reasonable

366
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Intelligent

367
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Also boring

368
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:43,487
Super boring very measured speed

369
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
Understandable

370
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
Clearly a 2000

371
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
He believes a Bin Laden still alive

372
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Based on

373
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
Interview

374
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,311
2004

375
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
Events

376
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Of the alarm

377
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,735
And you had an interview with Larry King and he said he believed that

378
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
Clearly

379
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
He's believed in the bin Laden

380
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
I'm still alive

381
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
He believes that Karl Rove may have

382
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
Set up the bin Laden

383
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
It came out in 2000

384
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
14

385
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
He says this as it relates

386
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
2

387
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
It being Advent

388
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
Contagious to the

389
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
TobyMac

390
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
The Bush campaign

391
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
They bring out this

392
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Terrorist

393
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,943
He's not saying Karl Rove

394
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
Although Alex

395
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
As what

396
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
Nothing.

397
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
Leaving isn't play

398
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
But

399
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
He's saying that it's

400
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
I mean if you take the

401
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
The context of that last clip the

402
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,583
The 2002 interview into consideration

403
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,887
With what he says in that Larry King interview

404
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,727
They combined to be like why are they putting out this tape now

405
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
When

406
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Before

407
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,823
They had a restriction on playing bin Laden

408
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,127
And obviously that's a really good

409
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431
I've nothing to do with Bin Laden faking

410
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
Dead or anything like that

411
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,271
Walter Cronkite

412
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Does not match

413
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
It doesn't check out

414
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Necessarily

415
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Albright

416
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,536
Very quietly discourse run knowledge fight

417
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
Bronchitis

418
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
I've never aspired

419
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,960
To be either Madeleine Albright was quoted

420
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,800
Suppose that the Bush Administration has Osama Bin Laden hidden away

421
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
Somewhere and we'll bring him out before the election

422
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
This quote from

423
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,456
Fox News analyst and roll call executive editor port

424
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Kondraki

425
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,528
Goes on to say she was not

426
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Smiling

427
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
She's insisted that she was speaking tongue-in-cheek

428
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:51,488
Mr kondracke immediately went on the air to repeat the comment

429
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
Was made to a person I thought was a friend

430
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
Smart enough to know the difference

431
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
Between a serious state

432
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:04,032
We've seen in the past that Madeleine Albright is not that great at making off

433
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Pick up statements

434
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,360
She is like most sociopath

435
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
Devoid of a sense of

436
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:13,248
Number 10 on the show

437
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Misrepresent

438
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Yoshi's

439
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
Gone on record and apologize

440
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
That's clearly a joke

441
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,464
Or more contracts is just sort of an opportunist

442
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,864
Yeah really works for Fox News

443
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,680
Waterboarding pretty vociferously during the bush era

444
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
He said in 2006

445
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,568
You would figure the terrorists will plan more upsurge in violence in Iraq to help

446
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
Bush's adversaries

447
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
Arrow

448
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,968
Went on Fox News and was saying that like

449
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,016
Obviously terroristic

450
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
Lincoln

451
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
Democrats and terrorists

452
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,672
He has a pattern of uncritically airing

453
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
Conservative propaganda pieces of news on his

454
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Is Fox shows

455
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:00,864
What is that a couple shows on Fox

456
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
A progress for America in

457
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
In particular

458
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,008
He's equated NSA domestic spying with World War 2 codebreakers

459
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
That is

460
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
That is

461
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,688
Dumb on an offensively mistake

462
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,480
I have ever

463
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,928
Do you think it's okay I could just like this

464
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,792
Made in the present I think anyone else I think anyone was watching the video can see that in your face

465
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
That's

466
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,240
Bananas he's also been pushing

467
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
That's exactly what that mean haha

468
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
That's what's up.

469
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,640
All right he's also been pushing for war with Iran

470
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
That's at least two thousand five

471
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Cuz he's a hero

472
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,272
Right so I don't take him too seriously as a

473
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
Great source

474
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:55,136
As a completely stupid and unreliable source who is

475
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,696
More than willing to lie lie lie Direct

476
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,512
It seems that way

477
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
When I looked into like

478
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,864
What could Alex use in

479
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Is like

480
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,216
People prominent people who have

481
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
Maybe cast

482
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,872
Aspersions on the idea that was killed in 2011

483
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Comes up that

484
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
Alex Padilla

485
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
Benazir Bhutto

486
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,368
Okay Benazir Bhutto I have an interview in Tucson

487
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
Fun name

488
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Great

489
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,488
She was interviewed in 2007

490
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,792
I'm sad that someone had murdered of them

491
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
And it's unclear if you listen to

492
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
The context of the entire interview

493
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
It's not

494
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Relieved

495
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
Clear at all if she's misspeaking

496
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Because that's not the point of the inter

497
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,432
David Frost

498
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,736
And at no point does he like hold on

499
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,064
Hold on you're telling me it was on Dunlawton was murdered

500
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
What's going on

501
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,416
It's just a big move past it in a way

502
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
If you watch it

503
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
She meant to say another name

504
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:04,768
Countryside Osama

505
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,048
Okay it's not

506
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
He was murdered

507
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,144
Doesn't jibe

508
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
With the ideas that these other

509
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
Conspiracy theorist

510
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,800
Of him dying of like kidney failure

511
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,080
So that

512
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:23,968
To me make me feel Overload at my rank

513
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,016
Oh yeah oh yeah

514
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
Benazir Bhutto

515
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,864
Walter Cronkite Madeleine Albright terrible examples I'm not here to

516
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Discuss whether or not like

517
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,984
I'm certain that Osama Bin Laden was killed in 2011

518
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,776
In the context that we are told

519
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
He was

520
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
I don't know

521
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,616
From everything I can glean

522
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
I believe it

523
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
Enough

524
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,784
Because the things that people keep pointing out things like why would they throw his body into the ocean

525
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
That sort of thing

526
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,856
That's not that weird

527
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,696
The arguments of we don't want to create a holy

528
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
Trying to

529
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,536
To him or something like that

530
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,584
Does mustard for me I don't need

531
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Much more

532
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,424
I mean they could have of course buried him

533
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
In the middle of the desert

534
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
And slaughtered

535
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
Camel

536
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Child

537
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,616
So that only a child

538
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Calf

539
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
So that only its mother

540
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
Knew where the

541
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
And then they could let the mother

542
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,296
Who would always know where

543
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
To the body saver

544
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Visit

545
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Is an ancient

546
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:40,000
I like it like that

547
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,792
But they also killed like

548
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
40 body

549
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:50,752
That the way our government works

550
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,776
You need to set up like

551
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,592
Six organizations in order to get that app

552
00:26:54,848 --> 00:27:00,224
You know it'll be a lot of red tape

553
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,040
So now I want to talk about

554
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
For a second

555
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,624
She is a psyop dude I do okay

556
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
Jesus

557
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,976
The saying that you came on in 2000

558
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
2

559
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
To say that Osama Bin Laden was dead

560
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,328
He came out with all the

561
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,168
When you considered in the context of a stye operator

562
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
Operator

563
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
There we go

564
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,800
I was waiting for it you don't want anything

565
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:30,944
Happened pretty consistently throughout our Wars like these things happened in Vietnam and Korea in World War II

566
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,760
Rumors of the leader's death

567
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
The other side

568
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
Very popular

569
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:43,488
It's something that you do hoping that the forces will become this disenchanted

570
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,048
Are there more

571
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,632
Thinking that their leader is been cut off

572
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:56,032
You see this over and over again throughout the history of War

573
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,592
IHOP guy is coming onto Alex the show

574
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
I'm staying

575
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
This

576
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
Traditional

577
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,968
War siop language

578
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,272
That leads me to believe he was up

579
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
Now the problem is

580
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,880
When you're working with terrorist organizations

581
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
Then you're working with these nebulous

582
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,976
Groups like lk2 was an early 2000

583
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,048
They weren't fighting for bin Laden

584
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
They were fighting

585
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
For ideology

586
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
Either fighting again

587
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,192
Fighting against

588
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Murder

589
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,032
Right against themselves

590
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
This siop was

591
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
Successful

592
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
Terrorist

593
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,504
They would not stop them

594
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
From The Crusade they were on

595
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,624
Or from the wars that they were in

596
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,208
The only end result of the

597
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,488
This psyop that I believe

598
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
I was running

599
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
Is to make American

600
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
Distrustful of Their Own

601
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
Which I don't know if that was the

602
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
Or an unfortunate

603
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
Consequence

604
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,240
But it certainly Bears out on Infowars

605
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,288
And it's not like we needed that

606
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,336
Help

607
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,640
To the government for a good long while now for good reason

608
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,992
That's really what I wanted to talk about terms of

609
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,832
The rest of this is not going to

610
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
To do with bin Laden

611
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,416
Of course it's the anniversary

612
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Kohl's

613
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,328
Getting off track

614
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
But

615
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,888
He takes calls from like

616
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192
A wife of a Marine

617
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
Who has gossip

618
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,664
Here's one here's one of the calls that he gets

619
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,672
Paolo yes I'm this this is very nice

620
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
Fake laugh

621
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,864
Wright's glass

622
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
Formation

623
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:05,312
And so like all of this been although he wants to

624
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,616
So there's nothing

625
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,456
Want leave the song

626
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,224
2002

627
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,016
And then

628
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,808
For nine years

629
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344
Weekend at Bernie's

630
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
From place

631
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
To place to play

632
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
Let me fun absolutely

633
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:30,400
The number of people that would require in order to pull this off is

634
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,960
Like the amount of people that would take to hide this

635
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
49

636
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,544
Among two different Administrations

637
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,640
Like what would that be too elections

638
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,944
Difference every

639
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,368
Department offices

640
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,416
I think there's only one

641
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
Conspiracy where

642
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,256
The infrastructure

643
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
Sure did not break it anyone

644
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:58,816
Time

645
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
Scientology

646
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
Infiltrating the IRA

647
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,424
Interesting

648
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
Rock.

649
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,496
90 people

650
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,288
All who had worked for like

651
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,568
4 years plus

652
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
And they they

653
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
You did this

654
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,480
Just deleting all of scientology's record

655
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
Some good work

656
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,832
Yeah I know they all have needs a m

657
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
What's that

658
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
Get a raise

659
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,768
DC food now that's

660
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,632
Alex comes up with

661
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
And I can

662
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
Improve all three of

663
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
The stories he tells are low

664
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,848
Speaking of a cashier she want me just cover this

665
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
Cabinets Now

666
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,712
Man arrested in prison for using cash

667
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,760
It was an older $50 bill

668
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
And then finally

669
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,048
And they

670
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
So let's talk about this story

671
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,360
Did you just say he's bad yeah he's bad because you got to go change his money

672
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,456
Oh no I agree this is bad

673
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:26,112
What are you saying even if you do use a fake $50

674
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,952
Take your $50 bill away and be like hey,

675
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,536
This is a story about a man in Tennessee

676
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
Old $50 bill

677
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:40,704
So that the clerk at the Quick Mart

678
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
Isabelle notified police

679
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
Because the fraud

680
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
You have that

681
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:51,200
Mark anybill / 20

682
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
Bill is fake

683
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
And so they called the police

684
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
And here's a quote from

685
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,648
The front side of the bill was off-center and it didn't feel like a normal bill it didn't

686
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,952
It did look to be counterfeit

687
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,488
Officer Brock Warner said

688
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
This report

689
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
We thought

690
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
It was weird because it had Jefferson Davis are very old $50 bill

691
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
Order took the bill to Tubac

692
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,592
Where was determined as the old at 1

693
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,688
Improving real buy a black light and magnifying glass at another

694
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,784
A Judicial commissioner had Gasper that's the guy who tried to use it

695
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,112
Released from jail after 3 hours

696
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,160
For 3 hours too long and a holding cell

697
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
And hoarder apologize for the arrest

698
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
The report said

699
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,072
Gasper was told by Horner to take the bill to a bank and have it exchanged

700
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
For a newer one

701
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
So they

702
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,936
If I can say like your bad take this belt

703
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
This pill

704
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,520
70 years old

705
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,848
It shows up as counterfeit by our modern

706
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
You got it this should be out of circulation

707
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
But also you can hear in there

708
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:01,088
She apologized about it because it doesn't misunderstanding that is very reasonable to make the pain marked it is counterfeit

709
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,184
Are you the Black Lightning

710
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
Magnifying glass

711
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Kids story

712
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Gasper

713
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,912
Where did you get that f****** bill I don't know why does he still have that f****** Bill Gray's how old is he

714
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
He was an old

715
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
Also

716
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:23,872
The bill was probably worth more than $50

717
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:29,504
Imperfections is usually that that's usually very collectible

718
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,552
We could have gotten at least five hundred bucks for that

719
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,880
58. Now that is marked by the counter

720
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:42,304
I think that makes it even more excited

721
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:48,192
Reasonable understand like situation where they should have been

722
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
Because there's a chance that he is

723
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,544
Or something like that

724
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,872
That is I don't care

725
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,456
I don't really care to have that debate

726
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,272
Just the debate that Alex Jones is wrong isn't

727
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
Doctor he is wrong

728
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,624
He's you pretending that the crime is using money

729
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
And the crime

730
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,488
Which turns out it wasn't a crime and I apologize for holding him

731
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,280
Yeah it was that it was

732
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,840
Don't be counterfeit even the cop we got there

733
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:20,960
Thought it was a female Alex

734
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,032

He was down on the

Talking about Silver's is like 67 years ago

742
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,168
Do some people call the police

743
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,472
Illegal to have a silver coin

744
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,008
And then.

745
00:35:55,264 --> 00:36:01,408
Sounds right

746
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480

He was actually arrested

00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,184
I can't find an arrest record from anywhere around

759
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
I found the guys LinkedIn

760
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:54,400
Maybe maybe

761
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
Christopher Amoroso

762
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,752
Is a LinkedIn page

763
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,312
I mean why would you put I was in prison for a few years

764
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
It's not a good thing.

765
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,664
Charge

766
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:09,760
Do it look Noah look like a normal guy the only two things I could find

767
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,808
From Chris Italiano's

768
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,600
They were in any way

769
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Interesting

770
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,952
The page from mufon

771
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:25,376
Which as we know is the mutual UFO Network there's no information

772
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,216
But his name is on a move on site

773
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,824
Okay the collection of ghost sightings or alien sightings

774
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
Things on the site

775
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
But it's empty

776
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Completely app

777
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,688
So I don't I got nothing on me

778
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,760
Although they really missed an opportunity

779
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,296
It should be called moveon.org

780
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,088
Yeah probably

781
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
3 dates

782
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,416
Yeah I know they said they still got time

783
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,952
So

784
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,768
The other Rave that profile.

785
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
Cannot do

786
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,400
So the other thing I found was a organization called Liberty

787
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,448
Put out at this camp

788
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,752
They put out a periodical newsletter

789
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
And I found their newsletter

790
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
From April of

791
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
2003

792
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,384
Which is why impressive Thanos

793
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
Was allegedly

794
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,992
Skill

795
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,160
Who else would have gotten

796
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
Like I said.

797
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:26,048
I can't I can't find any like mugshot

798
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,584
Can't find any record of him

799
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,376
Doing time or anything like that

800
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
If you did I apologize

801
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,216
It's been I don't mean to disparage but

802
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,056
Out there public rec

803
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:43,712
Because you guys had a falling-out and Alex didn't want to talk

804
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:49,344
Talk to you anymore so we just made up a reason I've been Liberty. Org

805
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
In This Very

806
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,904
Terrible

807
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,976
The newsletter

808
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,256
Zine yeah it's

809
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
Just a word

810
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,608
Basically there's no way

811
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
Incident of the month

812
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
Now man

813
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:10,592
On April 14th 2003 in Austin Texas an incident occurred that just shows how is

814
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,640
Small misstep can create a big problem

815
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,688
And most unfortunately this incident

816
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
Involves crisanta

817
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
One of our most

818
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,040
Successful Associates in the rco

819
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
South Austin

820
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
Like so many times

821
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
Chris offered a cashier

822
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,976
A choice of either a $10 silver liberty coin

823
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,072
Or $20 Federal Reserve Note to attend a comedy show

824
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,864
How do University of Texas venue

825
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
I didn't think much

826
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,472
Police officer was on guard next

827
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
Nearby

828
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,312
Chris paid with a Federal Reserve Note is that was

829
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,640
Preferred by the cashier and went into the show

830
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,224
If your newsletter calls it

831
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,320
A Federal Reserve Note

832
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:57,184
Also we can already tell he was at a University of Texas venues

833
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
Blue collar

834
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,264
Dailybreak

835
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
Goes into the show

836
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,176
Shortly the police officer found Chris and ask to see the

837
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
Quote coin

838
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,248
I think the quotation marks in there a little

839
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
F*** off

840
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
Little bit of a

841
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
Slayer

842
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,880
I mistakenly the officer thought it was illegal so we asked

843
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,416
Chris to step outside with

844
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
Which he did

845
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,720
Now I'm going to read through the

846
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
God the subject

847
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,280
I believe that

848
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
The person who worked

849
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
The door

850
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,376
He thought this guy was trying to pull ups

851
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,936
I am flag down the police officer

852
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:47,360
So during a brief discussion the officer and the backup officer asked Chris for his identification

853
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
Chris refuse

854
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
Stating his fourth and fifth

855
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
Digital rights

856
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,528
The officers informed Chris that he would be arrested if you did not produce

857
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:58,368
When Chris finally produces ID he also produced his

858
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,904
To carry a concealed weapon permit

859
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
The inquiry as to

860
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,744
Where the weapon was an ultimately

861
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,304
Chris being arrested for having a weapon and for him

862
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
A school

863
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
So there we go

864
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,424
Perversion of it

865
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,824
So Chris is a lunatic who likes to carry guns wherever he goes to schools and comedy show

866
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,896
Is not realize that it's illegal to do so in public space

867
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:26,528
This is like a school

868
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
My sovereignty

869
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,856
I just heard the massive

870
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
Collective sigh the two police

871
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,184
Mosers ad

872
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
I have the 4th

873
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
They're like

874
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,888
F***

875
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,192
Yeah what are you

876
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
Second Story

877
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
Had nothing to do with money

878
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
It has a

879
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
It's money

880
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,104
Inasmuch as

881
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:55,711
Someone being so slightly suspicious about someone's intentions

882
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,039
To the the actual problem

883
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,367
The classic assholes / conman move is like

884
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:07,487
I got a $20 bill.

885
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:12,863
You do just pay with a Federal Reserve Note

886
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
Chunk of gold

887
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
So here's the next

888
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,567
ICD-10

889
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,103
The Best Buy

890
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,919

Engraving

896
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:57,919
I know because I went to the u.s. mint once when I was a kid

897
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,735
The guy he gave

898
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,039
Chores chores the children

899
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,231
How to store

900
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047

We're selling

903
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,703
As one sheet uncut

904
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,823
I guess I can get arrested for that I bought at the u.s. mint

905
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
But

906
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,943
Stories

907
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,271
Unkind

910
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,463
He had some left

911
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,839
This is illegal this is real

912
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:51,167
Managers and all of them were so stupid

00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,591

Episode

916
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:03,967

00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,999
Serta Illustrated

925
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,791
This is what his show was like back then

926
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,607
It's wild this is

927
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:59,007
Me rambling b******* information

928
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,823
What's in what's

929
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,407
What movie was that that we went to in the theater

930
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
It was a beautiful

931
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:12,575
It was great I thought we were talking about

932
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,391
Cloud Atlas

933
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:22,047
I love that movie

934
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
It was all

935
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,631
Yeah but it was

936
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,655
It's that like

937
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,471
It's not a show man

938
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,079
It's it's fun to listen to do because we're going to get to is

939
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,895
Hilarious

940
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,991
Ms episode just maybe one of my favorite things I've ever heard on the show

941
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,039
Since we started doing this podcast

942
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:48,671
Man I used to listen to Alex Jones like 5 years ago and I've always been

943
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,719
Why the f*** would you do that

944
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:54,559
He's an insane man

945
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:59,167
Just kind of cookie and stupid moments where it is

946
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,727
One of the things that I love the most about love line

947
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,287
Background used to listen

948
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
Sure

949
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,895
It felt like they were trap

950
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,943
There was a there was a certain amount of like

951
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,759
If late night radio they're stuck in this studio

952
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:19,391
And I got to feel tired so Adam come up with little games and stuff like that himself

953
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,207
And there's a feeling of that a little bit with Alex Jones

954
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
In 2012 of like

955
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
He's trapped in the studio

956
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
Where is now

957
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
If you look at

958
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,911
Pictures of what a studio look like back then it look like s***

959
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:35,263
Not like s*** but compared to now it's not a million-dollar Studio

960
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,567
Is a feeling of like

961
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,615
I feel this time

962
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,431
Let me ask about this boy scout thing

963
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,759
That I liked about radio

964
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,319
About amateur independent radio

965
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,367
Save a ramshackle quality to it

966
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,183
Is popping down into the

967
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
Right right

968
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,279
So Alex is lying about this story

969
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
Three stories in a row about money

970
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,423
Illegal

971
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
How to use money

972
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,239
This is from a world

973
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,031
Everyone knows is

974
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
Is dumb

975
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,847
Even his listeners back then or like

976
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Alex

977
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,663
It's not illegal to use money

978
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,735
It's not great to use stupid money because

979
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,759
People are going to get

980
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,087
Confused yet so even in the world article about this

981
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,111
What do you say

982
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
It says

983
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,183
According to the song report

984
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,719
The police arrest

985
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:31,583
Report noted one employee noticed some smearing of Ink on the bills

986
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,863
That's when cops

987
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,631
We're called

988
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,447
One officer reportedly noticed the bills ran into

989
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,471
Sequential order

990
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,751
Which is suspicious

991
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Generally

992
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
Cuz people

993
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,847
Would you Rob

994
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:47,455
Smearing ink on the bill also could come from

995
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
I like

996
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,271
A gel pack or something like it

997
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,599
There's a lot of reasons why that would cause a radish

998
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,415
Secret service agent of them being that it had a

999
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,975
They called in a secret service agent

1000
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
Because of this

1001
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:06,143
The secret service agent Lee Turner eventually arrived Claire the bills legitimate

1002
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
According

1003
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
The police report

1004
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
Sometimes

1005
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Smear on money

1006
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,543
Which is an information

1007
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359
That's not something that people know

1008
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,663
Also Alex is lying about the

1009
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,967
The fact that he was teaching Boy Scouts about

1010
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Constitution

1011
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
That's not what I was doing

1012
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,831
That doesn't sound right at all

1013
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,159
Tours

1014
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
Does BestBuy

1015
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,999
Stereo

1016
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
Installed

1017
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,791
Some car

1018
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
Not buying so

1019
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,351
She seems like a nice guy

1020
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:41,983
I don't have anything against

1021
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,175
It was only a matter of time

1022
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,735
Or whatever the police department

1023
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,039
I don't know if you would win

1024
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,367
I don't like

1025
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:02,207
They did not act out of line if you can't use two dollar bills

1026
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,767
But there was a miscarriage

1027
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
Perception

1028
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
I don't know

1029
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,655
Easter Best Buy Personnel repeatedly

1030
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,935
By the way his name is

1031
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
Is Mike bellesa

1032
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,519
Which is an anagram for bike molesta

1033
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
But you would not be charged

1034
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:25,503
Listen to the stereo on his son's car

1035
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,807
He received a call from the store saying it wasn't

1036
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,831
Charging

1037
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,879
As a means of protest

1038
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,695
But bolesta decided to pay the 140

1039
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
$10 bill

1040
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,767
57 crisp new $2 bills

1041
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,071
As the owner of capital city student

1042
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,119
Tours the Baltimore resident as an ear

1043
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,911
As I Hardy Supply

1044
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,447
Of The Uncommon current

1045
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,727
He often gives

1046
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
Isabel's.

1047
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,031
Tours for meal

1048
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,639
Quote the kids don't see that many 2 dollar bills so they think it's the greatest thing in the world

1049
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,455
They don't want to spend them they want to save them

1050
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,759
I've been doing this started the company

1051
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:01,855
All Stage my little comic protest $14 or $2

1052
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
So

1053
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:12,095
I mean that's not a good bit but I get it but it's saying someone is like a all the nickels

1054
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,911
I think it's less effective because it

1055
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,959
It's just 57 $2 bills

1056
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Supposed to

1057
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
You know like five

1058
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,079
Whatever have your foot

1059
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,663
Didn't realize they were leaking in

1060
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,063
Instances of Alex

1061
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,855
Misleading telling bulshit

1062
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,647
Stories to Triana

1063
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,183
Enforces narratives that like

1064
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:43,583
Fiat currency they're trying to make it so you can't have real money they want

1065
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,375
Wanting a cashless Society

1066
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,679
And so you use it

1067
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,751
Interesting

1068
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
One day

1069
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,847
The Prime Minister was like

1070
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,431
Like

1071
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,223
Interesting

1072
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,783
Now that is a great idea

1073
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
To go paper

1074
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
But

1075
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,439
Roughly 85% of people in India to not have

1076
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Credit cards are any

1077
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,047
The same is true in the

1078
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
Impossible to m

1079
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,423
All the

1080
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,263
Really fuk up

1081
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,567
Maybe that's what they should start doing

1082
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,359
Probably absolutely

1083
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,639
So Alex

1084
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:33,759
He's just trying to bolster this Narrative of globalist want to get rid of cash so they can

1085
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,783
Control what you purchase

1086
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,807
Soundtrack everything

1087
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,599
By telling three bulshit story

1088
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
Crazy

1089
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,903
It's so easy

1090
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,207
So easy to see through

1091
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:48,095
The Simpsons do only make one house of horrors episode

1092
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,679
They come up with 3

1093
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,447
Three separate source

1094
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,543
Possible that salad

1095
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:00,383
So at this point we've already seen

1096
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,711
About Alex

1097
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
Dairy Queen

1098
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,271
Are you not as good performer

1099
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,831
No he's a little bit

1100
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:13,183
Cuz I can track down all these stories

1101
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:17,279
If he'd just been super vague about it will be much more difficult for me to find these to be like

1102
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,815
Nope you're wrong

1103
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,607
If we haven't learned that trick yet

1104
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,191
But here in this next clip

1105
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,519
You know what we did

1106
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,055
Agree on things but I think you're

1107
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,871
Right there is a little bit but

1108
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,175
In his next clip we're going to get

1109
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,199
Time

1110
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,527
We're going to get to see a similarity between

1111
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,367
I saw yesterday and didn't cover

1112
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,767
Pilot newspaper

1113
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,583
Norfolk Virginia

1114
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,447
Black on white crime

1115
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,263
Reading at church and Brambleton

1116
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,847
The story is 42 weeks

1117
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:09,503
By hundreds of young black people this is happening all over the country

1118
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,783
100 epidemic

1119
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,575
And the police

1120
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,879
When they complained went for help for told

1121
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,231
Car will not going to help you what do you want us to do

1122
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:23,327
Sounds like the police

1123
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,119
On the shopping outlet

1124
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:29,215
Is this is very dangerous

1125
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
The Fosters

1126
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,615
Cars race Wars

1127
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,639
As you know

1128
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:41,247
Nbcla

1129
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,951
The media tried to push this to get us fighting with each other

1130
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,231
No boys

1131
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:55,583
Immediately

1132
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,119
On Facebook about it

1133
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:01,215
Bragging

1134
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,799
Some black folks

1135
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:10,687
And so what's going to happen is the average self-loathing and everything

1136
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,015
Racist but fearing

1137
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,911
About white people

1138
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,175
Well I better look out

1139
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,199
So

1140
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,783
Even

1141
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,111
Universal

1142
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Favorite

1143
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,159
Bulshit there

1144
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:52,927
Always like

1145
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,719
Black people

1146
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,767
If you were nicer to White

1147
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,559
People we would like you more as like

1148
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,167
You're just going to make white people scared

1149
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,215
Good

1150
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,751
Look up

1151
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,799
Be far more afraid. Here's the

1152
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,591
He's not why

1153
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,151
That is a real store

1154
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,455
I looked into it

1155
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,479
And

1156
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,551
A lot of the context is

1157
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,831
It is real

1158
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:24,159
There was a couple that was driving at church and brand

1159
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,183
Does intersect

1160
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,999
In some place in Virginia

1161
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,303
There were a bunch of

1162
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,071
Kids

1163
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:32,863
100

1164
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,143
Seems like an exaggeration

1165
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
There were dozens

1166
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,215
Okay it's okay

1167
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,775
The dude in the car

1168
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,543
Cuz he got out of

1169
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,127
They were wandering around

1170
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,455
In the aftermath of Trayvon Martin murder

1171
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,991
And they're blocking

1172
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,527
But you got out of the car

1173
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,295
And they worth

1174
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,599
And the police ended up

1175
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,415
Now the part about shut up and get back in

1176
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
In your car

1177
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
Isn't misrepresent

1178
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,999
The police

1179
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,559
We're interviewed about that may talked about how

1180
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,351
They have got reports of

1181
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
Gunshot

1182
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,679
Another part of town that evening

1183
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,239
And so when they were telling them to get in the car

1184
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
They were like

1185
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,031
Get in the car

1186
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,055
Because yes

1187
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:17,919
It was a protective thing I believe we made the decision

1188
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
To get them off

1189
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,735
The streets as immediately as poss

1190
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,551
Right so that was what was going on is there

1191
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,855
The article itself site

1192
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,439
It's one Twitter comment where someone said I would do it for Trayvon

1193
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:35,071
It's not good reporting

1194
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,375
But the other stuff

1195
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
Surrounded

1196
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,935
The stuff about the paper refusing to

1197
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
To cover it because it's

1198
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,495
Black on white crime is not

1199
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,799
True all that stuff is just that that

1200
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,103
Is that that part isn't true

1201
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,199
Well

1202
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:52,991
I know

1203
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,039
Are you still don't want people beating up innocent

1204
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Some people

1205
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,343
Do you want to meet like

1206
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,879
It's understandable

1207
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,183
I would say it's understandable I don't think

1208
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
But I get it

1209
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,791
Yeah I get it I still think there's an image

1210
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
Victim in it

1211
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,095
Is there

1212
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:17,823
You don't know anything about this guy

1213
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,103
I don't either

1214
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,383
So Edwards

1215
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,687
There's a lot of assumptions you have to make

1216
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:27,295
Norfolk Virginia Virgina

1217
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,599
The more important piece

1218
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
Is this is Alex

1219
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,647
Driving

1220
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,927
She's a bunch of black kids

1221
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:36,511
All of them very frustrating angry about Trayvon

1222
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
He thinks

1223
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:40,351
F*** it you know what we can't be having this gets out of his car

1224
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
Starts mouthing off

1225
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,655
We don't need to get this ass

1226
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:48,287
But that might not have been that might not have been what you got out of the car we don't know that

1227
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,335
Come on that narrative

1228
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
Tracks

1229
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,895
For you but you're just doing what Alex.

1230
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:01,087
Because that's the opposite of what we do

1231
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:07,743
Just sort of like a guessing what a story will yet

1232
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,815
Stabbing Fargo

1233
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,655
Throw a rock at you

1234
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:18,239
Is a good juxtaposition not that

1235
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:23,359
Switch around this is a body swap comedy yeah you're going to be very angry this entire time and

1236
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,639
I'm just going to chill having

1237
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,343
Harrison you think I'm

1238
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,159
Not chill

1239
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:39,231
I want to make is that this

1240
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,255
Idea that he has

1241
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,535
Espousing

1242
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,071
About

1243
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:47,423
Is being a race war narrative story reinforces that is the exact

1244
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
C-store

1245
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,031
So the game he plays is very clear

1246
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
Edit repeat

1247
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,103
Despite whatever the contacts

1248
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,895
And you could be

1249
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,991
You could make a good case for him just haven't got lucky

1250
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,271
That the headline

1251
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,039
Actually did

1252
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
Matchup with the red

1253
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,855
Marley's matched up with

1254
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,415
Some of this and it's not incredibly

1255
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,183
Sensational

1256
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,463
And actually I got to be honest

1257
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,767
Read that article

1258
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:16,095
Okay because when he's talking about the person on Facebook he's referring

1259
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Into something that we

1260
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
Was in the Arctic

1261
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,191
That one post

1262
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:30,687
I got to get to the bottom of this

1263
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,735
So I told you earlier

1264
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,503
Take call

1265
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,527
From app

1266
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,063
Veterans

1267
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:41,439
Who Outlook will agree with him

1268
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:45,535
He's crashing at so far taken unfortunately

1269
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,583
He gets bisque all pretty early

1270
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,167
And it destroys the entire restitution

1271
00:59:54,239 --> 01:00:00,383
Hey Alex I'm calling from FEMA region for two quick points and I'd like you to look into piggybacking on one of the

1272
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
Stories did a couple weeks ago

1273
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,759
I have a cousin who's married to a

1274
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,807
Soldier stationed out in Stuart

1275
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,367
Brigade Homeland

1276
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
He told her

1277
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:19,071
The guys that blew up that Fella's house in Roswell Holcomb County Marshal's uniform

1278
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,423
All those guys were off duty that day

1279
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,727
What did they were actually soldiers

1280
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,007
From Stuart

1281
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,335
It look into that number two

1282
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,639
Viper Squad

1283
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:39,295
Hanging out on Interstate 40 is he going to Memphis in the little cut off there where it's goes down since 7255

1284
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,975
23 police

1285
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,375
Hey where's the 23rd District in Tennessee

1286
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:57,215
He said man I don't know what that is there's no such thing

1287
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:03,615
That's bulshit just do a Google search you'll find the 23rd District it includes the city of

1288
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,663
Franklin

1289
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,199
Nolensville tops

1290
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,735
Open station Spring Hill

1291
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,807
It's just south of Nashville it is

1292
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
However

1293
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,415
40 + 55 is he stalking

1294
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,951
Nobody's not near there

1295
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,047
Congressional district

1296
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,071
Is very real place

1297
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:23,839
In Tennessee

1298
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,423
Memphis is straddled by the 8th and 9th District

1299
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
But

1300
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
The chicken man

1301
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,359
The chicken man

1302
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,639
Is what the

1303
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:39,455
Destroys the rest of Alex Jones Show what happened

1304
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,015
But you do

1305
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,087
Cigarette

1306
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
Cigarettes

1307
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,135
Do this burn my chair

1308
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
That's what I did

1309
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,439
Okay

1310
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,463
I apologize

1311
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:54,047
Do you know about the chicken

1312
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
I do everything

1313
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,655
So

1314
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,959
Will the gentleman by the name of Andrew word

1315
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
Or

1316
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:09,919
Could be jumped out of a gym

1317
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:15,807
I would totally go see him do a headlining spot

1318
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,831
So

1319
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,111
A words

1320
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:18,879
The chicken man

1321
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,415
I was a guy who lived

1322
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,463
Georgia

1323
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,255
In Roswell Georgia

1324
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,303
He had a couple of chicken

1325
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,399
One part of the story checks out

1326
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
Then you got a bunch more

1327
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,519
And his neighbors

1328
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,799
Started to

1329
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,567
It really matter

1330
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,847
Cuz it was just a house

1331
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,615
Yeah

1332
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
Because

1333
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,503
These animals were super loud

1334
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039
Pretty value

1335
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:52,671
For sure there was an order that adjudged

1336
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:56,255
Told him that he had to restrict the number of because

1337
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,815
We live in a society

1338
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:02,143
And so he refused to comply with that order

1339
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
He's a chicken

1340
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,239
Because he wouldn't get rid of it

1341
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,519
Contempt of court

1342
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:10,079
Behind on his mortgage payment

1343
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,359
It's while he was in jail

1344
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,919
And unfortunately that led to his house

1345
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
Put under

1346
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,735
So he's in debtors prison

1347
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:24,671
Call hope so

1348
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,951
That ironic master

1349
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:28,255
So on

1350
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,023
March

1351
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,047
26

1352
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,607
Fulton County Marshal's came to his house to

1353
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,911
I don't even hear from a hubby

1354
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
We can Post article on the

1355
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:39,775
But a standoff ensued around 12:45

1356
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,359
Words taking this is where we find out what happened

1357
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,151
The chicken man

1358
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,199
So the issue to was that

1359
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:51,039
He was supposed to be in court that day

1360
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,831
As I as I understand

1361
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,391
There's a guy named Mike pichette

1362
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,927
Not related

1363
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,743
Are you the reporter for Channel 2

1364
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:04,095
Towards his home on Alpine Drive or Fulton County Marshalls

1365
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,119
We're gathered outside for the

1366
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:05,887
Eviction

1367
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
Words told pechenik

1368
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:10,239
He was scheduled for a quarter. Sat morning on a traffic citation

1369
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,567
But feared that Marshall's would repossess his home while he's gone

1370
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
So you didn't

1371
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,127
So he's in the house

1372
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,919
I mean I guess that's

1373
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,687
To play

1374
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,247
Around 12:45

1375
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,015
P.m.

1376
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:25,599
Words called the cell phone is like a local TV reporter Mike

1377
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,135
Who was outside the home

1378
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
To leave the property

1379
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,743
He told pechenik

1380
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,303
I can't tell you what's going to happen

1381
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,839
But it ain't going to be pretty

1382
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,655
Moments later the home exploded

1383
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,191
And started a fire

1384
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:46,079
CBS Atlanta reported that fire officials found a deceased individual inside but could not

1385
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,871
Confirm that it was

1386
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
It was

1387
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,431
Investigators. Gasolina.

1388
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,711
A detonation device

1389
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,295
Inside but the cause of the explosion remains under investigation

1390
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,343
Reported the day off

1391
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:01,439
So the other quote that he had that he said to Mike

1392
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,719
Pieczenik on the phone

1393
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,511
Right before the explosion was

1394
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,791
I appreciate everything

1395
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,839
Brother I appreciate everything you've done

1396
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
And then so you blew up

1397
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,471
I feel like that

1398
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
Was a

1399
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,031
Probably fine

1400
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,591
Except for all the f****** chickens and pigs

1401
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:24,991
Every just if they just had an if they just taken him away although he probably would have blown up

1402
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,807
Call the pigs according to the

1403
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,575
Stuff that he

1404
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,903
Posted on a bunch of like weird Meetup

1405
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,695
Groups in Monterey

1406
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:37,535
Social media star

1407
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,583
Like to the point where Cube

1408
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
With willing

1409
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,631
To die for the chicken

1410
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,679
There's something

1411
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,215
Grossly romantic

1412
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:49,311
That's why he's called the chicken

1413
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,335
I need the story

1414
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,359
The story that Alex's

1415
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,383
The telling is

1416
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,199
Like I mean I guess

1417
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:01,087
These Federal Marshals Federal Marshals

1418
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
What would you do

1419
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,159
Is a army base

1420
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:09,279
Soldier group now

1421
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,071
Well we call ourselves the soldiers from

1422
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:18,751
B Moore down the line

1423
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:23,615
But for basic premise is that there are soldiers

1424
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
Personating

1425
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,919
Deputies

1426
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,479
Sounds right and they blew up his house

1427
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,527
For an unknown reason

1428
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,063
Madeleine Albright was running the

1429
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:38,463
Probably wanted to build a biodome there which doesn't make sense

1430
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:42,303
Spurs and there is no biodome now throughout the f****** house

1431
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:47,423
That doesn't make sense

1432
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:53,055
You are bothering your neighbors

1433
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
Roosters

1434
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,591
Do one

1435
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:57,407
Something and that's wake people up

1436
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,295
Bigfoot

1437
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,343
It's very discourteous

1438
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,647
I don't like the fact that he lost his house

1439
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
Right

1440
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,511
Like while he was in jail he couldn't make his Morgan

1441
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:17,631
I think that's this is well I feel a tremendous amount of empathy

1442
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:21,983
Examone

1443
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:22,751
Couldn't hurt

1444
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:26,591
Soundproof the home they were just trying to

1445
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,383
The film the movie biodome

1446
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,687
He misheard.

1447
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,855
I'm so if it's next to a clip we see that Alex Jones

1448
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,415
Totally believe the caller who is brought up

1449
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,695
The soldiers from Stuart

1450
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,231
Narrative of blowing up the

1451
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,863
Spoiler alert

1452
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,167
The reason Steve pieczenik hangs up

1453
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,191
Is that

1454
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,215
Alex

1455
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,031
50 minutes

1456
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,055
Anti

1457
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,383
Alex Koch back from break after Steve has gone

1458
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,687
A stable just like

1459
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:08,575
I called in to talk about

1460
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:14,975
I got to go I got to go

1461
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
Steve pieczenik

1462
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:22,143
Assassin or whatever the f*** I overthrow government

1463
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,447
That sounds fun

1464
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
Take a break

1465
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,151
Breaking news

1466
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:37,247
Ketchup

1467
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:43,135
But

1468
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,927
Who the person is

1469
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,231
Call Melendez Bay

1470
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,791
Everything you said like tumblers just clicked

1471
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:59,007
The police

1472
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,799
I told the sheriff

1473
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,127
So is that piece exactly what he said in the first

1474
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:07,455
Course and it's a relative

1475
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,991
Has a spouse

1476
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
That works

1477
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,807
Stewart's this is third-hand information

1478
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,367
You can sit around

1479
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
Yes

1480
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,463
Here say it's nonsense

1481
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:20,511
And let's listen to this next clip

1482
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:23,327
So we can get like Alec being a little bit Patty

1483
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,607
Pretending he already knew everything

1484
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:29,727
Of course and then we can get a clear sense of what the allegation

1485
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,495
Actually is

1486
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:37,407
What they're training to do in their day-to-day training where police uniforms

1487
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,199
Country

1488
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,991
I argue that doesn't take trainer

1489
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,783
Put on a shirt

1490
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:47,903
Do they even need to do that they could just give him a badge and call him playing close

1491
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:54,303
Right we have to we have to train you to wear a different uniform it's very dumb

1492
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,119
Actually impersonate people that okay

1493
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,655
We're going to send you the Tennessee

1494
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:04,287
Tennessee accent

1495
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:10,687
Is any voice and say I moved here from Missouri

1496
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,711
Let me tell you this

1497
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,735
One of the Hallmarks

1498
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:19,135
To the police if they don't like to answer questions so you don't really have that

1499
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:22,463
Prophesying with a citizen

1500
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,023
It looks second-city traveling group

1501
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,047
Actually there

1502
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,071
To teach

1503
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,911
Soldiers from Stuart

1504
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,983
Fulton County Marshal

1505
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,567
They're training in these lovely Uniforms on the soldiers are like

1506
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,103
What are we doing

1507
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,919
You know if you have a lot of dissent within the range

1508
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,455
Call Terrance Stewart

1509
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:46,271
Interview

1510
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,463
District

1511
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,863
Which is the wheelbase

1512
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,959
Stitches directly

1513
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,823
Hell is this is where there

1514
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,247
Evil

1515
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015
Evil

1516
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,831
Victory believe cannot advertise themselves

1517
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,111
More like

1518
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:24,159
This narrative is.

1519
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,999
I don't there's not much

1520
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,327
Cuz the the motive is not strong

1521
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,167
Killing the chicken man

1522
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
Is

1523
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,727
Has to be its own motor what else

1524
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
The chicken man

1525
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,031
What else

1526
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Who is chicken

1527
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,847
That's the real question

1528
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,919
FEMA camp

1529
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,943
Keep buying them chicken

1530
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,223
Great cuz I have secrets

1531
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:51,039
Only God knows what goes on in the heart of

1532
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,063
Chicken follow the

1533
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:02,815
So Alex probably would say that this is like the idea of police killing you

1534
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,983
Listen to f***

1535
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:10,751
Hip Hop

1536
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,567
Know why people are angry about

1537
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,919
The other thing is you trying to bring in this idea that these soldiers

1538
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:18,687
Where's the military

1539
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,455
Is impersonating

1540
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,527
Because that would breach Posse Comitatus

1541
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:29,951
Nothing better than an obscure law that has a Latin name already

1542
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:35,583
Newsreel the ACT I guess that says that

1543
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,887
Accept act of Congress

1544
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,215
The military is not allowed to operate

1545
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,751
In police Act

1546
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:47,103
Of course that's kind of cross the Rubicon

1547
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,663
It's not because there is the stipulation

1548
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,455
Except by an act of Congress

1549
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,991
We're going to get to that later

1550
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,039
But anyway Alex's

1551
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,831
He tries to spend the narrative that

1552
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,599
Like

1553
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,903
The Malt The Fulton Marshalls

1554
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,767
They don't know what happened in the sheriff said that they weren't working that day or something I got

1555
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,327
He says it's in the paper to mainstream news

1556
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,351
I can find nothing

1557
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:10,655
Of this I can't find any of that information

1558
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:14,495
He doesn't provide any backup to any of it

1559
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,543
And just a caller told

1560
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,151
So after this

1561
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,431
Reel Inn

1562
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,455
Information

1563
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
About the

1564
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,503
VSCO

1565
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
Hey Alice good afternoon

1566
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,719
Join the ranch

1567
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:41,631
Yeah I always enjoy a good Ranch especially on Infowars I'm originally from

1568
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:45,727
In Georgia at work in law enforcement is where I cut my diesel enforcement was

1569
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:48,799
Ashley in the Roswell area in Fulton County

1570
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,871
And women think I want to point out is

1571
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:57,503
Fulton County in metro Atlanta Judy if they have a sheriff's office and a Marshal's office

1572
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:02,879
Different divisions of law enforcement the sheriff is an elected Constitution

1573
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,415
Constitutional

1574
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,719
Anna Marshall is an appointed position

1575
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,999
On The Board of Commissioners

1576
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:11,839
And the Marshall physician and his Deputy Marshals

1577
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:15,935
Mainly what they're there for is the movement of inmates

1578
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:18,239
Pretrial Detention Center

1579
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:22,079
Going forward for trial in this earth acoustic imagine

1580
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:27,711
When they leave jail and go to the courthouse to Marshalls are kind of their 12 kind of fit and babysit the inmate

1581
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,295
Conceivably you might need those people if you're going to

1582
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,831
To take this guy in

1583
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,367
Who seems resistant

1584
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,695
Yeah it's a little bit of a stretch

1585
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,999
It's a little bit of a stretch but it doesn't

1586
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:40,767
Themes apps

1587
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,815
No I think I buy this

1588
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,839
Okay

1589
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:49,983
Pandora waiting arraignment for court hearings in this order thinks it's highly unusual to me

1590
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:54,591
That the marshals would be the one doing the Civil process on the chicken man

1591
01:14:55,103 --> 01:15:00,223
And Roswell you in the papers

1592
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,719
Homeland right at the house

1593
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,327
Probably more info towards you Alex when you're reporters

1594
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:19,935
Went through what you're calling it feels like a capitol building Roswell city hall

1595
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:26,335
Roswell Police Officers proper what they actually are a municipal complex

1596
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:30,687
They work for City Hall they do not work for the police department

1597
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,527
If you can imagine their kind of trumped-up Bayless

1598
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,087
So when Alex Jones

1599
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,695
Crack team of reporters down there too

1600
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,975
Two bailiffs

1601
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:47,327
Sprite and said we weren't involved

1602
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,655
And that spiraled out of control into like the police involved

1603
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:54,495
That's my guess based on everything I know about Alex Jones

1604
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,775
Kotoko doodle

1605
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,871
Along with me and Maya

1606
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:00,895
A story about

1607
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,527
I think I'm coming from

1608
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,879
Position to or trying to start a race war

1609
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:16,255
Start a race war

1610
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,791
We just been winning at

1611
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:24,703
Before we get too deep into that cuz I don't want to get into that

1612
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,727
Because we have something

1613
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,495
Really important

1614
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,543
So we have two more clips

1615
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,359
From the May 2nd episode

1616
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,175
Then we're going to go to the May 3rd and I'm going to put on my policy

1617
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:34,943
Ewok hat

1618
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,759
Okay cuz I'm going to talk.

1619
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:41,855
First

1620
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:48,255
Will you give listeners of warning so they can deposit turn it off

1621
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,815
The end of the show on May 2nd

1622
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,375
Is exactly what I was talking about

1623
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,143
Alexina

1624
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,167
Trapped in the studio

1625
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:58,495
He knows that the Bilderberg count

1626
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
Is coming up

1627
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,567
It is in Virginia

1628
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,847
And to what he does

1629
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,383
To fill the last

1630
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,175
What's a half hour of his show

1631
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,223
He's trying book reservations at the Marriott

1632
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,623
It's great

1633
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:17,695
It's so good

1634
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,231
Bonaire

1635
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:22,047
Actually I don't have a clip of it but John bowne

1636
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,583
The guy who only appears in those

1637
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,887
Curable voiceover reports

1638
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,959
You don't see his face

1639
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,751
But you hear him over the mic

1640
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,031
Just talking to Alex

1641
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,823
Very creepy

1642
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:38,687
It's very weird voice over

1643
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:41,247
To be honest it kind of sounds like he's high

1644
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,551
I'm not entirely sure I don't want to put that on it but

1645
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,575
He doesn't tear

1646
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,135
Begin

1647
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
Alex trying to get reservations at

1648
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:56,607
495

1649
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,191
Coming up

01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,215
May 29th

1651
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
Through

1652
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,007
June

1653
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,823

That would be nice and

1659
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
I want to say

1660
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,167
This is killer this is this is kind of long

1661
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:36,543
So please tell me if you want to pause at any point in telling me that we about to listen to

1662
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,335

01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:42,175

Alright it's Bethany's firework

This is

1668
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:54,975
This is one of my favorite long-term clips

1669
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,743
Great

1670
01:18:55,999 --> 01:19:00,351
Big Lots

1671
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:03,423

Also

1673
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:07,775
This is probably awake

1674
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,335
Because he didn't tell people that he was recording

1675
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,831
The 3rd of June

1676
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:25,695
I'd like to find out when I should arrive for that what time it starts

1677

That was a fake

1784
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,016
Lesson that Alex is going to learn

1785
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,296

01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,648
Doesn't realize Alex

1815
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,416

And is trying to

1817
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:06,720
To help him

1818
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:11,840
She is now being like what was another Marriott six miles away I can get you a room there

1819
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,120
It's not that far

1820
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:16,192
You can still go to the conference she's going above and beyond

1821
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:18,240
In terms of trying to find a resolution

1822
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,032
For his problem

1823
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:20,800
The commission for this

1824
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:29,760
All the major conference rooms they weren't using

1825
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,552
Priority shipping in the equipment

1826
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:37,952
Really serious question

1827
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:41,536
Osama Bin Laden was killed last year by Obama

1828
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:45,120
Great

1829
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:47,424
Cesar Lane ever lied

1830
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,960
Well you never know

1831
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,184
So at this point Alex

1832
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,232
Is thinking oh my God

1833
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,792
Booked it out even further

1834
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:14,816
I will see what happens

1835
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,336
How many nights I can get you

1836
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:27,872
Oh my gosh

1837
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,432
Get me one night right

1838
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,968
Before

1839
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:55,520
When is it closed for the conference

1840
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:07,296
But I can do the 28th

1841
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:12,416
I thought I thought it was closed

1842
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:15,488
I thought it was closed the 29th through the 3rd

1843
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,328
I'm able to

1844
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,264

Wow

1847
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:42,624
So it's just the first place is because

1848
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:49,024
Sometimes they're booked out on one of those nights and they're like no you can't get off hotel is complicated

1849
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:54,144
You don't want to have people moving room

1850
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,448
Course not

1851
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,240
You learned the end of that they

1852
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,264
I can get some nights

1853
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,664
Struggling

1854
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:09,248

We've been totally fine if you hang up on me

1863
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:35,616
Not if they say f*** or s*** to you

1864
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:39,712

01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,816
Let me tell you why

1872
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,352
And then she bores him

1873
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,888
Even more than he was boring

1874
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,192
So that like

1875
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,472
These really bad on his face

1876
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,544
On some level

1877
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,568
I'm supposed to be talking about

1878
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,360
This

1879
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,896
Prank call is it go

1880
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,944
What's up girl what you think

1881
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,480
Terrible

1882
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,368
Whatever

1883
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,904
You never know

1884
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:26,304
Started the regular voice

1885
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,120
Weird kind of got back to the regular voice

1886
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:29,888
And then

1887
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,192
She should have been like

1888
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,032
Play still alive

1889
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:39,360
Sergeant

1890
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,640
So

1891
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:46,016
And you might expect some of this.

1892
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:46,784
The carryover

1893
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,320
Some of these things

1894
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
Chickenman

1895
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,136
The Marriott

1896
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:51,904
We could get

1897
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,184
Days out of just the

1898
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:57,792
Actually come back up but there's nothing new about it you just bring it back up

1899
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,584
The Marriott drama

1900
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,608
Does not come back on

1901
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,144
Of course not they were

1902
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,448
They would prefer if that episode was not.

1903
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:10,848
Not available not being around doesn't come back up

1904
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:11,616
Illegal dumping

1905
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,384
Come back up

1906
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,200
It's not Osama Bin Laden doesn't come back up

1907
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:15,968
You know why

1908
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,760
Because he's dead

1909
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:18,784
But you know why

1910
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,808
That's a good theory

1911
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:20,832
There's another reason

1912
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:31,328
11

1913
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:33,888
Sounds right

1914
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,984
Milan

1915
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,480
Because I wanted to believe this wasn't true

1916
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:51,040
Official govtrack

1917
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,576
Site

1918
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:53,856
So

1919
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:56,160
The Marriott's have been closed

1920
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,440
For a full week

1921
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,744
I couldn't get the reservation

1922
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,608
Double check by Paul Joseph Watson

1923
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:07,168
He booked us two flights and then he was like

1924
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:09,984
Now we can't sit together and I was like

1925
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:10,752
Build-A-Bear

1926
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,568
This is FEMA camp

1927
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,336
S***

1928
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,104
Okay

1929
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,640
Vfm

1930
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:19,456
3-3 9.40

1931
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,736
Has come out

1932
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:21,760
This day

1933
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,296
They are not in history

1934
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,320
May 3rd

1935
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:27,648
Is this when we get all of our feet

1936
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:32,000
This is where it all becomes very real.

1937
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,048
I will discuss

1938
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,328
That

1939
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,120
Here in a minute

1940
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:37,888
But

1941
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,680
On the way there

1942
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:40,960
Alex Jones

1943
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,728
Brings up

1944
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:43,520
A bunch of building blocks

1945
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,800
For his

1946
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,592
Fed FEMA camps are coming

1947
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,128
And throughout this clip

1948
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,176
I'm going to pause it after each one

1949
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:50,944
Empty bunk

1950
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:51,968
Each one

1951
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,760
Jesus this is going to be

1952
01:36:54,016 --> 01:37:00,160
Me running the gauntlet I appreciate your thoroughness I'm so excited about this

1953
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:00,928
I know

1954
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:04,512
I can do anything

1955
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:14,496
We already know this we already knew that

1956
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:22,944
So the John Waters called corroborate

1957
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,992
You do need people

1958
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:25,760
Two confirmed

1959
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:32,416
John Warner defense authorization Act

1960
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:34,720
Largely pushed through by Republicans

1961
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:39,584
Sport in the in the Senate I have a list here of all the actual votes

1962
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:43,936
The only Republicans actually vote against

1963
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,240
Pretty thrilled with

1964
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:48,288
Feel feel pretty awesome

1965
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:51,104
About like yeah my guy voted against this thing

1966
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,664
Jeff sessions voted for it

1967
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,784
It's mostly

1968
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,320
Mike Pence voted for it

1969
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:05,696
Trump Circle in favor of it

1970
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:08,512
All of the names were Democrats with except

1971
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,304
Rand Paul

1972
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:12,864
Maybe we'll like Conyers if people like Dennis

1973
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,888
Kucinich

1974
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:16,960
Kucinich around

1975
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,776
Those were the Glory Days

1976
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:23,360
The reason that everyone was

1977
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,896
Concerned about it I'm not sure

1978
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,248
With it is because

1979
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:32,064
Inside this National Defense authorization bill

1980
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:34,880
I read all this

1981
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:35,904
I'm very excited

1982
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,464
Do you want to just do a lightning round

1983
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,536
I can't cuz some of this kind of complicated

1984
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,304
Comes out alright

1985
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,632
So it's operation bill for funding

1986
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,656
For the year 2

1987
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:48,192
Fiscal year 2000

1988
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,472
But

1989
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,752
It buried in it

1990
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,032
I wasn't Amendment

1991
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,312
To the Insurrection Act

1992
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:55,872
Is that

1993
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,920
Governing the rules

1994
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,968
What is an interaction where

1995
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:07,648
Basically would make it easier for the president to send in military troops in the case

1996
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,928
Of a terrorist attack

1997
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,720
An outbreak of some sort

1998
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:13,280
Or some situation that I believed the language

1999
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,048
Specifically is

2000
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,120
The president deems that is uncontrollable by local

2001
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,912
Local or state Authority

2002
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,680
Federal government

2003
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:23,264
Navigate to outbreak natural disaster terrorist attack

2004
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,544
He just change

2005
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,312
Change the language

2006
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,872
Of the belt is still

2007
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,688
It is murky

2008
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:34,272
Alex believe that it violates Posse Comitatus

2009
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,552
Course

2010
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:36,832
Cuz

2011
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:37,600
Ethanac

2012
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,368
Congress

2013
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,416
And Posse Comitatus

2014
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,184
Says that

2015
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,976
Except by an act of Congress

2016
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:44,768
The military cannot Act

2017
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:46,560
Law enforcement capability

2018
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,096
This is Max Congress

2019
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,632
Dumb file a Posse Comitatus

2020
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:52,960
It violates

2021
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,728
The spirit of

2022
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,568
Cuz

2023
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,592
Posse Comitatus

2024
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,360
Really

2025
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,384
Was always about

2026
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:01,920
Commenting on those pots

2027
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:11,392
Absolutely man look at that Posse walking by

2028
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:16,768
Who you are at baby iffy on Posse Comitatus being broken I say it's not

2029
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,328
Usually it doesn't matter

2030
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,352
And Alex is alive

2031
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,376
So many reasons

2032
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:24,192
So this was 2007 for the fiscal year 2000

2033
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,800
It doesn't matter because the 2008 defense authorization bill

2034
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:32,640
Entirely repeal the changes

2035
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:41,856
If you look

2036
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:47,232
In anyway like violate Posse Comitatus

2037
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:51,840
To declare an insurrection

2038
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:53,632
Interested in whatever they could they were like

2039
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,496
The next time that the bill came up it was discussed

2040
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:03,360
The next year at this episode

2041
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,640
This episode

2042
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:06,176
Is it 2012

2043
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,200
This is equal

2044
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:10,528
Complete Warriors after

2045
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,296
The matter anyway

2046
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,064
Exactly

2047
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,368
Lying about that

2048
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,648
Completely made up bulshit

2049
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,720
That's the same thing

2050
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:19,488
That's what he's talking about

2051
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,560
Zach

2052
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:26,144
DLC double-a the enemy commissions Act is not a real thing

2053
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:32,544
What are you talkin about is the military

2054
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:34,848
2000s

2055
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,200
The military commissions act also known as MCA

2056
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,992
It waved

2057
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,272
Habeas corpus right

2058
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,296
Do non-citizens

2059
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:45,088
Detained as enemy combatants

2060
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,160
Many people believe that the wording

2061
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,184
Was too vague

2062
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,232
And in effect what it could do

2063
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:54,048
Is allow military tribunals to waive habeas corpus

2064
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:54,816
Sprite

2065
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:55,584
To citizens

2066
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:58,400
Although if you actually read the wording of the belt

2067
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,936
It says specifically alien

2068
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:02,752
And if you want to let you know that could be Raptors

2069
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,848
I have no opinion whatsoever I think

2070
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:09,152
If you are born on American soil

2071
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,432
Regardless of speed

2072
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,200
What up

2073
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:16,320
So a lot of people still upset about this was also on board

2074
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:21,696
And it needed to be looked into

2075
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:26,048
Someone brought suit

2076
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,072
In a 2000

2077
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,608
8 ruling of

2078
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,888
Boumediene

2079
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:30,912
Versus bush

2080
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:37,312
The Supreme Court ruled that the mcai was unconstitutional and would restrict detainees habeas corpus

2081
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,872
That's right and the right to appear in federal court

2082
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,920
Even in the context

2083
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,480
If non-citizen pedim. That was

2084
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,040
The necessary changes

2085
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,624
So there are still problems

2086
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,160
Yeah but it's not this

2087
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,464
Enemy combatant

2088
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,744
Military Commission

2089
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,304
Cuz they don't exist

2090
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,864
Right then the necessary changes

2091
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:03,936
Does that were requested about the habeas corpus

2092
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:05,984
Rules that were deemed unconstitutional

2093
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:06,752
To Channel 5

2094
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:07,520
Supreme Court

2095
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,568
Were made in the military commission Act

2096
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,336
2000

2097
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,408
3 years before the episode that we're listening to now

2098
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,688
AMV Affirmed

2099
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:17,504
That all detainees at access to US federal courts

2100
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,528
The challenge Reddit

2101
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,320
Unless

2102
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:22,880
And that's the other thing

2103
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:25,952
We still haven't closed Guantanamo Bay

2104
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:31,584
Well the other thing isn't like a lot of these things are probably to save face more than they are too.

2105
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,168
Militia types

2106
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,960
They're more to avoid I haven't

2107
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:40,032
To deal with your dad allow themselves

2108
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:40,800
Fresh

2109
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:46,688
So everybody go back to the ndaa because he mentioned that asked for the John Warner defense

2110
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:47,456
Authorization bill

2111
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:49,504
That is their sort of intertwine

2112
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,808
A little bit of credit

2113
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:56,416
Because there was also an ndaa the past in there the end of 2011

2114
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,952
Year 2012

2115
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:58,976
Which brought the

2116
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,000
Rules

2117
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,536
No no it is

2118
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:08,704
The issue the people bring up with the NBA of 2012 is that it brought up the question of indefinite

2119
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,240
The Detention of enemy combatant

2120
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,800
So it's a very idea

2121
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,592
Most legal Scholars

2122
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,152
Who have chimed in on the matter has made the case

2123
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,432
Based on the wording of the app

2124
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:19,456
It doesn't

2125
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:24,064
The NBA does not in any way Amanda powers that already exist

2126
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:27,904
I do to the authorization of military force

2127
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,952
Launched

2128
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:31,232
The beginning of the

2129
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,792
So the indefinite detention

2130
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,816
Aspect of it

2131
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:36,096
He's not real

2132
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:39,424
Because within the authorization of military force act

2133
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,448
Which govern

2134
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,496
This ndaa

2135
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,800
It's not indefinite detention

2136
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,616
End

2137
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:49,408
With the cessation of hostilities

2138
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,712
So whenever the war is over

2139
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,736
Detention Mustang

2140
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,296
Is never going to be

2141
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:58,624
That's the other problem

2142
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,904
The actual problem is

2143
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:03,488
It's the idea of having a war against an ideology or some sort of

2144
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,512
Nebulous concept

2145
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:08,096
As opposed to the idea that if you're at war with

2146
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,376
Let's say Sweden

2147
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:11,168
If you detain swedes

2148
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:16,800
Until the end of the war that's what the ndaa and the authorization of military force act allowed

2149
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,152
Severe rule in the ndaa

2150
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:23,968
Overridden by the MCA

2151
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:25,248
Reflect

2152
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:27,040
BR authorization of military

2153
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,576
So it is

2154
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:30,368
Not actually some sort of thing that

2155
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:34,720
Powers already

2156
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:37,024
Sing like that

2157
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,048
Exactly

2158
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:50,848
Do you model State emergency Health Powers Act

2159
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:57,760
During this one this one's real thought this one isn't

2160
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,320
So this was not a bill it was a

2161
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:01,856
Avabel

2162
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,392
I was written by Lauren

2163
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:06,208
Goston who's the director of the center of Law and Public Health

2164
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:07,744
The Georgetown University

2165
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,304
In association with Johns Hopkins and the CDC

2166
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:16,192
Written it was written right after the anthrax scare

2167
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,728
When we were all so

2168
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:19,264
We ain't right

2169
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:23,616
People I realize that we needed a systematic plan in order to deal with

2170
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,640
Potential bioterrorism

2171
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:26,176
Especially in the case of

2172
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:31,552
Contagious disease smart that could become a plague like Zane

2173
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:35,648
You could end up with a complete disaster.

2174
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:38,464
This Lawrence Coston realized

2175
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,256
The situation that could be ahead of

2176
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,560
And so he wrote up a bock bill

2177
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:48,704
Model State emergency Health Powers Act is not about a model or ideal State it's a bottle at

2178
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:49,984
Right it is

2179
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:53,568
If you look at it cuz you can find it it's available online it says

2180
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,408
Phil senators name here

2181
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,432
Bright

2182
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:00,992
There are a number of states that have now implement

2183
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,784
I have brought it through

2184
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:07,392
And implemented bills that are similar to sort of a framework

2185
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:10,464
Can you make their own changes that need to be made state by state

2186
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,768
It's not a federal thing

2187
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,560
Every state has the right

2188
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:18,400
Decide to introduce

2189
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,680
Alex should be thrilled with it

2190
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,960
It's a states rights thing

2191
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,496
It's not federal

2192
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:24,544
Alex has never seen schoolhouse

2193
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:26,848
It's not a federal power grab and

2194
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:29,664
It's not even that part of the song is not like

2195
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:37,088
I'm definitely not a bill I'm a model f****** bill I mean ivr loan I'm an idea

2196
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:42,208
The issue with that though is that it is not

2197
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,488
Like this Lawrence Coston

2198
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,048
Keep the way he wrote it was

2199
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:50,656
Kind of short-sighted

2200
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:53,472
The bill is written in a way that doesn't adequately protect

2201
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,496
Against the misuse

2202
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,520
Has powers

2203
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,056
But it could Branson emerge

2204
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,104
Right

2205
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,944
Generally when the states implemented there are

2206
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,576
Form of it

2207
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:09,600
So Alex is

2208
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:10,880
Misleading people again

2209
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,024
With the idea of like

2210
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:23,168
Any didn't put the Protections in there because he never confirmed

2211
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,704
Revolver

2212
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,472
We're doing this

2213
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,312
Emergency centers

2214
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:36,992
Lightning round emergency Sanders establishment Act is also known as HR 645

2215
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:42,624
This is legitimately just a plan for the office of Homeland Security to establish Regional refugee camps

2216
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:45,952
In recognition that there could be a natural disaster or attack

2217
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:48,256
There may be a need to

2218
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:50,048
Yeah these are built

2219
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:51,072
General Lyon quotes

2220
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,352
Closed military

2221
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,400
I think it's closed is why they put it

2222
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:56,960
Military installations whenever possible

2223
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:59,264
Because the land is already owned by the government

2224
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,544
And there will always be

2225
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,080
There's already substantial

2226
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,872
A structure on these military bases

2227
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:05,920
There's already permanent structures built

2228
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:09,504
And they're closed military bases that are being used for anything else

2229
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,784
Yeah

2230
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:14,112
Generally military installations are built and relatively safe place

2231
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,648
In terms of flooding

2232
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,672
In terms of that stuff

2233
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:21,280
So it would be an ideal place to take this place people when there's already a flood

2234
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:22,048
Let's say

2235
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,328
It would be

2236
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,352
For that

2237
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:26,400
So Alex makes a big deal out of it

2238
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:27,424
It's not it's not

2239
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,472
If you can read the entire bill

2240
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,752
4 pages long

2241
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,056
It's not at all

2242
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,848
Scary

2243
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,616
Doterra people

2244
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:38,688
Coraline naming a bunch of bills it don't say what do you think

2245
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:44,320
Program

2246
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:45,600
So

2247
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,368
This one

2248
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,416
Okay this is

2249
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,024
Like hearing you say this might be real

2250
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:59,168
A little bit and from everything I can tell there are

2251
01:49:59,424 --> 01:49:59,936
We have private

2252
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:01,984
A for-profit prisons

2253
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:05,824
This country wants to start talking about that a little bit more

2254
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,872
I don't really care about the inmate labor

2255
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:10,176
Well I mean the situation with

2256
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:12,992
The Wildfire right now we have inmates

2257
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:16,576
Core fighting this fire $0.20 an hour

2258
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:18,880
We are literally using slaves

2259
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:19,648
To fight fire

2260
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:26,560
No it's a big issue it's a huge issue and you can see that

2261
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:33,984
Where they have people doing a slave labor

2262
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:39,104
Clinton and Bill at the time where they were in the Arkansas Governor's

2263
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:40,384
Play slave labor day

2264
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,152
Absolutely

2265
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:45,504
2

2266
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,528
M2

2267
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:48,064
Real eagle-eyes in slavery

2268
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:48,832
Through

2269
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:50,624
Are private for-profit prisons

2270
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:55,232
And it's a good thing that we have the most prisoners in the entire world

2271
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:58,048
Yeah that's a good idea

2272
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:03,680
So Alex is conveniently

2273
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,960
Somebody brings up all the time

2274
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:06,496
Kind of strange

2275
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:08,800
84

2276
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:13,408
They often brings up when it comes to the idea of these FEMA camps

2277
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,200
Together of

2278
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:15,968
Oppressive

2279
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:17,504
Oppressiveness on population

2280
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:20,320
I'm just going to read this year

2281
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:21,344
About Rex

2282
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,112
84

2283
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:28,512
Readiness exercise 1984 rex-84 pursuer with a scenario and drill created under the Reagan Administration by Oliver North

2284
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:31,584
Deputy director John Brinkerhoff

2285
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,888
Throughout the Reagan Administration the Black Ops

2286
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:35,680
So the US Military Intelligence agencies

2287
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:36,960
Effectively ran Wild

2288
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:41,312
Especially in Latin America where Reagan's aggressive intervention many times words.

2289
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,336
Unintentional genocide

2290
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,408
The CIA backing

2291
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,688
Amid violence

2292
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:50,016
Environment the scenario described in rx84 is rather disturbing

2293
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:52,064
He called for the rounding up of

2294
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,112
And pre-emptive Detention of Human Rights

2295
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:55,136
Anti-war activist

2296
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,928
As well as Latino

2297
01:51:57,696 --> 01:52:00,000
The ironic part about rex-84 which many Wingnut

2298
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:05,888
Is that the program was targeted against civil rights groups anti-war groups organized labor immigrants

2299
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:07,168
The minority communities in

2300
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:10,496
Port of hegemonic capitalist right-wing American pin

2301
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,080
FEMA camps are not as conspiracy theorists would have

2302
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,104
Some Grand plot against

2303
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,640
Conservative American Patriot

2304
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:20,736
Rather the only Administration to seriously consider interning dissidence

2305
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:22,016
Was planning on doing so

2306
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:24,064
Against the sort of left-wing activists

2307
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,344
Did the American far right

2308
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,112
Despise the most

2309
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,392
Who Woulda guessed

2310
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:28,928
Those from rationale Wiki

2311
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:32,768
That is actually

2312
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:36,608
Can't imagine any kind of situation where that

2313
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,888
Miss you

2314
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,912
Nose

2315
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:45,312
It's f****** Christ so there we have in this clip so far

2316
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:48,640
Go into effect

2317
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:51,968
Defense authorization bill

2318
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,016
NBAA military commissions

2319
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:55,296
Model State emergency

2320
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,064
DC Powers Act

2321
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,856
Emergency centers establishment Act

2322
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:59,648
Maybe the inmate labor camp

2323
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:01,184
Racist

2324
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,464
Grace is that bad

2325
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:08,864
Still out of the six that he mentioned that are completely bogus and he's misrepresenting and lying to his audience about

2326
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,168
Musically

2327
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:12,704
Overruled

2328
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,472
The next

2329
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,008
Then he knows the

2330
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:16,032
He has to know that

2331
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,360
Does he know when I say he has to know that I mean

2332
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:20,640
This is John

2333
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,176
He has to know this

2334
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:27,552
Okay that's a way better way I'm guessing you probably dumb and doesn't know it

2335
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:30,368
Needs to know this

2336
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,672
Cuz he's riling up militia people

2337
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:34,464
He's riling up

2338
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:38,560
Bucking Weirdo anti-semites And racist

2339
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:39,328
Into a camp

2340
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:41,376
What are you lying about every single piece

2341
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:42,144
Piece of the way

2342
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:50,848
The last few years for interment specialist

2343
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:54,176
Forgot another lightning round

2344
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:55,968
I thought we had made it

2345
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:58,784
Nope

2346
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,832
So Alex says that they're ramping up

2347
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:01,856
The hiring of

2348
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:03,136
Internment specialist

2349
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:07,232
And the only thing that he has to back this up is that they had of posting

2350
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:09,280

Staffing confine

2360
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,480
Here's the first thing this article says

2361
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:29,760
Caution

2362
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:33,344
This is an exercise and ongoing citizen research in journalism

2363
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:35,648
Consider yourself inside the news off

2364
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,440
With some reports

2365
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,720
Verity is Asher

2366
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:39,488
With others

2367
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:42,048
Further corroboration of refutation must be done

2368
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:44,352
Consider yourself also in the war room

2369
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:46,656
Some positions and suspicious suspicious

2370
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:48,192
Must also be considered

2371
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:49,472
Implants preparation

2372
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:50,752
Executions thereof

2373
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,080
And none of this is real

2374
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:56,896
You think I'm top in the article that he wrote

2375
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,664
Hey warning

2376
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:00,736
I don't know about that I don't know a goddamn thing

2377
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:01,760
Imagine it

2378
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:02,784
Was true

2379
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,320
Leopard Planet place

2380
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,088
Together

2381
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:08,416
Just in case also one of these that one of the authors on

2382
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:12,000
This renewamerica site where this article is posted is Larry

2383
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:18,400
Claiming we know as the crazy lawyer was involved in the dentist Montgomery

2384
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:22,752
If you scroll down you find links

2385
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:24,544
Places like the

2388
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:29,408
S*** hit the fan plan.com

2389
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,688
Which is a preparedness

2390
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,968
Website where is

2391
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:34,528
Covered with gold and silver sales ads

2392
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:36,576
Completely covered

2393
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:38,112
But there's one add-on

2394
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:39,904
I think it's very special hide your guns

2395
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:40,928
Big Berkey

2396
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:47,328
Pittsburgh comeback

2397
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:52,192
Berkey was via the water

2398
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,776
Big Berkey

2399
01:55:57,312 --> 01:56:01,152
I don't think that there's any evidence

2400
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:01,920
Any of that

2401
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,944
Was opposed

2402
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:04,992
Specialist

2403
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:05,760
And that's reason

2404
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,296
Because there are internment position

2405
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:09,856
An ongoing theater

2406
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,392
Just that bad

2407
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:13,952
But that would be valuable for any number of

2408
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:18,816
In the United States that I Whenever there are like

2409
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:21,632

01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,328
Closer and closer to him like

2434
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:56,608
Making apps

2435
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,144
Right

2436
01:57:58,656 --> 01:57:59,680

2437
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:03,776

2439
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:12,224
I feel pretty good about that research

2440
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:18,368
Read a lot of documents could you be a little bit more pleased with yourself I can't

01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:26,560
I would actually I would like to send this clip to Alanis Morissette

2444
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:28,864
Because I think this clip is the definition

2445
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,912
Can of irony

2446
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:31,680
Oh yeah

2447
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,128

01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,152
Teepublic

2449
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:43,200
Oh my God

2450
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:46,272
Bicycling

2451
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:57,280
Biopsy

2452
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:11,872
Contractor

2453
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:16,480
You're being fed psyops in lies as well your your future is being destroyed

2454
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:17,504
Interesting

2455
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,272
Alex

2456
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:20,064
That's amazing

2457
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,600
It's so crazy

2458
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:26,976
Write that.

2459
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:28,256
Pieczenik in their new life

01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:31,072
2015 invest

2461
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:33,376
Navigation we've seen as Steve pieczenik

2462
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:35,424
Crazy calling on Alex

2463
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:38,752
And like exactly what he saying there is what happened to him

2464
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,032
Exactly what happened

2465
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:40,800
Crazy

2466
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:47,712
He's so gullible gorgeous of people who are immune to con men are always the ones who go

2467
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:48,736
Hook Line & Sinker

2468
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:52,576
Elizabeth

2469
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:55,648
No Alex has one more b*******

2470
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:56,416
I still think

2471
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:57,184
He gave that Niger

2472
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:01,280
Oh yeah

2473
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,072
My friend

2474
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:05,888
Yeah

2475
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:06,656
Do you have evidence

2476
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:07,424
The FEMA camp

2477
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:31,232
So what do you think about that

2478
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,792
I mean if that is

2479
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:34,816
Your master plan

2480
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,608
It seems like it'll be messy

2481
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,912
They're like more fact

2482
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:40,448
Voices are there cheaper

2483
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:41,472
To do it I assume then

2484
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:44,032
Organizing a mass war against

2485
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,568
Internal

2486
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:50,688
Mleota

2487
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:51,712
Nle donut

2488
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:55,040
Website

2489
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,832
The truth if I can research it

2490
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:57,856
Which I want

2491
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:59,136
But I can

2492
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:00,160
That means you must

2493
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:02,464
OU

2494
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,232
You should not have done

2495
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:11,168
Google go to the website

2496
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:16,288
What are things you find is a press release dated July 24th 2009

2497
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:22,176
3 years before Alex's last episode we're listening to right now from the Homeland

2498
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:23,200
Security website

2499
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:24,992
Does for immediate release

2500
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,016
Suppressor

2501
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:33,440
The Department of Homeland Security will launch a national level exercise 2009

2502
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:34,720
Nle 09

2503
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:38,048
The first national level exercise to focus on terrorism prevent

2504
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:41,888
In conjunction with federal state local tribal private sector and

2505
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:42,912
International partners

2506
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:48,544
Coordinating with our partners across the United States and around the world is critical to protecting the nation

2507
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,312
Terrorist attack

2508
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:51,360
XO secretary Janet Napolitano

2509
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:55,456
The national level exercise allows us to test our capabilities in real time

2510
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:57,248
Can find and strengthen our strategies

2511
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,784
For preventing terrorist attack

2512
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:00,832
This is something that has been going on

2513
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:01,856
For a number of

2514
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:07,488
It's a different name before that but this is just a joint

2515
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:08,512
Exercise that's done

2516
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:10,048
It doesn't always

2517
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:11,328
Involved

2518
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:13,120
Countries

2519
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:18,496
International partner Nations will include Australia Canada Mexico and the United Kingdom

2520
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:20,288
The Navajo Nation will also be

2521
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:22,336
Okay

2522
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:26,944
Training exercises

2523
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:30,528
I understand if they come up with a scenario

2524
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:36,928
Have them run through the scenario and how they would coordinate with each other and

2525
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:40,000
Like like

2526
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:41,280
In real life work

2527
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:43,072
Supposed to us

2528
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:45,376
It's like with the idea behind Jade helm

2529
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,656
Yeah

2530
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,680
You can't train

2531
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:49,216
In Iraq

2532
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:51,264
You know you can't do that today

2533
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:56,896
Targeting civilians

2534
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:58,432
Utrade on your own turf

2535
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:00,992
To get better at doing things elsewhere

2536
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:04,320
Or even to get better at doing things here cuz terrorist to do exist

2537
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:05,856
So

2538
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:06,880
This is bulshit

2539
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:09,440
There are 15 Nations I can find no evidence

2540
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:12,512
4 +

2541
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:14,048
Which which would the other

2542
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:18,912
Okay

2543
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:20,192
Oron

2544
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:21,984
New axis of Evil

2545
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:23,520
2009

2546
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:25,056
Channel 9

2547
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:26,080
Italy

2548
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:27,104
Wait

2549
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:35,552
Axis Powers actually actually yes those would absolutely be there

2550
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:38,368
Spain

2551
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:42,464
And why not Luxembourg they got a huge terrorism issue but a difference

2552
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:43,232
60 years make

2553
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:48,608
Absolutely so Alex loop on the third is stealing

2554
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:50,144
Tomato pole working on that

2555
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:51,680
Alex

2556
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:53,984
He hasn't read this

2557
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:54,752
Lupus

2558
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,824
Alex has not read this fm3.

2559
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:58,848
39.4

2560
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:00,896
I know that

2561
02:04:01,152 --> 02:04:01,664
Because

2562
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:03,712
It's very long

2563
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:04,480
That was

2564
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:05,504
That was all I needed

2565
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:06,784
If hundreds of page

2566
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,552
All I need

2567
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:08,832
Absolutely

2568
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:13,184
Lost in the Phantom can't even make it all the way through the Hobbit

2569
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:15,232
The Hobbit

2570
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:20,352
That's not even Lord of the Rings were talking about The Hobbit

2571
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:22,144
He read the chapter titles

2572
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:24,192
Yeah that's the headline of a novel

2573
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:33,920
The headlight of the novel it was certainly true in Around the World in 80 Days with long-ass titles

2574
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:39,040
I'm a big fan of that

2575
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,320
Chapter titles from

2576
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:42,624
Blood Meridian Cormac McCarthy

2577
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:44,160
Which is just a short synopsis

2578
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:46,720
You read the chapter titles to be like

2579
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,512
I got it

2580
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:54,912
In this clip Alex is the devil

2581
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:57,984

Important

2589
02:05:57,376 --> 02:06:01,984
Thomas a coward tortures will sit back while troops are.

2590
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:04,800
Yeah

2591
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:16,576
39.4

2592
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,416
Manual for operation

2593

Internment

2594
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,208
Inforum

2595
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:24,768
A talks about

Host Nations

2597

Repeatedly and

2598
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:29,632
Conspiracy theorists

2599
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:30,400
Such as Alex

2600
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:31,680
Hundred

2601
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:32,448
It's a bother

2602
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:33,984
Websites that you can find

2603
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:34,752
If you Google it

2604
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:36,032
They misrepresent

2605
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:37,568
Something that's very important

2606
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,872
There are a couple packages

2607
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:40,640
About

2608
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:41,408
Operation

2609
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:44,992
Little bit about that before

2610
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:46,784
Okay just because it is

2611
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:48,576
Did it is what part of the light about

2612
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:50,624
It isn't this isn't like because it's Sunday

2613
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:53,440
This is the aftermath

2614
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:59,840
They talked about how to change operations from

2615
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:01,888
What they would do in a foreign

2616
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:02,912
Incase

2617
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:04,192

2621
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:09,824
Operation

2622
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:10,848
Address consequence

2623
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:12,896
Natural or man-made disasters

2624
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:15,200
Terrorist attacks or incidents in the United States

2625
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:21,088
Yeah it's something that you would need

2626
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:22,624
Cuz otherwise you're going to have masks

2627
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:23,904

Is

2630
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:29,280
They conflate

2631
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:31,072
The most

2632
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:33,376
That guy book

2633
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:35,168

They don't

2637
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:41,824
Realize that all of the stuff

2638
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:43,104
About psyops

2639
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:44,384
About

Contempt

2642
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:47,200
And all that stuff

2643
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:48,480
Is despotism

2644
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:50,016
Very very germane

2645
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,296
24in

2646
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:52,320
Force

2647
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:54,112
Back there are tons

2648
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:56,416
The generals who have gone on record and said

2649
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:57,184
I wish

2650
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,464
That we'd had this

2651
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:01,280
When I was when I was in

2652
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:02,560
When I was in the ship

2653
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:04,864
Did the the

2654
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:06,144
Basically all it is is

2655
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,424
A reflection

2656
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,192
Alexa

2657
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:10,240
And learned from Vietnam and

2658
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,008
Cambodia

2659
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:13,056
Those times

2660
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:15,616
We had we had

2661
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:19,200
All of them but they tried to detain people you had

2662
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:23,040
You had political dissenters in there and there's there is a better way to

2663
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:24,064
To deal with them

2664
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:25,600
Then

2665
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:26,368
Violence

2666
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:29,440
Absolutely

2667
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:31,232
I don't understand why it is

2668
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,000
They White

2669
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:32,768
Why are we

2670
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:33,536
Even

2671
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:34,304
Trying whiskey

2672
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:40,704
No I mean anytime they talk about bills or anything like that

2673
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,472
The conspiracy

2674
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:42,496
It doesn't matter

2675
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:44,288
They're going to find a way

2676
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:47,872
Only way to not deal with conspiracy theories

2677
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:49,152
Is if you don't

2678
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:50,176
Publishers

2679
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:53,504
Information which you should but if you don't publish

2680
02:08:54,016 --> 02:09:00,160
That means the conspiracy theorists going to be like what are they hiding from or if it gets found then so you're trying to hide this from

2681
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:02,208
What we need to accept is that

2682
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:05,536
Conspiracy theorist on this level are just like Hoarders

2683
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:07,584
People with Siri

2684
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:12,192
Depression or something along those lines

2685
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:16,032
That bright but in the same way that not all orders are

2686
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:18,336
Are people with Siri

2687
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:19,104
But

2688
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:26,784
No it is actually I want to get let me get through this document then I want to get back to what you're talkin about.

2689
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:27,552
Fortin point that we need

2690
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:30,624
Foreign policy

2691
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,904
The article

2692
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:32,672
389

2693
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:35,744
390. 69

2694
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:42,912
2008 Serge there were few guidelines and regulations to help soldiers conducting

2695
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:43,680
These massive detention

2696
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:44,448
Operation

2697
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:46,240
According to a former military officer

2698
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:47,776
Who conducted detainee operations

2699
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:49,312
Facilities in Iraq

2700
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:52,640
Quote I would have loved to have this field manual 5 years ago

2701
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:54,688
The vast majority of guidance

2702
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:55,968
To the manuals intended for you

2703
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:56,736
Using foreign theater

2704
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:59,040
Noting that only a handful of paragraphs

2705
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,064
326

2706
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,856
Backpage Manuel address domestic

2707
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:05,184
An army spokesman speaking on background said

2708
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,720
The current state of online posting

2709
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:09,536
I taken passages from the manual significantly out of

2710
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:12,352
Conflating wartime operational guidance

2711
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:14,144
Psychological operation

2712
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:15,936
With peacetime operation

2713
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:18,240
In which a limited number of the manual

2714
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:20,288
Principles will be applied on us soil

2715
02:10:20,544 --> 02:10:22,592
In exceptional cases such as the relief efforts

2716
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:23,872
After Hurricane

2717
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:26,176
Now granted the hurricane

2718
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:27,712
300,000 bungling

2719
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:32,832
What have you here I think is the most sale

2720
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:35,392
Lead us to what I wanted to get to

2721
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:37,440
Yeah that is

2722
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:40,512
Radicalization is driven in large part by victimization

2723
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:44,352
Ameritas whether it's fear of Big Brother watching Big Bank looting big government

2724
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,376
Season 1

2725
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:46,912
For big global war on is

2726
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:50,752
A document like FM 3-3 9.40

2727
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:51,520
Is red is a

2728
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:54,592
Confirming the worst fears of an unusually wide spectrum

2729
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:56,384
Political dissenters radicals

2730
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,408
And would be violent

2731
02:10:57,664 --> 02:10:58,688
Extremists from the right left

2732
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:00,224
Gasoline

2733
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,016
So

2734
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:04,320
Radicalization

2735
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:05,088
Immigration narrative

2736
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:05,856
This is really the most

2737
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:08,672
And that is what you experience

2738
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:09,696
Everyday listen

2739
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:10,464
Alex Jones

2740
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:14,304
Now I want it I want here's the point that I wanted to bring

2741
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:16,608
I don't think the quest

2742
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:17,376
German government

2743
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:21,216
Being skeptical is at all on how you were saying

2744
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:22,240
Absolutely not

2745
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:24,032
But I am getting

2746
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:25,312
Elote

2747
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:28,384
Like Alex says this frequently that

2748
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,408
Conspiracy theory

2749
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:33,248
Especially Rodger Stone and then bring this up because of JFK files are come

2750
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:34,272
Coming out right like that

2751
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:35,808
Although the ones that

2752
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:37,344
It's important

2753
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:39,904
Did not come out now which is like what a Cox

2754
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,720
Is the American government

2755
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:46,048
But

2756
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:48,608
Alex make this point of Rodger stone make

2757
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:50,912
And then I'll need supposedly

2758
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:52,704
Jimmy Dore make this point on Twitter

2759
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:54,240
The idea that

2760
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:55,264
Conspiracy theorist

2761
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,312
Does the term popularized by

2762
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:58,336
The government

2763
02:11:58,848 --> 02:12:01,152
CIA after the JFK assassination

2764
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:03,968
To Tar and feather all the people who a question

2765
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:05,504
Send about it and make them look like crazy

2766
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:09,344
Maybe you guys made yourselves look like

2767
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:12,672
Possible but also if you look into it

2768
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:14,208
If you do a deep dive on it

2769
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:14,976
You will find

2770
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:16,256
That

2771
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,024
Be termed

2772
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:18,048
Conspiracy theorist

2773
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:20,864
Has had the exact same conversation that it has

2774
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:21,888
Currently

2775
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,168
Dating back

2776
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:23,936
2D

2777
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:26,752
Mid-to-late 80

2778
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:30,336
There are instances of a being used in the exact same

2779
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:34,176
Slightly pejorative or slightly dismissive way right

2780
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:34,944
Over

2781
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:36,480
150 years

2782
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:37,504
It's not on

2783
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,552
This idea.

2784
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:45,952
The government was like a we're going to use the term it's going to catch on like wildfire anything more appropriate

2785
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:46,976
Conspiracy theorist

2786
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:47,744
Thinking that

2787
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,024
Conspiracy theorist

2788
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,304
Is a conspiracy

2789
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,072
Bingo

2790
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:53,888
Perpetuates victimization

2791
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:55,424
Narratives which fueled

2792
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:59,520
Experiencing in the world

2793
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:01,568
But you know the one thing that

2794
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:02,592
It is

2795
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:06,176
What should be taken away from that is the things that word list

2796
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:08,224
Are all

2797
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:11,552
Things like I don't like the government isn't

2798
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:15,136
But they are going to

2799
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:16,672
Make you not be able to get an abortion

2800
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:18,208
F****** cry

2801
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:23,840
The things that they described radicalized

2802
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:25,120
The people and their things

2803
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:25,888
The government has

2804
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:26,656
Has done

2805
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:27,936
To us

2806
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:30,240
Right and that is why we are radical

2807
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:32,544
Spear of the Big Bang

2808
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:37,152
They are absolutely maybe they should stop that and we wouldn't be afraid

2809
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:39,968
You could conceivably

2810
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:41,760
Now this is crazy dad

2811
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:45,856
You could make that go foreign policy did not do the best job of coming up with

2812
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:51,232
Examples

2813
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:54,816
Entirely remiss

2814
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:57,120
If I don't point out that like

2815
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:59,424
A lot of the things that conspiracy theorist

2816
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:00,960
Are conspiracy theories

2817
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:03,008
Think about our things that

2818
02:14:03,264 --> 02:14:03,776
You know like

2819
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:10,432
There's some history two people doing that like false flag narrative have a route in reality

2820
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:11,456
Stuff that happened

2821
02:14:11,712 --> 02:14:17,088
6070 years ago like a lot of Tonkin

2822
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:18,368
And stuff like that that's

2823
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:19,904
A long time in the past

2824
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:21,696
They have to scramble to

2825
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:24,000
Turn current event into false flag

2826
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:26,560
In order to be like they're still doing it

2827
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:31,168
And when you do that when you have that mentality you end up saying things like say

2828
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:31,936
Sandy Hook is fake

2829
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:34,496
By the way Alex Jones the other day

2830
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,520
Said Sandy Hook was

2831
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,824
In 2017

2832
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:39,360
He said Sandy Hook was fake

2833
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:41,152
You got to give the man credit

2834
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:47,552
For going back on it you know why cuz he probably heard Steve pieczenik say that someone scared him out of believing any like

2835
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:49,344
F*** you

2836
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:53,952
Right

2837
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:54,720
Who's going to stop

2838
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:56,000
Who gives

2839
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:59,584
It's not like literally the only people who are like

2840
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:03,424
You need to stop this guy or at least

2841
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:05,728
Crye-Leike

2842
02:15:05,984 --> 02:15:07,008
Yeah.

2843
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:10,592
Not like Kelly I'm not like taking off the air anyting

2844
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:20,064
Arrested for arrest

2845
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,112
Or the thing where you arrest him

2846
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:24,160
Being an accessory to Larry Nichols

2847
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:30,560
Blackmail are coming down

2848
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:35,680
I don't want to do that I don't either

2849
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:39,776
We recording this on Sunday and the so we don't know who the indictments

2850
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:43,104
Therefore also recordings on Sunday so we don't know what Rodger

2851
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:45,664
Just don't response is going to be to be kicked off Twitter

2852
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:52,064
No actually did bring me Rodger Stone

2853
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:58,464
Documentary someone tweeted at Salix to port or whatever that Rogers

2854
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:04,864
Stone is tweeting from the he's moved over to his other account and he wrote back I've always been here slapstick

2855
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:11,008
Which I love

2856
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:13,056
Make me think

2857
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:13,824
Jeff Jarrett

2858
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:16,384
The wrestler Jeff Jerry's to call people slapnut

2859
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:19,200
Trial of people with a guitar

2860
02:16:19,456 --> 02:16:19,968
Cocaine

2861
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:21,248
Like El kabong

2862
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:22,784
Yeah basically

2863
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,600
How do we know what El kabong

2864
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:28,672
So

2865
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:30,976
Let's move

2866
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:34,816
A pretty good job of debunking a lot of this

2867
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:37,376
In the lightning round

2868
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:38,656
You got 546

2869
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:41,216
I was even like

2870
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:42,240
I don't know

2871
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:46,336
It looks like they could be real

2872
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:48,896
You the one on the feud for sure but on the

2873
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:51,968
$25,000 Pyramid

2874
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:54,016
All of them are

2875
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:55,296
Hot dog

2876
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:57,344
So let's get it

2877
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,880
In the next clip

2878
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:00,416
We get a further

2879
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,184
Extension

2880
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:02,208
Of the mythology

2881
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:02,976
Give Alex Jones

2882
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:03,744
Does father

2883
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,280
The CIA dentist

2884
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:10,144
But that is not what

2885
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:17,824
Everytime I look at my children other people's children out innocent

2886
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:21,920
I realize that we just absolutely should be honored

2887
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:29,856
The only fair you need to have is a

2888
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:33,952
You're alive this one X people in this test

2889
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:36,000
This is so real

2890
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,024
Fake crying again

2891
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:43,168
It is accelerated it's built to a fever Crescendo my father

2892
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:47,264
Was approached by a patient of 10 years

2893
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:51,360
The homeland security spy

2894
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:53,408
Spy on his

2895
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:55,200
Patience why

2896
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:56,224
My dad

2897
02:17:57,504 --> 02:17:59,808
It was real

2898
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:01,856
Call the card number Olive

2899
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:09,024
Homeland Security

2900
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:10,560
Okay

2901
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:16,448
The average person gets approached by this and gets on a power trip if you're out there listening think you're special

2902
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:17,472
Pretty sure

2903
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:23,872
No wonder I wake up with Dennis 6 a.m.

2904
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,736
Useful idiot moron

2905
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:29,504
Okay

2906
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,808
And the people

2907
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:41,792
He said the only talked to her the same way

2908
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:45,120
Yahoo.com

2909
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:47,424
People are filthy

2910
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:50,496
Military working for

2911
02:18:55,616 --> 02:19:00,736
Chicago

2912
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:06,624
5 years later I can

2913
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:13,024
Confirm Chicago still here

2914
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:13,792
I don't either

2915
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:16,096
A really good job

2916
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:19,936
Preemptively contextualizing any whites

2917
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:21,472
Supremacist militia attack

2918
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:22,496
Globalist

2919
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:24,288
Strength

2920
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:25,312
It's

2921
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:28,384
But

2922
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:30,176
I can't

2923
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:31,200
Can't hang with

2924
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:32,480
This narrative about his dad

2925
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:34,016
And here's why

2926
02:19:36,576 --> 02:19:39,392
Just one reason well I mean the one big one is

2927
02:19:39,648 --> 02:19:43,232
Come on

2928
02:19:43,488 --> 02:19:45,536
The more specific

2929
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:48,864
Is the correct phrase

2930
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:51,168
The first is why are they trying to get

2931
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:52,704
Who's going who's

2932
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:54,752
We don't know what is patient

2933
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:56,032
That's true

2934
02:19:57,312 --> 02:19:57,824
But still

2935
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:01,664
He said that they were trying to get a bunch of other dentists

2936
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,200
What was one of his patient

2937
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:06,016
Pretend

2938
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:16,256
I assume they're FBI spies going to happen

2939
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:21,120
Are they all spying on Alex's

2940
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:24,192
So here's the other problem

2941
02:20:26,496 --> 02:20:29,056
If we are to believe the things that Alex says about

2942
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:31,104
The globalist

2943
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:33,408
Tried to get him when he was like 16

2944
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:35,200
You rebuff very very

2945
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:38,272
So then he grows up and he becomes a dentist

2946
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:41,344
The globalist

2947
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:44,160
Course knowing that they're fishing in a dry well

2948
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:47,488
This guy is already slept moving up to your tennis Idol plan

2949
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:48,512
Not only that

2950
02:20:48,768 --> 02:20:49,536
They're fishing in

2951
02:20:50,816 --> 02:20:51,328
The dentist

2952
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:52,864
Right he's a dentist

2953
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:54,656
No

2954
02:20:54,912 --> 02:20:58,496
This is this is the Jingle writer running guns

2955
02:20:58,752 --> 02:21:03,104
Apologizing

2956
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:04,128
Nonsense

2957
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:05,152
But it's fun

2958
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:06,432
Fun

2959
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:07,712
How would he

2960
02:21:07,968 --> 02:21:08,480
Spy on people

2961
02:21:08,736 --> 02:21:09,504
He's a dentist

2962
02:21:10,016 --> 02:21:10,784
Is he just going to

2963
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:12,832
What is asking

2964
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:19,488
Rarararararara you knock them out and look at their cell phone

2965
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,024
I don't know it's dumb

2966
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:29,216
Because you are knocked out you can use the thumbprint on the iPhone you can crack

2967
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:29,984
Was easy

2968
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:32,544
Is social engineering

2969
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:33,824
That's the trash

2970
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,360
I watch the movie hackers

2971
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:36,384
Good movie

2972
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:39,200
Sakamoto is a religious studies

2973
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:42,784
To the extent

2974
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,064
But Alex does his

2975
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:45,344
Dentist father

2976
02:21:45,856 --> 02:21:47,392
I would have to say that my dad wrote the

2977
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:52,000
Well what you think about what you don't know is that your dad was approached

2978
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:59,168
I do

2979
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:04,800
So that's

2980
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:06,848
A little bit later Alex

2981
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:09,920
Call

2982
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:13,248
Alex thanks

2983
02:22:13,504 --> 02:22:14,528
Jesus-pie

2984
02:22:17,088 --> 02:22:19,392
What's your view on civilian inmate

2985
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:25,792
The Army at concentration camps

2986
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:28,608
Well I definitely think that

2987
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:35,520
There are legitimate issues like ndaa that's legitimate policy I think that Presidential Directive 51

2988
02:22:36,544 --> 02:22:40,640
So I want to stop there.

2989
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:44,224
Focus look

2990
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:46,272
She said that there are legitimate issues

2991
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:50,880
A lot of things that you referenced as a legitimate issue is ndaa

2992
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:52,416
Remember that

2993
02:22:53,696 --> 02:22:56,000
With regard to this particular document

2994
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:58,816
I would like you and or Paul Joseph Watson

2995
02:22:59,072 --> 02:22:59,584
Point guard

2996
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:00,864
Specifically to wear

2997
02:23:01,376 --> 02:23:03,424
It mentions anything about Kona

2998
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:08,288
Because I have found a document on an army website Army pubs

2999
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:09,824
Got army.mil

3000
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:16,480
This is not a top-secret document and I think

3001
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:22,880
Alice

3002
02:23:29,536 --> 02:23:30,560
You're out there

3003
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:32,864
California

3004
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:39,264
U.s. citizen illegal

3005
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:46,432
And you're calling up

3006
02:23:47,968 --> 02:23:51,808
Article in the Army times where they say they're going to start pulling

3007
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:53,088
Trigger Zone Diet

3008
02:23:53,344 --> 02:23:53,856
I can't find

3009
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,464
Score

3010
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:01,536
Right it was their plan

3011
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:03,584
You put it out open late

3012
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:06,400
Psyop the people who were

3013
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:13,056
Confirm that I don't

3014
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:16,128
You could say that I've done everything sounds like a

3015
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:17,408
Urban militia

3016
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,944
Drill sound like

3017
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:19,712
Sounds like

3018
02:24:19,968 --> 02:24:20,736
My dad

3019
02:24:24,064 --> 02:24:24,576
God though

3020
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:25,600
We should help him

3021
02:24:25,856 --> 02:24:26,368
True

3022
02:24:26,624 --> 02:24:31,232
Amazon Fire you shouldn't be upset and you started out by saying ndaa

3023
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:33,792
You didn't

3024
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:36,608
He said that it's legit illegitimate bill

3025
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:39,168
That was listed as one of the

3026
02:24:39,424 --> 02:24:41,472
Alex is intentionally twisting his words

3027
02:24:42,496 --> 02:24:48,640
Tire world

3028
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,480
Of US citizens

3029
02:24:52,736 --> 02:24:54,016
Unbelievable

3030
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:06,816
It was crafted for you

3031
02:25:07,072 --> 02:25:08,352
So Alex is at this point

3032
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:09,888
Decided that he is a cop

3033
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:11,424
Or something like that

3034
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:13,216
Ryan is working with the global

3035
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:13,984
Bright

3036
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:21,664
No one said this is okay what I'm saying to you is this particular document is not what you're making it out to be and

3037
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:26,272
You need to tell her specifically what mentioned the continental United States within this document

3038
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:30,624
You are misleading your audience like you did before the 20 minutes with the president

3039
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:35,744
So apparently

3040
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:41,376
Apparently I previous to this episode

3041
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:46,240
Clint Eastwood

3042
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,824
That was a mock interview with a president

3043
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:54,176
Computer glitch for a minute the same one on the bottom

3044
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:57,248
But I'm trying to find something where is the article

3045
02:25:57,504 --> 02:26:01,088
This is a boring joke

3046
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:02,368
From the document

3047
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:05,440
Directions home

3048
02:26:13,376 --> 02:26:14,656
Fortunate

3049
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:22,848
Five political activist

3050
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:24,896
Call Mary

3051
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:29,504
Nice lady customer service

3052
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:32,320
None of this is in relation

3053
02:26:32,576 --> 02:26:36,928
Caller was asking is where does it say

3054
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:39,232
In the United States

3055
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:43,072
But if you get into the context of where it says those things

3056
02:26:44,352 --> 02:26:45,632
You have to really stretch

3057
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:48,960
Instructions were necessary

3058
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:53,824
Military police

3059
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:06,624
Tell me

3060
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:13,792
What I'm saying is this Alex I'm not

3061
02:27:14,048 --> 02:27:16,352
Almost

3062
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:21,728
What I was about to

3063
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:26,848
Are you sure

3064
02:27:27,872 --> 02:27:29,408
So

3065
02:27:30,176 --> 02:27:32,736
I have I recently a conversation

3066
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:34,016
Friend of the shofar out

3067
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:36,832
Nearest talking about the idea of interviewing out

3068
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:38,368
And I told him

3069
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:41,440
Though I've been studying him for almost 11 months

3070
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:43,232
Incomplete dedication

3071
02:27:43,744 --> 02:27:44,768
I would never want to talk

3072
02:27:45,024 --> 02:27:45,536
Of course

3073
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:46,560
And this clip

3074
02:27:46,816 --> 02:27:47,328
Damonte

3075
02:27:47,584 --> 02:27:48,096
Sturtevant why

3076
02:27:48,352 --> 02:27:50,400
Cuz you just yell at you there's no point

3077
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:52,960
What's finish up this club

3078
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:54,240
Talk about about a little boy

3079
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:55,776
Okay

3080
02:27:58,592 --> 02:28:04,480
What is it true about this groundbreaking

3081
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:07,808
In this document

3082
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:11,904
Grouting is groundbreaking

3083
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:13,952
Ground-breaking

3084
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:17,792
Change the goalposts

3085
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:24,448
Domestically as well in Tod support

3086
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:30,848
Balboa paragraph

3087
02:28:32,896 --> 02:28:38,784
Page and paragraph in the PDF or we can find it in reference the United States of America

3088
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:45,440
Call Lanier and have him tell us where it's at that he read it

3089
02:28:45,696 --> 02:28:46,464
He wrote about it

3090
02:28:59,008 --> 02:29:00,288
Operations

3091
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:03,616
I called to ask you about the storm

3092
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:09,248
You watch what happens in this country

3093
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:13,088
You go ahead and do that

3094
02:29:13,856 --> 02:29:14,368
So

3095
02:29:14,624 --> 02:29:16,160
I would like to say at the end of this

3096
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:17,184
His

3097
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:19,744
You look what's going to happen to the country

3098
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:23,072
You use psyop techniques on people

3099
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:24,352
They look what's goin to happen

3100
02:29:25,888 --> 02:29:26,656
5 years later

3101
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:27,936
Look what's happened

3102
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:32,032
You use psyop techniques on your audio

3103
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:33,824
And we know this because

3104
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,360
One of your biggest influences

3105
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:37,408
Is a psyop officer

3106
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:41,248
Even if it's not

3107
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:43,296
Call it Sia

3108
02:29:44,064 --> 02:29:45,856
Even then all psyops

3109
02:29:46,112 --> 02:29:47,648
Really artist

3110
02:29:48,672 --> 02:29:53,280
It's absolutely up on people to get them to like

3111
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:54,816
American policy

3112
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:56,352
Well

3113
02:29:56,608 --> 02:30:00,448
In the same way that Alex Jones says you should like Trump

3114
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:03,776
The only difference is that these are enemy

3115
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:07,104
Combatants where's Alex

3116
02:30:08,128 --> 02:30:10,432
Actually work

3117
02:30:10,944 --> 02:30:15,040
I'm not advocating for the death of Ali

3118
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:15,808
George Jones

3119
02:30:16,064 --> 02:30:19,136
But if

3120
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:21,440
If I were designing a perfect

3121
02:30:21,696 --> 02:30:24,256
World if I were designing a civilization

3122
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:25,024
That I think

3123
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:25,792
Function

3124
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:26,560
Perfectly

3125
02:30:26,816 --> 02:30:28,352
Well the show Designing Women

3126
02:30:28,608 --> 02:30:29,888
1st and Taylor

3127
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:31,680
Linda bloodworth-thomason

3128
02:30:31,936 --> 02:30:38,080
Delta Burke I would say that actively and consciously

3129
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:40,640
Engaging and propaganda should be an executed

3130
02:30:41,664 --> 02:30:44,224
Because of the amount of disasters that you create

3131
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:45,760
The amount of misinformation

3132
02:30:46,528 --> 02:30:48,576
The how many people you lead astray

3133
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:49,600
Through

3134
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:50,368
Attractive

3135
02:30:50,624 --> 02:30:52,416
But deceitful

3136
02:30:52,672 --> 02:30:53,184
News

3137
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:53,952
Prevalence

3138
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:56,000
Like it is a disaster

3139
02:30:56,512 --> 02:30:58,048
There's the possibility of us

3140
02:30:58,304 --> 02:30:59,072
Really ever coming

3141
02:30:59,328 --> 02:30:59,840
Together

3142
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:00,608
And working

3143
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:01,888
Towards common goal

3144
02:31:02,656 --> 02:31:05,728
Is completely knocked off track by people like Alex Jones

3145
02:31:05,984 --> 02:31:07,776
Absolute again

3146
02:31:08,032 --> 02:31:08,544
I'm not saying

3147
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:09,568
You should even be arrested

3148
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:11,104
That's not the world we live in

3149
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:12,640
Put in a Utopia

3150
02:31:12,896 --> 02:31:14,944
We would really look at the idea that

3151
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:17,248
Well were willingly misleading people

3152
02:31:17,504 --> 02:31:23,648
Like executing people might be counterproductive

3153
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:28,000
Why do that's why we do the show the way we do it should have is f***

3154
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:30,560
Classes in school

3155
02:31:30,816 --> 02:31:35,168
Here's how you recognized propagandist rhetoric the reason we can't have those classes

3156
02:31:35,424 --> 02:31:37,216
Is because religious people would go

3157
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:37,984
Jaguar

3158
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:40,032
To be like

3159
02:31:40,288 --> 02:31:46,432
Okay well we know religion isn't real Ouroboros kind of because also the reason that you can't

3160
02:31:46,944 --> 02:31:48,992
Get the schools to work

3161
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:55,392
As well as they should it's because people like the last cuz it's propaganda stopped right

3162
02:31:56,928 --> 02:31:59,232
These people who can't run

3163
02:31:59,488 --> 02:32:00,512
Well when we have

3164
02:32:00,768 --> 02:32:01,536
Things like

3165
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:03,840
Standardized testing No Child Left Behind

3166
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:05,376
Commoncoresheets

3167
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:06,400
And the funding is

3168
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:08,448
Thank you just can't

3169
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:13,312
Can teach kid with a need-to-know to grow up understanding logic and rhetoric

3170
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:14,592
Those two things are

3171
02:32:14,848 --> 02:32:15,872
Critically important

3172
02:32:16,128 --> 02:32:17,920
You need to understand

3173
02:32:18,176 --> 02:32:18,688
Deconstruct in Ark

3174
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:19,456
Number one

3175
02:32:19,968 --> 02:32:20,736
You cannot go

3176
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:27,136
Get through life without or else you will be tricked by people like this ding dong right second you need to understand rhetoric

3177
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:28,672
Bravo he's never going to make it out

3178
02:32:29,952 --> 02:32:30,720
For Eddie

3179
02:32:30,976 --> 02:32:35,072
Sweet sweet Addie you stupid bastard

3180
02:32:35,328 --> 02:32:36,608
Because you need to understand

3181
02:32:36,864 --> 02:32:37,376
Rhetorical tricks

3182
02:32:37,632 --> 02:32:38,656
People use like

3183
02:32:38,912 --> 02:32:39,424
What's shutting down

3184
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,704
Every single time

3185
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:41,728
This guy truck

3186
02:32:41,984 --> 02:32:43,776
To talk and then pretending that he's not answer

3187
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:47,616
Question right that is a rhetorical technique in order to silence your opposition

3188
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:48,896
You need to know these

3189
02:32:49,152 --> 02:32:53,504
These tricks cuz you need to know when people are using them and then you can pick the next step which is

3190
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,272
Why are they

3191
02:32:55,296 --> 02:32:57,600
And we go back to your religious argument

3192
02:32:57,856 --> 02:32:59,648
People would shut down all of that discussion

3193
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:01,440
Beno secretly

3194
02:33:01,696 --> 02:33:02,464
That their

3195
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:05,280
Absolutely

3196
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:08,352
School s*** all right I'm going to walk back the idea of killing property

3197
02:33:08,864 --> 02:33:11,424
But I think I'd like for your heart

3198
02:33:12,448 --> 02:33:13,472
I'll tell you why

3199
02:33:13,728 --> 02:33:17,568
This is becoming

3200
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:18,336
Somebody to kill

3201
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:24,736
Right as I walk that back I still think it would be a very serious

3202
02:33:24,992 --> 02:33:25,760
Deal to be a problem

3203
02:33:26,272 --> 02:33:27,296
Where is it

3204
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:28,064
You making money

3205
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:31,392
I forgot my thought

3206
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:35,232
Good it's a good thought which is

3207
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:37,792
I lean back more towards

3208
02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:40,096
Okay

3209
02:33:43,424 --> 02:33:43,936
The

3210
02:33:46,496 --> 02:33:47,520
What are the Three Kingdoms

3211
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:52,640
Whenever you had legalism and taoism and Buddhism and all of those

3212
02:33:52,896 --> 02:33:58,784
Mainly because those all of those were

3213
02:33:59,808 --> 02:34:01,600
Built around the idea of how is it

3214
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:02,368
That we getting

3215
02:34:02,624 --> 02:34:03,136
Ineffective government

3216
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:04,928
Like if you read the

3217
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:06,464
Mainly it's about

3218
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:07,488
Not not like

3219
02:34:07,744 --> 02:34:08,768
How you should live and how you say

3220
02:34:09,024 --> 02:34:09,792
Three people but

3221
02:34:10,048 --> 02:34:11,328
If I were the king

3222
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:13,120
Here's how not to be an ass

3223
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:16,448
Exactly

3224
02:34:16,704 --> 02:34:17,984
Really boils down to

3225
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:18,752
If

3226
02:34:19,008 --> 02:34:20,544
You are running a competition

3227
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:21,824
Government

3228
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:23,360
The rule of Leah Plaza

3229
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:24,896
The rule of law

3230
02:34:25,152 --> 02:34:26,176
Applies equally to ever

3231
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:27,968
Where people are

3232
02:34:28,736 --> 02:34:30,528
Where they feel safe where they have their base

3233
02:34:31,552 --> 02:34:37,696
They don't have to fret about this before Maslow even came up with his hierarchy

3234
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:40,256
Exactly and you

3235
02:34:40,512 --> 02:34:41,792
Will wind up not have

3236
02:34:42,048 --> 02:34:43,584
Nothing to worry about these prop

3237
02:34:44,352 --> 02:34:45,632
Yeah that's a good point

3238
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:51,520
Because because the root of all of this root of all of the the why we believe in the propaganda

3239
02:34:51,776 --> 02:34:57,920
So why we believe in religion believe in all of this is because life is miserable and nobody is doing anything

3240
02:34:58,176 --> 02:34:59,968
Victimization narrative

3241
02:35:00,224 --> 02:35:05,088
It comes down to that but you're miserable because you don't have your needs met you need to find someone to blame

3242
02:35:05,344 --> 02:35:08,416
Alex Jones

3243
02:35:09,184 --> 02:35:09,696
Simple

3244
02:35:09,952 --> 02:35:12,768
My fault that I got back

3245
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:19,424
Well I don't know how I can relate to that but Alex doesn't believe

3246
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:20,192
But do you think

3247
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:21,472
Yeah and I know that

3248
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:22,752
Because if he did

3249
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:24,288
He would be calling for

3250
02:35:25,056 --> 02:35:25,568
Taking the street

3251
02:35:25,824 --> 02:35:26,336
Absolute

3252
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:29,152
If you legitimately believe that this was

3253
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:30,432
Government.

3254
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:34,272
To incarcerate

3255
02:35:34,528 --> 02:35:37,088
Dissidents in America in FEMA camps

3256
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:40,160
It's separate agitators like himself

3257
02:35:41,184 --> 02:35:44,256
He would call for an overthrow of the f****** government

3258
02:35:44,512 --> 02:35:45,792
Infowars

3259
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:47,584
Well I mean

3260
02:35:48,096 --> 02:35:49,888
Easiest way to

3261
02:35:50,144 --> 02:35:52,448
Who are the people who really believed

3262
02:35:52,704 --> 02:35:55,008
That abortion is murdering babies

3263
02:35:57,312 --> 02:36:01,664
Like if you really believe that you are murdering a live thing

3264
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:02,944
That isn't

3265
02:36:04,736 --> 02:36:09,344
So the people who are going out there and protesting and doing all that s***

3266
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:10,368
At the very least

3267
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:11,904
They believe what b*******

3268
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:15,488
Salad I don't know if we want to look I don't want to say it's very least

3269
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,816
I do I write I don't want to use that as like a feather in the cap

3270
02:36:19,072 --> 02:36:20,864
Prepare enough

3271
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:23,168
Question the authenticity of their beliefs

3272
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:24,448
Where is it

3273
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:28,288
Clearly a con game

3274
02:36:29,056 --> 02:36:29,568
Vicky would be actor

3275
02:36:29,824 --> 02:36:30,336
Completely

3276
02:36:30,848 --> 02:36:33,408
Evan secondarily running his own militia

3277
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:34,432
Absolutely

3278
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:41,344
The problem with that is like we can sort of assess what Alex Jones really believes and what he does

3279
02:36:41,856 --> 02:36:43,392
But what's scary is to think about

3280
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:44,672
The logic

3281
02:36:44,928 --> 02:36:46,976
Would be in a person's mind if they ask

3282
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:48,000
Actually believe

3283
02:36:48,256 --> 02:36:50,048
Because if they actually believed him

3284
02:36:50,816 --> 02:36:52,096
They're the ones who are going to take

3285
02:36:52,352 --> 02:36:58,496
Take to the street there's a while let's take that out of it even though that definitely is a piece of

3286
02:36:59,264 --> 02:37:00,032
Let's just say

3287
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:01,056
Old people

3288
02:37:01,312 --> 02:37:04,128
Or people who aren't going to storm places with guns

3289
02:37:04,384 --> 02:37:05,408
See now in my perfect

3290
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:06,176
Society

3291
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:07,456
It would be nice

3292
02:37:07,712 --> 02:37:08,224
Executable offense

3293
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:09,760
Oh boy

3294
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:16,416
I'm going to

3295
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:19,744
So what I'm saying is if you actually believe in Alex Jones

3296
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:22,048
The thing that you should do is give him literally Olive

3297
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:24,352
Because if you believe it

3298
02:37:24,608 --> 02:37:25,376
He is the person

3299
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:26,656
Who has the best

3300
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:28,704
Chance of taking down these globalist

3301
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:30,240
You keep staring you about

3302
02:37:30,752 --> 02:37:33,056
Then your money is useless if he loses

3303
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:35,104
So the only

3304
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:37,152
Logical rational thing to do

3305
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:37,920
Would be

3306
02:37:38,176 --> 02:37:39,968
Pour everything you can into him

3307
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:41,504
And do everything he tells you

3308
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:43,552
And that's kind of scary

3309
02:37:43,808 --> 02:37:45,856
Well I mean your money would be worthless

3310
02:37:46,368 --> 02:37:46,880
Seawinds 2

3311
02:37:47,392 --> 02:37:47,904
No

3312
02:37:48,672 --> 02:37:49,952
Overthrow the government

3313
02:37:50,208 --> 02:37:52,768
No no no

3314
02:37:53,024 --> 02:37:55,072
No because if you listen to him you would have bought gold

3315
02:37:55,584 --> 02:37:58,144
That's true take care of that

3316
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:04,544
Xbox

3317
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:06,848
Stuff did I when I listen to this that's what really scares me

3318
02:38:07,104 --> 02:38:09,920
Is the idea of rationality in his listeners

3319
02:38:10,432 --> 02:38:11,456
Like a twisted rash

3320
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:14,016
Irrational

3321
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:15,552
Logic

3322
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:19,392
But that's why so many people give to like

3323
02:38:19,648 --> 02:38:23,232
Your wealth glitterbug

3324
02:38:23,488 --> 02:38:29,632
Prosperity got in the history of the world

3325
02:38:29,888 --> 02:38:36,032
Jim Baker Supply we will do that for the future

3326
02:38:36,288 --> 02:38:39,360
August singer

3327
02:38:39,616 --> 02:38:40,128
Anti-semite

3328
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:42,688
Running me down man

3329
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:46,784
He was trying to get some work done the other night

3330
02:38:47,296 --> 02:38:48,064
Errands

3331
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:49,856
I was watching like

3332
02:38:50,112 --> 02:38:51,392
Majority report videos

3333
02:38:51,648 --> 02:38:52,928
I do getting work done

3334
02:38:54,208 --> 02:38:54,976
Computer

3335
02:38:55,232 --> 02:38:57,792
And one of the things that was recommended to me because I have

3336
02:38:58,048 --> 02:38:59,072
Terrible YouTube

3337
02:39:00,608 --> 02:39:01,888
Kerry Cassidy is live

3338
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:04,448
She was interviewing the guy live

3339
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:09,312
Or this guy was interviewing her like I watched about 20 minutes of it

3340
02:39:11,104 --> 02:39:11,616
Not good

3341
02:39:15,968 --> 02:39:18,016
Well it was going live there's a chat room

3342
02:39:19,296 --> 02:39:19,808
On YouTube

3343
02:39:20,064 --> 02:39:20,832
For the livestream

3344
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:26,208
They were in

3345
02:39:27,744 --> 02:39:28,256
It was wild

3346
02:39:28,768 --> 02:39:30,560
Also no updates about Jim 70s

3347
02:39:32,096 --> 02:39:34,144
A man just a couple clips

3348
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:39,008
Journal we can wrap this up cuz this is a classic knowledge fight episode we're already at 2

3349
02:39:40,288 --> 02:39:41,824
This is back in the good old days

3350
02:39:42,336 --> 02:39:43,104
Next weekend

3351
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:45,408
As we work toward this happy Monday to you and yours

3352
02:39:48,992 --> 02:39:52,832
On the previous caller who is completely rational

3353
02:39:53,088 --> 02:39:53,600
Start over

3354
02:39:54,112 --> 02:39:55,648
The decided was a cop

3355
02:39:55,904 --> 02:39:56,672
For no reason

3356
02:39:57,184 --> 02:40:00,256
Young man like this guy just called and he's either a fraud

3357
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:01,536
Or total cool

3358
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:04,352
I don't have a clue what's going on in his life

3359
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:06,912
Military

3360
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:12,032
He's like a deputy

3361
02:40:16,896 --> 02:40:20,992
Listen but you're nothing special they tried to recruit every dentist my dad works with

3362
02:40:21,248 --> 02:40:22,528
Okay

3363
02:40:27,136 --> 02:40:33,280
They're even going up for bringing foreign troops enforce it because I'll tell you on my whole family's military I have bias

3364
02:40:33,536 --> 02:40:35,328
Military been in the military

3365
02:40:35,584 --> 02:40:36,864
Afghanistan Iraq

3366
02:40:37,376 --> 02:40:43,520
And I'mma tell you right now these fine young people in the military are going to rebuild their knockout they're not going to go along with it

3367
02:40:43,776 --> 02:40:45,568
So they're going to have to bring in a lot of

3368
02:40:45,824 --> 02:40:47,616
Lots of United Nations Forces

3369
02:40:47,872 --> 02:40:54,016
Do it

3370
02:40:55,808 --> 02:41:00,672
Help

3371
02:41:01,184 --> 02:41:02,720
They're admitting it

3372
02:41:04,768 --> 02:41:05,280
Alright

3373
02:41:05,536 --> 02:41:06,560
So if you're saying

3374
02:41:07,072 --> 02:41:08,864
That the United States military is going to

3375
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:12,192
The largest military

3376
02:41:12,704 --> 02:41:13,728
In the world

3377
02:41:14,496 --> 02:41:16,288
All the other ones

3378
02:41:16,544 --> 02:41:17,056
Combine

3379
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:20,384
They're going to bring in some un troops

3380
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:25,504
Is the US military rebelled against

3381
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:27,040
Anybody world

3382
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:33,440
Boy like that cont the countries that were listed in that DHHS press release are Australia they're not going to be able to

3383
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:37,280
How much

3384
02:41:37,536 --> 02:41:38,048
Compared to us

3385
02:41:38,304 --> 02:41:40,352
Mexico

3386
02:41:40,608 --> 02:41:41,120
No

3387
02:41:41,632 --> 02:41:47,776
PennLive

3388
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:50,080
Cartels they not a sucker

3389
02:41:50,336 --> 02:41:56,480
Might as well

3390
02:41:56,736 --> 02:41:59,552
The Navajo Nation that's when you got to worry about

3391
02:41:59,808 --> 02:42:00,320
Franklin

3392
02:42:00,576 --> 02:42:03,648
They may not have the people put god dammit if they don't have the motivation

3393
02:42:03,904 --> 02:42:07,488
Anybody wants to

3394
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:08,768
It's been Ava Hotel

3395
02:42:09,024 --> 02:42:11,840
Your point is well taken

3396
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:15,424
Nothing to fear unless

3397
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:19,008
The military does Rebelle

3398
02:42:19,264 --> 02:42:21,824
Yeah which is increasingly becoming

3399
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:24,384
Not likelihood with a possibility

3400
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:25,664
Well I mean

3401
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:26,944
Imagine

3402
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:28,736
It's run by a military junta

3403
02:42:29,248 --> 02:42:34,368
Scary is the most military Hunters are horrifica in small-town

3404
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:35,904
Countries where they can't do anything

3405
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:42,304
Oh I want everybody back to my idea about killing prop

3406
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:45,888
One of the reasons that I

3407
02:42:47,168 --> 02:42:48,448
Confidence

3408
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:50,240
About that in a Utopia

3409
02:42:50,752 --> 02:42:51,776
Is when we look at things

3410
02:42:52,032 --> 02:42:53,312
Like what we talked about

3411
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:55,616
What number of episodes back

3412
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:58,688
About Edward Bernays

3413
02:42:58,944 --> 02:43:03,296
Leading to a three-year Civil War Guatemala

3414
02:43:03,808 --> 02:43:06,624
So many deaths that are attributable to propaganda

3415
02:43:07,904 --> 02:43:08,672
And it's not

3416
02:43:08,928 --> 02:43:09,440
It's not a game

3417
02:43:09,952 --> 02:43:11,488
Like the things that Alex Jones says

3418
02:43:11,744 --> 02:43:13,024
Is not it's not a game

3419
02:43:13,536 --> 02:43:15,328
He's making a ton of money on this s***

3420
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:18,400
But people do lose their lives people are terrorized

3421
02:43:18,912 --> 02:43:23,008
Like I read an article recently about a couple that was at the Las Vegas

3422
02:43:23,264 --> 02:43:23,776
Country

3423
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:24,544
Free concert

3424
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:25,568
That was attack

3425
02:43:26,336 --> 02:43:27,872
And the guy

3426
02:43:28,128 --> 02:43:29,152
It got shot in the head

3427
02:43:29,408 --> 02:43:30,176
Running away

3428
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:31,200
From the

3429
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:31,968
The

3430
02:43:32,224 --> 02:43:33,248
Conflagration

3431
02:43:33,504 --> 02:43:34,016
It works

3432
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:38,112
Just because it was off by about an inch

3433
02:43:38,368 --> 02:43:40,672
It wasn't that bad

3434
02:43:41,952 --> 02:43:42,464
It wasn't relevant

3435
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:46,304
And so he and his girlfriend had an interview

3436
02:43:46,816 --> 02:43:47,328
And they were talking

3437
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:48,352
Think about how

3438
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:50,656
Immediately he was inundated

3439
02:43:51,168 --> 02:43:53,728
With tons and tons of messages about how someone needs to

3440
02:43:53,984 --> 02:43:54,496
The Killing

3441
02:43:54,752 --> 02:43:56,800
Someone needs to shoot him in the head for real

3442
02:43:57,056 --> 02:43:58,080
Because he is a f******

3443
02:43:58,336 --> 02:44:00,896
Can crisis actor and all this s*** isn't real

3444
02:44:01,152 --> 02:44:03,968
Now that's not Alex Jones is narrative this time but it's something

3445
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:04,736
You perpetuate

3446
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:07,552
It's something with the Sandy Hook stuff that he's

3447
02:44:07,808 --> 02:44:09,344
Perpetuated and fostered in

3448
02:44:10,112 --> 02:44:12,928
The idea crisis actors isn't it doesn't start with him

3449
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:16,768
But God damn it if he isn't one of the biggest people who push that narrative

3450
02:44:17,536 --> 02:44:19,328
He has to share the blame in this

3451
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:21,632
It's not that it's not no steak

3452
02:44:22,144 --> 02:44:24,448
It's not a situation where you and I are sitting here

3453
02:44:24,704 --> 02:44:25,216
And we're like

3454
02:44:25,472 --> 02:44:27,520
Hey Alex Jones sucks doesn't he

3455
02:44:27,776 --> 02:44:29,312
It's it's this damn it

3456
02:44:35,968 --> 02:44:37,504
Those people are being terrorized

3457
02:44:38,016 --> 02:44:39,296
The families of Sandy Hook victims

3458
02:44:39,552 --> 02:44:40,320
Terrorized

3459
02:44:40,576 --> 02:44:42,112
Is it for years now at this point

3460
02:44:42,624 --> 02:44:43,392
It's just

3461
02:44:43,648 --> 02:44:44,160
A byproduct

3462
02:44:44,416 --> 02:44:44,928
To the ship

3463
02:44:45,184 --> 02:44:46,720
Guy coming to Pizza Hut Pizza Hut

3464
02:44:46,976 --> 02:44:48,256
Comet Ping Pong with a gun

3465
02:44:48,512 --> 02:44:49,280
All that stuff is

3466
02:44:49,536 --> 02:44:50,048
Just

3467
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:51,840
Very predictable outcome

3468
02:44:52,864 --> 02:44:53,632
Envista

3469
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:55,936
This stuff about Ms

3470
02:44:56,192 --> 02:44:59,776
Fm3

3471
02:45:00,032 --> 02:45:04,384
In concert with all of his lies about Elohim City in Oklahoma City bombing

3472
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:06,688
It combines

3473
02:45:06,944 --> 02:45:07,456
To create

3474
02:45:07,712 --> 02:45:09,248
A very dangerous

3475
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:10,784
White

3476
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:11,808
Militia

3477
02:45:12,832 --> 02:45:13,856
Organization

3478
02:45:14,112 --> 02:45:14,624
And again

3479
02:45:15,136 --> 02:45:16,672
He's not solely responsible

3480
02:45:16,928 --> 02:45:17,440
For creating that

3481
02:45:17,952 --> 02:45:22,048
But he's the most mainstream voice that is super in favor of it and popularized

3482
02:45:22,304 --> 02:45:25,632
Able to make effects in the world

3483
02:45:25,888 --> 02:45:26,656
Changes in the world

3484
02:45:27,424 --> 02:45:28,192
Talking nonsense

3485
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:30,240
I don't understand why

3486
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:32,032
We don't have millions of dollars

3487
02:45:32,544 --> 02:45:33,312
Quite frankly

3488
02:45:35,872 --> 02:45:36,384
Because

3489
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:38,688
We are debunked propagate

3490
02:45:38,944 --> 02:45:39,968
We don't

3491
02:45:40,224 --> 02:45:44,320
Dole it out because there's no money on the Progressive side of things

3492
02:45:44,832 --> 02:45:47,392
There is like the myths about Soros are real

3493
02:45:47,904 --> 02:45:50,208
Whereas the myths about the Koch brothers in the Mercers

3494
02:45:52,256 --> 02:45:53,024
So that's really what

3495
02:45:53,536 --> 02:45:56,096
Soros was real like in the

3496
02:45:56,352 --> 02:45:59,680
Presents him we would have a lot of money we wouldn't be in my

3497
02:45:59,936 --> 02:46:01,472
F****** bedroom right now

3498
02:46:02,496 --> 02:46:03,519
Anyway

3499
02:46:04,543 --> 02:46:05,055
I know

3500
02:46:12,735 --> 02:46:18,879
I was talking about it I Utopia that is hypothetical

3501
02:46:19,135 --> 02:46:19,903
You made a good point

3502
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:21,951
To talk me off the ledge about the Dow

3503
02:46:22,207 --> 02:46:25,535
And about how it would be necessary

3504
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:27,071
If their needs were met

3505
02:46:27,327 --> 02:46:28,095
Retina Group

3506
02:46:28,607 --> 02:46:29,119
Okay

3507
02:46:29,375 --> 02:46:29,887
So now

3508
02:46:31,167 --> 02:46:31,679
Quahog

3509
02:46:32,703 --> 02:46:36,031
How would you kill

3510
02:46:36,543 --> 02:46:39,615
What are we talkin about are we bringing back or we bring it back guillotine

3511
02:46:39,871 --> 02:46:40,639
Cuz that was fun

3512
02:46:40,895 --> 02:46:42,687
Actually about the guillotine

3513
02:46:42,943 --> 02:46:47,551
In my ideal scenario what it would be

3514
02:46:47,807 --> 02:46:48,831
Is a protracted

3515
02:46:49,087 --> 02:46:49,599
Trial

3516
02:46:49,855 --> 02:46:55,999
We're in everything that they say like it'll be just every episode of our podcast

3517
02:46:57,279 --> 02:47:00,607
Add by the end they would have already killed himself point-by-point

3518
02:47:00,863 --> 02:47:02,143
This is what you said

3519
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:03,679
This is the reality

3520
02:47:04,191 --> 02:47:05,727
And make them confess

3521
02:47:06,239 --> 02:47:07,519
To everything

3522
02:47:09,567 --> 02:47:10,591
No just be like look

3523
02:47:11,103 --> 02:47:13,407
What we really need to do is get them really drunk one night

3524
02:47:14,431 --> 02:47:16,479
Boredom in court demonstrate

3525
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:20,575
Untruthfulness of all their claims

3526
02:47:20,831 --> 02:47:21,343
And that's a fact

3527
02:47:21,855 --> 02:47:22,367
Now

3528
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:23,391
Next.

3529
02:47:23,647 --> 02:47:26,463
Seppuku after they're already honorable death

3530
02:47:26,719 --> 02:47:29,535
After they're already dead but also they don't deserve that honorable

3531
02:47:29,791 --> 02:47:31,583
After they're already dead

3532
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:35,167
I propose we Oliver Cromwell

3533
02:47:36,191 --> 02:47:36,959
Diggum back

3534
02:47:37,983 --> 02:47:41,055
Put them back on trial and then B had them

3535
02:47:41,567 --> 02:47:42,079
Interesting

3536
02:47:44,383 --> 02:47:45,919
On that

3537
02:47:46,175 --> 02:47:48,223
Eclipse

3538
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:50,015
The first one is

3539
02:47:51,295 --> 02:47:53,343
Alex misleading people about Hillary Clinton

3540
02:47:53,599 --> 02:47:57,183
Early

3541
02:47:58,207 --> 02:48:02,047
Hillary Kentucky voice real

3542
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:05,887
She was running against Obama in 2008

3543
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:12,287
I don't feel no Ways Tired

3544
02:48:12,543 --> 02:48:18,687
I started from nobody told me that the road would be easy

3545
02:48:27,135 --> 02:48:30,975
Bridgeton California

3546
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:33,791
Cuz he was going

3547
02:48:40,959 --> 02:48:46,591
Got some family that I would like

3548
02:48:49,919 --> 02:48:52,223
Italian restaurants

3549
02:48:52,479 --> 02:48:55,807
Luigi

3550
02:49:06,815 --> 02:49:07,583
Condescending

3551
02:49:07,839 --> 02:49:08,863
I have another example

3552
02:49:09,375 --> 02:49:13,983
How about you go on the BBC and do a British accent while you talk over the other guests on the show

3553
02:49:14,239 --> 02:49:19,103
Condescending condescending

3554
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:20,383
A little bit

3555
02:49:20,639 --> 02:49:23,455
So anyway

3556
02:49:23,967 --> 02:49:25,247
Really bad about EX

3557
02:49:25,759 --> 02:49:28,319
That was maybe the worst Tennessee an accident

3558
02:49:30,879 --> 02:49:31,647
Trying to

3559
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:32,671
To be like hey

3560
02:49:33,183 --> 02:49:35,231
Look at this kind of bed I'm doing it

3561
02:49:35,487 --> 02:49:39,071
You guys know that I'm cool with you and it's just like a little thing

3562
02:49:39,583 --> 02:49:45,727
Know what she's doing is she's reciting the lyrics of a song by James Cleveland four-time Grammy Award

3563
02:49:45,983 --> 02:49:47,007
Winner for gospel album

3564
02:49:47,263 --> 02:49:47,775
The year

3565
02:49:48,031 --> 02:49:51,359
It's a song called I've gone too far to come back or

3566
02:49:54,431 --> 02:49:55,711
Are unfortunately written

3567
02:49:55,967 --> 02:49:56,735
Patois

3568
02:49:58,783 --> 02:50:00,831
Grades of the accidents not good

3569
02:50:01,087 --> 02:50:02,623
But the

3570
02:50:03,391 --> 02:50:05,951
She's forced into it a little bit by the

3571
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:12,863
Even back then you can really see that her campaign handlers have no idea what they're doing

3572
02:50:13,119 --> 02:50:14,655
Yeah

3573
02:50:14,911 --> 02:50:15,679
The stiffest

3574
02:50:16,191 --> 02:50:16,703
Most

3575
02:50:17,215 --> 02:50:19,007
Knowledgeable person we can find

3576
02:50:19,263 --> 02:50:21,567
Yeah and try and get them to do B

3577
02:50:24,383 --> 02:50:24,895
Really making

3578
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:26,943
You complain I think I would more

3579
02:50:27,199 --> 02:50:27,711
Complained

3580
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:29,503
It's a little race

3581
02:50:34,111 --> 02:50:36,159
Yeah I know because the the

3582
02:50:37,695 --> 02:50:39,231
Cleveland song is from

3583
02:50:39,999 --> 02:50:41,535
Use born in nineteen

3584
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:42,303
30

3585
02:50:44,351 --> 02:50:46,143
These are these are Old Time song

3586
02:50:46,911 --> 02:50:48,447
It's kind of like

3587
02:50:48,703 --> 02:50:50,751
Jim's dialogue is written

3588
02:50:51,263 --> 02:50:55,359
Now there is a little bit more like how the national anthem

3589
02:50:55,615 --> 02:50:56,127
Support

3590
02:50:56,383 --> 02:50:57,151
Right right

3591
02:50:57,407 --> 02:50:58,431
It it it's

3592
02:51:01,503 --> 02:51:03,039
And I would I would

3593
02:51:03,295 --> 02:51:04,063
Think that Alex can

3594
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:07,903
Much easier attackpoint there then to say that she's doing hillbilly voice

3595
02:51:10,719 --> 02:51:12,255
Do that

3596
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:15,839
Because she's stepping on his game of Bad Axe

3597
02:51:16,607 --> 02:51:18,143
What we saw

3598
02:51:18,399 --> 02:51:19,423
Exactly I was fair

3599
02:51:19,679 --> 02:51:22,239
Yeah so at the end

3600
02:51:22,495 --> 02:51:23,007
To somebody else

3601
02:51:23,263 --> 02:51:24,287
Alternators Gerald Celente

3602
02:51:25,055 --> 02:51:26,591
He has Gerald Celente

3603
02:51:27,871 --> 02:51:28,895
A bunch of bulshit

3604
02:51:29,407 --> 02:51:31,711
The Show by saying that the president

3605
02:51:33,247 --> 02:51:33,759
There's no real

3606
02:51:35,551 --> 02:51:39,647
He screamed about some guy of the saying stuff about the Army when

3607
02:51:39,903 --> 02:51:40,927
And he's never served

3608
02:51:41,695 --> 02:51:43,231
I don't know Gerald Celente is ever

3609
02:51:43,487 --> 02:51:45,279
Reserved himself I have no idea but

3610
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:47,327
Is the age where he would have been in Vietnam

3611
02:51:47,839 --> 02:51:51,167
I have no idea I don't want to cast aspersions cuz I don't know his history

3612
02:51:51,679 --> 02:51:52,191
I don't know

3613
02:51:52,447 --> 02:51:56,543
You would think that he would bring it up while he's screaming at somebody about talking about the military

3614
02:51:57,055 --> 02:51:59,871
Be that as it may

3615
02:52:00,639 --> 02:52:06,783
I think based on the ramps but I've gone on about property

3616
02:52:07,039 --> 02:52:09,343
On this episode This Is A fitting way for us to

3617
02:52:09,599 --> 02:52:10,111
Episode

3618
02:52:11,135 --> 02:52:16,767
I know these are the German style culture

3619
02:52:17,023 --> 02:52:19,839
This isn't a third world Banana Republic

3620
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:22,911
Rucdr beautiful buildings

3621
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:26,495
From the late 1800s early 1900s

3622
02:52:27,007 --> 02:52:32,895
And then you see in between them all new-construction from post-world war

3623
02:52:33,151 --> 02:52:35,199
And it keeps going on everywhere you go

3624
02:52:35,711 --> 02:52:37,759
Behold bombed-out building

3625
02:52:38,527 --> 02:52:41,087
So it's been haunting me since I've returned

3626
02:52:41,855 --> 02:52:43,391
I said to myself

3627
02:52:43,903 --> 02:52:45,183
These are the German

3628
02:52:45,695 --> 02:52:47,231
How can I have lead

3629
02:52:47,487 --> 02:52:49,279
No little

3630
02:52:49,535 --> 02:52:50,047
Freak

3631
02:52:50,559 --> 02:52:51,839
Like Hitler

3632
02:52:52,095 --> 02:52:54,655
Destroy their entire country

3633
02:52:55,167 --> 02:52:55,679
Well

3634
02:52:56,959 --> 02:52:57,471
Victimization

3635
02:52:57,727 --> 02:52:59,007
Narratives

3636
02:52:59,263 --> 02:53:00,031
You 2016

3637
02:53:00,799 --> 02:53:01,311
Chop

3638
02:53:01,823 --> 02:53:02,591
President of the United States

3639
02:53:03,871 --> 02:53:05,407
Well I mean one of the big reason

3640
02:53:05,663 --> 02:53:06,687
Things that people line along

3641
02:53:06,943 --> 02:53:07,455
With

3642
02:53:07,711 --> 02:53:08,223
Hitler

3643
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:09,759
Was because of desperation

3644
02:53:10,271 --> 02:53:16,415
The country because of things that actually the global Community was responsible for

3645
02:53:16,671 --> 02:53:18,207
Treaty of Versailles is

3646
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:20,511
Proof of exactly what it is that I'm

3647
02:53:21,023 --> 02:53:23,071
Right

3648
02:53:23,327 --> 02:53:25,887
They will absolutely go for whatever.

3649
02:53:26,399 --> 02:53:28,191
Is going to give them that

3650
02:53:28,447 --> 02:53:29,215
Outlet for their.

3651
02:53:29,471 --> 02:53:30,239
Wichita

3652
02:53:30,495 --> 02:53:33,567
Anybody who expresses away out of your victims

3653
02:53:33,823 --> 02:53:34,335
Narrative

3654
02:53:34,847 --> 02:53:35,615
But Alex

3655
02:53:36,639 --> 02:53:37,407
Poses

3656
02:53:37,663 --> 02:53:38,687
Exploit

3657
02:53:39,455 --> 02:53:41,247
The job loss

3658
02:53:41,503 --> 02:53:42,271
In the Midwest

3659
02:53:42,527 --> 02:53:43,551
Coal mining

3660
02:53:43,807 --> 02:53:44,575
Territory

3661
02:53:44,831 --> 02:53:45,343
Exploit

3662
02:53:45,599 --> 02:53:47,391
The pain of people who have lost people

3663
02:53:47,647 --> 02:53:48,927
To opiate addiction

3664
02:53:49,439 --> 02:53:49,951
Exploit

3665
02:53:51,231 --> 02:53:52,255
The fear of immigrants

3666
02:53:54,047 --> 02:53:55,327
All he's doing is

3667
02:53:55,583 --> 02:53:56,095
Providing

3668
02:53:56,351 --> 02:53:57,375
Convenient scapegoat in

3669
02:53:58,911 --> 02:53:59,423
Talk about all the

3670
02:54:00,191 --> 02:54:02,239
Exactly the same way Hitler did

3671
02:54:02,495 --> 02:54:03,263
With the Jew Bang

3672
02:54:04,031 --> 02:54:05,311
General

3673
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:09,151
Gerald I would say

3674
02:54:09,663 --> 02:54:10,175
Look in the mirror

3675
02:54:11,711 --> 02:54:13,759
That would be my recommendation

3676
02:54:16,831 --> 02:54:18,367
Its role to play in all of this

3677
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:19,903
He brings up an Ana Republic

3678
02:54:20,927 --> 02:54:21,439
Oh yeah

3679
02:54:21,695 --> 02:54:23,231
Lot of that is propaganda

3680
02:54:23,743 --> 02:54:26,559
Capitalism

3681
02:54:27,071 --> 02:54:28,095
Right but

3682
02:54:29,119 --> 02:54:30,399
Yeah I mean that's just

3683
02:54:31,167 --> 02:54:35,519
Ultimately come down to propaganda is

3684
02:54:37,055 --> 02:54:38,079
Especially when it's used is

3685
02:54:38,335 --> 02:54:39,615
The tool from by the

3686
02:54:40,639 --> 02:54:41,151
It is

3687
02:54:41,407 --> 02:54:42,687
Is just one part

3688
02:54:43,967 --> 02:54:44,991
That's that you know

3689
02:54:45,759 --> 02:54:47,039
Unrestrained capitalism

3690
02:54:47,295 --> 02:54:48,831
Kleptocracy

3691
02:54:49,087 --> 02:54:51,135
They really you can have the

3692
02:54:51,391 --> 02:54:51,903
These people

3693
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:53,695
Who are like if the Democrats

3694
02:54:54,207 --> 02:54:56,767
While at the same time they're voting for candidates

3695
02:54:57,023 --> 02:55:00,607
Who support the very policies that are putting them where they are

3696
02:55:00,863 --> 02:55:04,191
Like if you're going to if if Alex is going to b**** about the opioid crisis

3697
02:55:04,703 --> 02:55:08,031
The very guy that you wanted to take things over

3698
02:55:08,287 --> 02:55:09,823
Is doing nothing about it

3699
02:55:10,079 --> 02:55:10,591
He's talking

3700
02:55:11,103 --> 02:55:11,615
And being

3701
02:55:11,871 --> 02:55:12,639
He's talking

3702
02:55:12,895 --> 02:55:14,431
These people

3703
02:55:14,943 --> 02:55:15,455
AR

3704
02:55:15,967 --> 02:55:16,735
Far-right

3705
02:55:16,991 --> 02:55:18,527
They're angry

3706
02:55:19,039 --> 02:55:19,551
And they are

3707
02:55:20,063 --> 02:55:20,575
Tricked

3708
02:55:20,831 --> 02:55:22,623
By the people they should be angry

3709
02:55:22,879 --> 02:55:25,439
That's what that's what propaganda is

3710
02:55:25,695 --> 02:55:26,463
Like North Korea

3711
02:55:26,719 --> 02:55:28,767
Why are you guys f****** starving

3712
02:55:29,279 --> 02:55:31,839
And yet at the same time you believe your leader is a God

3713
02:55:32,351 --> 02:55:32,863
Propaganda

3714
02:55:33,119 --> 02:55:33,631
Exactly

3715
02:55:34,655 --> 02:55:35,167
It's it's

3716
02:55:35,679 --> 02:55:37,983
You know it it's not a psyop

3717
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:39,263
So much as it is

3718
02:55:39,519 --> 02:55:42,847
If you shout live loud enough a lot of people are going to believe

3719
02:55:43,103 --> 02:55:44,127
There's a thin line

3720
02:55:44,383 --> 02:55:45,151
Between marketing

3721
02:55:45,407 --> 02:55:47,455
And propaganda

3722
02:55:47,711 --> 02:55:48,479
Is very important

3723
02:55:48,991 --> 02:55:50,015
I'm at

3724
02:55:53,343 --> 02:55:53,855
He does Lincoln

3725
02:55:54,111 --> 02:55:55,647
There whatever

3726
02:55:56,159 --> 02:56:02,303
For some reason

3727
02:56:02,559 --> 02:56:05,375
In the movie The Lincoln Lawyer and he was also Abraham Lincoln

3728
02:56:05,631 --> 02:56:06,911
What's going on

3729
02:56:07,423 --> 02:56:08,703
So anyway

3730
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:10,495

For sending us down this

3733
02:56:15,359 --> 02:56:19,711
In history and also it was not really all that much about

3734
02:56:20,223 --> 02:56:22,015
Experience

3735
02:56:22,783 --> 02:56:27,903
Very important things in the mythology of Alex Jones travel episode we've ever done

3736
02:56:28,159 --> 02:56:28,671
You're like

3737
02:56:28,927 --> 02:56:29,439

3739
02:56:31,999 --> 02:56:33,535
He's going to do Y2K all over it

3740
02:56:33,791 --> 02:56:34,559
Nope

3741
02:56:35,583 --> 02:56:36,863
It's camps at the airport

3742
02:56:37,375 --> 02:56:39,423
No concentration camps

3743
02:56:39,679 --> 02:56:40,191
Austin Airport

3744
02:56:40,447 --> 02:56:43,007
Except for the one where Reagan got busted

3745
02:56:43,519 --> 02:56:46,335
That was Target

3746
02:56:46,591 --> 02:56:48,383
He wasn't necessarily but

3747
02:56:48,639 --> 02:56:49,407
He was definitely pay

3748
02:56:54,015 --> 02:56:54,527
Goodonya

3749
02:56:54,783 --> 02:56:55,807
Delivery life

3750
02:56:56,319 --> 02:56:59,391
So I mean we've gone through a bunch of bulshit

3751
02:56:59,647 --> 02:57:02,207
The currency being illegal

3752
02:57:02,463 --> 02:57:03,743
Narrative

3753
02:57:03,999 --> 02:57:05,791
The idea that

3754
02:57:06,047 --> 02:57:07,071
Madeleine Albright

3755
02:57:07,327 --> 02:57:08,351
Walter Cronkite

3756
02:57:08,607 --> 02:57:12,447
Came out publicly and said that Osama Bin Laden was killed before

3757
02:57:12,703 --> 02:57:13,471
All that stuff

3758
02:57:14,751 --> 02:57:16,543
All these things are really easily the monster

3759
02:57:16,799 --> 02:57:21,151
Probably not true the chicken man narrative yez is full of s***

3760
02:57:22,687 --> 02:57:25,503
American Hero

3761
02:57:25,759 --> 02:57:26,271
America

3762
02:57:27,295 --> 02:57:30,367
You know what I think he's not as cool as

3763
02:57:30,623 --> 02:57:31,391
San Diego

3764
02:57:32,671 --> 02:57:34,975
Goodnight who is Mike the Headless

3765
02:57:35,487 --> 02:57:36,767
Oh that's true

3766
02:57:38,303 --> 02:57:39,583
It also then we just have

3767
02:57:40,095 --> 02:57:40,863
Capture

3768
02:57:41,119 --> 02:57:42,655
Beware it really came together

3769
02:57:43,167 --> 02:57:45,983
Like to know also I listen to the day after this

3770
02:57:46,239 --> 02:57:48,543
Real talk about it very much ever you know why

3771
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:50,335
Go get Charlie Daniels at a guess

3772
02:57:51,103 --> 02:57:53,151
Wow yep

3773
02:57:53,407 --> 02:57:54,175
Tootsie ask

3774
02:57:55,455 --> 02:58:01,087
How did you come up with the Devil

3775
02:58:01,343 --> 02:58:04,415
Charlie Daniels is on to talk about how evil Agenda 21

3776
02:58:04,671 --> 02:58:10,815
We got to get to the bottom of this Devil Went Down to Georgia

3777
02:58:11,071 --> 02:58:12,607
Charlie Daniels answer underwhelming

3778
02:58:13,631 --> 02:58:14,655
Story

3779
02:58:14,911 --> 02:58:16,447
He has no story about how he came up with

3780
02:58:17,727 --> 02:58:18,239
He stepped down

3781
02:58:18,751 --> 02:58:19,263
Wait

3782
02:58:19,519 --> 02:58:20,031
He was predict

3783
02:58:20,287 --> 02:58:22,335
Exit program

3784
02:58:22,591 --> 02:58:27,199
Be comfortable with the death indeed but it is

3785
02:58:28,223 --> 02:58:28,991
The time capsule

3786
02:58:29,247 --> 02:58:30,783
I appreciate that for what it is

3787
02:58:31,039 --> 02:58:32,319
Absolutely

3788
02:58:32,575 --> 02:58:34,111
Let me ask you a question

3789
02:58:34,367 --> 02:58:34,879
I got it

3790
02:58:35,135 --> 02:58:36,671
Have you ever been to a website

3791
02:58:38,463 --> 02:58:42,815
No okay well you can times that I ever have

3792
02:58:48,447 --> 02:58:54,591
You're not on Twitter

3793
02:59:03,039 --> 02:59:05,087
You should hire a social media manager

3794
02:59:05,855 --> 02:59:08,671
This podcast that is so great

3795
02:59:08,927 --> 02:59:10,719
Is that by Design

3796
02:59:11,231 --> 02:59:12,255
You have to do all the way

3797
02:59:12,767 --> 02:59:15,071
If I start doing any work

3798
02:59:15,327 --> 02:59:16,863
Demolishes the entire point

3799
02:59:17,119 --> 02:59:20,959
I don't think less of you for not doing the work

3800
02:59:23,007 --> 02:59:23,519
I'm fine

3801
02:59:23,775 --> 02:59:25,311
I started out with a healthy

3802
02:59:25,567 --> 02:59:26,847
Dose of insecurities about it

3803
02:59:27,103 --> 02:59:28,383
And then

3804
02:59:30,687 --> 02:59:32,223
Good that's how it it works

3805
02:59:32,735 --> 02:59:35,807
Now there's one guy I know

3806
02:59:36,063 --> 02:59:40,415

3807
02:59:40,671 --> 02:59:41,695
The show button

3808
02:59:43,231 --> 02:59:47,071
If we can get that number up 35% more of our goal

3809
02:59:47,327 --> 02:59:49,887
We will do a full-length commentary

3810
02:59:50,143 --> 02:59:52,191
I'll put up a Twitter poll of like

3811
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:54,495
Three options of Alex's documentaries

3812
02:59:55,007 --> 02:59:55,775
And I will

3813
02:59:56,031 --> 02:59:57,311
I promise you this

3814
02:59:58,079 --> 02:59:59,871
Spend as long as it takes

3815
03:00:00,127 --> 03:00:02,687
Going through and debunking every point in

3816
03:00:03,199 --> 03:00:04,479
And I will write

3817
03:00:04,735 --> 03:00:05,247
Jokes

3818
03:00:06,271 --> 03:00:08,575
I will do a commentary track over it that

3819
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:10,879
Might end up being like 5 hours long

3820
03:00:11,135 --> 03:00:13,439
Webcams

3821
03:00:13,695 --> 03:00:15,999
Although we can't get the rights to the LOL

3822
03:00:16,255 --> 03:00:20,095
On YouTube

3823
03:00:20,607 --> 03:00:23,423
If you guys want to support that.

3824
03:00:26,495 --> 03:00:29,823
But I do want to do it so nice and also

3825
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:32,383

CIA

3831
03:00:41,599 --> 03:00:42,367
Being a

3832
03:00:42,623 --> 03:00:43,135
Approached

3833
03:00:43,391 --> 03:00:44,159
You think about teeth

3834
03:00:44,415 --> 03:00:47,743
I think about I think about one guy I know was approached

3835
03:00:49,023 --> 03:00:50,815

03:00:54,655 --> 03:00:55,167
Difference

3839
03:00:55,423 --> 03:00:55,935
CIA

3841
03:00:57,727 --> 03:00:58,751
CIA psyop

3842
03:00:59,519 --> 03:01:00,031
Psyops

3843
03:01:00,287 --> 03:01:01,311
And let me tell you something

3844
03:01:02,079 --> 03:01:02,847
As

Tragic is that story you really would think that's biasi Optique

3846
03:01:07,455 --> 03:01:08,223
Would sound better in a mile

3847
03:01:08,991 --> 03:01:10,015
You really think

3848
03:01:10,271 --> 03:01:15,135

My buddy Ryan Beck has a great joke that he doesn't do anymore which pisses me off cuz

03:01:28,447 --> 03:01:28,959
It's a great joke

03:01:29,215 --> 03:01:31,775
Why do old people always look like they're chewing something

3857
