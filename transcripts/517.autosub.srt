00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
January 7th

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
Our first episode came out

12
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
What are we doing I don't know how dare we do this

13
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,208
We are also a cancer on this

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,536
Unexpected Warriors ago

15
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
And it's been

16
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
Fun ride

17
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,960
Inappropriate gifts

18
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
From the universe

19
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
It is it is nice to still be working on this one

20
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
With you and I appreciate that

21
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
So that is my brights

22
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,272
But now it's beautiful it's one of those things where I have a hard time remembering that we

23
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,088
We didn't do this show at some point

24
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,488
Like there's a part of me that's like we didn't open mic

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,048
Suburbs and I was doing an open mic

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
My third of the night and I

27
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
Cheap room in my memory I'm like

28
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
Well tomorrow I'm going after record

29
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,240
Ridiculous

30
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,592
The schedule has got my toes done

31
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Absolutely

32
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,712
What is I got new glasses

33
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,808
I got new glasses went about two weeks after I got these

34
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
My dog Jake

35
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Got ahold of him

36
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
And there is a tooth marks in the like all over

37
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,232
And that was about a year ago

38
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,792
And got a new pair glasses

39
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
And do you want to know how stupid I am

40
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
When I went

41
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
To get new glasses I was looking

42
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:52,032
The frames and I was like how you know what I'll do I'll get some different frames I like the same stuff but I'm going to get some

43
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,616
I got the sticker

44
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
The different one

45
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
Now they look great

46
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,184
So something doesn't look great is our prospects, programmatic a decent hour

47
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,584
Recording is a little bit late because necessity kind of had to

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
Some big news happened yesterday and you decided to sleep the whole day you

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,592
You did maybe two hours of work on this episode

50
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
We were talking on

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
On Tuesday we recorded our little bonus scavenger hunt over

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
After we recorded that we were talking

53
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,856
Tomorrow

54
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
Going to suck it's going

55
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
How to be a disaster

56
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
I'm going to have to work a whole lot

57
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
So I'm going to do nothing

58
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,656
How to treat myself to a little bit of relaxation cuz I know that Wednesday is going to suck

59
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
I didn't think it was

60
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
Going to suck in the way that it did

61
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
At that point I was kind of predicting a dumb rally what I was thinking was going to suck was that Alex it interview

62
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
Viewed my

63
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,016
And I didn't want to deal with that

64
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,136
How nice

65
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
Famous person on the plane with the big

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,815
Not going to be in the news anymore you have Mike's wins interview can have to be on the back burner

67
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,143
46

68
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
I did watch it

69
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
And it's boring

70
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,263
But we might cover it at some point.

71
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Bizarre thing to happen

72
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
I believe

73
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
The qanon

74
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,479
Who think Alex Jones is like a CIA massage Shield

75
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,039
And the two of them were doing an interview where they're like

76
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
And it won't stop talking about it on the

77
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,951
The episode that we're going to be going over today like it ends with

78
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
The two of them hug

79
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
Call Greg

80
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,559
Love it describes it as like

81
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,631
A really important moment

82
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,959
Rationalize that

83
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,359
Like it seems like a really difficult for their hero to be hugging a CIA Mossad agent

84
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,431
I would say he actually doesn't know anything about us

85
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
Doesn't care and would just like our money

86
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,343
Irene obd2b on the level

87
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
So Jordan

88
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
We're going to be doing

89
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
We're going to be going over

90
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:24,351
First of all the speeches that Owen Shroyer and Alex Jones gave at a stop Bastille rally on

91
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
The evening of January

92
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Okay

93
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Then

94
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,751
We will be tracking the entire day's cover it all right

95
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
On Infowars on January 6th

96
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:39,199
We're going to start with the American Journal

97
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Why not

98
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,623
Well I mean nothing happened by then

99
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
Zits that early in the morning

100
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
Mostly because the

101
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
Harrison Smith is hosting and he's

102
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
Basically throwing it to where I was just throwing a Junior speech and

103
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,263
John show comes on after that also hosted by Harrison

104
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
And then we've got the War Room

105
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
Which is hosted by Tom pappert

106
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,503
And also Alex Jones

107
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
And Owen Shroyer in d.c.

108
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Okay

109
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,159
So if I understand correctly we are playing the washer

110
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Washington generals

111
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,791
Is that what's going to be string

112
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:32,191
Do important I just think I do still think it's important to look at the the lens of how the coverage on Infowars

113
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,055
Editorial control

114
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,895
You can see the training that these people have had under Alex

115
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
And Alex

116
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
It does show up

117
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
For sure for sure Culloden on cell

118
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,111
But I apologize to everybody I

119
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
They've been working

120
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
Straight through

121
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,743
All day yesterday I forgot to get names for walk

122
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,607
So I'll tell you what before we start today showed like to say thank you to everybody who supports our show

123
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,423
Also everybody who would like

124
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Supportive

125
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
I'd like to thank you

126
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,823
Anybody out there who needs this today who needs their nice little

Thank you

129
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
Thanks everybody

130
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,111
On walks and I guess people who are hearing this 10 years in the future

131
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Future

132
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Sia on Wednesday

133
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,999
There was a planned rally in DC

134
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,303
We knew that there was enough without a hitch

135
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Man

136
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,887
I was not

137
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Fry's

138
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,959
Inasmuch as they've been talkin about this

139
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
This for a long time

140
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
And Alex has been trying

141
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
Incite an event

142
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
Like people storming the White House Tour

143
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,871
Capitol building

144
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
Something

145
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
That is bad

146
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
A predictable conclusion

147
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
From something

148
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,599
Lying if I said I wasn't still like shocked

149
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,415
Yeah I wasn't ready for it to happen right

150
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,815
I was I thought it was like I said already I thought it was going to be another dumb rally world

151
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
Everyone goes home

152
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:09,215
I was but I was taken aback by how quickly things got out of control

153
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Control

154
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,871
And I was at I was pretty surprised

155
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:22,271
Watching Alex's coverage of it too I'm interested to see what I was trying to avoid dipping my toe

156
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
To have the

157
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Conservative media would react

158
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,855
Too much to this

159
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Just

160
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,999
So I didn't get a whiff of you know ruining the whole premise of the show which is that I don't know what Alex is

161
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,607
Yeah so I'm very curious to see how they all take this as a

162
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,935
Glaring Lawson that they're all a bunch of embarrassing moron

163
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
I think that's what they're going to

164
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
I think this is interesting because you and I have

165
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
Very different takes

166
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
On the event

167
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
There's a little bit of it

168
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,551
Disagreement and I actually think the both of our position

169
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Oceans have marriage

170
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
And there's

171
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:03,231
To both of them believe that this was an Optics disaster and they all look like

172
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Dum Dums

173
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Hey and this is going

174
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
Going to be crippling to the right wing

175
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,655
Extremist movement

176
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,239
And I can see where you're coming from and I think that there is a place for Ibaka

177
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
And I think that is something that

178
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Is

179
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,615
You know Valley to be part of the conversation

180
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,199
Personally I see Patriot lure being

181
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Established

182
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
And that worries me

183
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
IC

184
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
Do you know the way that Alex talk

185
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
Facts about Lake Colonel Travis

186
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
Time at the Alamo and it's

187
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Isn't history

188
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,631
Atrial or something like a misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the pass

189
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Yeah

190
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
IC

191
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
That happening in the Press

192
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,543
And I see all of the elements that are necessary

193
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
In this event

194
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
To become a part of patriot lure

195
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
That is really encouraging

196
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,759
An inspiring and dangerous for people in the

197
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
And I don't think

198
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,463
But you don't think that's valid also I think that's one of the weird things about our our general disagreements is

199
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,071
I think you're probably right if certain couple of

200
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
Variable like

201
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,423
Our our worldviews are just like a couple little variables twisted

202
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,239
Did here or there and we disagree otherwise

203
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
I think

204
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
I even then we're still coming

205
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
At it from the same like

206
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
This is where all of the

207
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
These people think

208
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,247
Yeah some of these differences in our perspective

209
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
I hope they can

210
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,623
Be more fleshed-out as we go along the episode

211
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
Infowars coverage

212
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
I think it's very

213
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,511
So we're going to jump in with the speeches

214
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Papa steel rally

215
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
Redo here's an out-of-context dropped from Today Show

216
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,959
God and His Consciousness creates the ocean

217
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
The creates the wave

218
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,543
On with Donald Trump

219
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Joan

220
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
You

221
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:04,319
The ocean the ocean creates the waves and Donald Trump Alex Jones that you arrived

222
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,927
Brake locked up

223
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
He seems like he's gas

224
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
Like

225
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
It's a mess

226
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Got it's another

227
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,679
Another instance of him being the guy at the comedy show you

228
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
You never want

229
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
2Go app

230
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
You don't want

231
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
This guy in the middle of the book

232
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,871
Not we're supposed to be no cuz I was going to burn out the audience

233
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
With just

234
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
If you can't do it

235
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,063
I mean even if the guy in front of you is only doing 10 minutes 45 if he gets

236
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
8 standing ovation

237
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,135
You're done

238
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,743
So are we start with Owen though and opens for Alex

239
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,583
He does a good eat at I-5 today

240
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
He starts off by ripping off Ally

241
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
President Trump is watch

242
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,847
And he's very excited and what do you see

243
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
And he's going to have some big announcements

244
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
For us tomorrow

245
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,807
I believe

246
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
When the government

247
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
Sears the people

248
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
There is freedom

249
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,023
All the people have beard

250
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
The government

251
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,375
Well in January 2021

252
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Change it

253
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
It's a little worse in hindsight

254
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
We've been over this before but that isn't a Thomas Jefferson quote it's against socialism delivered

255
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
By John Basile Barnhill

256
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,575
That's over the years has been miss attributed to a bunch of people like Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson

257
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
Perhaps more interesting Lee though In that clip

258
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Appears that Owens trying

259
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,231
To promote the idea that Trump is going to show up at the rally the next

260
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
This was the first instance of an Infowars in

261
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
Employee behaving in a way that led me to believe that they had

262
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,911
No idea people were planning

263
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
To storm the capital the bank

264
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,031
They're acting 100% business as usual

265
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,591
Promoting what they expect will just be another afternoon

266
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Profitable terrorism edging

267
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
Going to be playing

268
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
That's kind of the vibe that I get

269
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,039
This is all I can Infowars business-as-usual

270
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
Does Owen being a dumb s*** head

271
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
And the theme is

272
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,207
Four more years for Donald Trump in Wildwood

273
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,511
I think all of us can get behind that

274
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
I'd like to see a thousand more years of human freedom and 1000 more years

275
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:33,055
United States of America

276
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,431
Then deal with climate change

277
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:45,087
How far it always happens

278
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:50,207
That always happens Breakout

279
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Here's the problem

280
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,047
I'm going to give you this right now

281
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
There's only one that I can

282
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Here's your route

283
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
Those dumb

284
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
You can steal

285
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Anything

286
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
And they will have no you stole a

287
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,663
Thomas Jefferson quote from not Thomas Jefferson and they

288
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Still bought it

289
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,759
Why wouldn't you go out there and be like

290
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
Would you rather have a Lexus or Justice

291
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
Do you want some substance

292
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,815
Okay I see you working hard

293
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Schools don't teach history

294
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
Seattle player

295
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Stay awake

296
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
Yeah horse reindeer really fancy and

297
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
Just completely lie to the audience

298
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,871
Just like grapes don't exist

299
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,991
Shoot the moon what's the light

300
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,319
The fake Thomas Jefferson quotes

301
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
So in the pocket

302
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
Territory

303
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:58,047
Also I would say that even under like ideal conditions I don't know if America could last

304
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
Another Thousand Years

305
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:06,495
Country 2

306
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Baby baby

307
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
We could still exist

308
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
In some fashion

309
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,687
But not like a superpower I mean it'll probably be more like the Holy Roman Empire

310
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
Was in Germany for a while

311
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
You know like that kind of

312
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
It would be bizarre to imagine

313
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:27,231
Continuing at the other ideas for that long

314
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
Small parts of man Montana that caught up

315
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
It's a foolish

316
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
But I will say I think that or when

317
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Feels bleh

318
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,263
To get into a line of work that you and I used to

319
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
Explorer I think he wants

320
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:47,455
Start doing open-mic you want to do a little bit but you remember when he took the tank down to the Austin

321
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,855
Ready to go on the

322
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Sure you got a new bit

323
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
What you know

324
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,279
Nancy Pelosi said that you can no longer

325
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,119
Mother and father in Congress did you see this

326
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,471
Why not news for Nancy Pelosi

327
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,567
Trap is your daddy

328
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,919
Goodbye goodbye solid solid piece of work right there

329
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,343
We're doing me you can't say mother and father again 24 hours prior to

330
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,743
To the fall of the United States government a nuclear power of one of the leaders of the resistance said

331
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
Who's your daddy

332
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,447
Great 5 years ago they did this you can't say mother and father paranoia

333
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
Great to see them bring them back to hit

334
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
It's about time

335
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:49,663
So this is in response to Nancy Pelosi the house updating their rulebook

336
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
Text of the rulebook

337
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
Doesn't include gendered language

338
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,343
But that doesn't mean that you can't say mother and father

339
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
That's against the rules

340
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,439
It's just not in the text of the rule right

341
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:06,559
This is like Spooner do you know they've been doing new stuff for five years but whenever you go in public

342
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
You still got to play the

343
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Yeah but

344
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
This would be like

345
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,983
You know you don't play Freebird for a few years

346
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,543
You bring it out as if a

347
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,943
Has never been played before in public that chance to get a free bird out there

348
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Are you know

349
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,551
I would save Freebirds along song

350
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,367
And Owen Shroyer set is not long

351
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,647
It's a smart move

352
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
This is no Stairway to Heaven

353
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
That is a

354
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Okay alright

355
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
2 1/2 minute pop song

356
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,423
He's getting out of there and he's a he's also another stand-up reference

357
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
Shotgun

358
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,775
Situation

359
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,103
It's my pleasure to introduce a man

360
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,479
It's my honor to introduce a man

361
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,551
Who was the Genesis in many ways

362
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:05,183
August 2nd American Revolution dear FBI

363
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:10,559
Alex Jones was in many ways the Genesis of this started

364
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
With one man

365
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,679
On public access television will tomorrow

366
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,287
Turn into millions of Americans in the streets of Washington DC

367
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,175
Lego Republic

368
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,855
I really also does not look great in that in hindsight

369
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,815
Only one man on public access at Austin Texas is responsible for everything that happens tomorrow

Throwing him under the bus by way of flattery

380
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,095
This is the greatest man who is responsible for everything

381
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:22,495
I thought I found myself feeling like this is terrible

382
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,055
Put them the other thing that I was feeling was

383
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,407

00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:47,231

But he's also got a catchphrase and he's got a catchphrase

413
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Apparently

414
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
Audiences will

415
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855

Wild never heard that before in my life

422
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:46,368
Yeah but I mean if you if you think of you want to fight you better believe you got one that was a long

423
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,904
Anything for people to

424
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Yeah

425
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,536
I thought I was a little bit late

426
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,120
The Lord's Prayer saying I don't remember all of the Lord's Prayer

427
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:03,008
If I was up after this I would be worth what the Lord's Prayer

428
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,056
Bring the energy out of

429
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848

00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
He's going to f***

432
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,016
I'm not going to be able to follow

433
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Anyway

434
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,344
He almost alienate the audience

435
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
The Lauryn Hill if the right

436
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,584
He almost immediately after this after getting a git er done

437
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
He almost alienates the audience

438
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,192
By accidentally saying that Hitler was bad

439
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,520
Gangster

440
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
Star Wars was a monster

441
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
But 1033

442
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
Gingy bang dad

443
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,016
Overshadow their Prime

444
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,392
Angry Birds

445
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
RJ

446
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
A mother's love

447
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
At Tristan

448
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,792
A Buddhist and exhaustion

449
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
Are Chinese

450
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,608
Odell Beckham

451
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,632
Of what

452
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,240
I think it's f***** up

453
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
Eggdog

454
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:14,176
You can tell that Alex has a serious scholar of Chinese history in the Chinese Communist party because he knows the names of Maui and she

455
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,760
I actually kind of think that he doesn't realize that she is a

456
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
Set Mouse successor

457
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:25,440
And I'd love to bring up who Jintao to him he would say who and then we'd end up in the Vaudeville

458
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,768
Legitimately like to ask him if

459
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
Pino's

460
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,072
Fit Chairman Mao Haddaway

461
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,864
I would be

462
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Did to know if he

463
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
He thinks then

464
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,936
The whole time it was

465
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,776
I don't know

466
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:44,384
In a couple names

467
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,456
Leaving that aside it's important to understand that Alex is lying

468
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
To this audience

469
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Sensitive area

470
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,856
He doesn't care at all what kind of does to the weaker population

471
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
Muslim

472
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,928
Except when he can use their pain as a weapon against

473
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
His own anime

474
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:02,304
In this case he's in front of a crowd so he wants to establish the moral High Ground

475
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,632
A imaginary evil enemies who Sports on his treatment of Muslims

476
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,704
When he's alone on his own show speaking freely

477
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,984
You sound a little bit different

478
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
Like he did on May 26th

479
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
From Michigan to Texas

480
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
From London to Los

481
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,456
Rio de Janeiro to Berlin

482
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,760
There are called the prayers

483
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,624
Cuz I know it's a group ride

484
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:38,656
Do you think check their repressive treatment to ensure these populations

485
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
She cares

486
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,616
What would Alex is doing here onstage is exactly what he and his friends accused the entire left

487
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Does doing

488
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,016
Virtue signaling China treats Muslims because

489
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:59,136
The only Muslims that would be allowed in America would be the ones who agreed to convert to his bizarre idiotic version

490
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Christianity

491
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:05,536
Quite simply Alex's using the false impression that he's offended by how the Chinese government treats the tweakers

492
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,864
In order to pretend that his criticisms of China come from a sensible

493
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
A real place

494
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
When in reality they're mostly just

495
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
The rewarmed

496
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
John Birch

497
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,288
Society Cold War.

498
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,640
Yep it's a it's a it's a bummer but also Alex need a little bit f***** up

499
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,480
Use a diesel messed up

500
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
Yes there are

501
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
Currently I would say

502
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:32,672
The countdown of ways to learn we've gone from 10 to about

503
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:39,328
When he gets down to a four we know we're f***** up right now there are eight ways that I would say that he's having a good time

504
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
And more importantly he has

505
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,680
Had a good time before this

506
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,984
You've been having a good time

507
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
Relationship

508
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,800
Gas

509
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
Mikey has nocardia

510
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,664
If you're a comic and you want to be like a high-energy comic

511
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
You'll quickly learn

512
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
If you're out of shape

513
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,272
You're going to have a really tough time with that

514
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,856
DC Comics or like maybe a little bit more energetic

515
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,136
Sometimes it'll be sweating

516
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
That's because

517
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
It's hard

518
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
It's hard to keep a

519
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
The energy app

520
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,096
I think Alex is learning now we're only a half hour is

521
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Alex is learning this the hard way

522
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,008
Authoritarian throughout history have pat on the Bolsheviks

523
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
Bad dad on the Nazis

524
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,616
On every other

525
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Will Ferrell

526
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:33,344
I guess you're right in a way odd

527
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
Big Freedia the universe

528
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416
There is a God

529
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,208
That inspired our Republic

530
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
Edgar is a God

531
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
There's a control

532
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,304
Ma

533
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,328
Abdomen

534
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:48,192
Real real sweet if we are loyal

535
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:54,592
I don't know if it came through as well on the audio but you can tell

536
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,176
Is breath after just about every other word

537
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
And it doesn't look

538
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
Comfortable

539
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,576
But

540
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
Listen to Safe territory

541
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
Start this getting into religion

542
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
Get in get out

543
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,816
And once you start talking about religion it's important that you level with the audience

544
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,376
You got to be real

545
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
Let's hear this one

546
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,240
Make no mistake I'm like

547
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
Liliana

548
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
Thanks for going to erupt

549
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
Things are going to get bad

550
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,480
We've already allowed the murder of 60 million babies in this country

551
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,528
Animal

552
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,088
So weird sometimes

553
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
We're hundreds of feet deep

554
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,672
It's really hard for a backhoe service

555
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,464
And not everybody

556
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
Is going to make it

557
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
But that's okay

558
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
Because in the end

559
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,864
God will fulfill

560
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,168
And will

561
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:58,080
Outside of like some surface-level stuff this is exactly the

562
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
The kind of speech I would

563
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,432
Expect to hear at an Isis rally

564
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,480
Different decoration that's different

565
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,552
Themes maybe but like this is this is

566
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
This is called

567
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
These guys are

568
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,720
Are you I am so happy

569
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:18,048
To remember how many times people told me

570
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
Years ago like

571
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Don't call them Isis that's

572
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
That's too bad

573
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,240
I love it

574
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
Love it

575
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
IQ

576
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
The past

577
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:35,456
Well if it's possible for you to have been onto something and also wrong again

578
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,296
But maybe not now

579
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:43,136
Screen

580
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,184
God Rises up man

581
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
Who are real

582
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
Goddamn that

583
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
Are above reproach

584
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
Real man

585
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,144
President-trump

586
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
Whose fault

587
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
Reproductive

588
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,384
Pecan

589
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
Ugly toes

590
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,224
A representative

591
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
Do your daughter return

592
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,320
Hold up President Trump

593
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,656
Party for him

594
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:37,408
Sounds like his voice is about to bottom out to like give up the gasoline Road Warrior

595
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,272
Okay

596
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,880
Thanking thanking God for sending Trump is he deliver

597
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
Subway

598
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
It's funny too

599
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
Hear that speech

600
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,768
Like broadcast

601
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
On TV

602
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,120
And like no it like I'm not but I'm not positive this speech

603
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
No.

604
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
A little more like

605
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
Imperial Centerville

606
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
Traveling throughout speitzer

607
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
It's sent

608
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
Broadcast Network

609
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,504
Around everywhere all of this happening

610
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
Instantly

611
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:19,648
In his pocket is a small little brick with all of human history record

612
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
Inside of India but he's like

613
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
We've got

614
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
Trump is our deliverer because

615
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
Super weird world

616
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,120
It's super weird to to imagine that signal like going

617
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,656
Into people's homes

618
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,704
At least one person is watching it like

619
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
Damn right

620
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,520
Yeah that's very bizarre

621
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,848
What sea is this the Miracles in your face

622
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,432
This speech

623
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
It's like yeah yeah

624
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:48,832
I get I get what Alex is doing I can understand

625
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,392
Baffling to me to imagine that

626
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
You know people are like

627
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Wild

628
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,232
This is good yeah man

629
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:01,888
This is my favorite character

630
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
Free Road was Immortal

631
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,984
Joe I thought he was the guy I wanted to follow

632
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,288
Ride-or-die immortan Joe

633
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
Well it could not be worse

634
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
Spend Bill Gates money

635
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,128
All I know

636
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,480
I was looking around. Banned. Video

637
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,784
And there's a new section on there and it's

638
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,856
Just titled Bill Gates is evil

639
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,024
I guess that's also a folder I have on my desktop but I guess that's what Alex is doing instead of making that documentary

640
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,864
Call Bill Gates is just got a place where he's posted some shity videos

641
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Nice organized

642
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
But he doesn't run the world

643
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
That Bill Gates

644
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
What is God

645
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
Okuma destiny

646
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
Martha okay

647
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,128
Batman

648
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,176
Not Lord Rothschild

649
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
Understanding

650
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
Is the universe

651
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
Control

652
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,400
We recognize God we connect with God

653
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:15,616
I think people worried about when that sentence was

654
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,176
Yeah that way

655
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,760
Highland calf

656
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
I don't mind a run-on

657
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,600
Mine one but there are times when you should

658
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
It felt like

659
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
The sentence was

660
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:33,792
As drunk as Alex appears to be assertive staggering forward

661
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Alex says also doesn't

662
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
Look great in hindsight

663
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
Tomorrow

664
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
Enterprise

665
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
We do quietly take the election

666
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,664
We don't quietly take the scam

667
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
And believed RBS

668
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,784
The system

669
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,832
Has had good desperately

670
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,392
Engage get this gambling

671
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,184
To maintain control

672
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:02,976
Well

673
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,768
Either Waterloo

674
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,304
Will be

675
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,096
Destruction

676
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
Emigrate

677
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,472
I would say that if I

678
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:19,872
And I were confronted with that

679
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
This is all political

680
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
Political only

681
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,992
Hey I have not talked about

682
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,320
Literal events at that would be smart

683
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:32,928
So now here is my concern when I was talking about being the person who comes up after him is like

684
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
He's going to lose

685
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,488
Krowd

686
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,560
Keep this up this is

687
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,680
He's going to burn out fast

688
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:51,360
Start dipping his toes into covid Denial in the audience

689
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
School

690
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,248
Stop the steel route

691
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:03,904
Everything YouTube with a big Tech censorship

692
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Atomic attack

693
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,744
And the covid lockdown

694
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,536
Mou and martial law

695
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
Worldometer

696
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
Porto's

697
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:16,448
How did you get here

698
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
The world

699
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,712
Government Chicken Little

700
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,248
Witch Hunt system

701
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,928
61000 more people died

702
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,256
They talk about Hitler

703
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,072
When you can

704
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
Drug addiction

705
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,656
Drug overdoses suicide

706
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:55,616
Harley Quinn

707
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
Have to go out

708
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
You have to expose it

709
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:12,256
It's falling apart a little bit I think should have left that one again

710
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:16,608
A little bit drunk now Alex a little bit too drunk to stay on target

711
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:23,520
Sometimes you'll be onstage like it matters three B will land in like

712
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
I'm going to tryouts

713
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,128
I just got f***** up

714
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:32,736
No I think he's in I think he's in a nice little world of like

715
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Hold on

716
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:38,624
I'm going to do one more bet that last one didn't land so I'm going to do one more and then that one lands in your life

717
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
Oh s***

718
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,440
How many do one more after that I'm going to

719
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,488
Push it I'm going to get blue blood in this ride

720
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,816
No one's going to get this but he's Mike Sheehan

721
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
Yeah I would say that about right

722
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,960
When you when you're in that circumstance

723
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
That's the only thing you can do

724
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,312
Is Retreat back to what was working

725
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,920
Try and be like okay I was being dirty earlier I tried to be like more

726
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
Introspective

727
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
Observational

728
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,504
They didn't like that

729
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Got to go back

730
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,880
Don't be mean to Hitler I realize that if you're mean to Hitler

731
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
But religion is Papa

732
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,952
Go back to religion

733
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
So we must now

734
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
President-trump

735
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,608
And lift him up the Todd

736
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,912
And ask God to give him the guidance

737
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Sherman

738
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,984
Evan leadership

739
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,312
In dogs worm

740
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,872
Breakdown the New World Order

741
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,456
Go back a little bit alright

742
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
Alright

743
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
It should be harder

744
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,320
If it were not very smart

745
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,416
They believe things like that like that fake Jefferson quote earlier

746
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
Churchill

747
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
A famous Beach

748
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,888
Braeside all I can promise you with blood

749
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,704
And pain in 1 hour

750
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
What the New World Order.

751
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
Electric rice

752
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
World

753
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,120
I may be wrong and I'm open to admitting that if Alex

754
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,520
God provide that to that citation but I think he's trying to remember his first speech as prime minister in

755
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,312
House of Commons in 1940

756
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,128
Alex I think is misquoting is quote

757
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,224
In this crisis I hope I may be pardoned if I do not address the house at any length

758
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Today

759
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:46,880
I hope that any of my friends and colleagues are former colleagues are affected by the political reconstruction will make allowance

760
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,976
For any lack of ceremony with which it has been necessary to add

761
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,816
I would say to the house as I say to those who have joined this

762
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,864
I have nothing to offer but blood

763
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
Toil tears and sweat

764
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
People at 12 tears

765
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
Sweating is an attempt

766
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,264
Distress to his government that he's working

767
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,544
B A shorts

768
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,104
Not a promising you the blood

769
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,224
After this Churchill comments on his strategy for fighting WWII

770
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,296
Which is the other part of what I think Alex is messing up here

771
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,344
You ask what is our policy

772
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:23,744
I can say it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might with all our strength that God can give us

773
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,304
The wage war against the Monstrous tyranny

774
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
Never surpassed in the dark

775
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,888
Lamentable catalogue of human

776
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Crime

777
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,680
That is our policy

778
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,752
You ask what is our aim I can answer in one word

779
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
It is Victory

780
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,800
Victory at all costs

781
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,592
Victory in spite of all Terror

782
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,408
Victory however long and hard the road may be

783
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,712
For without victory there is no survival

784
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,040
Three elements of slightly more eloquent than Alex makes

785
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,648
I will give you blood

786
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
I reminded

787
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,232
Greg Churchill cloud

788
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
What is best in life

789
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
It wasn't good

790
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
I think

791
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,432
The bed is definitely the quote but he's mixing up

792
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,528
Because whatever he does is really shity Churchill impression

793
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,832
Bilap

794
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,048
He's changed in the moment it is drunken idlebrain.

795
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,864
I know that I know that a lot of people are struggling

796
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,424
You know I think a lot of people had a tough time

797
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
With the watch

798
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,752
The events that unfolded on Wednesday

799
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,592
Still recognizes that there's a lot of people in pain

800
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,384
Maybe some people in the audience

801
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
Feeling in pain

802
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,968
And I shouldn't this is his messages

803
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Of unity

804
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
No hope

805
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,624
God. Nobody

806
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,696
For anybody I got into might be feeling alone

807
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
Jennifer

808
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
Never

809
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
Never feel alone

810
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,376
Bugatti

811
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,496
No matter if your car broke down in the middle of the desert

812
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:14,080
God of the universe built you

813
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Will

814
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
Andover. Channel

815
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,928
Enclosing

816
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,000
Enchilada today or tonight okay

817
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
I love the idea of Owen Shroyer sitting off

818
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,840
Stage laughing

819
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,632
This guy's got the good

820
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,448
I will follow Captain my Captain

821
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,008
Take a note

822
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:51,456
So it is in the back listening to his sack record

823
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:57,856
Later on tonight

824
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
Go to f***

825
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
Hidden Shamrock

826
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
Why why not do it

827
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:06,560
Although I do hear that and I kind of think to myself it would be really interesting to see The Alex Jones

828
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
Motivational

829
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
Speaker

830
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
You know like

831
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Hey

832
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
You lost your job

833
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
Taxman sucks

834
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,312
Guess What You're Made In God's image

835
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,920
No matter what you got is minimizes your problem

836
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,504
Tell me that God made you out of Stardust or whatever

837
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
I know you're poor

838
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
Come on now

839
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,184
A the end of Alex's speech

840
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,512
And where we will leave the stop Bastille rally

841
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
From January 5th

842
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,903
General plan

843
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,231
Rodger Stone

844
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,583
As You Are

845
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,863
Whether you be black

846
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
What do you mean why

847
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
God loves you

848
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,823
And I will never suffer

849
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,639
We will prevail

850
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
Woohoo

851
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,479
While too very weird

852
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
Yeah

853
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,551
You got to end

854
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,599
1876

855
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
And upset

856
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:41,279
Walk-off you don't need to reveal that you've completely blanked on who else is speaking General Flynn

857
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:47,679
Nope don't even end with almond as I weird

858
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,215
Still leave the quest

859
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,775
Junior mind what does he think that means

860
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:57,919
You got people storming the capital the next day you got him

861
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,759
Inspiring chance of 1776

862
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,551
Kind of I mean

863
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
Look

864
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:10,207
Understand what year are you drawing a connection between the two I'm not necessarily I'm just the narrative consistency

865
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,143
If these two events were in a fictional story

866
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,423
The author we're arguing

867
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
That one

868
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,471
Led to the other

869
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,263
It would make that would make sense

870
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
Cause anything

871
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,687
Proven entropy standpoint

872
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,783
In front of the other I think you know which you would

873
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,367
We go to the

874
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,415
I will be here for a while

875
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,463
Will be spending a little bit time

876
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
Frenchy's

877
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,351
It doesn't happen until

878
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,143
Almost the end of Alex's show

879
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,167
Sure actually

880
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,959
Probably in the second hour I

881
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,751
Think is when the actual like

882
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,847
When were the barricades

883
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,407
Proceeded to get wild pretty fast

884
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,831
We'll deal with that as best we can as we as we go along

885
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,135
But we're still in this sort of

886
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,463
Much more innocent time now because we're listen

887
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,487
The American Journey

888
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,791
Sure which is Guinness supposed to be calling

889
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,839
Ellen show there's no calls

890
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,375
No call zero calls

891
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
Yeah I'm not even one

892
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
Call Timber Alexei

893
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,199
A seventeen-year-old host

894
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,015
Very shortly

895
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
True

896
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,087
Could be a baby

897
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:47,487
I think he's like a high school sophomore internship

898
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,887
AV block

899
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,167
Local

900
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,703
College Area High School

901
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,543
The news of the day for him

902
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
Beginning is the Thursday

903
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,871
This Trump rally that's going to be going on

904
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,151
But also

905
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,711
Georgia got stolen

906
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
What do you expect

907
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,063
They haven't been punished of course they're going to do it again

908
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
And so they did it again

909
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,135
So Georgia

910
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,951
Looks like it was lost

911
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
I think one of the

912
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:25,375
I'll get an update here but as far as I know both races are projected to be Democrat victories

913
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,679
Although one is still

914
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,471
On that the hairline

915
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
Victory margin

916
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:39,455
Junior is live right now on the stage only go to him he I think has a major future if there's anybody that could source

917
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,015
His father succeed his father

918
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,063
Remember seeing him give a speech

919
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
At the RNC

920
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,135
In 2016 and thinking

921
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,439
I am putting my money on this guy

922
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
Disgaea

923
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
This guy can carry his father's mantle

924
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,071
And keep that torch lit

925
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,887
Let's go to him now and then watch this live feed

926
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,935
This John Junior kids got something

927
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,959
Wow

928
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
Please my future

929
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,519
Isaac Carree

930
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,055
For sure

931
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:11,455
The way he introduc clip made me really excited pump hear what I wanted to hear

932
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:15,039
Punished for stealing last time

933
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:21,695
I thought myself very bored listening to Harrison a day calendar because he wouldn't

934
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
Not stop funky

935
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
Considering abrogate

936
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,047
A lot alright

937
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:31,423
I was going to make a Supercut of it but I got like three or four times that I cut it out notice I got any

938
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,727
Most one abrogate

939
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,519
Per week these people wax

940
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,591
Mike Pence has abrogated C-Max

941
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
At 1

942
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
Anyway

943
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,711
There's a lot of stuff that I was listening to

944
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,759
Would have just sounded like

945
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,039
Bragi bulshit

946
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,831
If people hadn't

947
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:52,671
Rodger wormed Capitol building

948
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,023
There's a lot of stuff

949
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,351
Here is one of them

950
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,399
Truly incredible stuff

951
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
Of course

952
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,983
What we have just learned

953
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,287
And I'm excited to share once again is that

954
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,823
President Donald Trump himself

955
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,615
Personally asked Alex Jones

956
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
2

957
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,175
Weed this March

958
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,271
Following outruns a speech he will be at the Bangor guess they didn't want to win

959
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
To the Capitol

960
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,319
And it's a

961
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:24,671
It's truly incredible just go ahead and leave that life ft up we leave me in a box to

962
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
Just because

963
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
Nami people tuning in for its the

964
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,047
Incredible events going down in Washington

965
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:34,399
You're right

966
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,423
I would say

967
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:42,079
Now it would probably be even have they have known that people are going to storm the

968
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:48,479
Capital

969
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,271
Personally asked by Trump

970
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,343
To believe the march from the speech to the

971
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,367
Capitol building

972
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:58,207
Seem like my resume pretty quick

973
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,511
Also this looks discount

974
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
Silly in hindsight

975
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,607
That's the message we need to tell the police's

976
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,655
You're a human being you're not a robot

977
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,447
You know what's going on here

978
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:11,007
You know who the good guys are who the bad guys are

979
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,311
Shouldn't be confusing to you

980
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,615
Shouldn't be up in the air for you when you have

981
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,639
Chords of

982
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,687
You know just black lives matter

983
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,503
Just failures just supported by the state

984
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:26,367
Coming out to the capital city to try to burn down buildings to try to tear down statues

985
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,951
Call yell at police and called him all sorts of horrible things

986
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,511
Then you have interest on protesters marching saying

987
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,327
Thank you to the cops saying you know we support you

988
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,887
It's not too difficult to know

989
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,679
Who's bad guys aren't who's good guys are

990
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
Couple hours later

991
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,239
Christine

992
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:46,335
Interesting things you're saying

993
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
Perhaps

994
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,199
Perhaps you may not be viewing yourself through the appropriate

995
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,247
I think I might be

996
00:48:54,527 --> 00:49:00,159
One of the things I find really interesting is Harrison's doing play-by-play of the Trump rally

997
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,439
And so you had Don Jr

998
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,255
Who's this fresh upstart he's a he's got

999
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,535
You got a bright future ahead of him

1000
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,839
Now there is an actual

1001
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,375
GOP upstart

1002
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,655
Who's really like

1003
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:14,751
Kind of a hot commodity

1004
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,079
Yeah yeah the Nazi who's in a wheelchair

1005
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:22,943
25

1006
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:27,807
Like the person who would want an all kinds ad campaign

1007
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
Sure

1008
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,903
I don't I don't know enough about his politics

1009
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,463
Everything but based on the speech

1010
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,487
I'm not thrilled

1011
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,791
Interesting

1012
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,071
Do still know who he

1013
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:39,839
He is

1014
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,423
Square jaw and all

1015
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
Harrison

1016
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,847
Doesn't know who he is

1017
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,895
Real Madison cawthorn comes up

1018
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
To give the speech

1019
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
Yeah he's up like

1020
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:59,295
Madison something that's fantastic

1021
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,343
His name is

1022
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,647
Is easy new he's a new

1023
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
Congressman

1024
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
His name is

1025
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,047
I'm in Lincolnton right now Madison or something

1026
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,631
But but he was just elected he's promised to stand up for Trump again stop

1027
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
Bastille Wild

1028
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,983
I love it I want this

1029
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,775
Steube Infowars is new

1030
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,055
Entire

1031
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,383
I want Harrison

1032
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,711
To host every show yeah I think this is dynamite

1033
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:31,551
Looks familiar

1034
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,135
Madison cawthorn zip they're doing is doing his speech

1035
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Just to show that everyone is a door

1036
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:55,871
Love that USA Champs

1037
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
A

1038
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,687
Parody of a parody it is

1039
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,223
It really is

1040
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
Yeah

1041
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,527
Speaking of parodies of Perry

1042
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:08,415
Up next Rudy Giuliani Rudy is giving a speech

1043
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:10,975
Man-o-man

1044
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,815
A lot of people took issue with him saying that He suggests

1045
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,095
Trial by combat

1046
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Call Storm Dwight

1047
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,447
Which is objectively hilarious

1048
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,983
It is it is

1049
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,567
It's a poor choice of words sure

1050
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,359
Well I I mean

1051
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,431
I get why you would be hand-wringing over that

1052
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,991
I understand it to nobody says

1053
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,783
Trial by combat meaning

1054
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
Store Mebane

1055
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:42,719
Sure it means one-on-one Game of Thrones

1056
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:49,119
Stupid even so that's not what he was talking about you actually listen to the context he's talking about the reputation of Donald

1057
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,679
Trump versus the reputation of Joe Biden

1058
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,983
He's just trying to argue Mountain versa

1059
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,007
The sand snake

1060
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:58,847
Makes her whatever

1061
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,127
Two of them actually fighting

1062
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
He wants 10 days

1063
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,967
His whole argument has he wants 10 days

1064
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
For them to go on

1065
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,295
Fishing experiment

1066
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
Expedition

1067
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,623
And try and find something in the ballot

1068
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
That they can make an argument

1069
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:15,999
Presenting it that way it'll take 10 days for them

1070
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:19,327
Define defraud that they already know is there or something

1071
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,607
Stick arbitrary measure of

1072
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,447
I love time is exactly 10

1073
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,591
We get to see the machines

1074
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
Too late

1075
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:07,199
If I were Rudy Giuliani and I could get anyone to gamble again

1076
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:13,599
My reputation I don't care what I said to win I'm taking that.

1077
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,135
2 reputation

1078
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
More worthless if

1079
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,463
Amazing

1080
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,815
Number to Giuliani I'm Campbell in for like a sandwich

1081
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:27,167
I have every bit of my reputation

1082
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:33,055
From 9/11 bear to standing in front of the Four Seasons Landscaping Company

1083
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
So

1084
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,639
I got a little bored

1085
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
At this point

1086
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,199
Because Harrison is really just

1087
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
No covering these

1088
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,015
Speeches and it's a lot of speech

1089
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:48,415
What to see this person landed in amazing exclusive

1090
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,719
Right now we have any

1091
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,791
Exclusive we are on the line with Rob do who is there

1092
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,327
App to save America March

1093

Live on the ground at thanks for

1094
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,935
Connecting with a drive-by no

1095
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
It's difficult

1096
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:05,311
Cell phone signal there with all of the massive crowds what is the

1097
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,103
What is it like there on the ground Rob

1098
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,407
It's a seat Patriots

1099
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,687
The city of Happy

1100
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:17,087
Happy people really believe you

1101
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,111
That is an exclusive

1102
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,975
Also technically one of the most

1103
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:28,351
Accurate ways you can use the word exclusive

1104
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:34,751
All the networks are knocking down radu's door cuz I would love to go

1105
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,055
On Fox News today but I've gotten

1106
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,359
Exclusive

1107
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:44,991
Xrd Buell

1108
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:48,319
There you know I do ever the

1109
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,367
Bumbly

1110
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,903
Dumb dumb

1111
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:58,047
I can't even come up with the right words to express how much of a goof this guy is schlemazel

1112
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Sure

1113
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:02,143
He's got to come in and get a little piece of that pie

1114
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:06,239
And that pie of course it's saying things that look really bad in hindsight

1115
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,287
Right when the president starts

1116
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,079
Speaking about halfway through Alex

1117
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,103
Full album

1118
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,639
And then we're going to leave that marks

1119
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,663
To the Capitol

1120
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
To surround it

1121
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,455
And let these

1122
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
Dogs that are trying to

1123
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,015
Steal our Republic know

1124
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:22,111
What's going to happen to them if they do go through with their dastardly Deeds

1125
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:28,511
Yeah and you know I got wish I was there I mean the energy must be amazing so I guess Rob is expressing with that

1126
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,303
The intention of the marches

1127
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,167
To scare the covers into not certifying the results of the election

1128
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
School what they need to know is that we are at

1129
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,751
Threat to them

1130
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:39,775
Physically

1131
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:45,151
They should be scared for their lives we're going to do this we are going to

1132
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:48,735
Follow through on that threat should they not give us what we want exactly

1133
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
Popped

1134
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:54,111
I thought so Donald Trump coming up next

1135
00:55:54,367 --> 00:56:00,511
What are you doing

1136
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,071
The second American Revolution has begun

1137
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,911
He can't do that out to break like that

1138
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,727
It will go fast

1139
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,543
Alex

1140
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,127
Overly dramatic like really exciting

1141
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,687
You can see like

1142
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,247
He's trying to do some of Alex's tricks

1143
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
But he just can't

1144
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,551
He doesn't have it no

1145
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,575
Embarrassing

1146
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,135
Sing again to know that a couple hours after this

1147
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:27,903
People

1148
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:28,927
Storm

1149
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
Capital

1150
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,303
I think it's a little bit weird that

1151
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
It's not like it this

1152
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,095
Does Harrison Smith

1153
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,935
First time on mine like he's been on Mike for a long time

1154
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,471
How do you not just

1155
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,287
Allow yourself into the joy of

1156
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
Following out with music

1157
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
I don't know you know

1158
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:51,711
How can you not get pumped how could you not even like at least sing a little bit along he sounds

1159
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:57,855
Robert probably because Alex would hear about it and he beat him up for working inside of the street

1160
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,903
No that's my game

1161
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,207
Yeah but get a little into a get a little hip

1162
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:08,607
Man if I if I would come in

1163
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,399
Silver Stallion

1164
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:13,727
Holy God

1165
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,055
Begging Alex.

1166
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,383
Collars call in and then be like you're boring and play a song

1167
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,407
Sing instead

1168
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,991
It always be the Highway 31 would go crazy

1169
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,527
So

1170
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,623
Since the little bit of perhaps racial animus earlier

1171
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:34,207
From Harrison blacklivesmatter failures

1172
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,255
And what have you

1173
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,815
Easy a little bit more of that on

1174
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
Display here

1175
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,143
The Democrats are allowed

1176
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,167
2

1177
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,703
Carry out this fraud if there

1178
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
Do it again and again and again and again and again

1179
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
The also increase

1180
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,591
The number of

1181
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
Immigrants by

1182
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,151
Magnitudes of 10

1183
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,479
Refugees by many many millions

1184
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,807
And completely open the borders outright bill

1185
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,343
Install socialistic

1186
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,879
Programs that

1187
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:07,231
Reward people that don't work don't provide and

1188
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,511
Have nothing but

1189
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:11,839
Hatred Forest ICICI Owen Shroyer there

1190
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,887
You see him right there to the left of the stage

1191
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:14,911
Screen left

1192
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
Stage right

1193
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,703
Shroyer

1194
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,727
Just stood up

1195
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,775
And is looking around that's him right

1196
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,847
I do think that moment is a little cute at the end

1197
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:26,175
Watching the video you can see like almost real exciting

1198
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
Where you at

1199
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:33,855
I think that might actually be friends I think that but I think that sounds right later on

1200
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,671
Like Owens on the phone

1201
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,999
Talk over each other

1202
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,023
Yeah they both

1203
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,559
Apologize to each other

1204
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,447
How people would interact

1205
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,239
I know that's what I'm saying

1206
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,775
Puppies otamatone

1207
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:58,175
Watching Alex interact with people it's so goddamn Rudolph music.

1208
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,015
It's bizarre to see like actual like a

1209
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,319
Excitement with see my friend on TV

1210
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,623
Polite conversation

1211
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:12,767
Azhar Azhar solo

1212
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
Betty White

1213
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,607
I'm a guy who's just

1214
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Shoveling

1215
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,423
Pile of a

1216
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,239
Stuff that looks bad in hindsight Yorkshire

1217
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:26,079
Can add to that

1218
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,359
What's this

1219
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
Course today is the day

1220
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,431
That the

1221
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,503
Congress will vote on whether or not to certify

1222
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
And

1223
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,343
Codify the

1224
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,647
So-called fraudulent results

1225
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,183
Of the election

1226
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,743
They're many machinations that

1227
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
Could be

1228
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:51,679
You know pulled out here in the last in the last minutes or so the last hours

1229
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:58,591
Of course it's not really over until January 20th but today is the day that we've all been waiting for its David Donald Trump himself

1230
00:59:59,103 --> 00:59:59,615
Requested

1231
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
His supporters

1232
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,223
Come to Washington DC to see him speak into stand-up

1233
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
Against

1234
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,295
The lies just information and fraud

1235
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,831
Of the mainstream media

1236
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,879
In their controllers in the Deep state

1237
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,183
Feel incredible stuff

1238
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,975
Of course the word is

1239
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,535
Alex Jones was requested by

1240
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,839
Donald Trump himself can use March

1241
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,631
The driving that home

1242
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:26,239
Oh boy

1243
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:30,079
Is in order for it to be like

1244
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
Isolated

1245
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:35,455
In just a few minutes Alex Jones will actually be leading the March

1246
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,479
To the Capitol

1247
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
At best

1248
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,319
Personal request of President Donald Trump

1249
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,135
Alex Jones will be at the head of that Vanguard

1250
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,951
As the entire crowd this massive

1251
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,487
Cumin

1252
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,279
Snake this is huge

1253
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
Just

1254
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,143
Unimaginable almost crowd

1255
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,471
Trump supporters who have made their way to the nation's capital

1256
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,775
I will wind its way towards

1257
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,567
Capitol building

1258
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
How's it going

1259
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
Wow

1260
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,175
What age

1261
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,199
Chest

1262
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,223
Glowing waves

1263
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,527
You describe your friends and people you love

1264
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:13,343
Are they look like

1265
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,647
The mood is jovial

1266
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:19,743
Among Trump supporters in d.c. or at least that's what

1267
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,023
Harrison is gassing car

1268
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,327
Based on his assessment of it

1269
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,351
Occupied

1270
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:31,519
Back folks the mood is still a jovial one here in a courses on Rob do reported

1271
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:37,919
Live on the scene and there at the Save America March in Washington DC it's like it's uplifting everybody

1272
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:41,503
Happy everybody's feeling good at the same time there's an underlying

1273
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,039
Aggressiveness

1274
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,575
Beneath the surface

1275
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,391
Anaa and unrest

1276
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,183
I suppose you could say

1277
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,207
Pervading

1278
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,487
Spirit of

1279
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,023
American Trump

1280
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,095
Supporters everybody's a little bit on edge because once again

1281
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,375
We have tried

1282
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,399
And tried

1283
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:02,239
And tried and tried and tried to play Within the rules we have tried

1284
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,615
To make the system change itself to get back on track

1285
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,383
To stop

1286
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,663
Have you endless

1287
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,711
Drive to bankrupt

1288
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,735
And enslave us

1289
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:15,295
And time and time again we are met with

1290
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,343
Traitorous and seditious

1291
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
At blocking us

1292
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,415
From carrying out

1293
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,463
Hey we gold lawful

1294
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,535
Within the bounds of of the game

1295
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:30,399
Change it now they've prevented us at every pass our last and final

1296
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,423
Outlet

1297
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,495
Was our sacred vote and that is what has been

1298
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,775
Stolen from us or

1299
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:39,103
At least it's still in the process of being stolen from myself

1300
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,895
So you're making the argument that the

1301
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,455
The jovial mood is Pierce

1302
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:47,551
Only by the recognition that there are no more legal ways for you

1303
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
Deal with the problem

1304
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,647
That are existentially threatened

1305
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
Going to you

1306
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
So you're saying that

1307
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,487
It's time to do illegal things

1308
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,279
It is a solemn moment

1309
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,583
That we must decide to

1310
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,607
Extrajudicial

1311
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
Take back our

1312
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,167
Married

1313
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,983
When's that that's exactly what we wanted to do so we're feeling

1314
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,775
I'm pretty good about it right now

1315
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,567
Is a real jovial atmosphere

1316
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:12,383
Kill a few people

1317
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:18,783
Jaunty music playing at Graham we got a flapper contingent over there

1318
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,087
Are there a doing little via

1319
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,159
So earlier in the episode we already heard

1320
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,719
Harrison saying that

1321
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:27,999
You know

1322
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,791
We had the storm

1323
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:33,375
Denotes the Georgia election

1324
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:37,215
So this bit of news that he comes to at the end of his show seems

1325
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,519
Unbelievable

1326
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,567
Capital Bank reports

1327
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,591
That these

1328
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
Send it

1329
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,175
Races in Georgia

1330
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,223
Attracted 300,000

1331
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,247
Les Bois

1332
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,527
What's the Donald Trump got

1333
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,063
For president

1334
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,367
Indicating that the Breezy

1335
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,391
Stayed home

1336
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,719
Why would we go out of our way to support

1337
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,743
A party

1338
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:04,095
That refuses to lift a single finger for the president of the United States we all voted for

1339
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,143
Undermined him at every pass

1340
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,167
I thought it was stolen

1341
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Wait

1342
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:12,799
You're saying that it's that people didn't show up to look for animation tablet

1343
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,359
Because she's a bad

1344
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,383
Keokis Amanda

1345
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,223
What but they got Bev debuted in

1346
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,807
Didn't show up because it was preempted

1347
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:24,831
We stolen

1348
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:34,047
These don't seem to be counter explanations for they almost in

1349
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:40,447
At at odds with one another Infowars

1350
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,007
Perhaps even one with the

1351
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,799
Suggest that they don't even know what they believe

1352
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,103
Maybe they're very

1353
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:53,503
Confuse feels good feels right that they stole it

1354
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:59,903
Didn't show up

1355
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,439
They stole it

1356
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:07,583
Obviously it might have something to do with us saying that they stole elections and that elections don't matter

1357
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
So your vote.

1358
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,399
Doesn't matter so it doesn't matter if you vote

1359
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:16,031
Alexander's making a lot of money off the stuff

1360
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:21,407
So Harrison is hosting Alex's show so it's basically just a smooth transition

1361
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,431
Into the Alex

1362
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,455
Gun show

1363
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:29,855
Welcome to The Alex Jones Show on Harrison Smith it's January 6th and Donald Trump is just begin

1364
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,903
Began speaking to the stop

1365
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,463
Steel March in Washington without any further ado

1366
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,231
We go now to

1367
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,535
The president of the United States in Washington

1368
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:42,143
So I apologize in advance the first hour of the show is just Trump speech

1369
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,935
And so we're going to have to listen

1370
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:49,311
Come to a little bit of it I know that we generally don't listen to step this is pretty wild

1371
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:55,711
I think that it also sets the stage for a lot of the contents a tiny things

1372
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,759
Things that end up happening

1373
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,087
Please try not to scream too much we're recording this late

1374
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:01,855
Screaming

1375
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,463
So it's kind of

1376
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,487
Trump rambling

1377
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,023
A bit about how he

1378
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
Describes a really huge

1379
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:14,655
And fake news World prize eggs

1380
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:20,799
Go ahead turn your cameras please would you show they came from all over the world actually but

1381
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,847
They came from all over a country

1382
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,479
I just really want to see what they do

1383
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,271
I just want to see

1384
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,319
They covered I've never seen that

1385
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,111
But the

1386
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:40,511
It would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media the media is the biggest problem we have

1387
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:43,071
As far as I'm concerned single biggest problem

1388
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:43,839
Wow

1389
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:52,031
Are you making whimpering dog noises

1390
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,335
Well if that seems

1391
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,895
Kind of soft

1392
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,687
There's so many week

1393
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,879
But it's it's incredible

1394
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:09,951
Many of the Republicans I helped them get in I help them

1395
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,767
Get elected

1396
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
I help

1397
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,351
I could name

1398
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,143
20

1399
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:21,727
Four of them let's say I won't bore you with it

1400
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:26,079
What the f*** is going on but this

1401
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:31,455
This is so bizarre that this is what's happening that this is a speech to the east

1402
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,735
Aye

1403
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,527
I never listen to him

1404
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,295
So

1405
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,367
It's so weak I think this is something that is under-reported

1406
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,927
Amongst all of his terrifying words

1407
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,719
Is how much of a

1408
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,791
Pathetic little whiny

1409
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,071
He's a

1410
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,607
Little tiny

1411
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,631
You imagine

1412
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,423
Anybody else in a leadership position

1413
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:57,311
Complaining about the 24 people I've helped to her ungrateful to me

1414
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,335
My God

1415
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,639
Grow up

1416
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:04,735
Respect that in a boss I would respect that

1417
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,527
Contemporary

1418
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,879
I would respect that anybody that is

1419
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,671
Childish it

1420
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,743
You imagined like Obama

1421
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,839
He made fun of my Tears

1422
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:26,239
All these Democrats

1423
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,663
It's just

1424
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,431
So sad

1425
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,759
The president

1426
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,527
I swear

1427
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,855
Trump says b******* in the middle of this clip

1428
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,439
Extra

1429
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,023
I don't know if Nixon ever

1430
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,047
Swore and then

1431
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:54,655
A crowd of people started chanting this way or he just said

1432
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:59,519
Using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of

1433
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,799
Mail-in ballot

1434
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,079
Democrats

1435
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,383
The tempted the most Brazen and outrageous

1436
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,663
Selection

1437
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,735
Superior theft

1438
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:11,039
In American history everybody knows

1439
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,855
Everybody knows our election was over

1440
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,415
Will eating

1441
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,487
Pennsylvania Michigan Georgia

1442
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
500000

1443
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:25,375
I do and then late in the evening or early in the morning

1444
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,423
Boom this explosion

1445
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,703
Bulshit

1446
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:35,615
And all of a sudden

1447
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,991
That's amazing

1448
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,783
Do you know why

1449
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,551
Do you know why

1450
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,831
All of this s***

1451
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,623
Do you know

1452
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,183
I will say this

1453
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,975
This is what I ate I believe

1454
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,791
As much as

1455
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,839
Is the cops are totally complicit with all those

1456
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,119
People getting through in all of that

1457
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:01,215
The reason that the National Guard and all of those people

1458
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:02,751
Word already at the ready

1459
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,543
Is because of s*** like

1460
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,847
Professional rapper

1461
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,151
None of these people thought

1462
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,175
That any of this was

1463
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:10,943
Real

1464
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,247
Yeah I mean professor

1465
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:16,319
You're telling me that a crowd of people

1466
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,623
Who's listening to the president of the United

1467
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,647
State's a goddamn

1468
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:26,047
The biggest economy in the nuclear f****** power is going to get taken down by a crowd of assholes screaming

1469
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,655
Is perfect

1470
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,935
Big Dipper

1471
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
Scream Park

1472
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,031
Yes it's the same s***

1473
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:40,127
Weird definite Alamo

1474
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:40,895
Meant to overlap

1475
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,943
And when you're losing

1476
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,223
In a wrestling match

1477
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,247
Got to fight harder

1478
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:48,319
And that's what Trump says people got to do this is

1479
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,367
Keep in mind right before people

1480
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,391
Call Storm.

1481
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,207
And we want to be so

1482
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
Nice

1483
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:58,303
We want to be so respectful of everybody

1484
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,071
Including

1485
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,607
Bad people

1486
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,423
And we're going to have to fight much harder

1487
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,007
And Mike Pence is going to have to come through

1488
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,287
Hanabi dozen

1489
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,615
That will be a sad day for a cont

1490
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,407
Because

1491
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,199
Your sworn

1492
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,247
Arkansas

1493
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,271
Institution

1494
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,879
God is up to Congress to confront

1495
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,927
This egregious assault

1496
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,951
Walnut Demarcus

1497
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:32,095
Donald Trump giving it to Republicans and Democrats alike in defense of the Constitution we have to go to a

1498
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:32,863
Quick commercial break

1499
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,911
The Alex Jones Show we'll be right back

1500
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:38,239
Depends to save the Constitution which I guess

1501
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,263
Do not know

1502
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
Took the meds

1503
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,103
Seemed

1504
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,639
Seemed very 121

1505
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,687
Seem very if

1506
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
Then

1507
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
It's it it

1508
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,015
Again narrative

1509
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,063
Consistent

1510
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,855
Kind of interesting how

1511
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,159
The night before I was trying out a little bit

1512
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,439
Stand up

1513
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,231
I noticed

1514
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,767
Trump might have the sand of it

1515
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,071
I'm going to little bit

1516
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,631
And the only unhappy person in the United

1517
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,167
Single most unhappy

1518
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,447
Is

1519
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,215
Hillary Clint

1520
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:12,543
Because she

1521
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,871
Why didn't you do this for me for years ago

1522
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:19,199
10000 in Michigan

1523
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,015
You could have changed the whole thing

1524
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,319
She's not too happy you noticed

1525
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
Where is she

1526
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,183
I bet did not land

1527
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,231
You would have expected that bit to go over

1528
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:37,631
Foster's with Matt to that crowd but no problem with that bit is that he unfortunately

1529
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,447
Did his entire bulshit for this election

1530
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,471
Yeah

1531
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,519
Why didn't they do it for her

1532
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:47,103
Yeah it's less a comedic premise as much as it is a plot hole

1533
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:01,695
Huh well we didn't those Gunners on the Destroyer shoot down the Escape pod with

1534
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:04,511
C-3PO and R2-D2

1535
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,327
Hilarious hilarious

1536
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,399
This is this is worth

1537
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,423
Pull-A-Part

1538
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,959
Trump

1539
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,263
He wants to train

1540
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,567
Prove that there was there was fraud

1541
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:23,967
As you know the media is constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was

1542
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,759
No evidence of widespread

1543
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,623
Oh really

1544
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,671
Walking to read you pages I hope you don't

1545
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,463
Bored listening to a promise

1546
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,767
Don't get bored listening to all those

1547
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,791
Hundreds of thousands

1548
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,071
What is the people back there

1549
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,375
Move up

1550
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
Play Cher

1551
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:47,775
All they all these people don't get bored don't get angry at me because you're going to get bored

1552
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,311
Because it's so much

1553
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,591
They do get bored

1554
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,639
Yeah I need to start rattling off numbers

1555
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,687
The audience

1556
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,967
I think is able to pay attention

1557
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,991
It's not exciting

1558
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,271
He loses a little bit

1559
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,575
In retrospect

1560
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:03,135
If all of these speakers had known that the

1561
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,159
The crowd was

1562
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,463
More of us

1563
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,743
Storming crowd

1564
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:09,791
Anna

1565
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,327
Like they like chant

1566
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,631
But they love storm until we learned that

1567
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,191
I don't think the numbers game was really going to end

1568
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:16,959
Inspire them in

1569
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:24,127
Recorders out

1570
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:28,223
But that's a little bit lower

1571
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:33,599
Stuck In The Weeds you're not coming back out talkin about covid

1572
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:39,999
One out of every ten people we already stopped listening listing off County

1573
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:44,863
Twitter

1574
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,911
Every time I put out a tweet

1575
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,215
Even if it's totally correct

1576
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:52,031
Only correct

1577
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,823
Tickets

1578
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:57,151
And they also don't let you get out you know on Twitter

1579
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,199
Very hard to come on to my account

1580
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,759
It's very hard to get out of message

1581
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,295
They don't let the message

1582
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
Get out

1583
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,599
Nearly like they should

1584
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:08,671
But I've had many people

1585
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,695
I don't care about

1586
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,511
What is bad news they're all bad news

1587
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:15,071
Newsletters bad news

1588
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,119
Oh man

1589
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,911
How funny is it how

1590
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,471
Long everybody is tried to respect the office

1591
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,263
Yeah

1592
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,543
How hilarious is it

1593
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,103
This might have all ended if

1594
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,127
TV news anchors

1595
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,199
Just treated Trump the way I did and every time he whines is my

1596
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:35,039
And then everybody was

1597
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,319
Maybe

1598
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,111
I mean

1599
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,903
I know that generally we don't

1600
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,671
Don't cover

1601
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,975
When you know Trump speeches but awesome

1602
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,743
They don't

1603
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:46,815
Play the feed.

1604
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
It's

1605
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,167
I had to listen to

1606
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:54,239
That's why I have

1607
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,543
Because they

1608
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,359
Like really if you're if you're listening

1609
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,383
In the audience

1610
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
You kind of get

1611
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,175
A certain message

1612
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:06,271
These powers only option

1613
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:09,343
And it's time that somebody did something about it

1614
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,903
And Mike Pence I hope you're going to stand up

1615
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,719
Of our constitution

1616
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,279
About country

1617
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:21,887
Out of your not I'm going to be very disappointed in you I will tell you right now

1618
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,703
I'm not hearing good stories

1619
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,239
Stories

1620
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:29,055
That's pretty clear but it's

1621
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,335
The

1622
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,639
Applicants have to get tough or you're not going to have a republic

1623
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,919
Can party if you don't get tough

1624
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:37,247
They want to play so straight they want to play Soul

1625
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,039
The United States

1626
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,599
The Constitution doesn't allow me

1627
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,623
Just send them back

1628
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,439
What's a yes it does because

1629
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,975
The Constitution says you have to

1630
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,743
Protector

1631
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,535
Igf2 protect.com

1632
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,095
And you can't vote on fraud

1633
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,399
Android breaks up everything doesn't it

1634
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,447
When you catch somebody in a fraud

1635
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,471
You're allowed to go

1636
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:02,335
I should know I've cheated on my wife I hope Mike has

1637
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,615
The courage to do what he has

1638
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,383
Citadel

1639
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:08,735
And I hope he doesn't listen to the rhinos and the stupid people that he's

1640
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:15,391
Whenever you have the present out there saying that like no Pence's the last chance to really

1641
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:19,231
Save this as a responsibility to do it

1642
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:19,999
Zen pencils

1643
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,535
Doesn't do that thing

1644
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:25,631
And the president has also said that when something is stolen you're playing by

1645
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,655
Current set of rules

1646
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,679
It's kind of

1647
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,959
Hard to not take

1648
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,495
Where your messages like

1649
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,031
There's no rules

1650
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,079
The rules that are normal

1651
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:34,847
Argon

1652
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,175
Do find it difficult to take

1653
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:43,039
A would-be strongmen dictator seriously if he gives an entire speech

1654
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,343
Exhorting his second-in-command

1655
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
What is a

1656
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:49,439
Borderline a honorary position

1657
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,767
It's to overthrow the

1658
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,535
Country for him

1659
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,327
That's a little bit sad

1660
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,351
Mixed in with

1661
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:02,751
Petty complaints

1662
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:08,127
But that's kind of. Kind of a thing though

1663
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,663
It could easily be

1664
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,735
White blinds you to the real danger of a lot of things

1665
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:15,295
Easy to to minimize

1666
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,087
What some real threats are

1667
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,367
Because of that window dress

1668
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:19,903
I was like hitting this

1669
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,671
Pathetic

1670
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,207
And I don't want to

1671
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,023
So

1672
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:27,071
Donald Trump speech now

1673
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:27,839
Is that the most

1674
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,375
That that is relevant

1675
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,911
Comparison comes back

1676
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:33,727
He wants to throw it to video what's going on

1677
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,751
In Congress

1678
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,799
Where Mike Pence is presiding over this

1679
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,335
But they actually send it

1680
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,359
To the streets

1681
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,127
Where Alex

1682
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,151
Is bullhorn

1683
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,455
Let's go to

1684
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,015
Inside the chamber here

1685
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,319
The report is

1686
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,703
What does that mean

1687
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,983
It doesn't have a good

1688
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
Rhythm

1689
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,823
It doesn't have a good M now it doesn't as far as a chant goes

1690
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,895
Muse painting 1776

1691
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:17,247
I don't know what message You're supposed to take away from that other than overthrow the government

1692
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,527
What happened at 7

1693
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,295
1376

1694
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,319
Except he would be referee

1695
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,855
Barbados at Revolution

1696
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,415
It would did anything else happen though

1697
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:25,695
I mean I'm certain

1698
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:32,607
What happened to let's see did open to business

1699
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:36,703
I would say that I think Benjamin Franklin opened up a little side gig

1700
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:43,103
Grinding lenses I think that's also what happened in 1776 I guarantee there was somebody in

1701
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,919
Like Virginia who's also like everybody

1702
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,967
He's not referencing that

1703
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,063
Sam

1704
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:58,207
Batista's first beer Sam Adams somebody in Virginia was trying to get people

1705
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:04,607
To have rationality calmer heads will prevail that's not what he's referring to

1706
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,399
Cricket diplomatic

1707
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:08,447
Delusion is in order

1708
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:11,263
So Alex still is not like great with long

1709
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,031
Stretches

1710
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,824
Will still end up becoming

1711
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,360
Nothing really overwhelmed by

1712
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,664
You got to yell into a bowl

1713
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,480
Sew-ins got to come in here and there

1714
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:39,168
Illegal

1715
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:47,360
Too good little boy

1716
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,384
Oh man

1717
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,432
Yep so what I was listening to this

1718
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,992
This action of Alex and Owen on the

1719
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:57,088
Street it really felt like they were trying to juice this crowd

1720
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:57,856
It feels

1721
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:58,880
Kind of like a

1722
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,648
Incitement

1723
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,952
What is a gentleman

1724
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,832
21st century Warfare

1725
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:42,400
It seems like if you're in the audience who probably this is the kind of thing that would be like

1726
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,424
What you

1727
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,728
Then yell then you charge

1728
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,312
Should I take the country back

1729
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,640
You're not giving me answers

1730
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,944
I'm not getting concrete answers from you

1731
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,528
Supplements there's actually a way to take the country back

1732
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:02,368
In front of me so I'm going to go do no no no no no no you need to

1733
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,648
To spread my links

1734
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,304
Right by spreading legs video

1735
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,608
Well overthrow the government

1736
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,888
Jaws take a walk

1737
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,448
We get back to the car you'll be able to

1738
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:19,264
Just be cool one of those pictures of

1739
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,288
F****** wall man

1740
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:25,664
I want to tour the other day and there's this pictures no it's on the Capitol building

1741
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,528
Stopping the Chinese only be achieved by more traffic coming to my website

1742
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,808
I don't think you understand

1743
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,368
Cross purposes

1744
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:38,464
We have different ideas of what 1776

1745
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,488
It looks like

1746
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:43,584
And your 1776 you get rich

1747
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,888
I feel like that's different than mine

1748
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:48,704
You're trying to profiteer

1749
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,728
So

1750
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:55,616
Owen Harrison has been clear that allegedly

1751
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,408
Donald Trump

1752
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,200
Has personally asked Alex to leave this

1753
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:03,552
That's weird because well they're showing Alex

1754
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,344
You can overhear a producer

1755
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
Tell Alec

1756
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,928
Trump told the audience

1757
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,952
At his speech

1758
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:15,328
That they were going to March down Pennsylvania

1759
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,096
Yeah

1760
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:29,152
Pennsylvania State live feed from Washington DC right now Alex Johnson

1761
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,432
Troy speaking to a large

1762
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,200
Krowd

1763
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,736
That exchange doesn't make much sense

1764
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,272
That's if Trump is

1765
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,552
Stu

1766
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,320
But whatever

1767
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,880
I don't care it's going down

1768
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,160
Pennsylvania Avenue

1769
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,696
Where am I

1770
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,488
Transylvania

1771
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:48,096
Yndc where am I

1772
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,376
The long walk

1773
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,656
From here

1774
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:53,728
Here's where we get our first mention of the

1775
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,008
The breaching of barriers

1776
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:58,080
And I think it's really interesting because these people have started

1777
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:00,640
To encroach Over The Line

1778
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,688
Haha at the same time

1779
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,992
You have audio of Alex

1780
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,040
Yelling about the New World Order

1781
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:10,112
Broadcast that Harrison is trying to put together

1782
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,392
You have a really

1783
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,416
Interesting

1784
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,208
Juxtaposition of these two things

1785
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,512
Mike Pence has rejected

1786
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,536
Trump's call

1787
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,072
He has failed to show the courage

1788
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,352
The Donald Trump was attempting

1789
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,120
2

1790
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,400
Imbue in him

1791
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,424
And has

1792
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,240
McGann at the counting of the electoral votes

1793
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:32,128
The same time there's word that thousands of Patriots have broken through

1794
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,664
The

1795
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:40,320
Barriers around the cap and moving towards it to the ground

1796
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:44,416
And continues to speak to the scribes go back to Alex Jones

1797
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:06,688
That looks bad eyesight real bad

1798
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,736
I just

1799
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,016
I'm starting to see a

1800
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,296
Pattern

1801
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,064
Dematic

1802
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,344
Consistent

1803
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,624
Yeah you know

1804
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,720
11 * I think the word incitement is is overused

1805
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,024
You know it's a very specific meaning

1806
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,584
Yeah this is that specific meaning

1807
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,864
Yeah it's

1808
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,144
It's it's interesting

1809
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:26,912
Because

1810
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,960
This group does

1811
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,288
Are not the same people

1812
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,896
Harrison is talking about breaching these barriers

1813
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:37,664
At the same time

1814
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,944
Alex's group

1815
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,736
Going to go to the Capitol

1816
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,528
Heading to the Capitol

1817
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:46,368
To some of the people that are in Alex's group may have gotten involved

1818
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,416
We'll have to insert

1819
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:54,304
For the time being these are two separate things that are happening

1820
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,072
100 +

1821
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,096
Sentence

1822
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,424
Anthony accepted like a lot of those people who are the

1823
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,704
First ones that were pictured

1824
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:01,984
Inside

1825
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,288
The Capitol building where qanon weirdos

1826
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:07,104
I was just talkin about the Great Awakening which is such a

1827
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,640
Like a trademark

1828
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688
Follower

1829
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,040
Basically their brand

1830
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,600
It's just it's it's a lot

1831
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,672
But I will say

1832
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,464
Analysis credit

1833
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
Maybe

1834
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,792
Discredit he's very insistent

1835
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:29,632
To make sure people hear him say we're not going to

1836
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,680
Knock knock

1837
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:36,288
As we say estimated 1000000 people

1838
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:42,688
Moving to surround the capital loan Troyer in Alex Jones now speaking through the bullhorn to the crowds who follow them

1839
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,440
Fireworks

1840
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,512
Keep it on the record

1841
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,864
I think just after that you can hear someone say

1842
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,656
Utah

1843
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:07,008
I think a producer also is in his ear there

1844
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,568
Hey they were there actually doing it so

1845
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,640
I don't know how much Alex would be aware of it

1846
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,664
This point because

1847
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,480
You know communication would be difficult was that many

1848
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,760
People in a

1849
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,296
Such a tight space

1850
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,832
Communication could be tough

1851
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:22,112
I know that Alex does have

1852
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:25,952
Quite a security detail to probably have walkie-talkies private banyak

1853
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,488
There is a chance

1854
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,024
Actually spoiler alert

1855
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,584
I know that he has somebody who's inside

1856
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,400
Yeah so like I know that like he

1857
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,960
I have a hard time believing he doesn't

1858
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,496
No more than

1859
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,544
A little so I don't know if he knows

1860
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,568
The full scope of

1861
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,360
It seems strange

1862
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,432
To me but also not that strange that he would be very insistent

1863
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,480
Alright

1864
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,016
Yeah that seems a little bit tablet

1865
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:54,112
Brand for him because he always says like

1866
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,392
Politically

1867
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,696
I want to kill you politically

1868
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,488
I talked to say

1869
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,280
They're also

1870
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,048
No

1871
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,352
Getting people riled up while they walk

1872
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:09,984
Tomorrow

1873
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:48,128
It was really interesting about there.

1874
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,152
Cuz Alex doesn't

1875
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,432
Cardio to walk

1876
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,480
And carry on sentences

1877
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:56,064
And simultaneously Owen doesn't have a creativity

1878
01:28:56,320 --> 01:29:00,672
To speak more than like in Little bursts

1879
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:02,720
His crutches

1880
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:05,280
Three-legged race

1881
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,352
Yeah well it's

1882
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:14,752
Teamwork level of complementary Parts here

1883
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,336
Fluid this is not

1884
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,104
Definition

1885
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:19,872
No

1886
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:22,176
No no mo Stephen solid Queen

1887
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:25,248
Couple quality to be found here nobody

1888
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,016
The same thing

1889
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,576
In terms of like they need each other in order to make the

1890
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,344
This work

1891
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,880
It's a block

1892
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,672
Harrison's Bakery

1893
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,208
Studio needed some other things

1894
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,000
Instareport primarily

1895
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:36,768
You getting worried

1896
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,816
That staffers are evacuated

1897
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,096
From

1898
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,120
Capitol building

1899
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:48,288
Addressing the house right now but here's an update as of less than a minute ago Hill staffers have been told to

1900
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,056
Evacuate

1901
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,336
The Madison Building

1902
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,664
Things are getting tenuous here as Trump supporters and Patriots

1903
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,968
Continue to pour towards the capital

1904
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,272
Alex Jones himself at the head of a mask

1905
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:02,112
Call of Patriots moving now towards the United States Capitol building

1906
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,392
This

1907
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,416
Again

1908
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:07,232
Looks like bad looks bad

1909
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:09,024
The government is

1910
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,792
Pleasing

1911
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,352
At the head of the Rebellion

1912
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:17,472
Well they're going to enjoy another Rebellion that is already in progress

1913
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:21,312
They're the reinforcement column that's coming in

1914
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,592
Yeah how is Joseph

1915
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,640
Flanking the f****** Capitol building

1916
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,456
To certain extent I kind of

1917
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,480
Think they at

1918
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:31,040
The reason that is being presented like this

1919
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,576
Is they still think

1920
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,624
Going to stop

1921
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,184
You still think they're not going to get inside

1922
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,232
Everybody thinks that someone will stop them

1923
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:40,256
Yeah

1924
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,280
But

1925
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,584
Because there's still this like

1926
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,376
Kind of vibe

1927
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:54,080
This is a historic day with Incredible things happening they're storming d.c.

1928
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:57,664
Patriots are rushing and surrounding the capital

1929
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,712
They're tearing down barriers

1930
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:02,528
Police are struggling to maintain the crowd mace

1931
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,600
And punches being thrown it back and forth

1932
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:06,624
2

1933
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:10,976
Two house buildings have been evacuated the house Cannon Building

1934
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,768
Anyhow Madison Building

1935
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:15,072
Have both been issued evacuation orders

1936
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,632
Pintu said he cannot reject out

1937
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,168
Electoral votes out right

1938
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,448
But the

1939
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:24,800
Congress themselves are objecting right now to the Arizona votes

1940
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,336
The vibe is really positive

1941
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,640
This is someone who's like

1942
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:29,920
Really pump

1943
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,944
To see what's happening

1944
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:33,760
Was great this will never go wrong

1945
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,040
And I know that

1946
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:40,416
Now they're a lot of people who are trying to make arguments that this was antifa certainly

1947
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:42,208
Superatv

1948
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:47,072
Immediately

1949
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,864
Everything is unfolding

1950
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,656
Harrison wants you to know that this is

1951
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,936
He's not into the

1952
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:55,008
This is not blacklivesmatter folks this is not antifa

1953
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,032
These are Patriot

1954
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,056
And

1955
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:00,384
Perhaps they finally boiled over you see the air

1956
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,408
Filled with the Mist

1957
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,176
Of Mace

1958
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,200
This stinging

1959
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:03,968
Gas that

1960
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,248
The police will be

1961
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,832
Implementing in that is also being implemented against the police

1962
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:09,856
As Patriots

1963
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:11,648
Wow

1964
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:16,256
So I mean okay people who are Mesa

1965
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:18,304
Cintas pictures

1966
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,328
Yeah so

1967
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,352
Check that

1968
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,888
Just for later totally

1969
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:28,288
He's very clear this is not This Is Us

1970
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,848
Celebrate

1971
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:33,152
Celebratory 5

1972
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,200
American nationalist on Twitter

1973
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,040
Asking President Trump to storm

1974
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,064
The Senate chamber

1975
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,600
This day is Young Folks

1976
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,648
And who knows what will be

1977
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,952
What's the weather future hold

1978
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:46,976
For us again Elijah

1979
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:49,536
Schaefer reports Patriots of storm the Capitol building

1980
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:53,120
Ground in a breaching Federal barriers and police in Mass

1981
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:53,888
And who knows what

1982
01:32:54,144 --> 01:33:00,288
What the day will bring lady exactly what you're talkin about to happen

1983
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:05,152
It happened interesting pretty consistently calling these people Patriots sure

1984
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,456
Thousands hundreds of thousands of people

1985
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,736
Right now moving towards the

1986
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,504
The capital

1987
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,296
The mass of humanity continues

1988
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,576
To grow as the police

1989
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,344
Lash out

1990
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,416
They're thin line of armored officers

1991
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,696
A pitiful

1992
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:19,488
Resistance against the

1993
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,792
Littoral tidal wave moving towards them

1994
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,840
Beautiful resistance against please

1995
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,864
Patriots

1996
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,888
They're so strong

1997
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,192
Seterus

1998
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,472
Reporting on what

1999
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:33,056
Because he has access to a lot of different

2000
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:35,360
Information. Yeah yeah

2001
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,896
Alex may or may not

2002
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,432
So now we go to

2003
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,712
Publix on the street

2004
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:41,248
Where everyone is chanting

2005
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,040
For Trump cool

2006
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:55,584
Cancel flight for Trump and ring out surrounding Alex Jones and Owen Shroyer the rest of the Infowars

2007
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,608
Cruise they move towards

2008
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:59,424
The capital here we see the view from inside the capitol

2009
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:04,032
Of staffers they're moving it down the stairs following that evacuation order

2010
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,056
You can't knock

2011
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,336
See this as like

2012
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,616
Two things that are

2013
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,640
About the intersect

2014
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,664
You are

2015
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,528
Like people who work for Trump

2016
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,064
Yeah

2017
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:17,344
Right

2018
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,368
Seems to be

2019
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,904
USA

2020
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:25,792
Yeah weird it's very weird

2021
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,840
Consistent I would want this

2022
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:32,704
I would like a mulligan on today

2023
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,752
I don't think they can get

2024
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,544
This show looks

2025
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:41,920
It's one part because Harrison Smith is hosting

2026
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,968
He's terrible because

2027
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,016
I mean

2028
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,064
You can draw your own

2029
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,112
Conclusions I don't I don't think that

2030
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,136
Like it would be

2031
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,184
Wise or even

2032
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,208
Sensible

2033
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:55,232
To save her like Alex

2034
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,768
It's inspired a lot of these actions

2035
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:02,400
Do you like we already said a lot of the people who are the first photographed folks who were there

2036
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,448
Food Network you folks and they hate

2037
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:10,336
It's easy to if you don't have an awareness of those world right thing back out all the same

2038
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,384
Do not listen to Alex

2039
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:14,176
They're similar information

2040
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:15,968
Speakers in terms a lot of the themes

2041
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,248
And the narratives

2042
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,528
In the stories that they tell

2043
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,576
And the reality that they believe in

2044
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,368
But they are not the same

2045
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,208
At the same time Pastor in Fort Worth gas

2046
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:28,000
That's like Nick Fuentes and

2047
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,536
Baked Alaska we're both

2048
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,328
In the offices

2049
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,120
Streaming

2050
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,912
And that's a little bit

2051
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,680
It's f***** up

2052
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,216
They're antifa did you know that

2053
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:40,544
They were deep state secret antifa agent

2054
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:45,152
Have been inspired not just see the problem

2055
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,176
They wanted

2056
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,456
Deep state antifa

2057
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:54,880
But there wasn't any right-wing violence they would never existed so they had to

2058
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:57,184
Created from the ground up

2059
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,208
Conspiracy

2060
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:58,976
Where do you live

2061
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,256
I live down the way

2062
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:02,048
Play what city

2063
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:05,376
What city is Nick Montez live in

2064
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:08,704
No way

2065
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,472
Suck you

2066
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,032
That deserved

2067
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,568
So

2068
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,592
Bissell just looks

2069
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,616
Adultlook

2070
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,896
Really really bad

2071
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:21,504
Especially thinking about the people

2072
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,784
Who are you know

2073
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,576
It's sometimes tough

2074
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,624
For people to get over there

2075
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,904
Frustration with Alexa

2076
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:32,000
Officials and she'll go too much empathy for them

2077
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:32,768
Staffers

2078
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,304
The people who are just on the job

2079
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,328
And the terror

2080
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,376
A lot of them probably fell

2081
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,912
Being whisked away to

2082
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,192
Secure locations

2083
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,776
I can't even imagine what that would be like

2084
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,568
And

2085
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,592
It's really f***** up

2086
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:49,408
To know that that is what a lot of people are experiencing

2087
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
And for this

2088
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:52,224
Just to be like they're kind of relishing

2089
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:55,296
Harrison is as well on air

2090
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,600
Now in the

2091
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
List

2092
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,440
Expected thing ever

2093
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,976
Trump is not

2094
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:07,584
Going to the capital after he said we're all going to the capital capital

2095
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,608
Huge

2096
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,888
Unprecedented

2097
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,656
Krowd

2098
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,936
Is moving towards

2099
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,984
The capital

2100
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,288
As we speak as the debate rages inside

2101
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,408
President Trump has apparently returned it to the White House that's the word that we are receiving

2102
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,200
From Washington he said he

2103
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:23,968
Was going to go to

2104
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:24,736
The Capitol building

2105
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,760
He's gone to the White House

2106
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:28,576
Instead many people on Twitter encouraging him

2107
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,624
Do storm the Senate along with

2108
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,696
Supporters and what we're seeing here are the

2109
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,488
Independent journalist videos

2110
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:37,792
As Trump supporters move

2111
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,400
Once again inexorably towards the Capitol Building yeah I wonder why

2112
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:48,800
He would send everybody towards the capital and then not go there himself almost crazy

2113
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,408
Now they're willing to Die For This

2114
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,200
Because he's willing to

2115
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:55,968
To die for that

2116
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:56,736
Yeah

2117
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,504
This dude

2118
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,040
F****** potster

2119
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:06,464
So you remember that Ragtime music was playing earlier

2120
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,792
Joyous

2121
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,584
Abdul

2122
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,352
Describe

2123
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,240
The joyous

2124
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,824
Beat

2125
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,872
Atmosphere of

2126
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,432
The event earlier today has

2127
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:29,504
Showered and turned to rage as the fury of

2128
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,064
Trump supporters and Patriot's Crossing United States

2129
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,344
Overflows

2130
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,880
And expresses itself

2131
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:36,928
On the outside of the capitol

2132
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:41,024
So beat the editorial tone it appears to me to be

2133
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,304
Pretty consistently

2134
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,072
Righteous and

2135
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:45,888
That is what is motivating

2136
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,912
Said they are right

2137
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:51,264
Hate to do this they are right to storm the capital information be right there with them

2138
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,824
Are you saying that the founding fathers were wrong Mike

2139
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,616
Would stop this

2140
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,920
Someone's got to or Elsa Khan

2141
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,944
Restitution has been

2142
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,736
Episcopal Mike Pence

2143
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:01,504
King George

2144
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,040
We got to take him out

2145
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:05,600
Excitement

2146
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,392
Kind of about this because there's nothing

2147
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:10,464
Harrison can really do other than be the guy who's calling

2148
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,744
I'm the guy with the

2149
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,048
It's beyond are well this is going to

2150
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,352
And getting this was as a

2151
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,400
24 minutes ago and since then we've seen

2152
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,936
24 minutes of

2153
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
Rising

2154
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:24,288
Aggression Rising crowds more police

2155
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,568
Building evacuation

2156
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,920
And reaction from across the nation is

2157
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:34,528
Largely excitement as far as I'm concerned

2158
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,880
This is again truly incredible and will continue to update and bring you

2159
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,160
More videos

2160
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,976
Yeah it was

2161
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:44,000
But I was getting

2162
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:48,096
I took a took a slightly different temperature from the country based on

2163
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,144
Since I was getting

2164
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:52,192
Yeah

2165
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:55,520
It seems like everybody soured real quick

2166
01:39:55,776 --> 01:40:01,920
Everybody was like oh no I didn't want

2167
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:06,272
I saw a lot of people responding in ways that

2168
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,600
We're kind of like

2169
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:10,624
Oh

2170
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:11,904
Oh my

2171
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,720
Like I I can't believe I didn't see

2172
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:15,488
This

2173
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:16,256
Possibility

2174
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:19,072
I think it's very funny

2175
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,352
From from

2176
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,120
Where I

2177
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:22,656
Sure

2178
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,192
At the same time

2179
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:26,496
I think that had this not have happened

2180
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:27,776
This week

2181
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:33,664
You and I would have had a show where we would have said another dumb rally what do you what do you expect is going to happen

2182
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:35,456
S'more just edging

2183
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:38,528
Towards the hope that something like this would happen

2184
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,552
I'm not

2185
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:41,088
Surprised that it did but I'm shocked

2186
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:44,160
You know that but yeah I think there's a lot of people who are

2187
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,976
And I see a lot of like

2188
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:51,584
Scales falling through people's eyes with some kind of

2189
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:52,608
Flippant

2190
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:54,144
Like I told you so

2191
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,936
You know like I get on Arlo

2192
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,984
I'm glad that I haven't

2193
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:58,752
Casino Lotto

2194
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:01,056
Yeah because I think that's really

2195
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:03,104
Yeah and I hope

2196
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,896
The people who

2197
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:08,736
You want engagement at your business

2198
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:10,784
I know I know

2199
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:14,880
I think that if people see right-wing extremist

2200
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,416
Storm Inga lighthouse

2201
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:22,048
And I call this is what people have been talking about for a while that is fun

2202
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,680
No need to shame anybody as long as they remember

2203
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:29,984
That this is a problem

2204
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:33,568
Tomorrow to it didn't stop yesterday

2205
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:36,384
Today I mean spoiler alert

2206
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,712
We don't know what Alex's responses to it but Trump is basically

2207
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,992
Been like an hour I would

2208
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,808
Never it's over a reminder that doesn't

2209
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,368
Yeah that's the problem

2210
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,928
The reaction to it reminded me so much

2211
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:52,000
My partner was watching a documentary the other day

2212
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,792
And they some

2213
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:55,328
One of those bad guys it was like a

2214
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,632
Documentary about a small town that it gone

2215
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:58,656
Rogue with a

2216
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,424
Police Department

2217
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,448
Man in the Sheriff's Department

2218
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,472
And she's like

2219
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,752
Can you believe this

2220
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,800
This guy thinks that the sheriff

2221
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:08,128
Is the highest constitutional power in the land and I was like

2222
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:11,968
Well let me tell you about

2223
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,992
I-16

2224
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:17,600
That's what I'm saying like all these people watch this and

2225
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:19,648
It's the same reaction of of life

2226
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,720
I know you thought that that

2227
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,256
Couldn't be real

2228
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,536
Oh but it is

2229
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,560
16 of the country

2230
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:28,864
I was

2231
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:33,216
Desperately graph

2232
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,240
Any more child

2233
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,288
So

2234
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,104
24 Harrison do again is just

2235
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:39,872
Righteous and

2236
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,408
That is the name of the

2237
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,712
We do know is that the

2238
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:45,504
Washington establishment is

2239
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,552
Grambling any and all officers

2240
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,576
They have

2241
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:51,648
At their command in order to deal with this

2242
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:55,488
Massive outpouring of anger Fury and righteous in

2243
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,024
Indignation

2244
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,048
Coming from

2245
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,840
The Trump supporter you can there see

2246
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,120
We have the

2247
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:03,424
Fox News Feed up and even they are

2248
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,752
I having trouble maintaining the Integrity of their signal

2249
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:10,592
I meant just righteous indignation these people have been pushing

2250
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,384
Just to the point where this disc

2251
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,176
Responses that the only

2252
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,456
Only thing that can

2253
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,480
Mdwfp

2254
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:19,296
Created an imaginary reality where and I have

2255
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,064
Pushpay

2256
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,344
Push too far

2257
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,672
Going on in other states

2258
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:28,768
As well there's some f*****-up stuff happening at elsewhere

2259
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,560
Harrison covers this

2260
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:32,864
Scary

2261
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,680
Los Angeles as well as stop

2262
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,472
Bastille rally lining the streets

2263
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,496
Hundreds of

2264
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,520
Trump supporters

2265
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:41,568
People

2266
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:45,920
Cheering it on on Twitter saying insane drag him out saying go into the Capitol building

2267
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:47,968
And drag the traitors out

2268
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:48,992
That does not

2269
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:52,832
Seem like something that could have been impossible

2270
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,904
Things gone slightly differently

2271
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,184
I could

2272
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:59,744
Some harm coming

2273
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,048
Into representatives in Congress members

2274
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,584
Now there are people walking around with

2275
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,656
Zip ties I saw those pictures I didn't have a chance to look into

2276
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:09,216
Into them enough to feel really confident

2277
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,008
Yeah that was

2278
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:14,080
Really scary

2279
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,360
Sky trust enough to

2280
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,920
Definitely. Me like I have to go

2281
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:23,040
Search doubt ever you cannot just remind

2282
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:26,112
I did I did

2283
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,160
I kept back that

2284
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:28,928
2%

2285
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,952
Of my own

2286
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:34,816
Looking into it but I don't think it's I just don't know what.

2287
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,608
But that's scary as hell

2288
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,912
The even the possibility

2289
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,448
That is what

2290
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,472
Someone was up to

2291
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,032
Take hostages or something

2292
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:47,360
I put a citizen's arrest

2293
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,128
Humor

2294
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,664
Like it's horrifying

2295
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:52,992
Wow absolutely different

2296
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,528
Dinner takes

2297
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:58,112
Terrifying but it is also deeply funny

2298
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:58,880
That's the problem

2299
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:01,184
That's where I'm I'm struggling

2300
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:02,720
Because

2301
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:04,000
We are looking at

2302
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,536
A group of people

2303
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,072
Who stormed the f******

2304
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:07,840
Capital bill

2305
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:11,424
But we are also looking at a series of

2306
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,520
People smoking weed and Nancy Pelosi's office

2307
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:16,800
So

2308
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,080
That deeply funny

2309
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,360
Sorry

2310
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,664
Harrison is going on

2311
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,248
Here this is anything other than just like this is really positive coverage

2312
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:28,320
Are people such as at Dana Lash

2313
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,856
Saying stop this

2314
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:32,160
Do Trump supporters who are moving towards

2315
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:34,464
The castle other people saying get in there and

2316
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,000
Tear them out of here we see

2317
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,024
My God

2318
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,328
Images are just incredible massive

2319
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,352
Numbers of Patriots

2320
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:41,888
Storming the Capitol building

2321
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,704
Texas Flags waving American flags waving

2322
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,008
And masses of humanity have

2323
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,288
Apparently broken past

2324
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,312
The police barricades

2325
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,080
Good for keeping them

2326
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:52,896
Off the steps and away from the Capitol Building day have been

2327
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:55,200
Torn down and

2328
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:57,248
The people have moved on to

2329
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,272
That raised

2330
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:00,064
Platform and are scaling

2331
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,368
Scaffolding that was set up

2332
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:06,464
So at this point you know that we don't have people inside

2333
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,768
Yeah but you do have

2334
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,096
An awareness that there are people who are

2335
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,632
A large Mastiff Oak

2336
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:16,448
Who are not seeming to have all that much resistance

2337
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,728
Authority

2338
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:21,568
Who are making their way towards the Capitol building

2339
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,592
You have

2340
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:26,432
People online who are expressing a desire for people to be dragged out

2341
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,968
Give people who want Trump

2342
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,736
Coming

2343
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:30,528
Lead a charge on the Senate

2344
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:32,320
Do you have that awareness

2345
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,648
When you have that

2346
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:39,488
In the in the sort of context of what's going on

2347
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,024
You hear clip like this

2348
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:43,840
And you're like you just want somebody to kill

2349
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:46,656
You just want you want somebody to kill someone you don't like

2350
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:49,728
Incredible this crowd continues to swell

2351
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:52,800
What was it I mean

2352
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,896
I've lost track of time that he was less than an hour ago

2353
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,944
An hour ago

2354
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:05,600
That President Trump finished his speech and that massive crowd of hundreds of thousands probably upwards of a million people

2355
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,392
Surrounding the Washington Monument

2356
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:09,440
And all the way to the White House

2357
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:14,304
Finished watching that speech by President Trump and moved towards the US Capitol

2358
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,840
And by the time that

2359
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:22,752
Everything update from ilhan Omar current to Capitol Buildings are lockdown and everyone is Sheltering in place

2360
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:25,056
Case look that's where I'll know more is everyone

2361
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,128
A what

2362
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:29,664
Just kidding

2363
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:34,272
The joke is a from this vantage point you can tell where she is

2364
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:37,600
You know there are tons of people who are who are storming

2365
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:39,136
The Capitol building

2366
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,464
Hey wouldn't be fun if I wasn't

2367
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:43,488
Wannabe

2368
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,256
It's just joking

2369
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:45,536
That's where she is

2370
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:46,304
Yeah that's

2371
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,840
That is person who weave

2372
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:48,608
Expressed

2373
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,656
Extensive hatred for

2374
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,424
Yeah

2375
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:52,960
Yeah

2376
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,008
Even if I believe

2377
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,288
Somebody was joke

2378
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,312
When they said that

2379
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:58,336
Aportes

2380
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:00,640
Oh yeah and it is not joke

2381
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,176
So don't

2382
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:02,944
Don't give me this

2383
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:04,480
Jake Abel

2384
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,296
I would say that Harrison

2385
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,832
Pragmatic to a fault

2386
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:12,160
It does not care

2387
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,184
At all about

2388
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,464
The people in the

2389
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:15,744
In the Congress building

2390
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,768
Sure

2391
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:17,536
2

2392
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,608
Get where he's coming from

2393
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:22,912
In terms of like there are safety precautions

2394
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,680
Then place

2395
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:25,728
Tiger our evacuation routes

2396
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:27,776
So I guess

2397
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:28,544
I get weird

2398
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,824
He's coming from

2399
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,104
Seem super cala

2400
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:31,872
I guess

2401
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,176
Just like

2402
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,712
Who cares

2403
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,504
The people inside are did any

2404
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,272
Danger

2405
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:44,160
Congressmen and women and Senators I don't think are at much of a threat we know

2406
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:49,024
There's one thing they take very very seriously it is their own personal well-being and their own

2407
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,816
Security there are tunnels

2408
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,584
Of course

2409
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,120
Criss-crossing like

2410
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:55,680
Spiderwebs throughout all of DC

2411
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:58,240
And there's almost no risk

2412
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:01,056
Of them having to try to escape through a crowd or

2413
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:04,640
Having a bunker down in the Capitol building if they have Escape Routes

2414
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:11,808
More than they need so again I do not think there's actually a bodily threat to anybody in the chambers at this moment

2415
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:14,368
Anything to concern their continuing to

2416
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:16,160
Are you continuing to debate

2417
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,440
Without so much

2418
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:19,744
As a look over their shoulder asked you

2419
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,816
The doors being broke down or anything like that disassembly

2420
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:23,584
A

2421
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,888
Massive protests that is

2422
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:30,240
Refusing to stay quiet any longer that is making themselves known that is

2423
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:33,056
Not stopping at the barricades not

2424
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:35,360
Kowtowing and adhering to the

2425
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:36,128
Police report

2426
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:38,176
Betrayed us time and time again but instead

2427
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:40,736
Are pushing forward to take over what is

2428
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,016
At the heart of it

2429
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:42,784
AR

2430
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,552
Building

2431
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:45,600
I find it hard to believe

2432
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,624
They would be

2433
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,392
Recovering

2434
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,416
Let's say

2435
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:51,744
Black lives matter protest at the White House

2436
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:53,536
I seem to work

2437
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,816
Call

2438
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:55,584
When

2439
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,608
How old is summer

2440
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:57,632
Whenever those

2441
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:58,656
Large fences

2442
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,448
Yeah that people were up again

2443
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:01,216
Standley Lake

2444
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,240
Do you know yelling at

2445
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,128
Then

2446
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,664
It wasn't

2447
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:10,688
You know

2448
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:14,272
A situation where everyone safe inside they've got a situation roommate

2449
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,040
Right

2450
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:18,112
I don't know it just seems a little bit

2451
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:18,880
Selective

2452
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:20,416
I-290 like the

2453
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:22,720
They have more Escape tunnels than they need

2454
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:27,584
That's such a funny way of putting it

2455
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,912
They got more than they even need this is the type of

2456
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:33,472
What thing we're wasting taxpayers money on

2457
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,496
Too many Escape

2458
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:37,056
Don't go anywhere

2459
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:41,664
It's like the future of a joke where they're carrying the tanker full of oil and he's like

2460
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,968
This has 5,000

2461
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:48,064
I would ever break something is 1001

2462
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:52,672
It'll be great if there is like there's so many Escape tunnels down here there's like

2463
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:56,768
Tooth out of control

2464
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:59,584
But now

2465
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,864
That's where all that

2466
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:07,264
If if the Capitol Building turned into the Scooby-Doo B where they're all going up through the tunnel and exiting 12 are they closed

2467
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:10,080
The great so good

2468
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:12,640
So at this point people have breached the bill

2469
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:15,456
This is where I think a lot of people

2470
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,736
Around the

2471
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:18,784
Country in the world were like

2472
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:19,808
OSHA

2473
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:20,832
Senators

2474
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:21,856
The vice president

2475
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:23,136
The congressman

2476
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:25,184
Now no doubt making their way towards

2477
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,256
The security of the underground tunnels to ask Court them away

2478
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,280
From the threat

2479
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:31,328
They're supposed constituents

2480
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:34,144
Angry Furious and now venting that frustration

2481
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:34,912
On

2482
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:39,264
The system that has betrayed them time and time again this is just incredible

2483
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,800
Woolfolk you're watching Infowars

2484
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:45,920
So you got people coming in in the

2485
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:46,688
Constituents

2486
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:51,040
There's a certain part of me that almost

2487
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:51,808
Is like

2488
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,368
Good on you for sticking with

2489
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,392
Longer than most

2490
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,672
To the right-wing media did

2491
01:51:56,928 --> 01:52:01,280
Well I don't know like they were already at the point where they're like this is wrong

2492
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:03,072
Suspenders like this is what we got

2493
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,608
This is what we wanted

2494
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:07,680
I wanted I want to disagree with the phrasing

2495
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:10,752
Good on you.

2496
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:12,544
That's remarkable.

2497
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:18,944
That you are still you're still just working everybody at this point everyone was cutting

2498
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:25,344
Realizes that you thought

2499
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:29,440
Oh no there's nobody behind me

2500
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:30,464
Privilege

2501
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:34,048
Course at least I would say my estimation a million

2502
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,072
Trump supporters

2503
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:41,472
Having moved from throughout DC internal converging on the capital this is revolution in progress

2504
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:44,032
This is a major historic moment

2505
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,568
In history of the United States

2506
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:48,896
Does a privilege and an honor to be here sharing it with you

2507
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:50,432
And bringing you updates just

2508
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:51,712
As soon as possible

2509
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,016
I suspect that he may be more of a

2510
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:57,856
A True Believer then a lot of people at Infowars

2511
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,904
And I also think he's a dork

2512
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,488
Anyway

2513
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,280
I'm just saying

2514
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:07,584
Yes it is a historic moment

2515
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:10,912
But it will probably be remembered more for

2516
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:12,448
An idiot and a headdress

2517
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,728
Smiling carrying a podium

2518
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:14,496
Then

2519
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:17,056
I will be a resident

2520
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,616
In order to just

2521
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:20,896
Defile out of this

2522
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:23,712
I think Harrison probably has a good scent that like

2523
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,992
Like this

2524
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:27,552
Going to have to make this palatable

2525
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:29,344
To somebody more Normie

2526
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,880
Parts of the audience

2527
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:33,952
As if in Fort Worth has a lot of that

2528
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:36,256
The only way that they can do this

2529
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:41,632
Is by being like the left protest Alive stuff

2530
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:43,424
We've seen six months

2531
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,192
Or more

2532
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:45,984
Violent protests

2533
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,776
Burning down entire cities

2534
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,544
Aimless

2535
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,312
Pointless

2536
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:52,640
Destruction being right across the United States by

2537
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:54,688
Liberal and communist agitators

2538
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,224
All to the point of

2539
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,528
Trying to tear down our system now we see

2540
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:00,064
Not the system fight back

2541
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,344
But those who love

2542
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:03,136
America fight back

2543
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,160
Patriots now

2544
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:06,464
Taking over the entire Capitol steps

2545
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:09,792
Continuing to wave the American flag the Gadsden flag

2546
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:12,096
The tree of Liberty flag

2547
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,376
Trump flag

2548
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:14,912
He's taking it over

2549
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:19,264
It is done this is what happens when Americans rise up is what happened

2550
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,288
When Patriots

2551
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,568
Do what

2552
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:23,616
The Communists have been trying to do

2553
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:24,640
Uber so long

2554
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,920
This doesn't look great

2555
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:28,736
I want to eat those words I would like to

2556
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,272
To print those words out now would like to hear

2557
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,808
If you didn't eat those

2558
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:37,440
I don't think this is going to age great

2559
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:44,864
Think Alex might be needing to fire Harrison soon it's not because you didn't take calls on the American Journal

2560
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:48,192
This is something else

2561
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:50,752
From the authority

2562
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:52,288
Might have to pretend a lot of

2563
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:58,688
This stuff didn't this wasn't what we did Infowars employee

2564
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:01,760
The views expressed by Harrison Smith do not represent

2565
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:03,808
I never met that guy

2566
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:09,952
He's an independent contractors you know that you found those Soros contracted a left report on Alex

2567
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:10,976
Anyway

2568
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:12,512
This is all just a global

2569
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,792
West Mandy pushed

2570
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:14,816
Patriots

2571
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,888
I have in my notes Here

2572
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:20,448
This is dramatically Pro storming

2573
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,216
Coverage

2574
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:25,568
Time and time again that the American people have shrug and taking the blows

2575
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:26,592
On the back

2576
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:29,152
Without so much as a whimper in protest

2577
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,432
Finally

2578
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,456
They have pushed

2579
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,224
Too far

2580
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:37,088
After stealing our last resort we always knew in the back of our minds and back our heads we had the numbers

2581
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,880
We had the will we could

2582
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:42,976
Through the electoral process maintain some semblance of control over

2583
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:46,304
What is supposed to be our representative democracy

2584
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:47,584
Our Republic

2585
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:49,632
Well they stole that

2586
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:50,912
From us they took away the

2587
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:52,192
The final lifeline

2588
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:52,960
They destroyed

2589
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:54,240
The final pressure valve

2590
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,288
And now the Rage of the American people

2591
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:58,080
Overflows as Patriots

2592
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,872
Storm into the United States

2593
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:02,688

Can get that sense

2616
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:42,624
Once he shows up

2617
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,160
Harrison isn't

2618
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:47,488
Experience to know if he doesn't really know how to play the game

2619
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:48,768
That Alex needs

01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:51,072
To play in order to be profitable

2621
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:52,096

But this is going to lead to a real Revolution or Trump is going to stay in office

2627
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:03,872

This deal has been stopped

2675
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,208

I don't know if

2693
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:32,864
We can print up a better Dewey defeats Truman

2694
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,632
We stopped

2695
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:38,496

2696
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:39,520

And Harris

2705
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:50,784
Pretty excited about that

2706
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:58,976
My God now the protesters have gotten their hands on fire extinguishers and are spraying them at the people

2707
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:01,536
The Congressional staffers and media

2708
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,816
Members of the media

2709
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:05,632
We're attempting to film them they're getting a face full of

2710
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:07,424
Fire extinguisher gas

2711
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:09,984
As police continue to radio and we heard

2712
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,008
Over the radio

2713
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,800
From the US Capitol Police

2714
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:13,568

2715
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:15,616

02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:18,944
Control now seated to

2718
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,224
The patriots who have breached

2719
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:20,992
The capital

2720
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:25,600
Alex did like days worth of coverage about people yelling at Sarah Huckabee Sanders

2721
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,208
8 bike

2722
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:31,232
Every private

2723
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:33,024
Citizen is entitled to the right

2724
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,304
To go eat at arrest

2725
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:37,376
What is they had sprayed her with a fire

2726
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,656
Wow that's

2727
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:41,984
Harbor Freight

2728
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,544
Did you instead strictly speaking that is assault

2729
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,872
And we've already heard him talking about punching and Mason

2730
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:49,408
Towards

2731
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,688
The the officers

2732
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:52,992
Three instances that

2733
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:55,040
Harrison is very keenly aware of

2734
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,320
Violence

2735
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,856
It's being done by

2736
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:59,392
These people again

2737
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:00,416
The cops

2738
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,440
No I mean

2739
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:03,232
Like obviously

2740
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,768
No situation is perfect

2741
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:06,048
Any protest

2742
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,840
And I don't think that you can

2743
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:08,864
Dyke

2744
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:09,632
Respond

2745
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:11,424
To the entirety of

2746
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,960
The group just based on the actor

2747
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:13,728
Tenth of an inch

2748
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:15,776
Individual but those people

2749
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,568
Should definitely have been treated if

2750
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:19,104
What they're doing

2751
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,384
Thing is not appropriate

2752
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:21,920
Property Dam

2753
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:23,200
That is directed

2754
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:23,968
Towards

2755
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:26,784
Movie harm and hurting hurting another person but

2756
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:28,320
No salt

2757
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:29,856
Anyway I just want to make

2758
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:31,392
Clearline there because

2759
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:36,256
Harrison later we'll pretend that he's not aware of any violence no nothing no violent actions

2760
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:38,816
Also

2761
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:40,096
Interesting Lee

2762
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:43,168
Harrison thrilled that they've stolen police equip

2763
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:46,240
Control now seated to the

2764
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:47,520
The patriots who have breached

2765
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:48,288
Capital

2766
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:50,848
And are moving ever more

2767
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,944
Farther into this Capitol Building people dress

2768
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:57,760
Pioneers people carrying riot shields

2769
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:59,552
I've been stripped from the Capo

2770
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:00,576

02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:09,024
I can't I just can't imagine

2775
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:11,328
And of the picture

2776
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:19,008
Left-wing protesters have stolen riot shields were police and they've entered the Stout

2777
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,544
They can't imagine you being like

2778
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,568
This is

2779
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:24,128
Protest

2780
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:28,736
America's Fallen

2781
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:34,624
I guess there isn't that much different

2782
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,392
Honestly

2783
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:36,416
Yeah man

2784
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:37,440
Weird

2785
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:39,232
Weird to think of the number of dead

2786
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,024
That there would have been its

2787
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,304
This was a left-wing crowd

2788
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:44,096
Do the people who are

2789
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,632
So many people would have been killed

2790
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,680
I think you're right

2791
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:51,008
Add stop to litigate that kind of what if

2792
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:54,848
You know that you know that whole like

2793
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,920
I was how is it that so many people could do the

2794
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:58,944
I thought if you went for

2795
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,224
For the Capitol Building you would just

2796
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:00,992
Get mowed down

2797
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:02,016
Yeah you know

2798
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:03,808
If this was a left-wing protest

2799
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,088
Oh believe me you were

2800
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:08,416
It seems like

2801
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:09,184
Seems that way

2802
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:09,952
Yeah

2803
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:13,024
Harrison still giving positive coverage

2804
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,048
Of this

2805
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:14,816
Event

2806
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:16,608
Point

2807
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,400
He does know that they shot

2808
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:20,192
Tear gas in the chamber

2809
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:21,472
Yeah and

2810
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,776
He's kind of aware that someone got shot

2811
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:28,128
Right doesn't know any of the details about it but he's aware that someone has reports

2812
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:29,664
Took someone's been shot

2813
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,688
Guitar

2814
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:37,088
Disclose TV protesters are smashing the doors to the US House chamber that seems that we saw just a second ago of the

2815
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:39,904
Furniture being piled up in a attempt to

2816
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,184
Prevent or at least

2817
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:45,024
Waylay or delay the breaking into the house chamber there

2818
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:51,424
US Senate chamber has been evacuated and senators are being taken to a secure location house members are being instructed to

2819
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,192
Put on mask

2820
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:54,240
As tear gas is now inside

2821
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:56,288
The US Capitol Dome folks this is

2822
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,336
Again unprecedented this

2823
02:03:58,592 --> 02:03:59,872
Is history being made

2824
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:00,896
As we speak

2825
02:04:01,152 --> 02:04:01,664
Slowly

2826
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,688
This is like

2827
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:03,456
Would severe

2828
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:06,016
Like the situation has deteriorated too

2829
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:10,624
And Harrison still definitely cool with it

2830
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,184
You saying

2831
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,464
Yeah they're rioting

2832
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:17,536
Great we took back the capitol

2833
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:22,144
The security of the Capitol building has been utterly devastated

2834
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,168
And decimated

2835
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:27,264
And the rider or Riders why the hell not right

2836
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:31,360
The Riders the protesters the Patriots the Americans the Trump supporters

2837
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:32,896
The revolutionaries

2838
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:37,248
Have taken the capital the US capital has fallen to the American people

2839
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:42,624
This day will go down in history ladies and gentlemen in you're getting it all live here and infowars.com

2840
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:45,184
Make no mistake about this would still be the

2841
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,208
The tone if it had been

2842
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:46,976
Successful

2843
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:48,256
Totally

2844
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:49,024
It like

2845
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,560
This is it would've been more

2846
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:51,840
Yes yeah

2847
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:53,120
Continued

2848
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:54,400
Fall Apart

2849
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,448
Just leave

2850
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:57,216
Bottle the

2851
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:58,240
The feeling of

2852
02:04:58,496 --> 02:04:59,520
Joy that he felt

2853
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:01,056
For almost a short.

2854
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:03,360
Cuz that must have been really nice

2855
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:05,152
Yeah but it also becomes

2856
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:08,480
Embarrassment that he's got to feel now

2857
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,760
Cuz this was recorded

2858
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:14,880
That's why I would only borrow the joy and I would enjoy that like a cold glass of water

2859
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:18,464
That Joe is delicious. Joey causes the hair.

2860
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:24,864
You can keep the embarrassment inside made out of BU it unfortunately

2861
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,400
The Hangover effect

2862
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:29,216
Realizing you were so naive so f***

2863
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:30,240
Being stupid

2864
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:31,264
Anyway

2865
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:33,568
At this point Harrison is heard

2866
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:37,920
Midnight last night but he is aware at that point that someone hit the

2867
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:38,688
Benshot

2868
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:40,224
And so now he's reporting

2869
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,760
He's heard that someone got shot in

2870
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:42,528
The arm

2871
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:48,672
Just got this information not confirmed but we have reports of a woman shot in the arm

2872
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,696
Attempting to breach

2873
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:53,024
The chamber so we have guns drawn inside the chamber

2874
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,072
Furniture piled against the door

2875
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:55,840
The

2876
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,632
Security is firing out

2877
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:59,424
Through the door and is apparently

2878
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,216
Shot woman in the arm

2879
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:03,520
So this is the reporting that he's giving

2880
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:05,056
Based on preliminary

2881
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:08,128
Stop which is incorrect but you know sometimes

2882
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:08,896
As a

2883
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:10,176
Informations coming and you can make

2884
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:11,456
Mistakes here and there

2885
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,480
I'm not going to hold it against

2886
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:13,504
Them too harshly

2887
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:17,344
Blame him for being so goddamn boring

2888
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:21,952
I've got to assure you all Alex will be coming back eventually we will get

2889
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:22,976
Alex

2890
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:25,536
How can you

2891
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:27,584
Think that you are living through a c

2892
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,608
Successful over

2893
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:31,168
Overthrow the United States government by your side

2894
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:33,216
Still be this boring

2895
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:35,008
Yeah

2896
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:36,544
Well I mean

2897
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:39,872
I mean on some level he knows he took over for David Knight

2898
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:40,640
Pizza Hut

2899
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:42,688
Who knows where the bread cutter liver

2900
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,992
Yeah you got a big shoes to fill

2901
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:53,440
I need a boring guy another boring guy boring guy and taste my boring understood

2902
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:54,720
Relief

2903
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:59,072
So at this point there's a video going around of some

2904
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:03,424
People commandeering a window washing sure rig

2905
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:04,448
Humped

2906
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:05,472
Oh my God

2907
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:07,520
This is amazing person video

2908
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:10,592
Of the protesters they seem to have commandeered

2909
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:12,128
A window washing

2910
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:13,152
Platform

2911
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:14,688
In a raising themselves up to

2912
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:16,480
To the second floor to perhaps

2913
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:18,272
Reach the windows there

2914
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:21,344
Trump Flags waving American flags waving

2915
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:24,160
Shots have been fired me reports of one woman shot

2916
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:28,000
From a protester a female protester has been shot

2917
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:31,584
By the Capital Security presumably who is inside

2918
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,144
The house chamber there

2919
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,424
Furniture piled up against

2920
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:38,496
The door refrigerator trying to get through that door shots were fired

2921
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,264
Through the window

2922
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:41,568
Dorin seemingly struck

2923
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:44,128
A protestor these Leon confirmed

2924
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:44,896
Reports

2925
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:45,920
That we're receiving

2926
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:47,456
From less than a minute

2927
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:49,760
Ago and will continue to bring you updates

2928
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:51,552
As we get them folks this is

2929
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:52,832
The revolution

2930
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:56,416
And it's only going to be televised on Infowars

2931
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:58,208
Dot-com Amarillo

2932
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:00,000
Stork

2933
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:02,048
Loser loser

2934
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:05,632
You really think it's this is only going to be covered by

2935
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:07,936
What a Virgo

2936
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:09,984
We are getting reports

2937
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:12,288
The Death Star is going to oh no I can

2938
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,056
I can see it

2939
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:14,592
Luke Skywalker has

2940
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:16,896
Commandeered a window washing

2941
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:17,664
Vehicle

2942
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,736
And he's slowly making his way towards the exhaust for its

2943
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:25,856
We are going to be televising that I loved the entire way I love this

2944
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:28,160
Dumb dumb ass kind of thing where it is

2945
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:29,696
Is it would be like going to be like

2946
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,256
Richard Nixon is resign

2947
02:08:32,512 --> 02:08:35,328
That's only going to hear

2948
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:37,120
My channel

2949
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:40,960
Everyone's going to cover that

2950
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:43,264
I am sad to report that JFK

2951
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:44,032
Has been

2952
02:08:44,288 --> 02:08:48,384
Assassinated

2953
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:52,992
No one else is saying s*** about it by pretending this isn't like a gigantic

2954
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:54,272
Take news story

2955
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:57,856
Going to dominate 3 new cycle for a while

2956
02:08:58,112 --> 02:08:58,880
Ridiculous

2957
02:08:59,136 --> 02:08:59,648
So

2958
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:00,416
At this point

2959
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:01,440
Harrison

2960
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:03,488
Do I don't know exactly how it happened

2961
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:06,816
Maybe by way of images or video

2962
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:08,096
Harrison come

2963
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:09,632
It's the realization

2964
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:10,656
The shooting is worse

2965
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:12,704
Then he had realized

2966
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,472
And this is.

2967
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:14,240
Someone's arm

2968
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,008
Now we're not have

2969
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:16,800
Did it tounsia

2970
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:19,360
Dramatically

2971
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:20,640
Very notice

2972
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:23,968
And here we see the bloody stretcher and a woman

2973
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,016
Oh my gosh being

2974
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:28,576
We got that putting pressure on a wound it look like

2975
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:32,160
We heard before she was shot in the arm that look like he was shot in the chest

2976
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:33,696
Perhaps the collarbone

2977
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:34,976
But absolutely

2978
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:37,536
Covered in blood as she's rushed away

2979
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:39,072
From the capital

2980
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:40,352
This may be the

2981
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:43,680
First casualty of the second American Revolution

2982
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:44,704
This woman who is

2983
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,752
Presumably oh my God they're pumping her

2984
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:49,568
Not if they're pumping her chest

2985
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,104
That means she was most likely

2986
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,152
Unresponsive that woman

2987
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:55,968
May have died or lie sustained

2988
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:56,736
Ace

2989
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:57,760
Critical energy

2990
02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:01,856
So I don't know if he knows how to handle a lot of this stuff

2991
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:03,136
This is pretty

2992
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:05,440
This is tough because you've been

2993
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:06,976
Spending your entire day

2994
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:11,328
Sort of teasing people towards doing something like that

2995
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,632
Celebrating as it happened

2996
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:16,448
And now the reality that someone has been

2997
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:18,240
Been shot and is probably dead

2998
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:19,264
Yeah

2999
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:20,288
It's tough

3000
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,592
It's tough to cover all of that

3001
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:28,224
Especially when you're someone like you don't have the skill it is it is in

3002
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:29,504
The real world

3003
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:31,552
In his world

3004
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:33,344
In the world that they all believe in

3005
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:35,648
That should be

3006
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:43,584
Well that should be an expected casualty of your f****** Revolution are you telling me are you telling me that you

3007
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,120
You think you're going to overthrow a f***

3008
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:50,496
Country and then you're going to get all windy and sad when someone gets shot and I think guys

3009
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:52,800
F*** off and I think there's some decent

3010
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:53,568
Instincts

3011
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:54,848
On Harrison's part with

3012
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,384
Saying like the first

3013
02:10:56,640 --> 02:11:02,272
First casualty of the American Revolution keeping it in the pocket

3014
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:04,064
How's the Patriot lure

3015
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:07,648
Exactly but he needs to build in real-time in order

3016
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:08,416
At the same time

3017
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:10,208
I don't like

3018
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:11,232
Emotional

3019
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,512
Standpoint and from a

3020
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:14,304
Performance standpoint I don't

3021
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,072
2 cm

3022
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:16,096
Being able

3023
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:17,376
Keep up his

3024
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,912
Who's Karen

3025
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:20,704
No I doubt cuz of the character

3026
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,520
And because this as much as he's about

3027
02:11:23,776 --> 02:11:26,592
I understand that somebody's dead in the real world that's a

3028
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:27,616
The f****** tragedy

3029
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:28,640
What I'm saying

3030
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:31,712
Is that these people are imagining themselves

3031
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:34,016
As f****** revolutionary

3032
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:36,320
And then they all quit and cried

3033
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:37,856
Because somebody died

3034
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:42,720
You cannot scream 1776 at me and then be like

3035
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:44,000
Wow somebody got

3036
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:48,352
Oh my God explained Alex's angle on it

3037
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:53,472
Much better as soon as of a mystery to me

3038
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:55,264
I am not entirely sure

3039
02:11:55,776 --> 02:11:56,544
I just don't think

3040
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:57,312
He's very good

3041
02:11:58,592 --> 02:11:59,360
You supposed to be doing

3042
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:01,152
But I just don't think it does very well

3043
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:02,432
That's why you got to get

3044
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:07,040
Alex and Owen on the phone getting real

3045
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:09,600
Trying to talk

3046
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:10,880
Tijeras

3047
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:11,904
It's Good Friday

3048
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,976
In Tucson in that video you know that everybody's

3049
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:17,024
Alex just keeps yelling in the background

3050
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:20,352
Contradicting the entire day's cover a love it

3051
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:21,888
Daytime on here right now

3052
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:25,728
Understory

3053
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:30,592
When was Atlanta founded the first started

3054
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,432
Joe

3055
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:37,248
Breaking that down momentarily

3056
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:43,136
Metallica going to be explained that auntie

3057
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:44,160
Have

3058
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:45,696
You turned of involvement

3059
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:47,744
I was going to look bad

3060
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:48,768
Now we got it

3061
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:50,304
If read this needle baby

3062
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,584
The man

3063
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,144
These white people are so f****** entitled

3064
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,960
They think they're entitled to a revolution without getting

3065
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,520
Or looking bad yeah exactly

3066
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:05,664
So Alex is decreeing in the background yelling while I was on the phone that their commercial free

3067
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:09,760
Commercial Freon all shows commercial free

3068
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:13,088
Martial law

3069
02:13:13,344 --> 02:13:16,416
National Guard it's absolutely insane

3070
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:17,696
Albany

3071
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:19,744
Minute Trump announce he was going to come speak

3072
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:20,768
Antifa

3073
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:24,864
I need pads and arm pads

3074
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:27,424
Track a place to Stage the trigger of that

3075
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:30,752
Stampy

3076
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:32,544
I guess at this point he had taken the phone

3077
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:36,384
I'm from Bart from Wichita

3078
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:37,152
Have the lines yet

3079
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:40,480
No No Nanette and Alex can just rattle off these

3080
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:42,272
Steve's business narrative

3081
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:44,320
With without any

3082
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:50,464
Nonno and there and it could be a switch Eclipse instantly and just below are we doing antifa now okay I'll switch to my auntie

3083
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:53,280
Depot rambling nonsense

3084
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:56,096
If I if I have my timeline right now

3085
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:59,424
National Guard definitely had not been but no they are not point

3086
02:13:59,936 --> 02:14:00,704
But

3087
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:02,752
This is business.

3088
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:04,800
Because this is a direct contradiction

3089
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:05,568
Of

3090
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:08,896
Harrison's narrative that he's been building for hours at this point

3091
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:10,944
Watching this event happen lol

3092
02:14:11,712 --> 02:14:14,272
This is Patriots who have righteous indignation

3093
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:16,064
Would push too far right now

3094
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:16,832
Snot

3095
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:19,136
Antifa provocateur

3096
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:21,952
And they're the ones who storm things

3097
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:23,488
Patriots were trying to keep

3098
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:24,256
Peaceful

3099
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:27,328
Course they could put up with much more

3100
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:28,864
God dammit

3101
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:31,168
Completely contradictory narrative riding solo

3102
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,192
Now

3103
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:33,984
Owen is on the same phone call

3104
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:34,752
With Alex

3105
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:36,032
And he is there

3106
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:43,200
Keep contradicting out he's got number 326 Sodexo tough to really put this in his right because here's the deal were not violent

3107
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:43,968
Lucien Ares

3108
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:44,736
But

3109
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:46,272
They've been taking our country

3110
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:51,392
All countries occupied and you can debate all day long what the appropriate response is

3111
02:14:51,904 --> 02:14:53,696
The point is we finally have a response

3112
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:58,048
And we haven't any fight in our Congressman that any fight in our legislators

3113
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:01,120
And so this is what can happen if we the people going to fight again

3114
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:03,168
We did not come here as violent revolutionaries

3115
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:04,448
But

3116
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:07,520
The history is definitely being made right now I don't know what today is

3117
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:08,544
Turning points

3118
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,080
It will change

3119
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:13,920
The course of American History or this is just the Nexus

3120
02:15:14,176 --> 02:15:15,200
Of the beginning

3121
02:15:15,456 --> 02:15:17,248
This is a direct contradiction of

3122
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:19,808
Alex he's closer to the narrative

3123
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:24,160
Harrison has been selling 303

3124
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:24,928
No

3125
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:25,696
The thing that

3126
02:15:25,952 --> 02:15:30,048
Difficult time with his like we can have different opinions about like

3127
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:31,072
I don't know

3128
02:15:31,584 --> 02:15:33,376
Weather weather pastas good

3129
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:35,424
Like maybe you don't like it

3130
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:37,216
We have different

3131
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:39,776
Agree the pasta exist

3132
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:41,824
I

3133
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:43,360
Begrudgingly admit

3134
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:44,896
They have

3135
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:47,712
Fundamental contradiction

3136
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:50,016
About the reality of what has happened

3137
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:51,552
And what it means

3138
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:52,320
And everything

3139
02:15:52,576 --> 02:15:54,368
These two things cannot coexist together

3140
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,160
And they're asking Their audience

3141
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:57,440
To believe

3142
02:15:57,952 --> 02:15:58,464
That it's

3143
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:00,256
Just sort of a little

3144
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:01,280
Do we have

3145
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:02,560
Interpretation

3146
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:05,120
Something no it's not it's very important

3147
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:08,448
I think that's something that's under appreciate

3148
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:09,728
About

3149
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:11,520
I think the difference

3150
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:13,056
Prince that we're seeing between

3151
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:15,104
These in the black lives matter protest

3152
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:16,384
Is

3153
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:17,408
Kind of

3154
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:18,944
Built around

3155
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:19,712
FL

3156
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:22,016
The fact that all of these right-wing ding dongs

3157
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:23,552
Are fighting a different anime

3158
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:30,464
Like they all have their own conception of the evil government whether it's lizards or anything

3159
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:33,536
It's all completely different from the person standing next

3160
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:38,656
Things they scream but

3161
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:40,448
Deep down they're all fighting a

3162
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,752
Fight yeah ended Horton

3163
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:44,544
Everybody was fighting the

3164
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:46,592
The same singular

3165
02:16:46,848 --> 02:16:50,176
One of the things that I actually think is at the

3166
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:52,736
The core of why I disagree with you

3167
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:55,296
About the the nature of what happened on what

3168
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,064
Wednesday at work

3169
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:59,392
You're saying they all look stupid and is going to have a deflationary effect

3170
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:01,440
I look at this

3171
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:02,976
And I worry

3172
02:17:03,488 --> 02:17:04,000
That

3173
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:06,560
The way that it will be used

3174
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:07,584
This event

3175
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:08,352
Will be used

3176
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,376
Used in the same way.

3177
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:10,912
Things like Ruby Ridge

3178
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:13,472
Charlotte and Waco were used in the 90

3179
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:16,032
Right in the aftermath of those events

3180
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:16,800
You had

3181
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:19,360
The the Rocky Mountain rendezvous

3182
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:25,760
Where you had a bunch of different right-wing extremist groups who also didn't see eye-to-eye about what their enemy was

3183
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:27,808
Some people thought it was

3184
02:17:28,064 --> 02:17:28,576
Just

3185
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:31,904
Big-government something thought it was the Jews

3186
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,976
Ain't they all got together and we're like well we got to work

3187
02:17:35,232 --> 02:17:36,000
Together

3188
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:37,792
That is what emboldened

3189
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:40,096
The militia right wing

3190
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:41,632
Community right in the 90

3191
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:43,424
I do worry that this will have

3192
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,704
Galvanizing a

3193
02:17:45,472 --> 02:17:47,008
Especially with you have a death

3194
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:48,800
Shorted

3195
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:50,080
Spoiler alert is

3196
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:51,616
Something that Alex is going to

3197
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:52,640
To try and use

3198
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:54,432
How to make a martyr out of

3199
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:56,736
That is going to game that Alex and Zach

3200
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:57,504
The plank right

3201
02:17:58,528 --> 02:18:00,320
You have a lot of the essential elements

3202
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:01,600
That you would need to

3203
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:02,624
To try and create

3204
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:03,392
This

3205
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:04,672
Focal point

3206
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:05,696
Where you could get

3207
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:06,976
People of different

3208
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:08,256
Like what

3209
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:12,864
How could you get qanon folks and Alex to work side-by-side

3210
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:14,400
Seems like

3211
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:16,192
This is this is something

3212
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:16,960
That we could

3213
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:17,728
Reach

3214
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:21,568
Toutant / I get that I think

3215
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:23,616
The difference

3216
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:26,176
For me between the Ruby Ridge and those are

3217
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:28,480
You've given our that

3218
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:30,016
They were

3219
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:32,320
In response to an aggressor

3220
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:35,136
There were people coming

3221
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:35,904
Them

3222
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:36,672
As well

3223
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,952
It was not a

3224
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:39,488
It was not a bunch of

3225
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:40,256
Moron

3226
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:41,536
And the cup

3227
02:18:41,792 --> 02:18:42,304
Cops let them go

3228
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:43,840
There was a conflict

3229
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:45,888
We don't have to do this I know we're not

3230
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:49,472
To all of that

3231
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:52,032
I will say that perception

3232
02:18:52,288 --> 02:18:53,312
Is what's more important

3233
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:54,080
Then reality

3234
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:55,616
Midterms of patriot lower

3235
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:57,152
The story

3236
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:58,432
It can be told

3237
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:01,248
People in the rolls

3238
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:02,528
But they need to be in

3239
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:03,296
In order to make

3240
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:04,064
The story

3241
02:19:04,576 --> 02:19:07,136
You would see as a bunch of riders going home right

3242
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:09,696
Stupid as being exactly what's needed

3243
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:11,232
I will be interested

3244
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:12,000
To see how they do it

3245
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:14,048
I'm not saying that is what's going to happen

3246
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:16,352
As I was seeing all this happen

3247
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:18,144
That was the fear that I feel

3248
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,192
Is the worry that I have

3249
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:21,216
About the

3250
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:22,496
Pieces of this

3251
02:19:23,008 --> 02:19:24,288
And the way that I see Alex

3252
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:25,056
Responding

3253
02:19:25,312 --> 02:19:25,824
To understand

3254
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:28,128
Is kind of

3255
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:32,480
Anyway everybody's contradict

3256
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:34,272
Other in a way that is

3257
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:42,464
It's just it it's incomprehensible if you're a listener I guess you just got to be on team Owen and Harrison or team Alex

3258
02:19:43,232 --> 02:19:44,256
Whatever or whomever

3259
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:46,560
Now Harrison is realize that

3260
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:49,376
Someone got shot probably dead

3261
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:56,544
You know what these protestors they were completely non-violent the f*** out of the only violence I have seen perpetrated

3262
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:57,568
It's so far beyond

3263
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:58,848
You know one or two

3264
02:19:59,104 --> 02:20:01,152
You punches in in return for

3265
02:20:01,408 --> 02:20:02,688
A punch thrown by a police officer

3266
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:07,552
The only violence I have seen has been to be cold-blooded Point Blank Shooting of a woman in the chest

3267
02:20:08,064 --> 02:20:08,832
By the

3268
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:11,648
Capital cold-blooded Apple police rather

3269
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:18,304
That's the only violence the memories of people shooting fire extinguishers a cops

3270
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:24,960
That's more like

3271
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:25,728
You know

3272
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:27,520
Tough guys here

3273
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:30,080
So now the entire town is kind of train

3274
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:32,128
For Harrison and he's been

3275
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:33,152
Application mode

3276
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:34,176
And it's almost

3277
02:20:34,688 --> 02:20:35,456
Entirely for her

3278
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:36,736
Play long stretch of time

3279
02:20:36,992 --> 02:20:38,528
I'm talking about how the last

3280
02:20:39,296 --> 02:20:42,368
Protest shooting

3281
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:46,208
Blessed sister saying just shoot them all you know if you dare protest against us

3282
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:50,304
We we can protest when you burn your city down for a year-and-a-half we can just do you know for a year

3283
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:52,608
For four years we can just

3284
02:20:52,864 --> 02:20:57,216
Obstruct everything we can destroy everything we can murder people in Cold Blood Vice magazine will

3285
02:20:57,472 --> 02:20:58,752
Give us a

3286
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:01,312
A good 30 minute documentary Norte

3287
02:21:01,824 --> 02:21:07,968
The Bagel Man

3288
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:11,296
By his death that's reaction you get if you are a protester

3289
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:12,064
On the left

3290
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:17,696
This is really Halo for me but it seems to be like their mic drop moment

3291
02:21:17,952 --> 02:21:18,976
Just keeps coming back to that are

3292
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:19,744
It's just

3293
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,768
I don't care

3294
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:22,048
Iris

3295
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:24,608
Hehehehe

3296
02:21:24,864 --> 02:21:25,632
Ted Cruz

3297
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:26,400
Responses

3298
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:28,448
I think Harrison two little bit surprised

3299
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:29,472
To learn

3300
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:31,008
The Ted Cruz is not on board

3301
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:33,568
Ted Cruz he says quote

3302
02:21:33,824 --> 02:21:36,128
Those storms in the capital need to stop now

3303
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:37,408
The Constitution protects Beast

3304
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:40,992
Protest violence from left or right is always wrong I've not seen any vinyl

3305
02:21:41,248 --> 02:21:43,296
I've not seen any violence from the protesters yet

3306
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:44,576
Am I wrong

3307
02:21:45,088 --> 02:21:48,416
Tell me if I seen forever I seen violence with a protester that you have

3308
02:21:49,952 --> 02:21:53,024
Earlier sir

3309
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:53,792
Impact

3310
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:55,840
Exchange

3311
02:21:59,936 --> 02:22:00,704
Harrison better

3312
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:01,472
F****** hope

3313
02:22:01,728 --> 02:22:04,032
That some of the people that he's talking about in the

3314
02:22:05,568 --> 02:22:07,616
What you saying they did cuz if so they're going to

3315
02:22:07,872 --> 02:22:08,384
No no

3316
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:11,456
The people who have been able to successfully break into

3317
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:12,992
I sent it offices

3318
02:22:13,504 --> 02:22:14,784
And Congressional offices

3319
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:16,064
I did so with such

3320
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:17,088
Witness that the

3321
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:18,880
Protesters there

3322
02:22:19,136 --> 02:22:20,416
Where are the

3323
02:22:20,672 --> 02:22:21,952
That staffers and

3324
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:24,256
Congressman and Senators there were

3325
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:27,584
Unable to even grab their information grab their papers

3326
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:30,656
Or even shut down their computer so now unlocked

3327
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:35,008
And open to anybody those computers are being accessed by the protesters

3328
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:36,544
Who themselves are

3329
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:37,824
Gathering information

3330
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:41,408
Downloading hard drives are stealing at the hard drives out right

3331
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:42,688
We can expect

3332
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:44,736
To see The Fallout from this continue on

3333
02:22:44,992 --> 02:22:48,576
For a very long time but I remind you again after a year

3334
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:52,672
Complete chaos a year of protest a year of

3335
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:54,208
Literally tens of

3336
02:22:54,464 --> 02:22:54,976
Thousands

3337
02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:56,256
Violent riot

3338
02:22:56,768 --> 02:22:58,304
I'm not saying I'm not saying that it's

3339
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,840
It's impossible that some people

3340
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:02,656
Some stuff for my tab access some stuff but like

3341
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:03,424
That way

3342
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:07,264
Is that a very serious like national security problem

3343
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:09,312
Simplot that's something I don't

3344
02:23:09,568 --> 02:23:11,616
People will take lightly

3345
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:15,712
What did Chandler bring home from the White House

3346
02:23:16,992 --> 02:23:19,552
Governor's f****** hard drive

3347
02:23:20,064 --> 02:23:22,624
It's a tumor is a motherboard

3348
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:26,208
What are we going to do we got to get rid of it

3349
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:28,512
Airbnb good to like

3350
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:31,328
Like if these f****** ding-dongs didn't

3351
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:37,216
Livestream themselves without masks on AR stealing

3352
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:39,520
May be privileged

3353
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:40,544
Classified information

3354
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:41,312
It's a good

3355
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,336
Sing the

3356
02:23:42,592 --> 02:23:46,944
They decided to storm one of the least heavily surveilled building

3357
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:48,480
Without masks

3358
02:23:48,992 --> 02:23:51,296
You know that relief that Capitol building

3359
02:23:51,552 --> 02:23:56,928
I'm glad they just don't have many cameras there or recording equipment of any kind 22 like

3360
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:08,448
Were they filming was George

3361
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:13,056
Jimmy Fallon in that Boston

3362
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:14,592
Sup pawns 11

3363
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:16,384
So

3364
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,408
This point

3365
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:18,176
Alex's

3366
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:20,224
Suggested that it's antifa that is ARCA

3367
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:21,760
Restraining order show

3368
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:22,784
Hearing all this

3369
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:25,600
Is this is still real to him man

3370
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:28,416
We've heard time and time again how valuable

3371
02:24:28,928 --> 02:24:30,976
Protests are how good protests are

3372
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:34,048
Antifa is only an idea how black lives matter is

3373
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:36,352
Simply a set of beliefs

3374
02:24:36,608 --> 02:24:37,888
But if you don't believe you're racist

3375
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:40,448
And we watched silently

3376
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:44,288
Because we always knew that the end of the day we had our vote we always knew

3377
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:47,104
That when it came right down to it the American system

3378
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:48,128
Powerful enough

3379
02:24:48,384 --> 02:24:48,896
Flexible enough

3380
02:24:50,944 --> 02:24:53,760
Is that enough to vote

3381
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:55,040
Maintain

3382
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:56,320
We knew that if we just

3383
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,088
Trusted

3384
02:24:57,344 --> 02:24:57,856
And

3385
02:24:58,112 --> 02:24:58,624
Exerted are

3386
02:24:59,136 --> 02:24:59,648
Rights

3387
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:01,952
As members of a republican citizen

3388
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:03,744
Of this democracy

3389
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:04,768
That we

3390
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:05,536
Good

3391
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:08,096
Regain our footing and get back on track well

3392
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:09,888
That boat has been stolen from us

3393
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:12,192
If you're wondering what is inspiring the

3394
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:13,984
Overwhelming

3395
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:18,336
Activity that we're seeing here in Tagalog

3396
02:25:18,592 --> 02:25:20,640
Supporters move into the Capitol building

3397
02:25:21,408 --> 02:25:22,688
And starts to destroy things

3398
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:25,760
It's that that last release valve has been

3399
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:27,040
Taken destroyed

3400
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:30,368
Perverted and prevented from being accessed in use

3401
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:31,392
Bye

3402
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:32,672
The people who

3403
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:37,024
For so long have patiently stood by and watched their country

3404
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:38,560
Literally burned around them

3405
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:40,608
So I guess it wasn't antifa provocateur

3406
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:42,656
I guess it was that people

3407
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:44,192
Had the right to vote stolen

3408
02:25:44,448 --> 02:25:44,960
Enough

3409
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:45,728
Time is the only thing

3410
02:25:45,984 --> 02:25:46,752
Remedy that

3411
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:50,336
Yeah but it was antifa who exploited that to make them

3412
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:52,384
Do things that they didn't want to do

3413
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:54,176
Even though the things that they did

3414
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:55,200
They did wanted

3415
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:57,248
I bet I bet is like

3416
02:25:58,016 --> 02:25:58,528
If push

3417
02:25:58,784 --> 02:26:01,088
Alex might be able to come up with that but that's not

3418
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:03,648
Cancel that one

3419
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:06,976
This next clip is really where I found myself

3420
02:26:07,232 --> 02:26:08,512
Saying oh Alex

3421
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:10,304
Oh no

3422
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:12,096
This is sad

3423
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:15,936
This is really indicative of how Alex operates

3424
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:17,216
Mike down for this

3425
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:18,240
Because

3426
02:26:18,496 --> 02:26:19,520
I'm going to talk about this shoot

3427
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:22,336
He listened to Alex's respond

3428
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:28,224
Barely have been shot inside the Capitol and what that is

3429
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:34,624
We got a safe location because it was just too crazy out there on the streets but that was capital

3430
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:45,888
So I don't know

3431
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:52,288
Point is of the shooting having taken place

3432
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:53,824
So Alex

3433
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:54,848
Based on

3434
02:26:55,104 --> 02:26:55,616
Nothing

3435
02:26:56,384 --> 02:26:57,920
His responses that's probably

3436
02:26:58,944 --> 02:26:59,456
The shooting

3437
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:00,736
Probably fake

3438
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:06,112
Alex I saw somebody going out there were to go out there in case you want to use that little smiley face

3439
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:08,416
Andromache

3440
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:12,512
Video you can't you can't tonight

3441
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:13,792
That's just

3442
02:27:14,048 --> 02:27:14,816
Random

3443
02:27:16,352 --> 02:27:17,888
Just anything he's just

3444
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:21,728
Make us look bad let's say it's fake first and let's just see if we can get away with

3445
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,336
What states did in her mouth

3446
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:29,664
He has been Now refuted by both of his employees

3447
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:30,944
Alex

3448
02:27:31,456 --> 02:27:33,760
Know who are not getting the line cannot

3449
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:36,832
Do that are not getting a lot of theirs video

3450
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:40,160
So Alex makes up another

3451
02:27:41,696 --> 02:27:46,304
So now Pence has also betrayed President Donald Trump so

3452
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:49,120
A man on a on a mountain

3453
02:27:49,888 --> 02:27:56,032
By himself and he has we the people fighting for him the police confirm

3454
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:02,176
Making up that confirmation confirmation

3455
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:05,504
That he's just making that up because he has to

3456
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:08,576
He has to admit that someone got shot

3457
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:09,344
Because of

3458
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:13,952
The pushback that he got from his employees yet but he can't let it be as serious

3459
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:18,560
As it looks like it might be more shot in the leg

3460
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:20,864
He has to say I got word that it was

3461
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:21,632
Confirm

3462
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:23,168
Call May.

3463
02:28:23,936 --> 02:28:25,728
So Alex has decided

3464
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:27,520
Antifa

3465
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:29,824
Explains his evidence

3466
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,360
It's for this

3467
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:32,128
Sabeing

3468
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,408
Incredibly generous

3469
02:28:34,176 --> 02:28:37,248
I would describe this as he imagined

3470
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,296
But it was

3471
02:28:40,064 --> 02:28:43,648
Bookstore militarily come in

3472
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:46,976
Once again

3473
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:53,632
Pull up real quick

3474
02:28:53,888 --> 02:28:57,728
Experts

3475
02:28:57,984 --> 02:29:03,360
Driving 40 minutes over there from a big rally for a peaceful protest at the Capitol

3476
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:07,712
People are attacking the police

3477
02:29:08,224 --> 02:29:10,784
All this crazy stuff happening all this crazy stuff going down

3478
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:12,576
All the crazy stuff and folding

3479
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:25,632
We have to wait until we have the witnesses

3480
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:27,168
We have to win this week

3481
02:29:27,424 --> 02:29:28,448
We got it all

3482
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:30,496
We got all three kinds of headed

3483
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:34,848
Alex's basically just saying hey I thought they might do

3484
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:39,200
We thought there's this guy

3485
02:29:39,456 --> 02:29:42,528
He was dressed at amazing how good inteva is he was

3486
02:29:42,784 --> 02:29:48,160
That's exactly like you would expect somebody at this rally to be dressed he was screaming things that like

3487
02:29:48,416 --> 02:29:54,560
I scream so you know that he was antifa cuz they wouldn't say the thing but I ain't we all know that

3488
02:29:54,816 --> 02:29:55,328
Mostly out of work

3489
02:29:55,584 --> 02:30:00,704
Even on his neck

3490
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:07,104
How good is antifa a provocateur

3491
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:11,456
To one of them do drawing about this is the kind of go back

3492
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:13,248
Can Ford from Harrison during summer

3493
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:14,016
Reporting

3494
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:16,832
And Alex doing

3495
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:18,368
I am so Harrison

3496
02:30:19,648 --> 02:30:20,928
You know I would say

3497
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:22,976
One of the most important things in a

3498
02:30:23,232 --> 02:30:24,000
Situation like this

3499
02:30:24,256 --> 02:30:25,280
Is not

3500
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:26,560
To just say anything

3501
02:30:27,584 --> 02:30:28,096
What do you have it

3502
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:29,120
10 situation

3503
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:30,656
You have

3504
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:32,960
A lot of information coming in

3505
02:30:33,216 --> 02:30:34,752
Yeah some of it might be wrong

3506
02:30:35,008 --> 02:30:35,520
You might want to

3507
02:30:35,776 --> 02:30:36,544
Some things right

3508
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,336
I understand that there is an impulse

3509
02:30:38,592 --> 02:30:40,640
To report everything as quickly as you can

3510
02:30:41,152 --> 02:30:41,664
Sometimes

3511
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:42,944
It's best to take a breath

3512
02:30:43,456 --> 02:30:44,480
And wait a little while

3513
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:46,528
Harrison is from a different

3514
02:30:48,064 --> 02:30:48,576
This is a ton

3515
02:30:48,832 --> 02:30:52,160
Confirm but it does say that protesters are engaging u.s. Secret Service

3516
02:30:52,672 --> 02:30:54,208
Hand-to-hand combat

3517
02:30:57,024 --> 02:30:58,048
Confirm but not sure if that's it

3518
02:30:58,304 --> 02:30:58,816
Troll post

3519
02:30:59,584 --> 02:31:00,096
Or not

3520
02:31:00,352 --> 02:31:04,960
Usually not good on your news Outlet to read something and then afterwards when

3521
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:07,008
Sounds stupid coming out of your mouth

3522
02:31:07,264 --> 02:31:08,288
I got it might be trolling

3523
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:14,432
Ladies and gentlemen I am just getting worried that Olympus Has Fallen out right now that my

3524
02:31:14,944 --> 02:31:15,712
Patrol

3525
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:17,504
Hawaii earlier I

3526
02:31:18,784 --> 02:31:19,296
That d

3527
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:21,856
Capitalize fall

3528
02:31:23,136 --> 02:31:24,160
Controlling

3529
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:30,048
Has Chinese takeover with a new world order the country

3530
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:32,608
How to steal the election

3531
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:45,664
No you're the one starting all this

3532
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:47,712
You're the one they're going to pay just like Hitler

3533
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:55,904
And then you know this is this is what happens this is the result this is like if you don't if you don't deal with a cancer

3534
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:59,744
Cancer and you don't deal with it until it's too late they basically only have one shot

3535
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:06,144
Directions to chemotherapy radiate the hell out of you and hope you can survive that's what we're going through

3536
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:12,544
Cancer in this country for decades of communist Chinese takeover for decade we've been

3537
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:16,128
Occupied by tyrants for decades and ignoring it

3538
02:32:16,384 --> 02:32:16,896
Whoa

3539
02:32:17,408 --> 02:32:18,944
That's pretty severe yeah

3540
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:22,528
I mean we're at a point now where they have no reason to be like

3541
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:24,576
Gung ho

3542
02:32:29,952 --> 02:32:30,720
It's trouble

3543
02:32:31,232 --> 02:32:32,000
Bunch of idiots

3544
02:32:32,768 --> 02:32:33,280
This is

3545
02:32:35,328 --> 02:32:36,608
This is how it was going

3546
02:32:36,864 --> 02:32:37,632
To go

3547
02:32:38,912 --> 02:32:40,448
How is this taking them by

3548
02:32:40,704 --> 02:32:41,216
Soles

3549
02:32:41,472 --> 02:32:41,984
So much

3550
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:45,056
Well I think that they're used to

3551
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:47,104
Acting in ways that would

3552
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:48,640
Conceivably lead to something

3553
02:32:48,896 --> 02:32:49,664
Sing like this

3554
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:50,944
Admit it never happened

3555
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:54,784
And so I think that used to that outcome

3556
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,064
It's kind of surprising

3557
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:56,832
Tubi

3558
02:32:57,088 --> 02:33:00,672
The stars have aligned in such a way.

3559
02:33:01,184 --> 02:33:02,464
Other influences

3560
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:03,744
Are actually making the tap

3561
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:07,328
I don't know if they know how to react

3562
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:09,376
And that's why I think you see a little bit of flailing

3563
02:33:09,888 --> 02:33:10,400
You see

3564
02:33:10,656 --> 02:33:14,752
Contradictory narratives being thrown out you have

3565
02:33:15,008 --> 02:33:16,288
Alex trying to insist

3566
02:33:16,544 --> 02:33:20,640
It's antifa but then at the same time that last clip seemed to it sounds like he was saying it's great

3567
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:22,944
I don't know

3568
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:23,968
It's with weird

3569
02:33:24,224 --> 02:33:27,296
I think it's because the only thing they're not allowed to say

3570
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:31,136
Is the only thing that would make any sense for any of them to say which is just

3571
02:33:31,392 --> 02:33:33,696
You guys weren't supposed to actually do it

3572
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:36,512
This was about

3573
02:33:36,768 --> 02:33:37,536
Stealing your money

3574
02:33:37,792 --> 02:33:38,304
Yeah

3575
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:39,840
And now look at

3576
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:43,424
This is tough for business you

3577
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,448
Yeah yeah

3578
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:47,008
It's it's

3579
02:33:47,264 --> 02:33:49,056
So it in order to really threaten

3580
02:33:49,312 --> 02:33:50,592
The needle successfully one

3581
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:52,896
Everything we have to do is cast aspersions on the people who act

3582
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:54,432
Actually did follow through

3583
02:33:54,944 --> 02:33:55,712
With it so

3584
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:57,248
They're people who lives

3585
02:33:57,504 --> 02:33:59,296
Speculated that the queue shaman

3586
02:33:59,552 --> 02:34:02,368
Yeah weirdo guy and he was

3587
02:34:04,672 --> 02:34:07,232
Yeah come on buddy who else is antifa

3588
02:34:07,488 --> 02:34:09,024
Give me morning evening

3589
02:34:09,536 --> 02:34:12,096
People now in vet now looking into some of the

3590
02:34:12,864 --> 02:34:15,680
People that have broken in there seeing what you's a look

3591
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:17,472
Officiously like

3592
02:34:19,008 --> 02:34:19,520
Pianist

3593
02:34:21,312 --> 02:34:23,360
Funniest things are seeing incredible shots

3594
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:25,152
Inside the capitol Dome

3595
02:34:25,664 --> 02:34:27,712
Who's the guy with the tattoos that are 1000 hammer in

3596
02:34:27,968 --> 02:34:29,760
Collateral

3597
02:34:30,016 --> 02:34:31,296
Video game Dishonored

3598
02:34:33,856 --> 02:34:35,648
This isn't really

3599
02:34:36,672 --> 02:34:40,768
Oh so he had corvo's little tattoo

3600
02:34:41,024 --> 02:34:43,328
Darkseid so funny

3601
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:44,864
Nick Fuentes

3602
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:46,400
Baked Alaska

3603
02:34:49,216 --> 02:34:50,752
They were all your show

3604
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:58,432
He was with you

3605
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:02,784
Conveniently ignore that

3606
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:03,552
What a bunch

3607
02:35:03,808 --> 02:35:05,344
Is he he's going to be back on in

3608
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:07,136
Horsewright probably

3609
02:35:07,392 --> 02:35:10,208
Hassan soon I don't know what happened

3610
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:16,864
On Thursday keeping this as a bottle episode of when I got a Monday will cover

3611
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:18,400
Just because of the

3612
02:35:19,424 --> 02:35:20,960
Through stupidity of all this

3613
02:35:21,984 --> 02:35:23,520
But yeah I would assume

3614
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:25,568
At least by the time the weekends over 20

3615
02:35:25,824 --> 02:35:26,336
Text Willis made

3616
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:27,360
Some sort of virus

3617
02:35:28,128 --> 02:35:28,896
Play for real

3618
02:35:29,152 --> 02:35:29,920
Harrison's job

3619
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:34,016
Betty White

3620
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:35,552
The Alex Jones

3621
02:35:35,808 --> 02:35:38,880
And we end up going into the War Room

3622
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:39,904
Smooth

3623
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:40,672
Of course

3624
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:42,464
Are all hosted by Harrison

3625
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:44,256
He has to believe he's done

3626
02:35:44,512 --> 02:35:45,024
Okay

3627
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:46,304
He's tapped out he's out of

3628
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:48,352
I mean

3629
02:35:48,608 --> 02:35:49,376
To be fair

3630
02:35:50,144 --> 02:35:55,264
He was on there for a long time in straight hours holdup at least in terms of like

3631
02:35:55,776 --> 02:35:56,288
Wheatley fall in

3632
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:58,080
Which is

3633
02:35:58,336 --> 02:35:59,360
Phrase but I'll give it to him

3634
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:01,408
I don't know I don't think I could do 7 hours

3635
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:03,456
I don't think I absolutely

3636
02:36:03,968 --> 02:36:07,808
7 hours

3637
02:36:08,064 --> 02:36:10,368
Yeah, I would have been like guys we shouldn't

3638
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:11,648
Be doing this is not

3639
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:13,184
For us right now

3640
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:14,720
Stop that was really funny

3641
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:16,000
Is that Alex

3642
02:36:16,256 --> 02:36:18,304
Oh and also I mean not to

3643
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:20,352
Make a note to add more praise on Butler

3644
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:21,632
Like Alex it said we're cutting

3645
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:23,424
Commercials

3646
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:28,032
Basically the last hour that he's been on air

3647
02:36:28,288 --> 02:36:31,872
But like I keep saying

3648
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:33,152
The 4th hour

3649
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:35,456
Big wild

3650
02:36:37,248 --> 02:36:39,808
Is no idea again

3651
02:36:40,064 --> 02:36:40,832
Time zones

3652
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:43,904
It's there's a rebel

3653
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:46,720
Little bit funny

3654
02:36:46,976 --> 02:36:48,256
Because you can hear the producers voice

3655
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:55,168
I've not met you know I would make that mistake.

3656
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:57,216
Now with the mistake I would not make

3657
02:36:57,984 --> 02:37:02,592
Is Tom Palmer violent revolution is hosting the Wardrobe

3658
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:03,616
This guy sucks

3659
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:06,688
He's pretty

3660
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:07,712
Scary

3661
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:14,624
Local news has reported that protesters have moved inside the Kansas house Chambers

3662
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:21,024
Well I'm getting additional reports from Kentucky and Georgia the protesters are making their way inside the state

3663
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:21,792
Capital

3664
02:37:22,048 --> 02:37:22,560
Building

3665
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:23,840
What seems to have

3666
02:37:24,096 --> 02:37:25,120
Set this off of course

3667
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:29,728
Is all of this happened near seconds after Mike Pence

3668
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:32,544
Announce his ultimate betrayal of President Trump

3669
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:35,872
And said that he would not buy for him in the Electoral College

3670
02:37:36,128 --> 02:37:38,432
I would say that everybody has like

3671
02:37:38,688 --> 02:37:40,224
Real different vibe

3672
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:41,760
Episode that was

3673
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:43,808
Pentas

3674
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:46,880
He was the one who instigated this whole thing

3675
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:49,696
Well here's use the / would say

3676
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:51,488
Harrison

3677
02:37:51,744 --> 02:37:52,256
Is like

3678
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:57,376
Alright

3679
02:37:57,632 --> 02:38:02,240
Fitness go down and Revolution but he's also drastically

3680
02:38:02,496 --> 02:38:04,288
Affected in a kind of human way about

3681
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:05,312
The fact that someone died

3682
02:38:05,568 --> 02:38:06,080
That's true

3683
02:38:06,336 --> 02:38:08,640
And it it ruins a lot of the device

3684
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:12,992
Everything tuber

3685
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:14,528
He does not think

3686
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:15,296
He thinks it is

3687
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:16,832
Is great

3688
02:38:17,088 --> 02:38:19,648
We need to do way more okay

3689
02:38:21,696 --> 02:38:23,744
It's his he's much more acceleration

3690
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:24,512
Alright Tom

3691
02:38:24,768 --> 02:38:25,536
MN Alec

3692
02:38:25,792 --> 02:38:28,352
Can't quite figure out if it's antifa or if he's glad

3693
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:29,376
And

3694
02:38:29,632 --> 02:38:30,144
Owen

3695
02:38:31,424 --> 02:38:32,192
I don't even know what the

3696
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:33,984
The f*** he's on listen to this s***

3697
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:36,544
And like

3698
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:51,136
Churches burned

3699
02:39:00,608 --> 02:39:02,144
Great cuz that's the argument I would make

3700
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,032
People

3701
02:39:08,288 --> 02:39:09,312
Storming the f******

3702
02:39:09,824 --> 02:39:12,128
Capitol Building of Countryside

3703
02:39:12,384 --> 02:39:14,432
You can make the argument that this is a very

3704
02:39:14,688 --> 02:39:15,200
Serious

3705
02:39:15,456 --> 02:39:16,992
Real thing much more so than

3706
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:19,296
Someone stealing stuff from Target

3707
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:21,344
Yes and I would listen to that argument

3708
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:23,136
Convenient cuz that's the argument I would make

3709
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:26,208
Why would you tell me that you would listen

3710
02:39:26,464 --> 02:39:28,256
Into that

3711
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:33,120
But the really hurts your eyes

3712
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:35,680
Look if you were to make the argument that this was real

3713
02:39:35,936 --> 02:39:36,960
I would agree with you

3714
02:39:38,496 --> 02:39:40,288
Now even so I would say that some of the

3715
02:39:40,544 --> 02:39:41,056
The police response

3716
02:39:41,312 --> 02:39:41,824
Racine

3717
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:42,592
Over the course of the

3718
02:39:42,848 --> 02:39:43,360
Summer wear

3719
02:39:43,616 --> 02:39:44,384
Severe

3720
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:45,408
Call.

3721
02:39:46,176 --> 02:39:46,688
No

3722
02:39:46,944 --> 02:39:47,456
How so

3723
02:39:47,968 --> 02:39:50,528
I don't I don't want to get into a game with scale

3724
02:39:50,784 --> 02:39:54,112
Cuz I don't actually think that I would be the most credible Source on that

3725
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:55,392
But

3726
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:57,440
I would say that

3727
02:39:57,952 --> 02:39:59,488
There's a lot of police Act

3728
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:01,280
Turn against two people

3729
02:40:02,816 --> 02:40:03,328
Before

3730
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:04,864
Yeah and also

3731
02:40:05,632 --> 02:40:06,656
Whatever

3732
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:07,680
They did

3733
02:40:08,448 --> 02:40:09,216
In terms of Defending

3734
02:40:09,472 --> 02:40:10,240
The Capitol building

3735
02:40:10,752 --> 02:40:11,264
You kind of

3736
02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:13,568
Would see it be like Belle

3737
02:40:14,336 --> 02:40:16,384
It's a capital building hey we can talk about

3738
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:17,664
How many are how they were

3739
02:40:18,176 --> 02:40:21,504
Almost no arrests and all that stuff we can talk about that stuff

3740
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:23,552
But I think what's a more telling

3741
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:24,832
Statistic is

3742
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:27,136
How many f******

3743
02:40:27,648 --> 02:40:28,160
Casualties

3744
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:30,464
He's there were

3745
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:32,512
Fewer people with broken hands like that

3746
02:40:32,768 --> 02:40:33,280
That type of s***

3747
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:38,912
Oh I got shot in the face with a rubber bullet I got blood coming from my nose

3748
02:40:39,168 --> 02:40:39,680
Because I was hit by

3749
02:40:39,936 --> 02:40:40,704
Buy 3 f****** cops

3750
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:43,008
There is none of that s*** going around

3751
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:44,800
It seems like there's less

3752
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:47,360
That I've heard of

3753
02:40:47,616 --> 02:40:49,152
Yeah I mean

3754
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:50,432
It's it

3755
02:40:50,944 --> 02:40:53,504
It stopped because obviously I don't think that the police

3756
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:54,272
Should be

3757
02:40:54,528 --> 02:40:55,552
In our law enforcement

3758
02:40:56,576 --> 02:40:57,856
I'm not in the business of saying like

3759
02:40:58,112 --> 02:40:59,136
Yeah what'd you expect

3760
02:40:59,392 --> 02:41:00,160
I don't like that

3761
02:41:00,416 --> 02:41:01,952
Call Ono absolutely

3762
02:41:03,488 --> 02:41:04,000
Had

3763
02:41:04,512 --> 02:41:05,536
Things gone differently

3764
02:41:06,048 --> 02:41:06,560
Over the summer

3765
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:11,424
And people had made it over that barricade when they were around the White House

3766
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:13,728
I would not

3767
02:41:13,984 --> 02:41:14,496
Have been

3768
02:41:14,752 --> 02:41:15,520
Super surprised

3769
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:16,544
People got shot

3770
02:41:17,056 --> 02:41:18,592
For trying to rush the White House

3771
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:19,360
100%

3772
02:41:19,872 --> 02:41:21,920
I'm not saying the people should have been shot

3773
02:41:22,176 --> 02:41:22,944
For rushing

3774
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:24,224
Capitol building

3775
02:41:26,528 --> 02:41:28,576
I'm not surprised by any level

3776
02:41:28,832 --> 02:41:30,624
A law enforcement response

3777
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:33,440
Capital for the White House

3778
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:34,464
Or

3779
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:37,280
I just don't understand why they're playing games with

3780
02:41:37,536 --> 02:41:40,864
That I think I think that's one of the reasons that I'm just not as

3781
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:42,912
Okay

3782
02:41:43,424 --> 02:41:44,960
When you when Portland happen

3783
02:41:45,472 --> 02:41:47,264
You had f****** Stormtroopers

3784
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,032
Is against people

3785
02:41:48,544 --> 02:41:49,056
And the picture

3786
02:41:49,312 --> 02:41:49,824
Shoes that came out

3787
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:51,872
We're all in the middle of the night

3788
02:41:52,128 --> 02:41:53,152
And everybody looked

3789
02:41:54,944 --> 02:41:55,712
Hops looked cool

3790
02:41:55,968 --> 02:41:56,480
They looked like the

3791
02:41:56,736 --> 02:41:57,248
The f******

3792
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:58,784
Beast from movies

3793
02:41:59,040 --> 02:41:59,552
They look so

3794
02:41:59,808 --> 02:42:01,600
Strong and the protestors

3795
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:02,368
They were the pro

3796
02:42:02,624 --> 02:42:03,904
Protesters from movies they look

3797
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:05,952
So strong and in this one

3798
02:42:06,208 --> 02:42:06,720
We have

3799
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:12,096
Cops standing around going like hey what are you guys doing we just got to let you guys get this out of your system

3800
02:42:12,608 --> 02:42:14,144
And we have idiots storming

3801
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:15,680
We have people f******

3802
02:42:16,192 --> 02:42:18,240
Putting their feet up on Nancy Pelosi

3803
02:42:18,496 --> 02:42:20,800
F****** death some people might think that's pretty cool

3804
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:22,848
Is is cool but it's also pathetic

3805
02:42:24,128 --> 02:42:24,640
I think I think

3806
02:42:24,896 --> 02:42:25,920
You coming at this from

3807
02:42:26,176 --> 02:42:29,504
Objective standpoint understand

3808
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:32,576
Killer view of what's cool and what kind of movies you like

3809
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:34,624
What they do to

3810
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:36,416
These are people that are

3811
02:42:36,672 --> 02:42:38,976
That guy has a corvo tattoo

3812
02:42:39,232 --> 02:42:42,560
These are all people who live in one of them

3813
02:42:42,816 --> 02:42:46,144
Sky was hanging out with the shaman

3814
02:42:48,448 --> 02:42:50,240
These are all f****** scifinder

3815
02:42:50,496 --> 02:42:53,312
It says that is true it does seem like there's a lot of

3816
02:42:55,104 --> 02:42:55,616
But

3817
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:57,408
The bottom line is this

3818
02:42:59,712 --> 02:43:00,480
Pretty sure of that

3819
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:02,272
He's pretty much

3820
02:43:03,296 --> 02:43:05,344
Started

3821
02:43:26,592 --> 02:43:29,664
So Alex is really at like a point where he's like

3822
02:43:30,176 --> 02:43:31,968
Lights deescalate

3823
02:43:32,224 --> 02:43:33,248
Ionos

3824
02:43:33,504 --> 02:43:34,528
Kind of get it

3825
02:43:34,784 --> 02:43:36,832
I give I get his perspective

3826
02:43:37,088 --> 02:43:37,600
I mean

3827
02:43:38,112 --> 02:43:39,648
Not because I agree

3828
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:40,672
I do agree

3829
02:43:43,232 --> 02:43:43,744
I get where he is

3830
02:43:45,024 --> 02:43:46,560
It became very clear as I listened.

3831
02:44:09,088 --> 02:44:10,624
Alex's justifying

3832
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:14,208
Basically now a war

3833
02:44:14,464 --> 02:44:15,744
First Blood by accident

3834
02:44:16,256 --> 02:44:17,024
This

3835
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:18,304
This woman

3836
02:44:19,328 --> 02:44:19,840
Which I thought

3837
02:44:20,096 --> 02:44:21,120
The kids confirmed is just

3838
02:44:21,376 --> 02:44:22,144
Similac

3839
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:22,912
That's not

3840
02:44:23,424 --> 02:44:25,728
Case anymore argue that if

3841
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:28,032
Somebody who believes

3842
02:44:28,288 --> 02:44:28,800
In

3843
02:44:29,056 --> 02:44:29,568
Violent

3844
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:30,848
Conspiracy theories

3845
02:44:31,104 --> 02:44:31,616
Was

3846
02:44:31,872 --> 02:44:34,944
Encouraged to go to the mall and then

3847
02:44:35,456 --> 02:44:38,272
Stormed the Capitol building and was killed that's probably

3848
02:44:38,784 --> 02:44:40,064
Moron people like out

3849
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:45,440
I think it's it's tough to because people have such a similar information

3850
02:44:45,696 --> 02:44:46,976
10 streams that are very

3851
02:44:47,232 --> 02:44:50,304
Separate

3852
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:52,864
Sphere

3853
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:56,960
Sazon

3854
02:44:57,216 --> 02:44:59,008
The right-wing media ecosystem

3855
02:44:59,264 --> 02:45:02,080
System personalized responsibility or

3856
02:45:02,336 --> 02:45:02,848
To make it like

3857
02:45:03,104 --> 02:45:05,152
Alex you did this because

3858
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:06,432
That's kind of

3859
02:45:07,456 --> 02:45:09,760
Nebulous and impossible to nail down

3860
02:45:11,296 --> 02:45:12,832
It does feel to me

3861
02:45:14,112 --> 02:45:15,904
That you look at what is most

3862
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:16,928
Responsible

3863
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:17,952
4

3864
02:45:18,976 --> 02:45:20,512
Circumstances that lead to this it

3865
02:45:21,024 --> 02:45:22,048
People believing in a

3866
02:45:22,304 --> 02:45:23,072
Fictional reality

3867
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:25,888
And there's a lot of people who

3868
02:45:26,144 --> 02:45:26,656
I responded

3869
02:45:26,912 --> 02:45:27,424
Beaufort

3870
02:45:27,936 --> 02:45:29,472
Creating reinforcing

3871
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:32,032
Worsening

3872
02:45:32,288 --> 02:45:33,056
Pronounce ascertain

3873
02:45:33,312 --> 02:45:34,080
Everybody

3874
02:45:34,336 --> 02:45:35,872
Everybody on Fox News should be f******

3875
02:45:36,128 --> 02:45:36,640
Slapped

3876
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:38,688
If you if they say anything

3877
02:45:39,456 --> 02:45:39,968
About

3878
02:45:40,736 --> 02:45:43,552
You can hear them sing s*** that people on Fox news said

3879
02:45:43,808 --> 02:45:44,576
2 days before

3880
02:45:44,832 --> 02:45:45,856
So it's on you

3881
02:45:46,368 --> 02:45:49,440
Everybody there should have been slapped in the face while it was going on

3882
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:50,976
Do your f****** fault

3883
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:52,512
But now

3884
02:45:52,768 --> 02:45:53,792
Alex wants you to DS

3885
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:55,584
He wants everyone to go home

3886
02:45:56,096 --> 02:45:56,608
Such a

3887
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:57,376
Such a surprise

3888
02:45:58,144 --> 02:46:04,287
Time to go home

3889
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:32,703
Okay

3890
02:46:35,519 --> 02:46:37,567
So the reason that Alex is saying

3891
02:46:37,823 --> 02:46:39,103
Everyone go home.

3892
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:40,383
Belated

3893
02:46:40,895 --> 02:46:41,407
He needs

3894
02:46:41,919 --> 02:46:45,503
He thinks that everything he was hoping to accomplish

3895
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:48,063
11

3896
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:50,879
Lemonade out of lemons has given him

3897
02:46:51,391 --> 02:46:53,183
Obviously the most profitable route is

3898
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:53,951
Continuing

3899
02:46:54,207 --> 02:46:54,975
Just the terrorists Edge

3900
02:46:55,487 --> 02:46:55,999
Game

3901
02:46:57,279 --> 02:46:59,327
Bentley does that super manageable for him

3902
02:46:59,583 --> 02:47:00,863
But now that this has happened

3903
02:47:01,375 --> 02:47:01,887
It's tough

3904
02:47:02,143 --> 02:47:02,655
But

3905
02:47:03,423 --> 02:47:04,191
On the bright side

3906
02:47:04,703 --> 02:47:08,543
Alex doesn't realize that Congress will just reconvene in the evening

3907
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:10,335
And certify the election result

3908
02:47:11,103 --> 02:47:11,615
So he thinks

3909
02:47:12,127 --> 02:47:12,895
There's a state of x

3910
02:47:13,151 --> 02:47:13,663
Execution

3911
02:47:13,919 --> 02:47:14,431
That's going on

3912
02:47:15,455 --> 02:47:17,247
Simultaneously

3913
02:47:17,503 --> 02:47:18,015
He has

3914
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:19,039
This woman

3915
02:47:19,295 --> 02:47:20,063
Who has been

3916
02:47:20,319 --> 02:47:21,599
Killed by the

3917
02:47:21,855 --> 02:47:23,135
Police

3918
02:47:23,391 --> 02:47:24,159
He believes he can

3919
02:47:24,415 --> 02:47:24,927
Build

3920
02:47:25,183 --> 02:47:26,975
Murder narrative out of

3921
02:47:27,487 --> 02:47:28,511
He has all of the objects

3922
02:47:28,767 --> 02:47:29,279
He needs to

3923
02:47:29,535 --> 02:47:30,559
To build upon

3924
02:47:30,815 --> 02:47:31,583
Move forward

3925
02:47:31,839 --> 02:47:33,631
He's decided that this is antifa

3926
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:34,911
And he's going to

3927
02:47:35,167 --> 02:47:36,703
Put it on the last Jeff

3928
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:40,287
He has everything that he needs as long as it doesn't get worse

3929
02:47:41,055 --> 02:47:41,823
And so

3930
02:47:42,079 --> 02:47:43,615
That's what he's encouraging people to do

3931
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:45,919
He has no real effect on anyone's Act

3932
02:47:46,175 --> 02:47:46,943
Jen's I don't believe

3933
02:47:47,199 --> 02:47:48,223
Absolutely

3934
02:47:48,735 --> 02:47:49,503
But it's it's

3935
02:47:50,527 --> 02:47:51,295
Imagine somebody

3936
02:47:51,551 --> 02:47:52,831
In the Capitol Building after

3937
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:59,231
After having stormed it like I got word from Alex we got we all got to go home.

3938
02:47:59,487 --> 02:48:01,279
Highly rated probiotics

3939
02:48:01,791 --> 02:48:05,119
Wait I thought I was in DC for testing today

3940
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:08,959
So what are the Dead

3941
02:48:09,215 --> 02:48:10,239
Giveaways with Alex

3942
02:48:10,495 --> 02:48:11,263
Is just like

3943
02:48:13,055 --> 02:48:14,079
We can't let this get worse

3944
02:48:14,335 --> 02:48:14,847
Is this

3945
02:48:25,087 --> 02:48:26,111
Texas telling people to

3946
02:48:26,367 --> 02:48:27,391
Except a curfew

3947
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:28,671
What

3948
02:48:28,927 --> 02:48:33,791
Hey you know what happens when your revolutionary movement is led by a bunch of

3949
02:48:34,303 --> 02:48:35,071
Rich people in

3950
02:48:35,327 --> 02:48:37,119
Grifters and scam artist

3951
02:48:37,375 --> 02:48:38,399
And I

3952
02:48:38,655 --> 02:48:39,167
Your

3953
02:48:39,423 --> 02:48:40,959
Supreme leader is a f******

3954
02:48:41,471 --> 02:48:42,239
Coward ask

3955
02:48:42,495 --> 02:48:44,799
Vice-presidents to overthrow a country

3956
02:48:45,055 --> 02:48:45,567
Before him

3957
02:48:45,823 --> 02:48:48,127
And then he decided to run away

3958
02:48:48,383 --> 02:48:49,663
SKU ranawat he

3959
02:48:49,919 --> 02:48:53,759
Bleed from your capital

3960
02:48:54,271 --> 02:49:00,415
And then your hero anti-government guy tells you a listen to the state when they tell you to go home

3961
02:49:02,207 --> 02:49:02,975
Listen to that curfew

3962
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:06,559
Hey you know who we're fighting the literal Christian devil

3963
02:49:07,327 --> 02:49:08,351
Nightfall

3964
02:49:08,607 --> 02:49:09,887
Yeah we only fight

3965
02:49:10,143 --> 02:49:12,191
The day I have been

3966
02:49:12,447 --> 02:49:13,215
And spending a lot of time on my

3967
02:49:13,471 --> 02:49:15,007
My program yelling about how

3968
02:49:15,519 --> 02:49:16,799
Fuser basically

3969
02:49:17,311 --> 02:49:18,591
You know that

3970
02:49:18,847 --> 02:49:19,615
Slavery

3971
02:49:19,871 --> 02:49:23,711
Government overreach

3972
02:49:23,967 --> 02:49:25,247
Scott it's nightfall gas

3973
02:49:25,503 --> 02:49:26,015
Got to go home

3974
02:49:26,271 --> 02:49:27,295
This is

3975
02:49:27,551 --> 02:49:29,599
This is actually kind of interesting at this point

3976
02:49:29,855 --> 02:49:30,623
Alex reports

3977
02:49:30,879 --> 02:49:32,415
That this woman was shot has died

3978
02:49:32,927 --> 02:49:34,463
This is Wade

3979
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:37,535
Before yeah I was going to say we didn't find that out no

3980
02:50:05,183 --> 02:50:06,463
I don't know what to make of

3981
02:50:06,975 --> 02:50:07,999
Because it did end up being

3982
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:09,023
Incorrect right

3983
02:50:09,791 --> 02:50:11,583
Still don't think Alex had a source

3984
02:50:13,375 --> 02:50:13,887
The good bat

3985
02:50:14,655 --> 02:50:15,423
I think you knew that there was a

3986
02:50:15,679 --> 02:50:16,703
Good chance she was going to

3987
02:50:16,959 --> 02:50:17,471
The past

3988
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:18,495
And decided

3989
02:50:18,751 --> 02:50:19,775
Did to make it to finitive

3990
02:50:20,287 --> 02:50:21,311
Claim there was a source

3991
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:26,175
Confirmed reports

3992
02:50:26,431 --> 02:50:28,223
We're very much like sex

3993
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:31,807
Well I mean

3994
02:50:33,087 --> 02:50:34,623
The real world

3995
02:50:35,391 --> 02:50:36,671
The reporting was like

3996
02:50:37,695 --> 02:50:39,231
We saw her get

3997
02:50:39,743 --> 02:50:43,839
This type of medical treatment which they only get right right the most

3998
02:50:44,095 --> 02:50:44,863
Stream of circum

3999
02:50:45,119 --> 02:50:45,631
Consensus

4000
02:50:46,143 --> 02:50:50,239
So it would be certain things

4001
02:50:50,495 --> 02:50:51,007
Good bat

4002
02:50:51,263 --> 02:50:52,287
It's not a new

4003
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:54,847
Black girl

4004
02:50:55,103 --> 02:50:56,383
Confirm reports are nonsense I mean

4005
02:50:56,639 --> 02:50:57,151
The things that Alex

4006
02:50:57,407 --> 02:51:02,015
Just tried to pass off as Cooper report

4007
02:51:03,807 --> 02:51:04,831
Now in light of this

4008
02:51:05,087 --> 02:51:05,599
Decision that he's

4009
02:51:05,855 --> 02:51:06,623
Maidenform

4010
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:07,903
Maybe somebody has

4011
02:51:08,159 --> 02:51:08,927
Giving him a tip

4012
02:51:09,183 --> 02:51:10,207
That she has passed

4013
02:51:10,463 --> 02:51:11,487
Now we need to see

4014
02:51:11,743 --> 02:51:12,255
Set the narrative

4015
02:51:16,863 --> 02:51:23,007
Today's the day

4016
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:25,311
What's up

4017
02:51:25,567 --> 02:51:28,127
Under martial law

4018
02:51:35,551 --> 02:51:37,343
Okay

4019
02:51:39,647 --> 02:51:42,463
DC under martial law

4020
02:51:42,719 --> 02:51:47,583
Feds shoot and kill innocent woman

4021
02:51:50,911 --> 02:51:53,983
We have to get the

4022
02:51:54,495 --> 02:51:55,519
We got to get to Meredith out

4023
02:51:55,775 --> 02:51:57,311
This is the narrative that we need

4024
02:51:57,567 --> 02:52:03,199
Does that guy the cop murdered this woman in Cold Blood in the city is under martial law

4025
02:52:03,711 --> 02:52:04,223
And of course

4026
02:52:04,479 --> 02:52:06,271
Sub narratives of course the martial law was for

4027
02:52:06,527 --> 02:52:12,671
Precipitated by false-flag Shore takeover of the

4028
02:52:13,695 --> 02:52:15,487
The power but also go home at 6

4029
02:52:17,023 --> 02:52:18,303
Alex is trying to make this work and

4030
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:21,375
So he has some

4031
02:52:21,631 --> 02:52:22,911
Footage of the shooting

4032
02:52:24,447 --> 02:52:26,239
He is constantly describes it as

4033
02:52:26,495 --> 02:52:27,519
Execution-style

4034
02:52:29,311 --> 02:52:29,823
It's just a narrative

4035
02:52:30,079 --> 02:52:31,871
Being said I saw the video

4036
02:52:36,735 --> 02:52:38,527
A non-violent woman

4037
02:52:51,839 --> 02:52:53,887
Yeah

4038
02:52:54,143 --> 02:52:54,655
Emily also seen

4039
02:52:54,911 --> 02:52:57,727
This video I did not want to but Alex plays it

4040
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:58,751
A bunch of times

4041
02:52:59,775 --> 02:53:00,799
And

4042
02:53:02,335 --> 02:53:03,615
Clear that he has made a point

4043
02:53:05,151 --> 02:53:06,687
Say that this was a

4044
02:53:06,943 --> 02:53:07,455
Execution

4045
02:53:08,223 --> 02:53:10,015
Because that term is now used

4046
02:53:10,783 --> 02:53:11,295
Like almost

4047
02:53:11,807 --> 02:53:12,575
Blanket ladder

4048
02:53:15,135 --> 02:53:15,903
This is weird

4049
02:53:16,159 --> 02:53:16,927
Alex is found

4050
02:53:17,183 --> 02:53:17,951
First-hand Witness

4051
02:53:18,975 --> 02:53:25,119
We've got a

4052
02:53:31,775 --> 02:53:32,799
Confirm oh my God

4053
02:53:33,567 --> 02:53:34,079
What a shock

4054
02:53:34,335 --> 02:53:35,103
We got it we got to wait

4055
02:53:35,871 --> 02:53:36,639
UniFirst

4056
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:38,175
You don't get

4057
02:53:38,431 --> 02:53:39,199
To tell me that

4058
02:53:39,455 --> 02:53:40,735
That you are revolting

4059
02:53:41,247 --> 02:53:42,527
And overthrowing the government

4060
02:53:42,783 --> 02:53:43,807
And then be like oh

4061
02:53:44,575 --> 02:53:46,623
Innocent woman was murdered

4062
02:53:46,879 --> 02:53:47,647
Cold Blood

4063
02:53:47,903 --> 02:53:48,415
By the cops

4064
02:53:49,695 --> 02:53:51,743
You're fighting a revolution

4065
02:53:51,999 --> 02:53:54,815
Or conversely antifa

4066
02:53:55,071 --> 02:53:55,839
Provocateur

4067
02:53:56,095 --> 02:53:56,607
Yeah

4068
02:53:56,863 --> 02:53:57,375
And then

4069
02:53:57,631 --> 02:53:58,143
She wouldn't

4070
02:53:58,911 --> 02:53:59,423
Bu

4071
02:54:00,447 --> 02:54:02,751
I don't understand if she's not

4072
02:54:03,007 --> 02:54:04,543
And it's hard

4073
02:54:04,799 --> 02:54:07,103
It's hard to figure out exactly what the narrative is

4074
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:09,407
Sickly they're all false flag provocateurs except for

4075
02:54:09,663 --> 02:54:11,455
For her she was a hero

4076
02:54:11,711 --> 02:54:12,223
And

4077
02:54:12,479 --> 02:54:13,247
I don't know

4078
02:54:13,503 --> 02:54:15,295
I can care that she was killed

4079
02:54:15,807 --> 02:54:19,135
Because I'm living in the real world

4080
02:54:19,647 --> 02:54:23,231
What happened was a woman's brain was destroyed and melted

4081
02:54:23,743 --> 02:54:24,767
And then here we are

4082
02:54:25,023 --> 02:54:25,791
But

4083
02:54:26,047 --> 02:54:26,559
They can't

4084
02:54:26,815 --> 02:54:28,863
Care because they're fighting a real f***

4085
02:54:29,119 --> 02:54:29,631
War against

4086
02:54:29,887 --> 02:54:33,215
It's the devil they should all be expecting to die immediately

4087
02:54:33,727 --> 02:54:37,311
That's what you're fighting the literal Christian devil

4088
02:54:37,823 --> 02:54:39,359
Yeah

4089
02:54:39,871 --> 02:54:40,895
And bring about one person

4090
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:43,199
It just seemed weird

4091
02:54:43,711 --> 02:54:45,759
Yeah and it also seems weird to go

4092
02:54:46,015 --> 02:54:46,527
Halfway

4093
02:54:47,039 --> 02:54:48,319
In terms of like we have

4094
02:54:48,575 --> 02:54:49,087
Breached

4095
02:54:49,599 --> 02:54:50,367
The Capitol building

4096
02:54:50,623 --> 02:54:53,183
Happy like we will fight another day

4097
02:54:53,695 --> 02:54:56,511
Like it seems weird if you think that you're up against the actual devil

4098
02:54:56,767 --> 02:54:58,303
You're already midstream

4099
02:54:59,583 --> 02:55:00,095
It's very weird

4100
02:55:01,631 --> 02:55:02,143
But that's

4101
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:02,911
Because that's

4102
02:55:03,167 --> 02:55:04,191
That's not really what they want

4103
02:55:04,447 --> 02:55:05,727
They don't want that

4104
02:55:05,983 --> 02:55:07,519
It's like what you were saying like

4105
02:55:07,775 --> 02:55:08,543
The people who they were

4106
02:55:08,799 --> 02:55:14,431
Probably the most matter the people who followed through with what they keep saying

4107
02:55:15,199 --> 02:55:19,551
We don't actually want a Ron Paul presidency

4108
02:55:19,807 --> 02:55:21,343
We would lose our money

4109
02:55:22,367 --> 02:55:26,207
So a host for a little while and

4110
02:55:26,463 --> 02:55:28,255
But he's doing the work to build up

4111
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:29,279
Does narratives that

4112
02:55:29,791 --> 02:55:30,815
This woman was a martyr

4113
02:55:31,583 --> 02:55:37,727
I will completely admit that I am a chauvinist and I forced all of our female reporters on the ground to get the

4114
02:55:37,983 --> 02:55:41,823
The hell out of there one is on a train getting multiple states away right now

4115
02:55:42,079 --> 02:55:44,895
This is not a safe place

4116
02:55:45,151 --> 02:55:46,431
Multiplan way

4117
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:48,223
And this is Nae that's not

4118
02:55:48,479 --> 02:55:49,759
The time to be a martyr

4119
02:55:50,015 --> 02:55:52,831
They've already made of murders and that is what this

4120
02:55:53,087 --> 02:55:54,367
Young woman will be

4121
02:55:54,623 --> 02:55:55,135
The police

4122
02:55:55,391 --> 02:55:55,903
Sean

4123
02:55:56,159 --> 02:55:57,183
And killed a woman

4124
02:55:57,439 --> 02:55:58,207
Because

4125
02:55:58,719 --> 02:56:00,511
They didn't like her form of protest

4126
02:56:01,535 --> 02:56:02,047
Say

4127
02:56:03,583 --> 02:56:08,447
I mean if your form of protest is storming the Capitol Building I would argue yeah

4128
02:56:12,543 --> 02:56:13,567
Google the bar.

4129
02:56:13,823 --> 02:56:15,615
Now is not the time to Marty yourself

4130
02:56:15,871 --> 02:56:17,407
We were fighting the devil

4131
02:56:17,663 --> 02:56:18,943
I'm going

4132
02:56:19,199 --> 02:56:21,503
I'm going to tell you that I have

4133
02:56:22,271 --> 02:56:23,807
Sombrero - feeling

4134
02:56:24,063 --> 02:56:26,111
Songs about how Alex handles the fact

4135
02:56:26,367 --> 02:56:26,879
That he has

4136
02:56:27,391 --> 02:56:27,903
Footage

4137
02:56:28,159 --> 02:56:28,927
Yeah of this shooting

4138
02:56:30,207 --> 02:56:30,719
But

4139
02:56:30,975 --> 02:56:33,023
There's a really interesting dynamic

4140
02:56:33,535 --> 02:56:34,047
At play

4141
02:56:34,303 --> 02:56:35,327
About the

4142
02:56:35,583 --> 02:56:36,095
Provenance

4143
02:56:36,351 --> 02:56:36,863
Of this

4144
02:56:37,119 --> 02:56:37,631
Footage

4145
02:56:38,399 --> 02:56:38,911
Alex

4146
02:56:39,679 --> 02:56:40,703
Kind of reviews

4147
02:56:41,215 --> 02:56:41,727
Too much

4148
02:56:42,239 --> 02:56:42,751
America

4149
02:56:43,007 --> 02:56:43,775
Pretend that he didn't

4150
02:56:44,031 --> 02:56:44,543
Say these things

4151
02:56:45,567 --> 02:56:48,895
I have seen a snuff film today

4152
02:57:04,255 --> 02:57:05,535
We are uploading footage

4153
02:57:06,559 --> 02:57:10,911
So one of your camera people one of your employees was one of the people who was a long

4154
02:57:11,167 --> 02:57:12,703
Storming the Senate and was there

4155
02:57:13,215 --> 02:57:13,983
Close enough to

4156
02:57:14,239 --> 02:57:15,263
Get this video

4157
02:57:15,519 --> 02:57:16,799
Do this woman being shot

4158
02:57:17,823 --> 02:57:18,335
Interesting

4159
02:57:21,151 --> 02:57:21,663
Weird

4160
02:57:21,919 --> 02:57:23,711
You would think that the psycho

4161
02:57:23,967 --> 02:57:24,479
Thanks

4162
02:57:24,991 --> 02:57:28,063
And we had a cameraman in there all the sudden everybody round images

4163
02:57:29,343 --> 02:57:31,135
Cabot him through that

4164
02:57:31,391 --> 02:57:32,671
F****** neck

4165
02:57:36,255 --> 02:57:37,023
Freaking out

4166
02:57:37,791 --> 02:57:38,559
Criminals in Congress

4167
02:57:40,095 --> 02:57:40,863
Just think there's a little

4168
02:57:41,887 --> 02:57:42,911
I think I kept this clip because it's

4169
02:57:43,167 --> 02:57:43,935
So out of place

4170
02:57:44,191 --> 02:57:44,959
The weird outbursts

4171
02:57:45,983 --> 02:57:52,127
This is the biggest frustration and this is why this is so difficult why we're on a Highwire here

4172
02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:14,143
You're damn right

4173
02:58:14,399 --> 02:58:19,263
Top of a building I think Express location okay

4174
02:58:20,543 --> 02:58:22,335
I hope it sounds like three dudes at a bar

4175
02:58:22,591 --> 02:58:24,383
Arguing about how they f****** lost

4176
02:58:24,639 --> 02:58:30,271
We won the game we'll get them next time really hard to tell but that was

4177
02:58:30,783 --> 02:58:31,295
Bizarre

4178
02:58:32,575 --> 02:58:34,623
Rob.

4179
02:58:34,879 --> 02:58:36,159
Course he's I watched

4180
02:58:36,415 --> 02:58:37,183
This is Death film

4181
02:58:37,951 --> 02:58:42,559
I just watched it a couple times it's pretty sad

4182
02:58:57,919 --> 02:59:02,015
Alex is Big take on this is that the media in the news

4183
02:59:02,271 --> 02:59:03,551
Play The Police

4184
02:59:03,807 --> 02:59:04,319
Footage

4185
02:59:04,575 --> 02:59:06,879
Of the of the killing of

4186
02:59:07,135 --> 02:59:07,647
George Floyd

4187
02:59:08,415 --> 02:59:09,695
And so he's like well

4188
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:11,487
I'm going to play this I want you to

4189
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:12,255
Watch it

4190
02:59:12,767 --> 02:59:18,655
So you get to see

4191
02:59:26,847 --> 02:59:32,735
I want you to see her.

4192
02:59:39,391 --> 02:59:42,975
Text Landing

4193
02:59:43,231 --> 02:59:45,279
That's psychologically so f*****

4194
02:59:45,535 --> 02:59:46,047
Dog

4195
02:59:47,327 --> 02:59:49,887
I want you to watch her die slowly

4196
02:59:50,143 --> 02:59:51,167
So gross

4197
02:59:52,191 --> 02:59:52,703
She would have

4198
02:59:52,959 --> 02:59:55,519
Wanted me you don't even know who this person is

4199
02:59:57,055 --> 02:59:57,567
Guess something

4200
02:59:57,823 --> 02:59:58,847
Things about her based on the fact

4201
02:59:59,359 --> 03:00:00,639
Qcor battle

4202
03:00:01,663 --> 03:00:04,223
But those bi-week assumption they will be great

4203
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:04,991
They wouldn't be great

4204
03:00:05,247 --> 03:00:07,807
But Tom pepper is doing his job Alex's.

4205
03:00:08,063 --> 03:00:08,575
Declare this Annex

4206
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:10,367
Execution and so while he's host

4207
03:00:10,623 --> 03:00:11,903
I think he's brilliant trying to push the

4208
03:00:12,671 --> 03:00:14,975
Again Infowars has exclusive video

4209
03:00:15,487 --> 03:00:16,255
Of the Martyr

4210
03:00:16,511 --> 03:00:17,279
DC

4211
03:00:18,047 --> 03:00:19,071
The mag of martyr

4212
03:00:19,839 --> 03:00:24,703
It was executed shot execution-style I've seen the video I don't know what else you'd call it

4213
03:00:25,983 --> 03:00:27,263
Buy these

4214
03:00:28,543 --> 03:00:29,567
Jackboots

4215
03:00:29,823 --> 03:00:31,103
Muriel Bowser

4216
03:00:31,615 --> 03:00:34,175
By the jackboot of Joe Biden

4217
03:00:34,431 --> 03:00:35,455
Joe Biden

4218
03:00:39,039 --> 03:00:39,551
Call them

4219
03:00:39,807 --> 03:00:41,599
Koopa Troopa

4220
03:00:41,855 --> 03:00:43,135
The jackboots

4221
03:00:43,391 --> 03:00:46,207
Her name

4222
03:00:46,463 --> 03:00:46,975
God

4223
03:00:47,487 --> 03:00:50,047
So anyway pampered also let slip

4224
03:00:50,303 --> 03:00:51,327
That the person who got

4225
03:00:51,583 --> 03:00:52,863
This footage is employed by in

4226
03:00:53,887 --> 03:00:56,447
I know the Infowars cameraman who was in

4227
03:00:56,959 --> 03:01:00,031
The roommate who captured the the footage what happened

4228
03:01:00,287 --> 03:01:04,639
Hey man it's okay I had a he's a strong man but I don't know if I would be

4229
03:01:05,151 --> 03:01:07,711
So Opera is playing

4230
03:01:07,967 --> 03:01:08,479
Some

4231
03:01:08,735 --> 03:01:09,247
Clips

4232
03:01:10,783 --> 03:01:11,551
At this point

4233
03:01:11,807 --> 03:01:13,087
There's a group of Trumps

4234
03:01:13,343 --> 03:01:15,903
Supporters who find immediate setup

4235
03:01:16,415 --> 03:01:17,695
I start attacking the light

4236
03:01:17,951 --> 03:01:21,279
Sure and and what have you

4237
03:01:21,791 --> 03:01:25,119
Not really funny here is that I was watching

4238
03:01:25,375 --> 03:01:27,423
Pinterest board is playing this

4239
03:01:27,679 --> 03:01:28,191
Video

4240
03:01:28,703 --> 03:01:29,471
And he's a stupor

4241
03:01:29,727 --> 03:01:34,079
Pretend that he can't see Trump flag

4242
03:01:35,103 --> 03:01:35,615
More

4243
03:01:36,127 --> 03:01:37,919
Clashes happening it appears

4244
03:01:38,175 --> 03:01:38,687
Between

4245
03:01:39,199 --> 03:01:39,967
The media

4246
03:01:40,223 --> 03:01:46,367
And Trump supporters or is that the left I can't tell what kind of flag that is

4247
03:01:46,623 --> 03:01:52,767
DC as the Sun starts to go down a little bit things are going to get a little bit darker and people come out

4248
03:01:53,023 --> 03:01:57,631
Appear to be light switch like somebody was maybe doing a stand-up some news Outlet was doing a stand-up

4249
03:01:57,887 --> 03:01:59,167
That's just dumb as well

4250
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:02,751
Immediate right friends in the media

4251
03:02:03,007 --> 03:02:04,031
Given my reporters

4252
03:02:04,287 --> 03:02:10,431
And we are the Renegade news outlet that is what is Julissa data by the seat of our pants

4253
03:02:10,687 --> 03:02:11,199
People Touhou

4254
03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:15,039
Nobody's going to get shot today on my watch

4255
03:02:17,087 --> 03:02:18,111
Who are out there to get the

4256
03:02:18,367 --> 03:02:19,903
What is to make us look bad

4257
03:02:21,183 --> 03:02:23,999
You're not say Franti fire police either I'm sorry

4258
03:02:24,255 --> 03:02:26,559
I'm not Flats on a threat that's an observation

4259
03:02:26,815 --> 03:02:29,375
No it's not a 3 cuz these people are Ferrell

4260
03:02:30,143 --> 03:02:31,167
I think you might need to go to therapy

4261
03:02:31,679 --> 03:02:32,447
I okay

4262
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:33,215
Here's the problem

4263
03:02:33,727 --> 03:02:34,751
Here's the problem alright

4264
03:02:35,775 --> 03:02:37,567
Here's why that's so obvious

4265
03:02:37,823 --> 03:02:38,591
Transparently bull

4266
03:02:40,383 --> 03:02:42,431
Because if they were antifa

4267
03:02:42,687 --> 03:02:43,199
Provocateur

4268
03:02:43,455 --> 03:02:43,967
Chores

4269
03:02:44,223 --> 03:02:44,735
Wrightwood

4270
03:02:44,991 --> 03:02:46,527
Still be carrying Trump

4271
03:02:46,783 --> 03:02:47,295
Flags

4272
03:02:47,807 --> 03:02:48,831
They wouldn't be carrying

4273
03:02:49,343 --> 03:02:50,111
Antifa flag

4274
03:02:50,879 --> 03:02:51,647
Oh yeah that's true

4275
03:02:51,903 --> 03:02:53,183
That's great point

4276
03:02:53,695 --> 03:02:54,207
Also

4277
03:02:54,463 --> 03:02:55,231
Everything else

4278
03:02:55,743 --> 03:02:57,023
Based on what Tom Packer

4279
03:02:58,559 --> 03:03:00,863
Conflict journalism should not exist

4280
03:03:01,887 --> 03:03:03,167
I can type a look

4281
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:06,239
I understand everyone's curious what's going on in the war zone

4282
03:03:06,495 --> 03:03:07,263
But you journalists

4283
03:03:07,519 --> 03:03:08,287
Stoop

4284
03:03:08,543 --> 03:03:09,311
Hey hey

4285
03:03:09,823 --> 03:03:10,335
Journalist

4286
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:13,407
Cops and antifa are going to

4287
03:03:13,663 --> 03:03:16,479
They're not your friends and they're going to come after you too

4288
03:03:16,991 --> 03:03:17,759
I know

4289
03:03:18,015 --> 03:03:18,527
No they're not

4290
03:03:19,039 --> 03:03:19,551
You guys are

4291
03:03:20,575 --> 03:03:21,343
So

4292
03:03:22,111 --> 03:03:23,391
Something something bad happen

4293
03:03:24,671 --> 03:03:25,183
Broadcast

4294
03:03:25,439 --> 03:03:26,719
And that is they've been

4295
03:03:26,975 --> 03:03:27,487
Teasing

4296
03:03:28,511 --> 03:03:29,023
Death footage

4297
03:03:29,535 --> 03:03:30,559
Going to play

4298
03:03:32,607 --> 03:03:33,119
Anodized

4299
03:03:33,631 --> 03:03:34,399
But they gets

4300
03:03:34,655 --> 03:03:35,167
Scooped

4301
03:03:35,679 --> 03:03:36,191
Someone else really

4302
03:03:36,447 --> 03:03:36,959
Lisa's Ono

4303
03:03:37,471 --> 03:03:39,007
Okay we will be going live

4304
03:03:39,263 --> 03:03:43,615
Here in just a second with Alex Jones who's going to come in and break the video

4305
03:03:43,871 --> 03:03:50,015
Sorry it's just my cry was telling them do not upload this video anywhere it needs an Infowars exclusive then all the sudden I'm seeing it go

4306
03:03:50,271 --> 03:03:56,159
So not sure what happened there someone else

4307
03:03:57,951 --> 03:03:58,975
Ixtapa Steel

4308
03:03:59,487 --> 03:04:00,767
Footage and he uploaded it

4309
03:04:01,023 --> 03:04:02,047
And

4310
03:04:02,303 --> 03:04:04,351
No longer than 4 hours exclusive

4311
03:04:05,375 --> 03:04:06,143
Can still get robbed dude

4312
03:04:08,191 --> 03:04:09,215
I don't know

4313
03:04:09,471 --> 03:04:12,287
You might be in the wind might be too high

4314
03:04:12,543 --> 03:04:13,567
Soy

4315
03:04:13,823 --> 03:04:14,591
I notice

4316
03:04:15,103 --> 03:04:17,407
I like their similarities and how like

4317
03:04:17,919 --> 03:04:18,431
Harrison

4318
03:04:18,687 --> 03:04:19,711
Is vaping

4319
03:04:19,967 --> 03:04:20,479
Traits

4320
03:04:20,735 --> 03:04:21,503
Patterns

4321
03:04:22,015 --> 03:04:23,039
That Alex Jones

4322
03:04:23,551 --> 03:04:24,319
Tribe.

4323
03:04:24,575 --> 03:04:25,087
In Houston

4324
03:04:25,599 --> 03:04:26,111
Exactly

4325
03:04:26,367 --> 03:04:26,879
And I notice

4326
03:04:27,135 --> 03:04:27,903
Stand up one

4327
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:28,927
The Tom pepper

4328
03:04:29,183 --> 03:04:29,951
Is doing an impression

4329
03:04:30,207 --> 03:04:30,719
Passion of

4330
03:04:30,975 --> 03:04:31,999
Or just basically

4331
03:04:32,255 --> 03:04:33,279
Alex does it so

4332
03:04:33,535 --> 03:04:34,047
It's totally fine

4333
03:04:34,559 --> 03:04:37,631
And that is reporting something based on imagining it

4334
03:04:38,655 --> 03:04:43,263
I guarantee you as we speak right now they're trying to use the 25th Amendment to remove Trump

4335
03:04:43,519 --> 03:04:45,311
Android full and complete and total coup

4336
03:04:45,567 --> 03:04:46,335
Right before our eyes

4337
03:04:46,591 --> 03:04:47,359
I guarantee you that

4338
03:04:47,615 --> 03:04:51,199
The conversation and Mike Pence's reading it I could almost

4339
03:04:51,455 --> 03:04:57,599
What is without sources I'm just telling you I know how these people think I've spent enough time covering them not nearly as much as you think

4340
03:04:59,135 --> 03:05:02,207
I'm making this up guaranteed cuz I know I've

4341
03:05:02,463 --> 03:05:04,255
Follow these people for so long they're sick

4342
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:07,071
Just based on nothing

4343
03:05:07,583 --> 03:05:08,607
Just feels so true though

4344
03:05:08,863 --> 03:05:09,887
Yeah oh yeah

4345
03:05:10,143 --> 03:05:10,655
This is a COO

4346
03:05:10,911 --> 03:05:14,239
You know after we stormed the Capitol building

4347
03:05:15,263 --> 03:05:16,287
They're going to cool

4348
03:05:16,799 --> 03:05:17,311
Wait

4349
03:05:18,079 --> 03:05:20,639
Our guys the president now

4350
03:05:21,151 --> 03:05:22,943
So now is the coup

4351
03:05:23,455 --> 03:05:24,479
But you know who's Ken

4352
03:05:24,735 --> 03:05:25,759
Conspicuous in their absence

4353
03:05:26,271 --> 03:05:27,039
Steve

4354
03:05:29,087 --> 03:05:30,879
He's got to get those ballot

4355
03:05:32,415 --> 03:05:38,559
We've got to find those ballots man Thursday got the various blockchain

4356
03:05:38,815 --> 03:05:42,143
Hey Dad Paul number one for me if I

4357
03:05:42,911 --> 03:05:44,191
Salon hair

4358
03:05:44,959 --> 03:05:48,031
Trump is a bandana so it's time for Melania to

4359
03:05:48,287 --> 03:05:52,895
To take over

4360
03:05:53,919 --> 03:05:55,711
Hey Rodger you want to come on

4361
03:05:55,967 --> 03:05:56,991
No

4362
03:05:59,295 --> 03:06:00,063
Please leave a message

4363
03:06:03,647 --> 03:06:06,463
Today

4364
03:06:06,975 --> 03:06:07,999
Diabeetus

4365
03:06:08,255 --> 03:06:11,583
Slim drunk in the bunker

4366
03:06:11,839 --> 03:06:14,399
So we get now to Alex's

4367
03:06:15,167 --> 03:06:15,935
First hand

4368
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:17,983
The guy who got the video

4369
03:06:18,751 --> 03:06:20,287
Now Alex is going

4370
03:06:20,799 --> 03:06:21,311
Pretend

4371
03:06:21,567 --> 03:06:23,615
But he hasn't already said that this person works

4372
03:06:23,871 --> 03:06:24,383
Springfield Water

4373
03:06:33,599 --> 03:06:39,743
Who was executed by

4374
03:06:40,767 --> 03:06:43,583
Alex conveniently fails to mention the Taylor Hanson

4375
03:06:43,839 --> 03:06:44,607
Not Tyler

4376
03:06:44,863 --> 03:06:46,143
Is the Infowars cameraman

4377
03:06:46,399 --> 03:06:47,167
NetSpend reference mother

4378
03:06:47,423 --> 03:06:47,935
Will times already

4379
03:06:48,447 --> 03:06:50,751
Owen was hanging out with Taylor the night before

4380
03:06:51,263 --> 03:06:52,287
And by hanging out

4381
03:06:52,799 --> 03:06:54,079
This is actually what I mean

4382
03:06:54,335 --> 03:06:55,103
They took video

4383
03:06:56,639 --> 03:06:58,943
My good friend heckler

4384
03:06:59,199 --> 03:07:00,735
They're going to do a

4385
03:07:01,759 --> 03:07:07,903
Blacklivesmatter enrichment ceremony

4386
03:07:14,559 --> 03:07:16,351
Stand in front

4387
03:07:23,775 --> 03:07:29,151
I'm not going to think I'm not getting pregnant

4388
03:07:34,015 --> 03:07:38,111
The default

4389
03:07:39,903 --> 03:07:42,719
Black pocketbook

4390
03:07:58,335 --> 03:08:02,175
Goodnight before Owen and Taylor.

4391
03:08:02,431 --> 03:08:06,015
Together with a group of people and doused a black lives matter flag

4392
03:08:06,271 --> 03:08:08,831
And I lighter fluid set it on fire

4393
03:08:09,087 --> 03:08:10,111
Enchanted f***

4394
03:08:10,367 --> 03:08:16,511
B l a b l m socks

4395
03:08:16,767 --> 03:08:19,839
Oh that's awesome

4396
03:08:20,095 --> 03:08:23,679
It is weird so weird

4397
03:08:23,935 --> 03:08:24,447
Pretending

4398
03:08:24,703 --> 03:08:25,215
That this is just a

4399
03:08:25,471 --> 03:08:26,239
The guy

4400
03:08:26,495 --> 03:08:32,383
Just a patriot out there.

4401
03:08:33,663 --> 03:08:38,527
Play Everybody Dance here just wanted to drop in to make a little bit of a correction here

4402
03:08:39,039 --> 03:08:41,599
There is something going on

4403
03:08:41,855 --> 03:08:45,695
I'm here definitely about this dude Taylor

4404
03:08:45,951 --> 03:08:47,487
Who Alex is interviewing

4405
03:08:49,023 --> 03:08:55,167
But I'd I messed something up I I make something up in that is that is my fault and I just like to correct that I did

4406
03:08:55,423 --> 03:08:58,239
Realize this until after we'd recorded the episode of it didn't want

4407
03:08:58,495 --> 03:09:01,823
To take it out but at the same time I didn't want anyone to get the wrong idea

4408
03:09:02,079 --> 03:09:06,431
There were actually two videos that are being referenced

4409
03:09:07,199 --> 03:09:11,551
And it is very unclear and I made a hasty assumption

4410
03:09:11,807 --> 03:09:13,599
There wasn't Infowars

4411
03:09:14,623 --> 03:09:15,391
Cameraperson

4412
03:09:15,647 --> 03:09:19,999
Who was filming at the Capital One of people had to storm

4413
03:09:20,511 --> 03:09:22,559
And the shooting did take place

4414
03:09:23,071 --> 03:09:24,863
And in addition to that

4415
03:09:25,375 --> 03:09:27,935
Taylor Hanson was also

4416
03:09:28,191 --> 03:09:29,983
There and he had shot some video

4417
03:09:30,495 --> 03:09:35,615
So I apologize for the mistake there is no indication that the Sara Lee

4418
03:09:35,871 --> 03:09:38,687
That Taylor himself he's an Infowars employee

4419
03:09:38,943 --> 03:09:43,807
Although very much should clearly and Infowars associate and as much as he's hanging out

4420
03:09:44,319 --> 03:09:47,391
Inoue troyer's hotel room and he is

4421
03:09:47,647 --> 03:09:49,439
You don't want video tonight

4422
03:09:49,695 --> 03:09:50,207
Before

4423
03:09:50,463 --> 03:09:53,535
Resetting a black lives matter flag on fire with Owen

4424
03:09:54,047 --> 03:10:00,191
There's something going on there was really confusing about the social dynamics between pretending he was

4425
03:10:00,447 --> 03:10:01,727
The stranger to them

4426
03:10:01,983 --> 03:10:05,055
When in fact he was very well known to them

4427
03:10:05,311 --> 03:10:07,103
And the

4428
03:10:07,359 --> 03:10:09,663
Multiple people

4429
03:10:09,919 --> 03:10:10,687
Recording

4430
03:10:11,455 --> 03:10:11,967
Stuff

4431
03:10:12,223 --> 03:10:15,807
It was very it was a mess anyway sorry I got that mixed up. Back to the episode

4432
03:10:18,111 --> 03:10:19,647
The next day after this

4433
03:10:19,903 --> 03:10:21,439
Taylor Hanson was a guest on Lori

4434
03:10:21,695 --> 03:10:22,207
Ingraham show

4435
03:10:22,719 --> 03:10:23,999
Taylor better be really careful

4436
03:10:24,511 --> 03:10:30,655
I certainly hope that the video showing him burning a black lives matter flag the night before doesn't paint his journalistic intentions as being

4437
03:10:32,191 --> 03:10:33,983
I would imagine the key and Alex should be really can

4438
03:10:34,239 --> 03:10:35,775
Concerned right now about him getting a rest

4439
03:10:36,287 --> 03:10:37,055
Free legal entry

4440
03:10:37,567 --> 03:10:38,335
Into the Capitol building

4441
03:10:38,591 --> 03:10:39,615
Because he was clearly

4442
03:10:39,871 --> 03:10:41,407
Not there is some kind of an object

4443
03:10:41,663 --> 03:10:42,687
No no

4444
03:10:44,223 --> 03:10:46,527
Using Infowars employee

4445
03:10:46,783 --> 03:10:51,391
Trying to get a Sizzle reel against the freedom of the press

4446
03:10:52,927 --> 03:10:56,255
This interview in a little bit

4447
03:10:56,511 --> 03:10:58,303
But Alex wants to play the video

4448
03:10:59,839 --> 03:11:01,631
And you really excited to play this video button

4449
03:11:02,143 --> 03:11:02,655
So excited

4450
03:11:13,407 --> 03:11:15,199
Hey Joe how you doing

4451
03:11:22,623 --> 03:11:24,415
Jarring

4452
03:11:24,671 --> 03:11:30,047
Play the video of her getting shot while Alex Alex

4453
03:11:30,559 --> 03:11:33,887
Trying to play

4454
03:11:34,143 --> 03:11:34,655
Setting up the

4455
03:11:34,911 --> 03:11:35,423
The clap

4456
03:11:35,679 --> 03:11:36,447
And now he's gotten

4457
03:11:36,703 --> 03:11:37,471
Call from Brogan

4458
03:11:37,727 --> 03:11:39,007
He can't not answer

4459
03:11:39,263 --> 03:11:40,799
So he wants to interview Rogan

4460
03:11:41,055 --> 03:11:42,079
Because he has them on speakerphone

4461
03:11:42,335 --> 03:11:43,103
But apparently

4462
03:11:43,615 --> 03:11:44,127
Borrego

4463
03:11:44,383 --> 03:11:44,895
Like in the

4464
03:11:45,151 --> 03:11:46,431
Steve they don't have Rogan

4465
03:11:46,687 --> 03:11:47,455
Call on there

4466
03:11:47,711 --> 03:11:48,991
I think it's probably good

4467
03:11:49,247 --> 03:11:49,759
Because they don't

4468
03:11:50,015 --> 03:11:52,063
Mission permission

4469
03:11:52,319 --> 03:11:53,087
Yeah

4470
03:11:53,599 --> 03:11:54,623
And I'll expect a little

4471
03:12:02,047 --> 03:12:03,839
They're very

4472
03:12:04,095 --> 03:12:04,863
Interesting

4473
03:12:14,847 --> 03:12:20,991
Roll the footage without me talking

4474
03:12:23,039 --> 03:12:23,807
Already played

4475
03:12:25,087 --> 03:12:26,111
I do think that he

4476
03:12:26,367 --> 03:12:28,415
Steam more interested in getting Rogue

4477
03:12:28,671 --> 03:12:29,951
Anthony is in

4478
03:12:30,975 --> 03:12:37,119
Just put it in the Maga murder

4479
03:12:37,375 --> 03:12:39,679
It's going to Galvanize it

4480
03:12:45,311 --> 03:12:47,103
But I got to take a Joe Rogan call real quick

4481
03:12:47,871 --> 03:12:49,151
Joe Rogan I don't know if you know this

4482
03:12:49,407 --> 03:12:49,919
Is

4483
03:12:50,175 --> 03:12:52,223
The comedian so the Maga murder

4484
03:12:52,479 --> 03:12:54,015
Fighting a little Christian devil

4485
03:12:54,527 --> 03:12:57,855
Hero going to practice

4486
03:12:58,111 --> 03:12:59,391
Professional comedian

4487
03:13:00,415 --> 03:13:00,927
So

4488
03:13:01,183 --> 03:13:06,559
Now that is out of the way and he can't get Rogan back on the phone Alex decides fukitol interview Taylor

4489
03:13:07,071 --> 03:13:08,863
I am pretend that I don't know him

4490
03:13:09,119 --> 03:13:11,167
Wild

4491
03:13:11,423 --> 03:13:17,567
Independent journalist and

4492
03:13:17,823 --> 03:13:22,431
He was the first one that actually had a head headed into that Hall I was right behind her

4493
03:13:22,687 --> 03:13:23,455
This is nonsense

4494
03:13:24,223 --> 03:13:26,015
Why are they pretending they don't know each other

4495
03:13:26,527 --> 03:13:28,063
Like literally listen to this

4496
03:13:28,319 --> 03:13:29,855
This is just a little bit later

4497
03:13:40,607 --> 03:13:42,399
Owen and Taylor are clearly for him

4498
03:13:43,679 --> 03:13:44,959
Another hotel room

4499
03:13:45,471 --> 03:13:46,751
It's so bizarre

4500
03:13:47,263 --> 03:13:47,775
So

4501
03:13:48,031 --> 03:13:48,799
Owens

4502
03:13:49,055 --> 03:13:49,567
Thanks Theory

4503
03:13:50,847 --> 03:13:51,359
About

4504
03:13:51,615 --> 03:13:52,127
Spewing

4505
03:13:52,383 --> 03:13:52,895
Of the election

4506
03:13:53,407 --> 03:13:59,551
Sure oh by the way

4507
03:13:59,807 --> 03:14:00,319
Ridiculous dance

4508
03:14:02,879 --> 03:14:04,159
Austin Theory I think that

4509
03:14:04,415 --> 03:14:04,927
Owen

4510
03:14:05,183 --> 03:14:05,695
Suspect

4511
03:14:06,463 --> 03:14:07,743
Set the Communist Chinese

4512
03:14:07,999 --> 03:14:09,535
Are going through an elaborate

4513
03:14:09,791 --> 03:14:10,303
Conspiracy

4514
03:14:10,559 --> 03:14:11,071
Just to make

4515
03:14:11,327 --> 03:14:12,095
Make him mad

4516
03:14:30,783 --> 03:14:32,319
Get this

4517
03:14:39,231 --> 03:14:39,743
Yeah man

4518
03:14:40,511 --> 03:14:43,839
That's pretty

4519
03:14:44,095 --> 03:14:45,375
Understand correctly the globalist

4520
03:14:45,887 --> 03:14:46,399
Both

4521
03:14:47,167 --> 03:14:48,959
Made the election look

4522
03:14:49,471 --> 03:14:50,239
Like they stole

4523
03:14:50,495 --> 03:14:54,591
While at the same time actually spend making the election

4524
03:14:54,847 --> 03:14:55,359
Look

4525
03:14:55,615 --> 03:14:56,639
As though we're close

4526
03:14:56,895 --> 03:14:58,943
Well at the same time

4527
03:14:59,199 --> 03:14:59,967
Julie Steele

4528
03:15:00,223 --> 03:15:01,759
Yes and they wanted to make a close

4529
03:15:02,015 --> 03:15:02,783
Because they knew

4530
03:15:03,039 --> 03:15:04,063
Wasn't close it wouldn't

4531
03:15:04,319 --> 03:15:06,111
Anger people like

4532
03:15:06,367 --> 03:15:08,415
And it had to be obvious that it was stolen

4533
03:15:08,671 --> 03:15:10,719
Because I would also pissed off

4534
03:15:10,975 --> 03:15:13,535
Come from behind Victory cuz it was one of those gut punch losses

4535
03:15:13,791 --> 03:15:19,935
Cuz you know it's like to come narcissistic knockout my beloved

4536
03:15:20,191 --> 03:15:22,495
Bullseye imagining

4537
03:15:23,263 --> 03:15:25,311
She is just sitting around and being like

4538
03:15:28,895 --> 03:15:30,431
He's not going to like this one

4539
03:15:31,199 --> 03:15:32,991
Sobeida they covered Trump's

4540
03:15:33,247 --> 03:15:34,015
Video

4541
03:15:34,271 --> 03:15:35,295
Oh that he put out

4542
03:15:35,551 --> 03:15:36,319
Guessing you saw that

4543
03:15:36,831 --> 03:15:38,367
Where you called everyone special

4544
03:15:38,623 --> 03:15:44,255

New cover that but it

4551
03:15:54,239 --> 03:15:55,519
It's basically exactly what you would expect

4552
03:15:56,031 --> 03:15:57,311
Only thing that I find shocking

4553
03:15:57,567 --> 03:15:58,079
King is

4554
03:15:58,335 --> 03:16:00,639

Iwan tompo

4558
03:16:05,247 --> 03:16:05,759

4559
03:16:06,271 --> 03:16:07,295
This tweet listen to this

4560
03:16:07,551 --> 03:16:08,063
Tommy's

4561
03:16:10,111 --> 03:16:14,719
Now we just have a a breaking tweet from the president President Trump

4562
03:16:14,975 --> 03:16:15,487

03:16:15,743 --> 03:16:17,279

03:16:21,631 --> 03:16:22,911
President Donald Trump breaking

4567
03:16:23,167 --> 03:16:25,215
These are the things and events that happen

4568
03:16:25,471 --> 03:16:28,031
When a sacred Landslide election victory

4569
03:16:28,287 --> 03:16:30,079
She's so unceremoniously

4570
03:16:30,335 --> 03:16:33,151
And viciously Stripped Away from great Patriots

4571
03:16:33,407 --> 03:16:36,735
Who have been badly and unfairly treated for so long

4572
03:16:37,247 --> 03:16:40,831
Culpeper to she believes all that stuff

4573
03:16:43,903 --> 03:16:45,439
How is it 84 agent

4574
03:16:45,951 --> 03:16:46,463
I got the camp

4575
03:16:47,231 --> 03:16:48,255
I don't know if

4576
03:16:48,511 --> 03:16:52,351
It's all just like whatever we'll figure it out tomorrow that you all of it

4577
03:16:52,607 --> 03:16:54,655
100% throw it all out there.

4578
03:16:54,911 --> 03:16:55,423
And then we'll pick some

4579
03:16:55,935 --> 03:16:56,959
Stick with tomorrow

4580
03:16:57,215 --> 03:17:00,287
And this point how shameful that's all

4581
03:17:00,543 --> 03:17:01,311
I know it's

4582
03:17:01,823 --> 03:17:02,591
We're on

4583
03:17:02,847 --> 03:17:05,919
Send 10,000 but I mean really fourth anniversary

4584
03:17:06,943 --> 03:17:07,967
F***** up

4585
03:17:08,991 --> 03:17:09,759
Crazy

4586
03:17:10,271 --> 03:17:11,039
So

4587
03:17:11,807 --> 03:17:12,319
Alex

4588
03:17:12,575 --> 03:17:13,343
Really

4589
03:17:13,599 --> 03:17:14,367
Trying to push

4590
03:17:14,623 --> 03:17:15,903
Homeless idea

4591
03:17:16,415 --> 03:17:17,439
That the woman

4592
03:17:17,695 --> 03:17:18,463
Who got shot

4593
03:17:18,719 --> 03:17:19,999
Is going to be covered up by the meat

4594
03:17:20,767 --> 03:17:21,535
The media is not going to talk

4595
03:17:22,047 --> 03:17:23,327
Just going to pretend that didn't happen

4596
03:17:23,583 --> 03:17:24,351
Because it's too.

4597
03:17:24,607 --> 03:17:25,631
Threatening to the global

4598
03:17:26,655 --> 03:17:29,471
Because she's a martyr for the cause of the Patriots

4599
03:17:29,727 --> 03:17:34,335
It's in the revolution I'm sorry I would love to hear more about her but I got to take this call Joe Joe Rogan is cool

4600
03:17:34,591 --> 03:17:36,639
No I know I care about the Martyr

4601
03:17:59,679 --> 03:18:03,519
By this point peopleready

4602
03:18:04,287 --> 03:18:05,823
Define we know where she lives

4603
03:18:06,079 --> 03:18:10,431
That other voices Ali Alexander

4604
03:18:10,943 --> 03:18:13,247
Drunk after a f******

4605
03:18:13,503 --> 03:18:14,271
Boat parade

4606
03:18:14,527 --> 03:18:16,063
That is what's happening

4607
03:18:16,575 --> 03:18:17,343
These people are f******

4608
03:18:17,599 --> 03:18:18,111
Stupid

4609
03:18:18,367 --> 03:18:19,135
It does seem that way

4610
03:18:19,391 --> 03:18:21,951
So Alex tries to sign off here cuz he's

4611
03:18:22,463 --> 03:18:23,743
Used

4612
03:18:24,511 --> 03:18:25,023
Took a little walk

4613
03:18:25,791 --> 03:18:29,887
Leading a parade earlier I know it's hard to remember that happened on this episode

4614
03:18:31,167 --> 03:18:33,215
But then I got to be signing off

4615
03:18:33,471 --> 03:18:36,031
And they seem like they really care

4616
03:18:36,287 --> 03:18:37,311
About this woman who got

4617
03:18:45,759 --> 03:18:46,527
The federal police

4618
03:18:55,231 --> 03:18:57,279
What's going on here

4619
03:18:57,791 --> 03:18:58,559
What is

4620
03:18:59,071 --> 03:19:02,143
Is full of empathy for their common person

4621
03:19:02,399 --> 03:19:03,423
The fellow

4622
03:19:04,191 --> 03:19:07,007
Alex is signing off but he throws it to Owen

4623
03:19:07,519 --> 03:19:08,543
To wrap it up

4624
03:19:09,055 --> 03:19:14,943
Cuz I still got a little time by the war room or something

4625
03:19:15,199 --> 03:19:15,967
10 minutes of this ship

4626
03:19:17,759 --> 03:19:18,527
Is

4627
03:19:18,783 --> 03:19:19,295
Gone

4628
03:19:20,319 --> 03:19:22,367
Theoretically that Owen tries to get rich

4629
03:19:22,623 --> 03:19:23,135
What is about like

4630
03:19:23,903 --> 03:19:24,671
What do we call the

4631
03:19:24,927 --> 03:19:26,719
Call what

4632
03:19:32,607 --> 03:19:35,935
WeedMaps

4633
03:19:43,871 --> 03:19:46,943
Don't you you are the bad guy

4634
03:19:47,455 --> 03:19:49,247
Sweet

4635
03:19:49,759 --> 03:19:50,271
Wait did you do

4636
03:19:50,527 --> 03:19:52,831
Barge back in town

4637
03:19:53,087 --> 03:19:54,111
Don't like it when you

4638
03:19:54,367 --> 03:19:54,879
You push back

4639
03:19:55,135 --> 03:19:55,903
What

4640
03:19:56,159 --> 03:19:56,671
The problem

4641
03:19:56,927 --> 03:20:01,279
Violent revolution but look stupid and they can't make money off of

4642
03:20:02,303 --> 03:20:03,327
Now we're

4643
03:20:06,399 --> 03:20:12,543
It's no good Revolution to be nonviolent for them they want to they want to play a video game

4644
03:20:12,799 --> 03:20:14,079
Demon god mode they don't want to ask

4645
03:20:14,335 --> 03:20:18,175
It's just like f****** democracy we live in a republic but I don't want to risk

4646
03:20:18,431 --> 03:20:19,199
Losing intellect

4647
03:20:19,711 --> 03:20:23,807
Sure you know like you were any of the majority how I can't stand that but I mean

4648
03:20:24,319 --> 03:20:25,599
The old wants to wrap up

4649
03:20:25,855 --> 03:20:27,903
Now cuz he was only supposed to say a few more things

4650
03:20:28,415 --> 03:20:29,695
How about small bladder

4651
03:20:40,191 --> 03:20:42,751
President Trump was on the phone with Mike

4652
03:20:48,127 --> 03:20:50,431
I got some more weapons are getting executed

4653
03:21:02,975 --> 03:21:04,255
I got two more witnesses

4654
03:21:05,279 --> 03:21:08,351
So and tries to interview these people

4655
03:21:08,863 --> 03:21:09,887
It turns out they're not so much weight

4656
03:21:25,247 --> 03:21:26,015
I mean

4657
03:21:26,527 --> 03:21:28,063
It was kind of monium their ads

4658
03:21:28,319 --> 03:21:28,831
Yeah

4659
03:21:29,087 --> 03:21:35,231
Assume so wild

4660
03:21:35,487 --> 03:21:35,999
Say

4661
03:21:36,255 --> 03:21:37,279
Also unfortunate

4662
03:21:37,535 --> 03:21:38,559
You guys have put yourself

4663
03:21:38,815 --> 03:21:41,119
In a place you were not legally supposed to have been

4664
03:21:41,631 --> 03:21:43,423
And pizza

4665
03:21:43,679 --> 03:21:44,959
Witnesses there right wing

4666
03:21:45,215 --> 03:21:46,239
Blog types

4667
03:21:46,495 --> 03:21:48,031
One of them is Lucy in winter

4668
03:21:48,543 --> 03:21:51,871
Who's the former White House correspondent working at the Gateway pundit

4669
03:21:52,127 --> 03:21:54,431
And somebody who's been on Infowars a bunch of the past

4670
03:21:54,943 --> 03:22:01,087
There's no way that Alex and Owen don't know who he is yet they're pretending that they don't know each other it's just a random person

4671
03:22:01,343 --> 03:22:01,855
Shooting

4672
03:22:02,367 --> 03:22:04,671
So bizarre that no one knows each other

4673
03:22:05,183 --> 03:22:09,791
Also the other guy his name is Matthew Foster I have no idea who he is but you probably should have

4674
03:22:14,655 --> 03:22:19,263
We were in there when the two together wild guess what you committed a crime

4675
03:22:20,031 --> 03:22:20,543
Welcome

4676
03:22:21,055 --> 03:22:22,079
ISO

4677
03:22:22,847 --> 03:22:24,383
Lot of people making these investigations

4678
03:22:24,639 --> 03:22:28,223
Pretty easy really don't understand that

4679
03:22:28,479 --> 03:22:29,247
They're wrong

4680
03:22:29,759 --> 03:22:30,271
And that

4681
03:22:30,527 --> 03:22:33,087
Crime is real if they do it

4682
03:22:33,343 --> 03:22:34,879
Yeah yeah yeah

4683
03:22:35,391 --> 03:22:37,695
I don't think white people can Revolt in the United

4684
03:22:37,951 --> 03:22:39,999
Stay there too goddamn and title

4685
03:22:40,255 --> 03:22:42,303
Funeral exerted on violin

4686
03:22:42,815 --> 03:22:46,911
Civil disobedience is the recognition that they will be

4687
03:22:47,935 --> 03:22:49,471
And you will have to bear those concert

4688
03:22:49,983 --> 03:22:50,751
That's part of it

4689
03:22:51,263 --> 03:22:56,639
Yellow like if you're doing something where you invade the Senate chamber and you do a sit-in or something like that

4690
03:22:56,895 --> 03:23:01,503
You recognize that there are consequences legally for that cuz what you're doing is

4691
03:23:01,759 --> 03:23:02,527
Technically legal

4692
03:23:03,039 --> 03:23:04,319
Answer these guys

4693
03:23:04,831 --> 03:23:08,415
I have decided to engage in some form of

4694
03:23:08,927 --> 03:23:11,231
The protest that they feel is appropriate

4695
03:23:11,487 --> 03:23:17,631
They have committed crimes and now they will have the bear that supposed to be illegal and I'm not supposed to be punished

4696
03:23:17,887 --> 03:23:24,031
I appreciate your feelings Lucien but there's a great guy

4697
03:23:24,287 --> 03:23:29,663
Look I'm the good guys because they stole election I'm good

4698
03:23:31,199 --> 03:23:31,711
Where Alex

4699
03:23:32,223 --> 03:23:32,991
Encourages Trump

4700
03:23:33,503 --> 03:23:34,783
Do use This Woman's death

4701
03:23:35,295 --> 03:23:36,063
As a web

4702
03:23:37,087 --> 03:23:40,927
I'm going to call Jennifer

4703
03:23:45,791 --> 03:23:47,839
Police attack Folks at pushed back a little

03:23:49,887 --> 03:23:50,911
But you don't shoot

4705
03:23:54,495 --> 03:23:56,287
Everything right now

4706
03:24:01,407 --> 03:24:03,711
South African take over and I'm going to go to work tonight

4707
03:24:04,223 --> 03:24:05,759
Call enforcers Bella president

4708
03:24:06,015 --> 03:24:06,783
Don't talk on this

4709
03:24:07,039 --> 03:24:07,807
Call the offense

4710
03:24:08,319 --> 03:24:09,087
Don't talk on it

4711
03:24:09,599 --> 03:24:15,743
Later in the evening Alex did a report about how like a pencils going to invoke the 25th Amendment

4712
03:24:15,999 --> 03:24:19,327
Taking pappert imaginations Arizona

4713
03:24:20,351 --> 03:24:21,119
And by that point

4714
03:24:21,375 --> 03:24:25,727
You still is unaware of what this lady's name is don't care to

4715
03:24:27,519 --> 03:24:28,799
Involved

4716
03:24:29,055 --> 03:24:29,567
1

4717
03:24:29,823 --> 03:24:30,335
Skill

4718
03:24:31,103 --> 03:24:31,615
That

4719
03:24:31,871 --> 03:24:32,639
Donald Trump

4720
03:24:33,663 --> 03:24:34,431
Absolutely does not

4721
03:24:35,711 --> 03:24:36,223
It is getting

4722
03:24:36,479 --> 03:24:36,991
Sing people to

4723
03:24:37,247 --> 03:24:37,759
Care about

4724
03:24:39,295 --> 03:24:40,063
That is true

4725
03:24:40,319 --> 03:24:41,343
So if you are a

4726
03:24:41,599 --> 03:24:45,695
Asking Donald Trump if you're asking Donald Trump to s*** all over her for being dead

4727
03:24:45,951 --> 03:24:48,767
That failing in her Mission power do you want that presently

4728
03:24:49,023 --> 03:24:54,399
If you wanted to go on TV and say he loves insurrectionists who don't get shot by the cops

4729
03:24:54,655 --> 03:24:58,751
Sure you can get that yeah he is skilled at that

4730
03:24:59,007 --> 03:25:00,287
Anybody being a martyr

4731
03:25:00,799 --> 03:25:01,311
But Trump

4732
03:25:02,591 --> 03:25:03,871
Yeah in Arabic

4733
03:25:04,383 --> 03:25:06,431
Stop personally involve him I don't think

4734
03:25:06,943 --> 03:25:07,711
I don't think he would care

4735
03:25:08,223 --> 03:25:08,735
You don't give a s***

4736
03:25:11,551 --> 03:25:13,855
Watched all this I lived inside this

4737
03:25:14,367 --> 03:25:16,159
I bet it was really weird

4738
03:25:16,415 --> 03:25:17,951
Because I was experiencing a lot of stuff

4739
03:25:18,207 --> 03:25:18,719
If that was like

4740
03:25:19,231 --> 03:25:19,999
What everyone else was

4741
03:25:20,255 --> 03:25:22,047
Experience again and reality-based

4742
03:25:22,559 --> 03:25:24,863
At the same time I was seeing

4743
03:25:25,119 --> 03:25:26,143
And I'm paying

4744
03:25:26,399 --> 03:25:27,167
Engine to the

4745
03:25:28,447 --> 03:25:30,751
Amanda and what-have-you on Infowars

4746
03:25:32,287 --> 03:25:33,055
Between the two is

4747
03:25:33,311 --> 03:25:34,079
Is staggering yeah

4748
03:25:34,591 --> 03:25:35,103
And

4749
03:25:35,359 --> 03:25:36,127
Really

4750
03:25:36,895 --> 03:25:37,407
I mean

4751
03:25:37,919 --> 03:25:38,431
Lack of

4752
03:25:39,199 --> 03:25:39,967
Talent

4753
03:25:40,223 --> 03:25:42,527
Aside because he had people like pappert than

4754
03:25:43,039 --> 03:25:44,063
And Harrison

4755
03:25:44,575 --> 03:25:45,599
Who just aren't good at this

4756
03:25:46,111 --> 03:25:47,647
Aside

4757
03:25:48,159 --> 03:25:49,951
There was a noticeable

4758
03:25:51,743 --> 03:25:52,255
Rakim

4759
03:25:53,023 --> 03:25:54,047
To trying to figure out what

4760
03:25:54,303 --> 03:25:55,583
To do how do never this

4761
03:25:56,095 --> 03:25:56,863
And then there was

4762
03:25:57,119 --> 03:25:58,143
A singularity

4763
03:25:58,399 --> 03:25:58,911
Purpose

4764
03:25:59,167 --> 03:25:59,935
That Alex had

4765
03:26:00,447 --> 03:26:02,239
That I really felt as I was a

4766
03:26:02,495 --> 03:26:03,263
Coming to this

4767
03:26:03,519 --> 03:26:04,031
Fit that

4768
03:26:04,287 --> 03:26:04,799
Idea that

4769
03:26:05,055 --> 03:26:05,823
He's trying to create

4770
03:26:06,079 --> 03:26:07,103
Patriot lure

4771
03:26:07,359 --> 03:26:08,383
He's trying to create

4772
03:26:08,639 --> 03:26:10,943
A mess out of this that is

4773
03:26:11,455 --> 03:26:12,479
This woman was murdered

4774
03:26:12,735 --> 03:26:14,015
For the cause

4775
03:26:14,271 --> 03:26:20,415
To make us look bad sugar antifa probably agitated

4776
03:26:20,671 --> 03:26:22,207
We were right to do the yeah

4777
03:26:22,463 --> 03:26:22,975
Incase

4778
03:26:26,303 --> 03:26:26,815
Yeah yeah

4779
03:26:27,071 --> 03:26:28,095
I just I felt

4780
03:26:28,351 --> 03:26:28,863
The

4781
03:26:29,887 --> 03:26:30,911
First pages

4782
03:26:31,423 --> 03:26:31,935
Of

4783
03:26:32,191 --> 03:26:32,703
Narrative

4784
03:26:32,959 --> 03:26:34,751
And first pages of things

4785
03:26:35,007 --> 03:26:35,775
They will affect

4786
03:26:36,031 --> 03:26:36,799
People

4787
03:26:37,055 --> 03:26:39,103
Down the road beer Ali and cries

4788
03:26:39,359 --> 03:26:39,871
4 people

4789
03:26:41,151 --> 03:26:42,943
Infant truck that weighs I hope that

4790
03:26:43,199 --> 03:26:44,479
That's not the case but that is

4791
03:26:44,735 --> 03:26:45,503
General sense of what

4792
03:26:46,015 --> 03:26:46,527
I felt Alex's

4793
03:26:46,783 --> 03:26:47,295
Intentions were

4794
03:26:47,551 --> 03:26:48,319
No

4795
03:26:48,831 --> 03:26:51,391
Same time everybody else around him is working across purpose

4796
03:26:51,647 --> 03:26:53,695
Everyone else I have no idea what the

4797
03:26:53,951 --> 03:26:54,463
They're doing

4798
03:26:56,255 --> 03:26:57,023
Insane

4799
03:26:57,279 --> 03:26:59,583
Harrison Smith seems like a True Believer

4800
03:26:59,839 --> 03:27:00,863
Owen Shroyer

4801
03:27:01,375 --> 03:27:02,143
What's the difference

4802
03:27:02,399 --> 03:27:03,423
Somewhere between just being

4803
03:27:03,679 --> 03:27:05,983
Angry and also wanting to

4804
03:27:06,239 --> 03:27:08,799
Make Daddy so happy so he's like

4805
03:27:09,055 --> 03:27:12,383
I want to kill everybody but also Daddy needs money so I'm going to back off

4806
03:27:12,639 --> 03:27:18,783
Cuz he said so but I do want to kill everybody and also I've recently realized that I'm pretty good at stand-up comedy

4807
03:27:19,039 --> 03:27:21,343
I got one B give me 15

4808
03:27:21,599 --> 03:27:27,231
Facebook I'm unemployable if Infowars goes away self-employed as a comic maybe that's where the money is

4809
03:27:27,487 --> 03:27:28,767
I would go another

4810
03:27:29,023 --> 03:27:30,047
Joe he made

4811
03:27:30,303 --> 03:27:34,399
Millions doing stand-up I go on tour with Nick DiPaolo

4812
03:27:35,679 --> 03:27:36,447
Everything's going to be alright

4813
03:27:36,703 --> 03:27:37,215
I'm going to

4814
03:27:37,471 --> 03:27:38,751
Middle for Rob Schneider

4815
03:27:40,543 --> 03:27:42,847
I think that we've taken a bit of a

4816
03:27:43,871 --> 03:27:45,151
Leonardo Maybe

4817
03:27:46,175 --> 03:27:47,199
A lighter tone

4818
03:27:48,223 --> 03:27:49,503
Maybe

4819
03:27:49,759 --> 03:27:55,391
Some people would feel and maybe I later than I feel it time

4820
03:27:55,647 --> 03:27:57,439
It's just we're looking to Dallas

4821
03:27:57,951 --> 03:27:59,999
Yeah this is this is this is scary

4822
03:28:00,255 --> 03:28:00,767
But he's also

4823
03:28:01,023 --> 03:28:02,815
F****** idiot idiotic

4824
03:28:03,071 --> 03:28:03,583
Right

4825
03:28:03,839 --> 03:28:04,351
And

4826
03:28:05,119 --> 03:28:06,911
Yeah I mean

4827
03:28:07,167 --> 03:28:08,703
I'm in a place I feel

4828
03:28:10,495 --> 03:28:12,031
Bye

4829
03:28:13,055 --> 03:28:14,079
Coming at this from a

4830
03:28:14,335 --> 03:28:15,871
Completely different point of view

4831
03:28:16,127 --> 03:28:16,895
Then every

4832
03:28:17,663 --> 03:28:23,807
And it freaks me out I feel a little insane because I have never felt more confident that we are not going to be over

4833
03:28:24,063 --> 03:28:24,575
Throne

4834
03:28:25,087 --> 03:28:28,927
Because the reality of actually overthrowing the United States

4835
03:28:29,439 --> 03:28:29,951
Is that

4836
03:28:30,463 --> 03:28:32,255
You would have to have the military on your side

4837
03:28:32,767 --> 03:28:37,375
And the most important thing about the military is that it is an arm of the economy

4838
03:28:38,399 --> 03:28:38,911
And

4839
03:28:39,167 --> 03:28:39,935
There's no way

4840
03:28:40,191 --> 03:28:41,215
That the economy

4841
03:28:41,471 --> 03:28:43,007
He's going to be collapsed by those

4842
03:28:44,543 --> 03:28:45,311
And there's no way

4843
03:28:45,567 --> 03:28:49,407
With the military leadership who could that mean it's entirely conceivable

4844
03:28:49,663 --> 03:28:52,223
That that could have that a coup could have

4845
03:28:52,479 --> 03:28:54,271
If it was

4846
03:28:54,527 --> 03:28:55,295
Plan appropriately

4847
03:28:55,551 --> 03:28:58,879
If the military saw signals that this is actually some real s***

4848
03:28:59,135 --> 03:29:00,159
If Trump

4849
03:29:00,415 --> 03:29:04,767
Didn't f****** run away like a coward and if politicians

4850
03:29:05,023 --> 03:29:07,839
If the right-wing politicians who were all up in arms about

4851
03:29:08,863 --> 03:29:09,887
Doing anything like that

4852
03:29:10,143 --> 03:29:11,423
If they joined the rally

4853
03:29:11,935 --> 03:29:13,471
I all bets could be off

4854
03:29:13,983 --> 03:29:15,519
But everybody who's in Port

4855
03:29:16,287 --> 03:29:17,055
In terms of

4856
03:29:17,311 --> 03:29:18,335
Running the world

4857
03:29:18,847 --> 03:29:21,151
Saw those people do that s*** and went

4858
03:29:22,431 --> 03:29:22,943
They did it

4859
03:29:23,199 --> 03:29:23,967
Too soon

4860
03:29:24,223 --> 03:29:27,295
They blew their wad too early and now they're an embarrassment

4861
03:29:27,551 --> 03:29:31,903
Yeah I see where you're coming from and I think that I can agree on the

4862
03:29:32,159 --> 03:29:32,671
Thunder

4863
03:29:32,927 --> 03:29:33,695
Sort of shorts

4864
03:29:34,207 --> 03:29:38,047
Fear the fear is the logger scale the lessons

4865
03:29:38,303 --> 03:29:42,399
I can be learned by the very serious people chew or who are among these

4866
03:29:43,167 --> 03:29:43,935
Ding dongs

4867
03:29:44,191 --> 03:29:44,703
The lesson

4868
03:29:44,959 --> 03:29:45,727
You can take

4869
03:29:45,983 --> 03:29:46,751
Take from this

4870
03:29:47,007 --> 03:29:48,031
The image

4871
03:29:49,567 --> 03:29:51,871
You know these people flying Confederate flags

4872
03:29:52,127 --> 03:29:53,407
Evading the

4873
03:29:55,455 --> 03:29:57,247
It is Meaningful from an optic

4874
03:29:57,503 --> 03:29:58,015
6th and point

4875
03:29:58,271 --> 03:29:59,039
It's emboldening

4876
03:29:59,551 --> 03:30:00,831
Enter even if it doesn't

4877
03:30:01,087 --> 03:30:01,599
Encourage

4878
03:30:02,111 --> 03:30:02,623
Actual

4879
03:30:03,391 --> 03:30:04,159
Cacu

4880
03:30:04,671 --> 03:30:06,975
Those are the sorts of imagery in the

4881
03:30:07,231 --> 03:30:08,255
It's sort of things that you would

4882
03:30:09,535 --> 03:30:10,559
Inspire people to take

4883
03:30:10,815 --> 03:30:11,839
Other kinds of Acts

4884
03:30:12,095 --> 03:30:12,863
Right

4885
03:30:13,119 --> 03:30:13,887
Destructive

4886
03:30:14,399 --> 03:30:15,935
I don't know I don't know

4887
03:30:16,191 --> 03:30:20,543
Let's let's let's not go crazy at the club

4888
03:30:20,799 --> 03:30:24,639
But I hope everyone is doing all right out there we will

4889
03:30:24,895 --> 03:30:25,919
Find out what happened

4890
03:30:26,431 --> 03:30:27,455
After this

4891
03:30:27,967 --> 03:30:31,039
On Monday we'll figure out whatever I decided

4892
03:30:31,295 --> 03:30:33,087
Maybe it wasn't maybe it's not

4893
03:30:33,855 --> 03:30:36,159
I will see if by the next day Alex

4894
03:30:36,415 --> 03:30:36,927
Figured out

4895
03:30:37,183 --> 03:30:37,695
Who this woman

4896
03:30:37,951 --> 03:30:38,463
Was

4897
03:30:41,535 --> 03:30:42,047
How about that

4898
03:30:45,119 --> 03:30:51,263
