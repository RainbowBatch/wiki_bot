1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan pipes sweat it

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of him posing as if they're the good guy

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

4
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

6
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,840
Little bit about Alex Jones

7
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,424
Authority

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,080
Shut up

9
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,688
Keep bringing that up excessively

10
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
Jordan is inside Jordana Brewster

11
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Movie

12
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,696
No that's Soleil Moon Frye

13
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
All right so that's

14
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
No

15
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
Let someone else

16
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Fantastic

17
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:49,056
Shoes in the thrilling adventure hour she's she's in

18
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:54,688
Controls the universe come on you ask yourself a question

19
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
I was thinking about this

20
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,600
Cuz of news of the day have you ever had a conflict of

21
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
Supposed to be theater back in my younger days I was friends

22
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Some of the employees

23
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,728
Adventurous

24
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,104
People who are you

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
Who's your friend

26
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,224
Friendly relations

27
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Projectionists

28
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:35,136
Alongside these people that got promoted to manager

29
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,720
CR 2 weeks ago I was just

30
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:45,888
I never really got that bad

31
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,192
Crisis of conflict of interest

32
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:53,056
But certainly a thirty-five-year-old man now I can look back on

33
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,152
How I behaved as a nineteen-year-old the movie theater manager

34
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,552
I can say I probably was far more people differently

35
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
My friend never got to never fired anybody or

36
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
Or did anything like that

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Just because I didn't like

38
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,328
Somebody but

39
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:24,800
The idea that likes

40
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
3 people who weren't even

41
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Out of college

42
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
Age without a general manager for a

43
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,296
Couple months stretch

44
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
Showtime

45
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,160
Bizarre

46
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
That's great you guys are like hiring at firms

47
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
Get Don Draper pitching you sit

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,984
Brother made a corporate level reordering

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
King supplies and electronics

50
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
The companies

51
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Play

52
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
It was a lot of admin it might have been

53
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,696
Or we can just burn it down Loki they might have been

54
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
Challenge

55
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Take that

56
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
Is the other conflict of interest was like

57
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Corporate

58
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
Let's see that's pretty

59
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
Google manager

60
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:35,455
I know a little bit about Alex Jones

61
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,527
Of the show

62
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:43,903
Little bit of an apology maybe I'm not

63
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
Entirely sure if it qualifies as

64
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:53,119
We got a present a episodes in a row

65
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
And I should give an explanation for

66
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,471
Everybody likes it when I'm dumb

67
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
You know it's

68
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,847
Is fun to celebrate when I do something dumb

69
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:09,247
My mind that's the last 2013

70
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
Episode that we had.

71
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Was the night

72
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,463
So when I sat down to prepare today's episode

73
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
Bailey

74
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,239
I'm so unprepared the wrong episode so obviously

75
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,055
Record we didn't have the

76
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,127
The right episode ready

77
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
We've got ready for you

78
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
Angela

79
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,391
Is Friday of last week real fun date to look into and check

80
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
I was because

81
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
The night before

82
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Thursday

83
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,423
For his rally

84
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:04,287
No.

85
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
He's a pretty

86
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Pretty messy

87
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:21,439
So first of all I apologize

88
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,023
Aimh

89
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,423
I'm a policy wonk

90
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
She ran out

91
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,855
I'm a policy

92
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
Maps

93
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,231
I'm a policy wonk

94
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,791
And finally

95
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,447
So just thank you so much you are now a technocrat

96
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,479
Money off at heroin

97
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,319
Freakishly large

98
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
Appreciate

99
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,895
You have been looking at me like I'm a little bit loopy

100
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:51,295
I don't recall looking at you like that baby maybe I'm just getting that since because

101
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:56,159
I might actually be a little I think we might both be

102
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
Tough night sleep last night so that

103
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:03,327
And you yourself do yourself for loopy battle Factory

104
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Let's Ride the Lightning

105
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,031
Alex

106
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Almost

107
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
Feeling like I'm peachment probably going to happen

108
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
If it's going to happen

109
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,855
We buy we weirdo friends

110
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415
Have to start dealing with what happened next

111
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
I don't want to know

112
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
Definitely

113
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
Trying

114
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
Remove the president

115
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Right now

116
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Yeah no s***

117
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
The aftermath

118
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Especially remove him

119
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
A lot of nationalist

120
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Conservative

121
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Christians

122
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
President

123
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,015
Tell you what

124
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
Subject today

125
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
Mario

126
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,439
Stories that

127
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
Trubbish

128
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,887
So you can see Alex has now started to recognize the shift in drudges coverage

129
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
Dare you acknowledge reality

130
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,871
How dare you say that break the fourth wall. Recognize reality

131
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Too much

132
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Too close to home

133
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,319
Is stories in order to wake up Trump

134
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,647
So he's still living in a little bit of a delusional

135
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
Hedge it as like

136
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,631
Drudge it's still a hundred percent on the don't worry about it

137
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
That's why all these that he's right-wing blogs

138
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Publications

139
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,615
Going through the motions of like had we lost.

140
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
Hairs

141
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Anyway

142
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
If you think the Trump is invented

143
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
You live in a damp

144
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
You're right

145
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,975
He later gives one example of a person who he thinks

146
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,583
Thinks Trump is invincible

147
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,167
I'll give you one hint

148
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
He was dating

149
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,079
Jesse James

150
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,687
Jesse James is apparently he thinks the truck as a vegetable

151
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
So that's good

152
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:34,879
Transitive property that alphabounces words

153
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,951
You know a lot of conservatives live in bubbles

154
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
But you know who doesn't

155
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
Alex Azar

156
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
Not as much

157
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Insane asylum

158
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Sure

159
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:03,039
They do love their own Bible sometimes

160
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
At work

161
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
Nationalist Christian

162
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,975
Patriots

163
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,143
That's your issue literally something that he is said

164
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,543
Over and over and over again you are bad if you do not believe in an hour

165
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,871
About how God is the only way to defeat the global right

166
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:33,759
Event tents sermon

167
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,999
Alex Jones also by the way

168
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
Because it's still saying that like if you don't have the same religious beliefs as me that's your issue as if

169
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
Problem

170
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,223
Christian Cooper

171
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,575
Applied within the the phone

172
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
Which is great

173
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
Love it

174
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Is it Trump

175
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
Like his rhetoric

176
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
I mean I don't know how you describe it

177
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
Bye

178
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:28,799
Did you get Lionel stores

179
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,831
Read his golf course

180
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
Really

181
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Did what

182
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
That's not breakfast

183
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
You talk about

184
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
Sure

185
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Play Store

186
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
Swiss cheese

187
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
Shut up roadside

188
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
Money got funding for new rugs

189
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
You wouldn't say all the other cow

190
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
Position

191
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
Total power grab the country

192
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,943
Short up power dishwasher

193
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,503
Russian Victory absolutely

194
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Alex

195
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
I believe that

196
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,879
Crushing victory that would be

197
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
Interesting idea about the Customs and Border Patrol is being ugly

198
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
Hundreds of miles of fence

199
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:59,167
And that's why there's no more fence being felt because I know

200
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,775
Build the wall

201
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:10,175
On August 30th 2019 PolitiFact

202
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,831
Seeing as it was one of the two main things that people chanted at Trump rallies in the run-up to the 2016 elections

203
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:23,231
To be effective

204
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
Prison for about 3 years

205
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
To see how he's doing with the other

206
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,967
Before Trump took office there was about 654 miles of primary barrier along the wall like sensor

207
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
Now three years later

208
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
No additional miles have been built

209
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,879
Is replacing a

210
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,439
Approximately 60 miles of fence

211
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,279
Hundreds of miles that Alex is referring to the need to be replaced

212
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
But sexy

213
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,399
Customs and Border Protection it received 6.2 billion dollars

214
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
To supposedly build state-of-the-art

215
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
But none of it has actually been built

216
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
Alex should be against this because it's in

217
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
Third level of financial malfeasance

218
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,151
But also because a lot of that money

219
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,711
Those billions of dollars

220
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,527
A lot of it came from the treasury forfeiture fund

221
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,879
Do you know the money that's taken for people when they're arrested or seized by the IRS

222
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,207
Really thought he was super against that

223
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,023
Oh well

224
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
Strange bedfellows

225
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,655
What are you going to do

226
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,519
As we discussed a number of times even if Trump wanted to make this wall he legitimately couldn't

227
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:45,407
The Border runs across a lot of private property the owners of witches that they're not interested in

228
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,759
Be built on their property so you need to have all kinds of eminent domain cases that

229
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
It just never would work out

230
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:56,415
And that's not even to mention the 118 miles of border that inside Big Bend National Park

231
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
Could you get never get approval

232
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
How to build a wall

233
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,815
Allocate billions of dollars to fix

234
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
The couple of miles of fencing I guess that's his prerogative

235
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,959
If you do that you're setting the bar insanely low

236
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,031
But you're supposed to be this overpowered conquering Weider

237
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,383
I really read but he's considering this a victory

238
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
To be some sort of

239
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
Rhetorical referee

240
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,527
To have jumped in the moment he said that with a whistle and just

241
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:27,135
Moving the goalposts remove 10 minutes from your shop

242
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Jumpers in Dallas

243
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
Because he's down there to scout locations

244
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,959
Alex

245
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
He speaks about

246
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
Briefly that

247
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,151
We're at the big Trump rally in Dallas last night

248
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Spoiler alert

249
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
He does not

250
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,319
It was a shark

251
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
And I

252
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
A bunch of the security group

253
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
Armored vehicle

254
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,895
I don't know it's weird

255
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
Play The Fray

256
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,063
Rolling around in

257
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,439
Factors root part of the very exciting

258
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
To see Alex appearing kind of like what you would expect his career

259
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
It just makes sense

260
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
8fit

261
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
Don't feel like it's okay

262
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Using a

263
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,503
And iterations of tyranny Crusher in the very representation of today

264
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
Around supporter

265
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
It's not really a tank

266
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,679
It's sort of an armed and armored Hummer

267
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Describing with a roof

268
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:22,335
Doesn't appear to have

269
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
Offensive capability

270
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
Open it

271
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,575
Supervisor

272
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:38,719
It wasn't that

273
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,471
Honestly it's Saturday then anything else

274
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
I can think of liked it just near

275
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,823
Rarity levels of aggressive militaristic

276
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Masculinity

277
00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:01,247
Because it comes off is really that's very sad

278
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,087
What's the video that Alex himself put out of the bullhorn

279
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,183
That he did

280
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,815
The first is that while Alex is driving around bullhorn number of people with their phones

281
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:21,471
It's unclear if their supporters are just hoping he'll get stuck in that roof hatch and then video on there

282
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,359
However there's one person in the shot who appears to be presenting as a real supporter

283
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:31,711
He's an African-American man with dreadlocks pumping his fists in the air toward Alex

284
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:37,087
If you pay close attention employees

285
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
The host of Firepower

286
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,159
To the show I will never learn about

287
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
At all

288
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,535
In the video Alex himself release to help stress that he himself released this

289
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,631
Will Johnson is the only person who appears to be a supporter

290
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,471
Following Alex in the armored vehicle given MD

291
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
And he's on the

292
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
Of course

293
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
So

294
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
His blankie

295
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:03,455
African Americans

296
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,015
So what

297
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
The fact that there's just one

298
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,975
Really

299
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
So there's that

300
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
Is that actually part of your

301
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
Opening orientation

302
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,287
Echo Park

303
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,847
Very sad vibe

304
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
There were about 10 people around the car will Johnson is one of them so it's entirely possible a couple of others were Infowars

305
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,807
Employees that I just don't know

306
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
Some people are just walking

307
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
Past and stop for a moment

308
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
Spectacle that keep walking

309
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:49,279
At least one of the people in the crowd is wearing a shirt that says quote anti Trump Social Club

310
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
And they're just taping Alex other phone causing

311
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Any trouble or anything

312
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Pokemon

313
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,799
Alright somebody in the crowd with Alex yells at it he says they're MSM

314
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,407
Mainstream media

315
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
The Deep state is trying

316
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Kill Trump

317
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
And Alex just yelled something about Phil Mudd

318
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,855
Any plugs infowars.com America is back

319
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:19,232
Chant going only kind of works cluster response

320
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,560
That's always

321
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,632
Yeah it always seems like this is a chain cuz you have a bullhorn

322
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,448
Look you only try and start a chat if you know you can

323
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Get a chance

324
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,032
Really dangerous maneuver if you're not

325
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,128
Before the Cubs

326
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,688
Back in the good old days of

327
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:45,088
Before 2016 and also after 2020

328
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,720
Like trying to get a chance

329
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:57,376
But it's nowhere near the level of someone I'd like an open mic or even a show

330
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:01,216
Coronavirus

331
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
You just feel for him

332
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,336
Even if it well it's almost worse if you could do successfully ushe

333
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
Carnival plush

334
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:12,992
Alex looks winded hello he literally hasn't moved and is just popping his little head out of a roof hatch

335
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
It's

336
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,832
Cobb picture of a man with almost nothing left

337
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,416
It's just that there's no joy in him at all

338
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,816
He was being a douche like back in the old days you know like you do early

339
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:33,216
Do you watch videos in trolling people

340
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,008
Two 2016 that Alexa

341
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
There was a spark there

342
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
He really seemed like he was having fun

343
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,640
When you go out and yell at people and f***

344
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,712
Getting on.

345
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:48,832
Alex

346
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
That space

347
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
But instead

348
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,744
Website

349
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,840
But you look at it it's got to be miserable

350
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,144
The greatest moment for him

351
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
He should be

352
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,728
Still alive

353
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
He's in a tank

354
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,080
Yelling at people at a trump rally in Texas

355
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,152
Adam Sandler

356
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,808
Realizes that there's nothing for him at home anymore

357
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
Never go home

358
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,160
Who sell your soul

359
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,000
He feels like he's treading water

360
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,560
Job treading water

361
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:36,960
Now get ready to Dallas

362
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,824
To the hospital for evaluation

363
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,128
Which is usually a really bad combination

364
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:50,528
Might have an expectation that a shootout might be a likely part of your evening when you leave the house with those accessories

365
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,624
Oh he also had mace and against Mass okay good

366
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,720
Except that he was wearing an insult

367
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
Fun stuff

368
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:06,656
They're absolutely really awesome

369
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,216
Don't I might have been under

370
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Okay well

371
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,384
A lot of shirts wrinkle when they're under body armor but not view high quality

372
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,016
Is Alex Haynes will work with him anymore so

373
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
It's got to go with another company

374
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
I don't know

375
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Iowa

376
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
Alex is out there in full

377
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,440
He was tank yelling at people

378
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
Having a blast

379
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
But not having a blast

380
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,816
Alex

381
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Really

382
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
Had to go to the

383
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
But you do

384
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Trump rally

385
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Been there

386
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
Done that Pharrell

387
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
Seems like you would get old

388
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,360
Yeah you're the first reason unspoken reason

389
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
He needs

390
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:56,576
Puppy are stuck around take Elena people is about as best as he could do right now

391
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Absolutely

392
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,672
Good for that there's another reason

393
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,464
And I talked about it and

394
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
Love

395
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
Coming out

396
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
On

397
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
By the 17th

398
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,344
56 years later

399
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Do not

400
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,976
All the other bizarre statements shut the fuk up

401
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
Cory Booker

402
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
I said

403
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
Everybody's got a

404
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
Real feeling of concern about that

405
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
I'm the one

406
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
Stop to Dallas with the crew

407
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
Did we stop Trump

408
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
The Big Show

409
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
The world will never know

410
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,624
I love it so much

411
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,976
How many years does it take to stop an assassin

412
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,864
My hero

413
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,728
World without never know the sacrifices that I made dumb dumb president

414
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
So this is complete

415
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
Assassination plot against

416
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,432
Drop schedule for this rally October 17th

417
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,248
This is more squarely in the genre of Alex

418
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,808
That I can get on

419
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
I love this

420
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
This is where I wanted to be

421
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:40,512
I do like knowing that in his Vine presidential assassinations have a certain kind of poetry to them

422
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,960
Anniversary boiler alert

423
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
Not

424
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
Presidential election

425
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,992
It's so important that we remove this man from office

426
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,784
On the 17

427
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
How many trails

428
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,136
There's no indication that he was saying the 17th

429
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,952
The number 17

430
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,304
Or is totally possible that Joe Biden decide one of those stocks

431
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,120
Call home

432
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,424
Whatever the case it's a

433
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
Is a bit of a stretch

434
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:30,688
Further Evidence comes from Nancy Pelosi

435
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
That she was wearing

436
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Which has a bullet

437
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,040
As well as some orange ornamental beads

438
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
Just thinking if I safe

439
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Stuff people wear

440
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,416
It's a statement piece of jewelry

441
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,232
Shootings

442
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
Butter

443
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
Special kind of idiot like Alec

444
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,912
See the bullet and put together

445
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
The TV

446
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Is threatening him

447
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,520
Subliminal messages are being conveyed

448
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,336
Trying to taunt him that they're going to kill his hero

449
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
Right

450
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
She's doing everything I say

451
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:15,488
Infowars

452
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:19,584
Her body language seems unusually shaky during the press conference

453
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:25,728
Because she was telegraphing the presidential assassination

454
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:32,128
Could be because part of that press conference had to do with the death of her longtime Congressional coworker Elijah Cummings

455
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,688
That might Shake person up a little bit

456
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,504
Nancy Pelosi been in the House of Representatives

457
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
1387

458
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
Hey, has it been there since 90

459
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
C96

460
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,416
It's 23 years the two of them work together to get legislation

461
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,256
Past perfect

462
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,328
Alex

463
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
That can't be true

464
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,008
Maybe they can all she wasn't out there

465
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:03,872
Literally only Alex

466
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
Picked up

467
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
I wanted to know more

468
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,320
I wanted to know more so I went over the Infowars article about this Theory

469
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
Amman

470
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,392
The evidence is overwhelming

471
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Alright

472
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
He was killed in Dallas

473
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Yes

474
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:25,888
Trump's rally rally was in Dallas

475
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:33,056
Falls Park

476
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:39,456
The only thing they get right on November 22nd 1960

477
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:45,856
C3

478
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,720
Don't worry about that Alex has you covered

479
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,584
Seems like it's not anniversary

480
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:03,264
So in the article which is posted before the rally the trumps life is in danger in Dallas

481
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,080
They have pictures of two calendars

482
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:10,944
One for October 1963

483
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,992
October 9th

484
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,552
You ready to have your mind blown

485
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,368
Okay ready

486
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
The 17th

487
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:25,792
The 17th is a Thursday in both years will freak out

488
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,072
Freak out

489
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
What

490
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,912
That's all but that's all they're gone

491
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
What

492
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
Yeah

493
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
No

494
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,240
Both ears

495
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:41,152
17th Thursday

496
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,528
Definitely

497
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:51,904
From the literal concept of October 17th

498
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,096
That October 17th was a Thursday in 2013 2006

499
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
5

500
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,680
1970s

501
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
6819

502
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,104
President was either assassinated or attempt

503
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,640
Probably

504
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,688
This is stupendous stuff

505
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
This is

506
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,760
Is great

507
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
What

508
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
What an employee was like

509
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Guys

510
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,584
Raiders page

511
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
1963

512
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,960
October 17th is a Thursday

513
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
It's not okay

514
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,616
Not even 50 not the right match

515
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,432
Nellis Thursday

516
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
Right

517
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,696
Get some screenshots put it on the website we're good we're good it makes sense this is a good theory

518
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,512
Just so everybody in the writers room knows

519
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,608
By the way you're wondering guess how long

520
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,192
It is 8:45 clock out

521
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:14,336
If it got to be stuff like this

522
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
Calendar

523
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,128
Conspiracy

524
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,664
This is Bush League work

525
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,064
Just a definition of a zero everything not working

526
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,160
Something like this

527
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:34,560
I think people are leaving there's no byline on that it just says Infowars

528
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:40,192
Wrote that

529
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,032
Heavily edited

530
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,176
Calendars to look a very much faster than they otherwise would honestly feel like he would do better than that

531
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,760
I don't know I don't I don't

532
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,320
Just bad but I love it

533
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
I just f****** love it

534
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,416
Here's my here's my theory

535
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
They didn't even come up

536
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,792
That is totally something that some assholes posted online

537
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:06,816
And they just

538
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:11,680
Dejah screengrab 100% pop

539
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:16,032
100% possible but I still think it shows a lack of quality

540
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Control

541
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,384
Going ever had good quality control to begin with

542
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,480
This being put in an article about how they're going to kill Trump

543
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,504
Is

544
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,808
Absurdly transparent

545
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Situation here

546
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
Conspiracy

547
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,464
Keyboard

548
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,328
Project Camelot

549
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
It's sad

550
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,680
OSHA

551
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Yeah

552
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
So we get around to Alex

553
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
Who now is

554
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,360
Favor of what Trump is doing in Syria

555
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:57,760
The Kurds

556
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:04,160
Yep is fully on wonderful

557
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,440
Find the Fab

558
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,000
First

559
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Trump

560
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Coming out

561
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Animedia

562
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
Tannerite

563
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
British flag

564
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,712
Spitting on a getting a

565
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,784
Rally

566
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,184
The people who have Kurdish Flags

567
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,024
Although he was already

568
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
Already

569
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,680
He was already coming around to supporting whatever

570
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:52,800
That anybody

571
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,872
He was a

572
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:00,224
Pulling out whenever you talk Joseph

573
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
Right back

574
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
So he he raped

575
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,624
People with Kurdish flag

576
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,904
Antifa

577
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
Out of the

578
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,464
The Dallas rally

579
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:23,264
I'm not really interested in that at all Alex keep saying

580
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,664
Everything but the hours to bleep it all

581
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
Excuse for him

582
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,832
I'm not really interested in that I don't care

583
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
If that happen

584
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,952
Cuz I also don't think it happen

585
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:47,584
But I don't really care to argue that

586
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
Because as we

587
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
We hear this mix

588
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,912
Clip we find out how

589
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
Responded

590
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
They stunk

591
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Like

592
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
I mean these people are

593
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,712
Surround the whole time

594
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
Call Shalonda the police

595
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Despicable

596
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,280
Get out the guys I was with were either via former police

597
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
Like it was very

598
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,216
Despicable but it shows where America's gone

599
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,568
I don't believe this at all I don't believe any part of this story because Alex has spent

600
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
I don't know

601
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:37,248
When do they start becoming a buzzword

602
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,320
If they ever come up to him he's going to beat their ass

603
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,976
He has the perfect opportunity

604
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,304
He wants to kick the s*** out of that Pride

605
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,608
He doesn't

606
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,424
I don't believe any of this

607
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,264
He should take the s*** out of that person by his own mind just because

608
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,664
Think about all the publicity

609
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,528
Is bravado and masculinity

610
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
B

611
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,488
I did not just none of this track

612
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
The idea that you got hit

613
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,352
Spit on it he went to the police and please help us

614
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:29,216
Everything about him and everything he puts out to the world

615
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,568
Why would he be the person who goes to the police

616
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:38,688
Individualism and Nanny state

617
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,016
Bulshit

618
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
It's an interesting question

619
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,392
So a big big thing was yelling America's back at

620
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,512
Like I said he tried to get that Backstreet's Back

621
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,840
Alright

622
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,144
That happen

623
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,936
And although it's more believable.

624
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,776
What Alex says happened

625
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,080
8 demonic left

626
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,408
Watching people

627
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,784
From from

628
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Boy looks like

629
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,136
Throwing holy water on Linda Blair in The Exorcist

630
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,440
Movie record

631
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
For the Democratic Party

632
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Around

633
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
America's

634
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
What's wrong with

635
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
All I've seen

636
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,976
Video people suck

637
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,256
With Alex

638
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
I've seen

639
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,864
A couple instances of people like hissing

640
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
Lear there f******

641
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,472
I don't know

642
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,056
I don't think that

643
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:14,944
Has footage of yelling America's back of people's nuts flopping on the ground and hissing like demons

644
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
Debbie does

645
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
100% in Woonsocket

646
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
So

647
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,600
This is great

648
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
Coincidence

649
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,952
Grand mal seizure in history

650
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,512
Hideout

651
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
Probably not

652
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,752
Spoilers

653
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:43,616
Can hear about the situation with the Kurds and

654
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
Syria

655
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,712
Expresses that he's all for

656
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:53,088
Now it's well that's true

657
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
Public

658
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
Roblox

659
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,256
That place out

660
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:06,144
You would have any problem with that

661
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
2

662
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,216
Other languages

663
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,776
Cleansing

664
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:19,200
Root word

665
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:25,600
Those words are closer than October and November

666
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,904
But the 17th is a

667
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,488
Pretty f***** up to imagine

668
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,768
Alex

669
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,816
Is okay and supportive

670
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,424
More f***** up is he doesn't even really see

671
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,520
Seemed to deny the idea that turkey is going to go in and kill a lot of

672
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,568
He doesn't seem to

673
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Care about

674
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
You get

675
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
He's only real response

676
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736
And he makes this response

677
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
A couple times

678
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
Episode

679
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,808
And I think it is

680
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,928
And I want to spend some time

681
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,096
Done very well

682
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
Very very

683
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,472
And most importantly he's doing when he's shedding

684
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
That

685
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,152
Of the shower grape jelly the bunch of Clubs

686
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,528
The Curve

687
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,464
The media

688
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,632
80% of all religious persecution in the world

689
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,496
First Easter Christian

690
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
More than that

691
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,503
His only real angle on this

692
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,063
Isn't like refute or even

693
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
Seem to

694
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,415
Care at all about the actual situation

695
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,231
Why didn't you care about

696
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
Octonauts

697
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,607
Christian persecution around the club

698
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
I don't believe that it's

699
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:19,007
Nearly as high as Alex's saying because the reference but he's making isn't it

700
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,527
You and didn't put out a report on it and Catholic priest

701
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
Just said

702
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,367
Yeah

703
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,927
I think that's something that we lost track record

704
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,999
I'm not minimizing the idea that there are Christian

705
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,279
Into are in bad situation

706
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
And our being

707
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
Themselves

708
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Absolutely

709
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
But

710
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
That is not a good

711
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,495
Excuse

712
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:55,103
I care about about what's going on in Northern

713
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,943
This is your fault

714
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:06,623
But almost a drawing a causal link between if you had been there for my perceived

715
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:13,535
Then I will be there for yours right here human rights is conditional

716
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,095
Its commitment to Human Rights is conditional

717
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
And that's a problem

718
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
It's not

719
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
Possible

720
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
No

721
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,103
At least it's not

722
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,895
Which is bad

723
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:34,527
So hook his behavior

724
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,599
In that time period and around that subject

725
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,647
He just lost another appeal

726
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,951
On that case recently

727
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
He says that it's not

728
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
True

729
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:50,143
Which is trying to get the case thrown out

730
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,983
And it didn't work so you peel the decision to not throw out the

731
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,711
Pushing back all of his stalling delay

732
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
Discussion tactics

733
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,391
To be like

734
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
Creating a straw man

735
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
Who cares

736
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:18,047
Even though he seems to be creating a

737
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,375
Completely fictitious version of what that lawsuit is about

738
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
When money falls

739
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
What

740
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,735
Basically those lawyers law firms

741
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
Izzy's Deli

742
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
Victimized by me

743
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,415
Which form of

744
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,607
There's an advertising formula

745
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
Haha

746
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
We covered that

747
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
How's the big news

748
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,431
Tom Arnold talkingshit

749
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:13,087
It's not big news

750
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,879
Do you know what else it's not the night

751
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,183
So

752
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,719
True Lies

753
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,279
Just, I don't care what tomorrow has

754
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:25,887
The issue with Alex advertising it's like

755
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,215
It's the idea that he profited off of

756
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,751
Slander

757
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,055
He doesn't understand

758
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,847
No I think he does

759
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:40,479
And he just doesn't want his audience to his best interest

760
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:45,343
Did this way I don't believe him for a second

761
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,439
In our 2013 when we got to the Boston bombing

762
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,511
The way he's so gleefully is talking about

763
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,535
Traffic

764
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,887
The way he's leaning so deeply Into The Sensational bulshit cover

765
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,679
Irresponsible

766
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,471
It is

767
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
Somebody probably

768
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,567
Could be sued for by people in those pictures that he found on 4chan

769
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
100

770
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:10,943
Is being led by the increasing traffic

771
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:17,087
I don't believe it he doesn't have some kind of a strategy know whether or not it's on paper or they have meetings about it

772
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:21,183
It's very clear that he recognizes when there are things that are popular

773
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
Eddie goes in that direction

774
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,767
Whether or not that's

775
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,607
Up to the standard of unjust enrichment I have no idea but

776
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,399
To pretend it's not a real phenomenon

777
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,215
It strains credulity

778
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Big stories

779
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
You know

780
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
Big

781
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:46,527
Story yeah I'm pretty sure that was wasn't complaining that they were blaming

782
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,807
I tried to put out that book

783
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,367
Advertising

784
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,183
If you have

785
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
30hop

786
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,303
Yes Save

787
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
Pushed affect

788
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,519
Russiagate

789
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
Impeach

790
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
Trumpism

791
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455
They are defraud

792
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
The General

793
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,039
Public as a consumer Flash

794
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,255
It's like that job famous Shabu

795
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
Great

796
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,983
So what are you talkin about is I guess

797
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Trump

798
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Demers

799
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,287
It's somebody

800
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:44,127
Trying to sue CNN based on James O'Keefe's latest stunt

801
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,431
I don't care I don't care at all

802
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,479
I didn't care to look into this

803
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
I don't have the patience

804
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,855
It's for it it's going to get thrown out

805
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
Today

806
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:59,999
Quite frankly I think I'm really interested in about this is Alex likes the idea of

807
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,071
A representative of the president or his campaign

808
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:11,519
That's not okay for him to control

809
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,359
Speech

810
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,151
Alex talks about things that are

811
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:20,991
Chilling Free Speech all the time

812
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:25,087
Have to think that this is falls under that

813
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:31,487
So you want to make sure that the media cannot report

814
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,607
It's not chili

815
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,911
Warmack is ice cold

816
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,871
He's complaining about us being in the middle

817
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
And shed

818
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
People Homewood

819
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:55,039
Direct contradiction to what

820
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,831
And reality that that too

821
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,159
Money that we saw

822
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,719
There's better ways that we could spend that

823
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,023
Yes and I don't disagree

824
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,071
Disagree with what

825
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
Talking about

826
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,399
Something that we could do

827
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
Okay

828
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,263
Bridges and

829
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,015
Remind Alex is a libertarian

830
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
What's 4

831
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
Not here

832
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,183
40 miles an hour

833
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,511
150 miles an hour

834
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,351
What the f*** are you talking about

835
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,519
To get on a train

836
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
Canon

837
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
50 minutes they were in town

838
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Sam Houston

839
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,991
Go to the museum

840
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,015
Restaurants

841
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,855
150 miles an hour

842
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,463
70 years old

843
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,327
Houston

844
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,103
It takes 24 hours from now

845
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
We have had no infrastructure

846
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
Built

847
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
That's real

848
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
And Lasting

849
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,623
Since the 70s

850
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:44,095
It's Alex we're looking for president in recent times who agreed with him completely about shifting spending toward infrastructure to build

851
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,375
High-Speed Rail

852
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,423
That President Barack Obama

853
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:02,271
Really as big an advocate of High-Speed Rail

854
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:08,159
But if you said that it was Donald J Trump

855
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,255
Just made sure that there were stops at each of his hotels

856
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,071
34f

857
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,655
It seems like there would be so many good things that we could do if we just

858
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:28,127
Make our lives better too

859
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:34,527
He's game to every social progress that's still be terrible

860
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,087
Universal

861
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
Whatever

862
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:40,671
It's strange I've never heard Alex

863
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,695
Assistant efforts

864
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,487
The build-up high-speed rail network

865
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:50,143
Never talked about Republican governors in Ohio Wisconsin and Florida literally rejected Federal

866
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,703
Money being offered for goal

867
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:57,567
You see people like Alex want High-Speed Rail that they don't want the government paying for it

868
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,615
Or at least not Obama's government

869
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:06,271
They must prefer the fantasy of businesses building up his high-speed rail network the private sector

870
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,623
The government paying for roads

871
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,927
Like

872
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Going

873
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:20,095
Never going to happen

874
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
Reasons why

875
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,679
Money is the root of all of

876
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:29,311
Without high-speed rate

877
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,895
Less money everything possible to keep

878
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
High-speed rail from

879
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,759
There's a reason so long to get somewhere by train now

880
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:42,111
Because the railway system this country has and has had for decades

881
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,183
That doesn't exist primarily to serve passenger needs

882
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:52,095
With the rise of the prevalence of the automobile in the greater accessibility to cheaper air travel

883
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,119
Nearly as much

884
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:57,727
And the commuter Focus rail Market became way less profitable and harder for companies

885
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,263
To justify starting is

886
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,287
Far back is the 9th

887
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
1830s

888
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,871
Most Rail lines prioritize Freight traffic

889
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,687
And this makes passenger rail

890
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:11,551
Subside sometimes you can end up having to wait for a passing freight train to go by at a Crossing

891
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,599
End up adding a bunch of times

892
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:18,463
Part and parcel of this is that most Rail lines are built to accommodate Freight traffic

893
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:25,119
And that's even though passenger trains are capable of traveling much faster they're Bound by the speed limits that apply to Freight travel

894
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,215
Because I operate differently would require an overhaul of many structural elements of

895
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
The tracks which again

896
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,287
No business has a financial incentive

897
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,055
Have to do

898
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,847
It just is no way

899
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,407
That this is going to become profitable for these busy

900
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,943
Operate differently

901
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,247
Freight traffic is what therapy

902
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,295
Business model is built on

903
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,855
That would be

904
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,391
So

905
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
Like

906
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,815
Part of this is just because

907
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,607
Oil and Automobiles

908
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,399
The 1930s

909
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:05,055
Bought up all the possible ways that a computer system could be built as a remor efficient and they would

910
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,383
They're trying to kill this

911
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,199
Think Alex might have had someone tell him about any

912
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
Durand

913
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:18,623
I think that might be what's up you got drunk at the gallop rally and someone told him about anyway

914
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
Cypress

915
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,255
Amtrak back to Missouri

916
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,559
Experience I really enjoyed

917
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,399
Being able to look out the side of its TV

918
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,935
Choosing

919
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,471
For the most part

920
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,031
Vevo you're on the train with art art Monsters then

921
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,615
If you're good even taking the metro to the like Milwaukee

922
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:45,247
United States

923
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,831
I think he's a real idiot if he thinks that any business has the kind of

924
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,367
Profit incentive

925
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,415
Ridiculous amount of financial losses

926
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,463
They would be required in order to pull it off

927
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:00,095
The only way we're ever going to have High-Speed Rail in this country is a massive publicly funded project

928
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,887
Sorry

929
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,191
Short of that the money is in Freight

930
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:07,519
And it doesn't seem like that Dynamic is going to change anytime soon

931
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,847
Advocating for this

932
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,407
So if you want to do that

933
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,175
Great

934
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:17,247
You gotta you gotta recognize

935
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,575
That you're drifting into socialist territory

936
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:25,183
Using tax money for all of this

937
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,719
Which seems to run counter

938
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,511
What ton of what Alex believes in

939
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,863
Concerned is love all of their closely held beliefs that were bought

940
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:39,007
But then when they come up against reality they have to find this weird

941
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,031
Push-backs

942
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,311
Weather

943
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,847
Let me twist my brain and

944
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,383
18 different

945
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,431
So I can get to you how the government

946
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,223
Can pay for it

947
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,503
But they won't

948
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,831
Add but they will but they're not and it's a good idea

949
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:57,183
Alex and I can probably find common cause

950
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,047
The ton of jobs

951
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
You'd have

952
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:09,727
An amazing thing that would come out the other side

953
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,775
Could get together a little bit on that

954
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:18,175
Right that's not what I'm arguing with

955
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:24,575
And then I can video of it later but I got to play.

956
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:31,999
I love the idea

957
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:36,607
The point I'm making isn't that I disagree with what he

958
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,959
I know enough about his beliefs

959
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
Never

960
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
Actually

961
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,543
Believe

962
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,943
Even if I guess you would have dropped presented it you just no matter what

963
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,223
Work

964
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,783
His brain around it but it's counter to

965
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,319
Just what he put the kids

966
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
We Act

967
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
Like he believed

968
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:02,207
I just I don't I don't trust

969
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,535
They don't know what they believe their

970
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:10,655
People pay other people to make them believe

971
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
Powdered milk

972
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:14,751
Kinko's

973
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
To do it

974
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,359
Absolutely

975
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,455
Chinese people and how they have braids

976
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Subway

977
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,855
Somewhere

978
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,415
Miles away

979
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,583
It's almost a sacrilege

980
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,799
Is decided we're not going to have that anymore

981
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:55,199
Early in his presidency priority

982
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
Not all of them

983
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,295
Retire somewhere okay with

984
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:06,463
There was an impeachment just program going on

985
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,255
Well any success

986
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,535
That he had wood

987
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,095
Reflects poorly upon that

988
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:18,239
Yep we could have made this a priority when we had a president who was committed to it when he was pushing for this back in 2009

989
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,823
Massive progress

990
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:28,479
President with a communist infiltrator

991
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,343
They on we've learned that now he could have just

992
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,623
F****** got it

993
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,927
It might not have been the best thing to

994
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,975
To do though even though we now realize

995
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
Still doesn't

996
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,815
I still am not sure if

997
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,839
A gray top

998
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,959
It's a bit it's a bigger debate

999
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
I think it's

1000
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,031
Probably true that

1001
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
If you

1002
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,591
If you ask

1003
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,895
Actually do the things that are good for people

1004
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,175
Even conservatives

1005
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,967
Stay on the ground will be like

1006
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,783
Oh yeah my life is better

1007
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,599
Eventually some people come around.

1008
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
Viewfinder

1009
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,647
The result

1010
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,671
If you're making

1011
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:11,743
If the only people who are really getting mad or rich people then

1012
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
You're doing it right

1013
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:23,263
Images of potato

1014
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,847
Seriously specific as to our current foreign policy

1015
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:37,855
Primary thing is you guys don't care about Christian so I don't care about this child

1016
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:42,719
Another reason why

1017
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,511
He's totally cool with dropped

1018
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,727
Perfect

1019
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:57,055
Charge they've been doing

1020
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:01,663
Since this war started 89 years ago they already had taken Arrow

1021
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,943
So it's okay

1022
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,503
Serie A

1023
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,063
Western stereo

1024
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,207
That's because the deal was made

1025
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,607
20 mile exclusion Zone

1026
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:35,199
Yeah did it so Alex is other defense

1027
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:37,503
Is this is the other option

1028
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,063
We didn't do this

1029
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,111
There be more refugees

1030
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,903
Right right

1031
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,671
So that's good

1032
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:49,791
Cuz he doesn't want to know demographic rate

1033
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:55,679
It really does seem like foreign policy decisions

1034
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,215
Trump this late

1035
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,495
Either you lettuce

1036
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,775
Kill all these people

1037
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,359
Or we send brown people your way

1038
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,919
And he was like

1039
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:11,551
If that's actually the conversation that's happening as opposed to Alex's perception of it

1040
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,599
That's f***** up

1041
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,135
2-level I can't even begin to

1042
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Yep

1043
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,815
He's going into the Plaza

1044
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,375
Because of course

1045
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,191
Want there to be more white people around

1046
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,983
Relatively speaking

1047
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,519
And so he starts talking

1048
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,567
Going about

1049
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
Fuji's bring

1050
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,127
These countries

1051
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,455
Absurd

1052
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,015
The 40 girls in German

1053
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,087
I go ahead and get yourself an adult

1054
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
Muslim

1055
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:46,879
Husband

1056
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,439
Level 40

1057
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,255
He is 24

1058
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,351
My b****

1059
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,471
Is a family show

1060
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,751
The family show Jordan

1061
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,311
Show

1062
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,895
Hoof daddy what's cooking

1063
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:19,135
Because it's just Alex saying that

1064
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
I only care

1065
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:26,047
If you cared about Christians account

1066
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,583
Baddest

1067
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,351
Mad Dog

1068
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,935
Thinking about making jokes about Trump

1069
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,703
Speech

1070
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,495
And here's Alex

1071
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,263
What is response today

1072
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:40,127
Well Mad Dog

1073
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:44,223
Islam

1074
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,039
Because he's enough

1075
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,343
Effete

1076
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,903
Alright

1077
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
It's so it's so

1078
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,975
Pathetically

1079
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
Consistent

1080
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,047
Just anybody says anything bad about Trump

1081
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,095
Just f****** the track

1082
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,887
Just attack them

1083
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,751
I'm honest

1084
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,519
F*** Mattis

1085
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:14,175
Fine like all of these people who come out after they've left the administration and then start talking s***

1086
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:20,575
Right on board with the Nuremberg trials like you're you're the problem

1087
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:26,975
I am so sorry I am part of the issue and I killed a lot of people and if it asks if it's not then people in the audience should have

1088
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,743
A lot of points

1089
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,559
Mayhem middle of their speech

1090
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,887
I'm almost at the point

1091
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
Listen

1092
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,703
Just slink away

1093
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,263
Well if we never hear from you again

1094
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,055
Will all close our eyes will call it a day

1095
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,359
You speak in public you going to

1096
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,895
That should be the rule

1097
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,575
In the hypothetical situation where he turns on Trump

1098
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,879
It's like you go away

1099
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,671
You slink away

1100
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:00,511
Will never have to feel like you can help

1101
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:04,095
Realized

1102
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,935
The beginning no s*** but you can't so

1103
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,215
Shut up

1104
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,799
Administration

1105
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,615
Scaramucci

1106
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:18,431
Because I think he has something to bring to the table

1107
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,991
You got it

1108
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,111
Stitches go away

1109
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,511
Turns out that the rally

1110
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,791
Are showing up

1111
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,583
And

1112
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495
And he wants

1113
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
To do a challenge

1114
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,847
Challenges

1115
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:47,871
Call

1116
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,407
From people who disagree with him

1117
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,687
I think Trump should be in

1118
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,967
How many do we get to

1119
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
People that diss

1120
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
Caldwell

1121
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,415
The first

1122
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,695
Rounded collars

1123
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:02,975
What state

1124
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,743
The first

1125
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,791
Open the phone

1126
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,911
To disagree with me

1127
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,007
Really asking you

1128
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
.

1129
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,615
You know damn well no one who listens

1130
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:22,687
A show is going to give you a serious disagreement about that

1131
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:28,319
Anyone who disagrees with Alex is named

1132
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,647
Yeah there's nobody at this point

1133
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,719
No one's f****** list and if they are not calling in

1134
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,255
This 88

1135
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,535
Comical idea

1136
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,327
So your question

1137
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,143
We'll find out okay we'll find out.

1138
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:48,799
Get ready to open up the phone lines and I don't know what the hell I don't know if he's like

1139
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:55,199
His phone lines are like an old Camaro out in the cold we got to go turn it on at the house for an hour

1140
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:59,295
Frost

1141
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:09,279
You can do some serious damage

1142
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:15,679
And then it is a long time

1143
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:20,287
So he gets the rambling about other things

1144
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,079
Have you found that there is a group

1145
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,615
That has revealed

1146
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,895
The climate change

1147
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919
Protest

1148
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,223
It's not really about climate change it's all

1149
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,527
A red herring

1150
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
Just don't lie articles

1151
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,207
Extinction Rebellion

1152
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,863
Blocked everything around the world

1153
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,935
Our sexuality app

1154
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,703
Normal

1155
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,495
Population

1156
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,847
Stop

1157
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,479
Normal

1158
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
Climate

1159
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
Them

1160
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
And some weird

1161
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:17,631
So get this group Extinction Rebellion

1162
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:23,007
I don't know a ton about them I don't feel like I can say a pro or

1163
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:27,103
Against strategy

1164
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,575
Attention to approach

1165
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,367
The video I don't know

1166
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,159
There's a diversity of tactics

1167
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,951
Six-letter probably required

1168
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,743
In the world

1169
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,911
First Extinction Rebellion is a Environmental Group it is existed for less than a year

1170
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,239
And as best I can tell they have nothing

1171
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,287
They were

1172
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,847
They were founded last Halloween

1173
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,663
The 17th wasn't on a Thursday last

1174
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,967
Is it

1175
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,783
Yap

1176
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:13,183
Old medium post

1177
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,463
Leandro

1178
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:19,839
Activism isn't just about the climate specifically

1179
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,375
But it's about

1180
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
Fix astigmatism

1181
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,703
Infected the way that we relate to each other as humans

1182
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:32,383
This post is not a gotcha moment where the climate activist flips up and admits the climate-change concerns are real

1183
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,431
Robin is just about forcing Alex

1184
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,223
The kiss another man or whatever

1185
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,575
It's about understanding the climate activism existed

1186
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,367
Oven just being about climate

1187
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:46,719
And honestly I think stuff like what this guy's talking about is really important

1188
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:50,815
The path forward if we're going to take care of these issues and survives

1189
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,839
Coexist

1190
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,911
It has to involve greater social and class Justice

1191
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,679
And equality

1192
01:08:55,935 --> 01:09:01,311
You run the risk of finding climate solutions that only serve to deepen

1193
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,103
Between segments of society

1194
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,407
It's important as Things become more serious too

1195
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,199
To be deeply committed to solution

1196
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,015
That don't Veer into Eco fascist territory

1197
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,295
And that's what I see being

1198
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,831
Expressed in this medium post

1199
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,671
Straight people feel weird

1200
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:22,559
The club of Rome

1201
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,423
I think that it's

1202
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:30,495
It's important think about those things

1203
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,311
It's important to not view things

1204
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,847
So

1205
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,127
Granularly

1206
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,175
Right you lose sight

1207
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:38,943
Of the larger

1208
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:44,063
I don't I don't know I'm not I'm not saying I fully support everything that this person

1209
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:48,671
Believes are in

1210
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:50,975
I don't see what you see

1211
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,255
Sea hear now

1212
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,023
You don't need this

1213
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,559
And they don't need to have

1214
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,911
Can you believe it

1215
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:06,335
Okay

1216
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,359
Watch The Good The Bad and The Ugly

1217
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,063
Internalized

1218
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:21,951
Travel to Faraway place

1219
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,863
Alright

1220
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
What a shock

1221
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:44,479
What a shock

1222
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,807
Key lime tequila

1223
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:51,391
I am being told

1224
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,951
So that's good

1225
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:57,279
Cuz there's not many people calling in

1226
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,559
Which is not too surprised

1227
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,447
Got drunk

1228
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:09,567
Put a million-dollar bounty on the opposing counsel in my Sandy Hook lawsuit

1229
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:13,151
Sure

1230
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,943
They say that I encourage

1231
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,295
Violence cuz I said I wanted his head on a spike

1232
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,111
Encourage violence

1233
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,791
You're slightly differently

1234
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
Interesting

1235
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,631
Suggestion of how the globalist

1236
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,399
Can win

1237
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
Alright

1238
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,495
What's it there

1239
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,287
Cliche I want this one

1240
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,047
Patriots

1241
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,839
Assaulting a ration

1242
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,631
Is the violent one

1243
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,911
And

1244
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,447
Did

1245
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:11,007
What I Hear here is a silly

1246
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,287
Scary

1247
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:17,151
Because I'm old enough to remember

1248
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,687
When I do.

1249
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,455
Hillary Clinton

1250
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:29,183
And I remember that Alex

1251
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,207
The false flag

1252
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,791
I hear in 1 hour

1253
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,607
Almost there wink

1254
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,167
If someone kills these people

1255
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,239
It's jumped the globalist doing it to set us up

1256
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:45,567
Yep just so consistent in his career but it's always so

1257
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,639
Jarring in the present-day and talk about hypothetical

1258
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,175
Murders that could happen

1259
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,759
I do most like a we got your back

1260
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,551
Yeah I know that's not what you saying

1261
01:12:55,807 --> 01:13:00,415
But there's a way you can hear it that way a little trouble

1262
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,207
If you did it though he would

1263
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:08,607
But for anybody who killed one of his enemies

1264
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:15,007
Volkswagen tempted order to make his day

1265
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:19,103
Cover for you if you did that he's just saying that

1266
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,895
You know he would

1267
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,431
Cover you if you did that

1268
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,967
You already know it doesn't

1269
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
Deez Nuts

1270
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,551
But you know it you know it

1271
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:32,415
Right and I don't necessarily like

1272
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,975
Persuasive or would get someone to

1273
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,743
Do something

1274
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,839
Put it is a strange thing to be like fully aware of

1275
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,655
Show

1276
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:45,215
At least on a subconscious level understand that

1277
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,007
I don't know

1278
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,407
And he was saying

1279
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,455
Wait real quick

1280
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:59,039
I didn't see the end of the rally

1281
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:05,439
Doesn't happen

1282
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,975
Anniversary

1283
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,999
Nothing happened

1284
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,839
But Alex got yelled at by

1285
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,887
A leaf

1286
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,911
Kurdish flag

1287
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:18,239
This next wave is really into

1288
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
Because

1289
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,823
Deeply racing

1290
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:26,943
But in a

1291
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,735
Like it don't literal words

1292
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,295
Are him he's trying to argue that he's not right

1293
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,575
Right spot

1294
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,879
In the way he makes his argument

1295
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,183
He shows and reveals

1296
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,463
A deep races

1297
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,487
No

1298
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:42,815
But it's also important to point out that I don't believe

1299
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:46,399
No I believe it's an imaginary scenario that Alex's

1300
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,191
Is constructing to tell his body

1301
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:51,775
To demonstrate that he's not racist

1302
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,311
Reveals deep races

1303
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
Stop

1304
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
Because this was

1305
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,295
TitleMax

1306
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,495
They really believe that

1307
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:25,823
Local time to keep Infowars on the air

1308
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,359
Cut off my break

1309
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,015
Hispanic and black

1310
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:36,063
Largely antifa

1311
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:41,695
They're being directed by the higher-level smart

1312
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:45,535
Call

1313
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:50,399
I know from contact when he talks about this he always calls them like white meth head

1314
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,703
There's a hierarchy

1315
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:55,007
Structural

1316
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,311
People are directing things around

1317
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:01,151
There's there's a white supremacy and his false version of antifa

1318
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:04,991
Is revealing that they are racing

1319
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,063
Haha

1320
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,415
Though because they obviously don't and he is imagining that that is how

1321
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:18,815
Obviously would go that's one that's one part of it is the conception of these

1322
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,583
Non-white

1323
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,423
Being so dumb

1324
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:29,567
White Overlord

1325
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,359
Bucked up

1326
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,943
Bucked up

1327
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,759
So congratulations

1328
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,783
Revealed

1329
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,575
A insanely race

1330
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,879
View of the world

1331
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,159
Heard a racist

1332
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,183
Once

1333
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,023
Try to convince me that they were not racing

1334
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,559
Without doing it

1335
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,327
Racist Lee

1336
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:55,423
It never happened does seem it doesn't never happened

1337
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,447
Even when there

1338
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,983
Trying to lie

1339
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,775
He tried to be like

1340
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:03,871
I don't hate black people because Bubba Bubba

1341
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:07,967
And I never say the n word

1342
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,735
Yeah.

1343
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:14,367
Alex imagine that he was

1344
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,391
No really slipping

1345
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:18,719
Sound by minority antifa people over to the side of Liberty

1346
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,511
Absolutely not

1347
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:24,351
But also like I said there was a gun and

1348
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,519
Hear about that and then either not talk about it or say it was a false flag

1349
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:34,847
Orsay

1350
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,383
Totally different perspect

1351
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,063
And he was wearing an Infowars shirt

1352
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,095
Sure

1353
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,031
Under his jacket

1354
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,823
But they sure

1355
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,639
Deal the yeah

1356
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,175
How do I wonder why

1357
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:15,551
Guy with a gun and body armor it as Trump rally

1358
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:21,951
I got I mean technically and text it's not illegal to have body armor on unless you're a felon

1359
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,279
I have body armor

1360
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:30,655
Sure

1361
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,215
I don't think the guys doing anything illegal

1362
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,031
Not good

1363
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:41,151
Probably also if someone on the left

1364
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,479
Without protesting in body armor

1365
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,759
Like I would still say like

1366
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,807
When you do that

1367
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,343
You highly

1368
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:54,207
Haley escalate the opportunity

1369
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:58,815
And I I just don't think it's healthy I really don't

1370
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,839
The only

1371
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,399
That makes sense

1372
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,959
This is when the escalation has already occurred without

1373
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:08,031
You know like with the Black Panthers

1374
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,055
In The Sticks

1375
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:09,823
Steve

1376
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,847
Around arms

1377
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:17,247
Watching the cops different

1378
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:23,135
The escalation was already passed long before they ever got there

1379
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,927
You're just at a f******

1380
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:25,695
Stadium

1381
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,999
With a bunch of people who you like

1382
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:34,655
Expecting

1383
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,959
That's all that's going on

1384
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
Primitive

1385
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:42,079
Premeditated murder

1386
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:45,663
Describe the clothes off at

1387
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,431
It's not bad to scratch

1388
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,783
Alex I think really get to the core of

1389
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,807
His feelings about Trump

1390
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:54,623
And that is it

1391
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,903
I love Trump

1392
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,695
F*** I want to get back on

1393
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,487
That's really all I do

1394
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,887
Buddy's not stood up

1395
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,167
The persecution of acid

1396
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,239
Beat up outside

1397
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,543
Because he thinks that will scare

1398
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:22,016
And he needs to speak out against

1399
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,672
They don't do that

1400
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,792
I want back on Facebook baby

1401
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:41,216
You started it with I love Trump made me hope for just one second that he would then

1402
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:51,456
What I want

1403
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:59,136
It's all being attacked and that's just filler

1404
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,976
Optics

1405
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:03,744
So that is happening

1406
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,816
To the point where he can use that in order to get more attention

1407
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,144
Problems

1408
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,168
But yeah so

1409
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,984
Call still are coming in

1410
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,288
No that's the problem

1411
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:22,688
Got to listen to this

1412
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:29,088
Remind me to supposed to be on and you never showed up

1413
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,184
The 17th was a Thursday

1414
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,768
Linda Barnes

1415
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,560
In his rambling Alex

1416
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:41,120
Tries to nationalize

1417
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,704
The Drudge is having more negative coverage restaurant

1418
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:48,800
He needs people like I said I I believe this

1419
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:51,360
I don't know what it means it's going to break

1420
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,896
But I do know that Alex

1421
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:54,944
Turn on

1422
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,480
There's just no way

1423
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:03,648
Make the argument that

1424
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,376
Which is rarely

1425
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,168
I think it's pretty boring.

1426
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:30,528
I love the idea that

1427
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,344
Do you have the anime

1428
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,416
Context of demonizing them to support Trump

1429
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,208
It's a little different

1430
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,488
B

1431
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:45,888
I know people don't want to hear a radio show that is regardless of any circumstances

1432
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:49,472
He makes at all my old positions

1433
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,640
It is a little boy

1434
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,408
Calendar

1435
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:01,248
Conspiracy and Alex

1436
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,296
Call cuz this is great

1437
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,064
This is

1438
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,160
Alex goes with First Call

1439
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,232
You got say you want some

1440
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:26,592
I thought initially that that might be someone playing audio of

1441
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,872
Turkish

1442
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,176
Nike Air Raid

1443
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,200
I thought

1444
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Like someone

1445
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:33,248
Might have troll Dalek

1446
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:37,344
I wasn't playing at audio

1447
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,904
Could be anything

1448
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:43,744
I'm not sure audio Russia

1449
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,304
Whatever you want

1450
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,328
I realized

1451
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:50,656
I'm probably overthinking this cuz Alex tries to go to another call

1452
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:54,496
Oh my goodness you're welcome

1453
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,336
No

1454
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,328
Okay

1455
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:23,680
You know what to do

1456
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,728
Got to know when to fold them

1457
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,520
When to walk away

1458
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,056
You got to know when to run

1459
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:41,344
No more calls and wow

1460
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:47,488
Differently around noon

1461
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:51,840
I love not being able to do my job

1462
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,608
Too long

1463
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
Without

1464
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
Getting the phones

1465
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,240
What episode

1466
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,800
Maybe a couple episodes but this is too long

1467
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:07,200
Yeah I am in there is that and then also you know you add that to like the not being able to play Clips whenever

1468
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:09,504
They're supposed to be playing up and all that stuff

1469
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,088
And then you added to the calendar bulshit

1470
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,136
This operation

1471
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:18,720
It's falling apart feels like if you turn the cameras around it

1472
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,488
Just Rex

1473
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,768
Running back and forth

1474
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,536
From station to stay

1475
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,096
It leads me to suspect

1476
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,144
Possibilities

1477
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,960
Is of him trying to sell off the warehouse to cash out

1478
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
Steam light

1479
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,752
Yeah

1480
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,568
I don't know if that's the case but it just

1481
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,104
Possibly

1482
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:42,528
We have a full staff staff that was there six months ago a year ago

1483
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,064
Like a different production

1484
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,904
The alternative is

1485
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,232
Whatever he was paying for like the phone

1486
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,512
The experts

1487
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,536
Run

1488
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,072
Ability to take calls

1489
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,120
He's now we can't afford

1490
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,936
Or they decided

1491
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,752
Occasion

1492
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:05,056
Something here in Decatur

1493
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,848
A deterioration of his

1494
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:08,384
No I got it

1495
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,432
Interference

1496
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,456
That's what it is

1497
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:16,576
That's why I can't take a pulsar weather we all know

1498
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:19,648
It's just a glitch

1499
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,440
Your calls

1500
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,328
It was just hung up

1501
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:33,216
Do the two callers who disagree with you think Trump should be impeached

1502
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:33,984
Weird

1503
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:39,360
Weird how there's a strange glitch while the people who are probably going to tell you to go fuc yourself

1504
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:43,200
I don't necessarily Alex

1505
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,480
Fake the glitch

1506
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:48,832
In order to not talk to these people but it's weird

1507
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,648
Unfortunate

1508
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,952
Tell off some people

1509
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:57,280
I don't know I've listened to the show long enough to know that whenever he gets it

1510
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:00,352
Defending call is usually like your thoughts

1511
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:06,752
You should be calling for Hillary to be hung love your product

1512
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,312
Do I take them all every morning

1513
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,848
And here's the thing

1514
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,128
I agree with you

1515
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:15,712
Yeah it's either that or like why do you dodge the

1516
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,016
The Jewish question

1517
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:22,112
Alright

1518
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:25,184
Cell phone lines aren't working

1519
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,464
Sommore

1520
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,256
Play some special reports

1521
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,280
Cuz he has nothing

1522
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,608
How many Rambles but how you shouldn't win the lottery

1523
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,240
Europe

1524
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,480
How swimming pool dozen occasions every year

1525
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,232
Combination

1526
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,448
It's hard to find Chasers

1527
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:10,240
Where people get

1528
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:16,896
You'll never hear about those

1529
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:23,296
And everything is fine. It's not a story anyone tell

1530
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,088
You don't hear about it

1531
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,464
A physical

1532
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,816
Money and success

1533
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,864
Will destroy you faster than

1534
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:45,056
Black

1535
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,592
Who's your daddy

1536
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:48,896
Probably

1537
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:55,040
Rockstar graphic

1538
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,600
Helping

1539
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:58,880
What about Trump

1540
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:09,888
That's what we've known about Trump since his entire career

1541
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,680
Nobody helps people

1542
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,472
Donald

1543
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:14,240
Jay

1544
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,520
It's so amazing

1545
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:21,920
Go to go on a little bit of a Jag that out on earned money is somehow

1546
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,832
Even though he has no skills or talents

1547
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:32,928
Very weird

1548
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:37,792
Alex has mostly play special reports cuz

1549
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,608
Really wanted to talk to callers cuz he probably didn't

1550
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:43,424
Do too much preparing use out late at the rally and

1551
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,472
He never prepares anyway

1552
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:48,800
The other particular Special Report we're going to hear about in the

1553
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:53,920
This last clip

1554
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:58,016
Pretty much

1555
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,320
But this is interesting because like

1556
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,600
We've done

1557
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:03,392
Investigation

1558
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,928
No how he came

1559
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,208
Support Trump

1560
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,792
We've listened to a lot of different time periods of his career

1561
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:10,816
And

1562
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,840
I could hear

1563
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,888
Somebody who doesn't know

1564
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,656
Those things

1565
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,936
Hearing this

1566
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,008
What about this special report

1567
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,800
I hear this

1568
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,080
Galaxy

1569
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:24,128
Go f****** f****** self

1570
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:26,688
We got to get some bleach on this year

1571
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:34,368
Brainwashed liberals

1572
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,208
Brindle

1573
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:44,608
Brainwashed liberals like Alex Jones in July 2015

1574
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:49,472
Brainwash liberal

1575
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,264
Like gangster

1576
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,848
It's crazy

1577
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,640
It's just like there's no

1578
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:58,432
Sincerity there's no context

1579
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,224
Text there's no through-line to any of this

1580
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,016
It just is what it is

1581
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,296
Bootlegging

1582
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,320
It is

1583
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,600
Rationalize

1584
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,440
A hundred percent

1585
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:12,000
There's so many there's so many things now where I

1586
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,280
Can't

1587
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,048
Albert

1588
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,328
See you in my head

1589
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:18,144
All of these propagandas reading anti-trump

1590
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,424
S*** and then just

1591
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,728
Crossing out bad adjectives and a damn good one

1592
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,776
Not even not even that

1593
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,056
The antonym

1594
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:31,712
The exact opposite of what it is you know like I'm stupid

1595
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:33,248
Cost it off and change the world

1596
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:35,552
That means that he took his time thinking about it

1597
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,576
I don't like f******

1598
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,392
Whatever it's all just meaningless

1599
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,184
I find

1600
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,000
It's very little interest except for the areas where it's

1601
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:44,768
Psyquel

1602
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,048
This might be relevant

1603
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,840
As things get bad

1604
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,400
And then also

1605
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,168
Bike

1606
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,192
I think

1607
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:52,960
Really interest

1608
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:53,984
The CDs

1609
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,032
Diminishing quality

1610
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:56,800
Instance

1611
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:02,688
Like that Trump is going to get killed at Dallas rally

1612
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,224
Tech problem

1613
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,504
Like I

1614
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:09,856
Increasing inability to do this job well

1615
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,392
Like

1616
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:14,208
Bad propaganda

1617
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,000
If he's still on air

1618
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,280
Couple months from now

1619
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,304
How is that

1620
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,840
Deterioration going to

1621
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:26,496
It's going to keep going

1622
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,056
Naya Impossible 4

1623
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,592
I just think like a cup

1624
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:32,128
4 months from now this could be

1625
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,408
Comically bad

1626
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:39,040
And I look forward to that.

1627
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,064
Does predictable trash

1628
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:47,232
Whatever Trump says repairs

1629
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,424
You can't get rid of them

1630
01:32:55,936 --> 01:33:00,288
I do have this question in my mind that it's impossible to answer

1631
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
Necessarily

1632
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,384
Howard Alex

1633
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,176
Respond to Trump bombing

1634
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:13,600
Getting drunk crying Trump shows Isis

1635
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:16,160
Lakewood that happened

1636
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,464
How is it possible that there's something

1637
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,000
That will reach that point

1638
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,280
I don't know

1639
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,632
Maybe couple months ago I would have said yeah you probably would respond

1640
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:27,168
I don't know now

1641
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,448
I really don't

1642
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:32,544
The idea that he could.

1643
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,872
Fourth on that and so like

1644
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,944
I lead me to believe that there is

1645
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,712
There isn't

1646
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,504
Now I think

1647
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,528
Gone

1648
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,856
Sometimes

1649
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:48,672
To surprise me so I don't know

1650
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:55,072
President episodes in a row

1651
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,608
Apologize

1652
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,632
You do not need to

1653
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:01,984
Different on Wednesday

1654
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:06,336
Vanderbilt website

1655
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:12,736
Built it

1656
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:16,832
Jordans

1657
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,648
Into the show please go to iTunes

1658
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:26,816
For sure send it to your friend if you have a brother

1659
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,192
Goodfellas

1660
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:36,800
That's a family shop but tell them I'm Neo

1661
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:41,664
I have the Ides of October 17th

1662
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:47,552
Alex

1663

Kristen color
